11585,saline sodic and sodic soils are characterized by the occurrence of excessive na that adversely affect soil properties takyric solonetz a saline sodic soil with a poor structure a low permeability saturated hydraulic conductivity 0 1mmd 1 and a considerable caco3 widely distributes in arid regions northwest china a 3 year field experiment was conducted to reclaim this impermeable saline sodic wasteland with an improved drip irrigation where a sand filled niche beneath drip emitter was adopted for ridge cultivation of lycium barbarum l through the extensive sampling in soil transects the salt characteristics and redistributions of soluble cations were evaluated results indicated that the soil properties that hindered takyric solonetz from being reclaimed orderly were soil salinity structure alkalinity and the concentrations of other ions e g k salt leaching through the water regulation had the highest priority in reclaiming takyric solonetz and followed by improving soil structure through changing ions composition and reducing soil sodicity after reclamation soil na concentrations decreased in root zone but increased in top layers of ridge slope and furrow while the increases of k were only found beneath drip line behaving little mobility with water flow considerable increases of divalent cations ca2 and mg2 occurred beneath drip line but no obvious changes occurred in other regions of soil transect it was concluded that irrigation water and dissolution of intrinsic caco3 provided sufficient ca2 to replace the excessive na and the replaced na was leached out of root zone resulting in a decrease of soil sodicity and improvement of soil structure the reclamation measures were expected to have good sustainability which was supported theoretically by the priorities of actions derived from salt characteristics thus this improved drip irrigation provided a potential substitute for the costly amendments to ameliorate impermeable saline sodic soils especially with considerable amount of caco3 keywords drip irrigation soil permeability soil reclamation takyric solonetz 1 introduction reclamation of salt affected soils is a global issue especially for the arid and semiarid regions mahmoodabadi et al 2013 among the categories of salt affected soils the saline sodic and sodic soils are characterized by presence of excessive na in soil solution and in the exchange phase up to the levels which can adversely affect the soil properties qadir et al 2001 tejada et al 2006 it is widely considered more difficult for the saline sodic and sodic soils to be ameliorated than the saline soils oster and shainberg 2001 qadir et al 2001 because various obstacles should be coped with when reclaiming a saline sodic or sodic soil e g high alkalinity poor soil structure low permeability as well as the high salinity among which only the last probably occurred in saline soils takyric solonetz iuss working group wrb 2007 is a saline sodic soil widely spread in arid regions northwest china generally it does not have very high salinity except for the surface layer but is always characterized by the high alkalinity ph 9 5 high sodicity exchangeable sodium percentage esp 60 extremely poor soil structure and compacted soil layers bulk density 1 6gcm 3 with the crusting prone surface all these soil properties result in a low soil hydraulic conductivity of takyric solonetz saturated hydraulic conductivity ks is usually less than 0 1mmd 1 wang et al 1993 chi et al 2012 zhang et al 2013 considerable caco3 generally exists in the form of calcite in the native profile no vegetation was supported in this soil except some blue green algae such as microcoleus growing in patches during the monsoon season comprehensive exploration team 1963 yin 1985 wang et al 1993 therefore the successful reclamation of this highly saline sodic wasteland is of great importance both for environmental improvement and for agricultural productivity in the recent decades many methods have been reported to be effective to reclaim saline sodic soils mace et al 1999 oster et al 1999 qadir et al 2001 clark et al 2007 yazdanpanah et al 2013 however many conventional methods e g deep ploughing application of organic fertilizer phytoremediation were not effective for takyric solonetz primarily due to the extremely low ks yin 1985 wang et al 1993 and application of the chemical amendments gypsum was too costly and provided only marginal economic interest for the local farmer wang et al 2016 since 2009 a field study had been conducted to test the possibility of reclaiming takyric solonetz with drip irrigation but without chemical amendments the vegetation planted was wolfberry lycium barbarum l a renowned medicinal fruit crop in northwest china zhang et al 2013 zhang et al 2017 the results showed that a considerable reclamation of this impermeable saline sodic wasteland could be achieved in three years zhang et al 2013 the drip irrigation used in this study was improved through adoption of the sand filled niches beneath drip emitters which facilitated the soil infiltration and finally made the reclamation possible then the changes of soil water and salt distribution zhang et al 2013 nutrients status zhang et al 2017 and soil enzymes activities zhang et al 2014 were studied an integrated agronomic measure was proposed for reclamation of takyric solonetz mainly including ridge cultivation sand filled niches beneath drip emitters mulched drip irrigation triggered by soil matric potential however some further studies are still needed for the amelioration mechanism and sustainability evaluation of the agronomic measure quantitative study of soil salt characteristics is the basis for salt affected soil management however the specific salt characteristics dominative and restrictive factors of reclamation and priorities of various actions in reclamation process are still unknown for takyric solonetz meanwhile the complexity and large spatial variability of soil salt compositions increased the difficulty of such quantitative study this problem might be partly solved by extensive sampling and appropriate factor analysis additionally a widely used amelioration method for sodicity induced degraded soil is addition of chemical amendment gypsum to promote the replacement of exchangeable na by ca2 and the replaced na is removed either below root zone or out of soil profile with leaching water oster et al 1999 qadir et al 2001 mahmoodabadi et al 2013 however in our study takyric solonetz was reclaimed through exclusive drip irrigation without any chemical amendments containing ca2 in this case some questions may be raised what were the ca2 resources and whether they were sufficient and how about the leaching efficiency of excessive na out of the root zone and even what were the migration and redistribution of soluble cations concurrent with the complex ions exchange adsorption and desorption the answers to these questions would help us to understand the amelioration mechanism and to evaluate the sustainability of agronomic measures in this study it was hypothesized that the theoretical possibility of our reclamation measures could be proved by the salt characteristics and restrictive factors emerged in takyric solonetz and that the solution of native calcite caco3 under cropped conditions can supply sufficient ca2 to reclaim this saline sodic soil the objectives of this study were 1 to analyze salt characteristics and dominative factors of takyric solonetz to prioritize the relevant actions during the reclamation and 2 to evaluate the migrations and redistributions of soluble cations in soil transects in three continuous planting years the results will not only provide an alternative soil amelioration technique for impermeable saline sodic soils but also help complete the methodology of salt affected soil amelioration 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental site the experimental site is located in xidatan area 38 47 38 57 n 106 20 106 30 e 1095m in pingluo county ningxia hui autonomous region northwest china the station has a typical arid continental climate with a mean annual temperature of 9 4 c and a mean annual precipitation of 178mm the mean annual potential evaporation is 2000mm the studied soil is classified as takyric solonetz iuss working group wrb 2007 xidatan where is the low lying area a natural collecting area of piedmont alluvial plain of helan mountain is the typical distribution area of takyric solonetz in china wang et al 1993 without any vegetation local soil environment is extremely infertile the local water table is about 2 5m and the mineral concentration of groundwater is generally 3gl 1 little inter annual variation existed in water table and salinity of ground water indicating that groundwater did not participate in modern soil formation probably due to the impermeability of takyric solonetz wang et al 1993 the typical arid climate and geographical conditions result in the high salinity and sodicity in the surface of takyric solonetz for the 0 30cm soil layer the average electrical conductivity of saturated paste extract ece ph of saturated paste phs and sodium adsorption ratio of saturated paste extract sar were 12 3dsm 1 9 4 and 44 1 mmolc l 1 0 5 respectively table 1 besides the high ph and sar takyric solonetz usually had a high bulk density of around 1 6gcm 3 a low ks of 0 1mmd 1 and a considerable caco3 in subsoil table 1 2 2 agronomic practices in april 2009 this highly saline sodic wasteland was reclaimed for growing wolfberry with ridge cultivation and drip irrigation the ridge had a height of 0 5m a width of 1m and an inter ridge distance of 3m between bed centers fig 1 a drip irrigation tapes emitter space of 0 2m flow rate of 0 76l h 1 at an operating pressure of 0 03mpa were placed in the center of each raised bed after constructing the beds semiellipsoid pits volume of about 4 2l with a ground surface diameter of 0 2m and a depth of 0 2m were dug beneath the emitters where wolfberry seedlings were planted fig 1a and filled with sands the purposes of sand filled niches could be summarized as following zhang et al 2013 1 to expand the soil water contact area and thereby increase the area over which infiltration of applied water occurs which will reduce the water application rates to levels that more closely match the hydraulic conductivity of the native soil 2 to provide a reservoir to hold the applied water before it infiltrates into the soil and 3 to alleviate the negative effects caused by the stirring action of applied water on surface soil seedlings of wolfberry cultivar of ningqi no 1 were transplanted into the center of the beds at an interval of 1m and the ridges were mulched with white polyethylene film fig 1 during the growing seasons drip irrigation was triggered by controlling the soil matric potential higher than 15kpa which was measured at a depth of 0 2m beneath drip emitter zhang et al 2013 the irrigation ratio was 5mm during the growing season and a 10 20mm irrigation was applied at the beginning of each growing season to leach the salts brought to soil surface in winter because of the lack of irrigation and upward water movement caused by the freeze thaw cycle and direct soil evaporation irrigation water with ec of 2 1dsm 1 and sar of 6 0 mmolc l 1 0 5 table 1 was obtained from a reservoir pumped from the yellow river urea phosphoric acid and potassium nitrate were dissolved and applied with the irrigation water in each irrigation event during the growing seasons the fertilization rates were about half of the corresponding level in local farmland table 2 a drainage ditch width of 0 5m and depth of 0 5m was dug around the field to minimize temporary waterlogging and associated soil saturation in the experimental plots similar to local high yield wolfberry fields field management mainly included regular pruning trimming weeding and application of pesticides to control insects 2 3 soil sampling and analysis soil samples were obtained with an auger a diameter of 4 0cm and length of 20cm at selected locations as shown in fig 1b and c at the end of three growing seasons i e 28 october in 2009 18 october in 2010 and 16 october in 2011 which were denoted as reclaimed for 1 2 and 3 years respectively the location of sampling soil transect was as close as possible to the sand filled niche but must avoid sampling the foreign sand in the niches fig 1c a total of 62 soil samples were obtained in each transect fig 1b and three replicate transects were sampled in each year after carefully removing surface organic materials and fine roots gravimetrical soil water content was determined for field moist subsamples the remaining soil subsamples were air dried and passed through a 1 mm sieve then the three replicates of soil samples were mixed for chemical analysis saturated soil paste was prepared for chemical analysis the phs was measured with a ph meter phs 3c shanghai precision scientific instrument co ltd shanghai china then clear extracts of saturated soil pastes were obtained by centrifugation 4000rpm 30min and analyzed for ece and ions concentrations the values of ece were measured with a conductivity meter dds 11a shanghai precision scientific instrument co ltd shanghai china concentrations of co3 2 and hco3 were measured by double indicator titration method cl by silver nitrate titration method so4 2 by edta complexiometric titration method ca2 and mg2 by edta titration method and na and k by flame photometry the detailed methods of ions concentration measurement were done as described by bao 2005 the total soluble salt content tss the sum of the eight ions concentrations and soluble sodium percentage ssp were calculated by mass concentration and sar was calculated by molar concentration using the following formula 1 sar na ca 2 mg 2 2 0 5 where a chemical element symbol indicates a concentration in mmolc l 1 2 4 data analysis the root zone was defined as 20cm horizontal distance from the drip line and 60cm in depth fig 1b average values of soil properties in root zone were calculated as the spatially weighted mean of all samples within this zone the kaiser meyer olkin kmo measure and bartlett s test of sphericity were used to test whether the samples were suitable for factor analysis results showed that the kmo value was 0 635 and the concomitant probability of sphericity test was 0 000 0 05 which indicated that these samples were suitable for factor analysis hao et al 2003 then principal component analysis pca was performed the principle components were selected when the cumulated contribution rate of total variance accounted for 85 then the factors were extracted and rotated by varimas and finally the eigenvalues of the selected eigenvectors and the factor loading were calculated spss 11 5 statistical software spss inc chicago il usa was used to analyze the data and the figures were created using surfer 8 0 golden software inc co usa and sigmaplot 10 0 systat software inc ca usa 3 results 3 1 establishment of soil salt eigenfactor the molar concentration of co3 2 was found very low during the analysis partly due to the non timely assay of some occasional samples so only hco3 concentrations were used in this study for the analysis to represent soil alkalinity co3 2 hco3 hao and chang 2003 the sum of eigenvalues of the first four principle components were 10 461 while the corresponding cumulated contribution rate of variance reached up to 87 18 table 3 this result illuminated that the first four principle components included the most variance of the initial 12factors while the loss information was only 12 82 the factor loading was the correlation coefficient between principle component and original variable factor the factors loadings exhibited a clustering distribution phenomenon obviously in the spaces defined by two components fig 2 for principle component 1 pc1 the four factors with biggest positive loadings were na ece tss and cl i e 0 952 0 942 0 929 and 0 91 respectively followed by sar and so4 2 concentrations this indicated that pc1 could represent the soil salinity of takyric solonetz and substitute six variables na ece tss cl sar and so4 2 among the original total 12 variables divalent cations mg2 and ca2 had the highest positive loadings in pc2 0 902 and 0 869 respectively fig 2a considering the positive effects of divalent cations on soil physical properties it could be concluded that pc2 represented the soil structural status meanwhile among the original factors in pc2 ssp had higher negative loadings which was because the decreases of ssp indicated the increased ratios of mg2 and ca2 in total cations therefore pc2 could substitute three variables mg2 ca2 and ssp among the original 12 variables the pc3 was characterized with higher positive loadings for soil phs and hco3 concentration fig 2b the reduction in soil phs not only indicated the mitigation of soil alkalinity co3 2 hco3 but also helped dissolution of mg and ca compounds in native soil thus pc3 represented the soil alkalinity and could substitute 2 variables phs and hco3 among the original 12 variables the high positive loading of k 0 958 was apparent in pc4 as shown in fig 2c since the ratio of na k mg2 ca2 is an important indicator of soil structure smith et al 2015 not only the cations composition pc4 represented the other cation k concentration in saline sodic soils besides the crucial cations na mg2 and ca2 and was the supplement component to pc1 soil salinity and pc2 soil structure 3 2 soluble cations redistribution after reclamation the correlation analysis between soil ions concentrations could help reveal the synergistc effects of some ions migrations to a certain extent correlation analysis show that as the dominating cation na had the biggest correlation coefficient with cl 0 902 p 0 01 followed by so4 2 0 846 p 0 01 and hco3 0 595 p 0 01 table 4 the correlations between na and other cations mg2 ca2 and k were completely non significant the correlation coefficient of ca2 and mg2 was up to 0 711 which was the biggest among the mutual of four cations k always gave a relative smaller coefficent with others table 4 probably due to the low concentration of k in soil solution excessive na is the most prominent characteristic of takyric solonetz undoubtedly na was the dominant cation among all soluble cations and accounted for over 70 of total cations concentrations in the uncultivated soil the na concentrations in saturated paste extract were even more than 100mmolc l 1 in the top layers of 0 20cm and decreased gradually to 15 4mmolc l 1 at depth of 80 120cm table 1 after reclamation the na concentrations beneath drip line decreased remarkably with the increasing planting years more na moved to the top layers of ridge slope and furrow which indicated the greater mobility of na with water flow these spatial redistributions of na were similar to the changes of soil ece after reclamation zhang et al 2013 indicating again the dominative contribution of na to soil total salt in uncultivated soil soluble k concentration was the smallest among the four cations always less than 1mmolc l 1 in saturated paste extract after reclamation soil k concentrations beneath drip line increased remarkably while no obvious change was observed in other regions the addition of potassium nitrate should be the main reason for the increased k content beneath drip line the bivalent cations ca2 and mg2 exhibited the same distribution in soil transect whether cultivated or not in uncultivated soil the concentrations of ca2 and mg2 showed a homogeneous distribution throughout the soil profile at a level of 2mmolc l 1 however with an exception of top layer 0 10cm where their concentrations were higher 5 5mmolc l 1 and 6 5mmolc l 1 for ca2 and mg2 respectively after cultivation the increases of bivalent cations concentrations only occurred in small regions beneath drip line with the increasing planting years fig 3 after 3 years the ca2 and mg2 concentrations increased moren than 10mmolc l 1 in the depth of 0 40cm beneath drip line but remained still around 2mmolc l 1 in other regions of soil transect no different from the uncultivated soil this result indicated litter mobility of ca2 and mg2 with water flow 4 discussion 4 1 the changing salt characteristics of takyric solonetz during reclamation reclaiming and managing a saline sodic or sodic soil requires an understanding of the adverse impacts of salinity and sodicity on soil properties the studied soil is characterized distingushingly by the excessive na ayers and westcot 1985 have stated that a relatively high na content the ratio of na ca2 3 1 often results in a severe water infiltration problem due to soil clay dispersion and swelling and sealing of the surface pores the ratio of na ca2 in takyric solonetz was up to 50 1 in top layers table 1 researches conducted since 1954 have also documented many instances in which the tencency for swelling aggregate failure and dispersion increases as soil salnity ece decreases even if the esp is less than 3 that is a soil with low salinity can behave like a sodic soil oster and jayawardane 1998 swelling reduces the radii of soil pores while dispersion after breakdown or slaking and subsequent clay movement lead to the blockage of soil pores it can be said that both swelling and dispersion reduce the saturated and unsaturated hydraulic conductivity of the soil oster and jayawardane 1998 this adverse effect of na on soil physical properties would be magnified when irrigated with non saline water quirk and schofield 1955 tedeschi and dell aquila 2005 basile et al 2012 these facts combinatively result in the extremely poor hydraulic properties ks 0 1mmd 1 in the undisturbed soil of takyric solonetz the high coefficient between na and cl table 4 indicated that a synergistic effect existed between na and cl migrations previous studies also showed that chloride was usually the most active in the soil salt movements sulfate the second and carbonate bicarbonate relatively static jiao et al 2008 mg2 had the biggest correlation coefficient with ca2 which endorsed the fact that these two cations have for practical purposes generally been grouped together as similar ions in maintaining soil structure when quantifying sodicity of soils and irrigation waters u s salinity lab staff 1954 salt affected soils in the arid area of northwest china are generally rich in potassium k since the main soil parent material is mica illite which has high k content bao 2005 however it does not mean that there is sufficient k for plant growth because most k exists as the insoluble mineral compounds in soil and the available k soluble and exchangeable k only account for 1 of total k bao 2005 this low k concentration in soil solution table 1 might result in the poor correlation of k with other ions table 4 as for the increased k after reclamation besides the addition of potassium nitrate it should also be noted that with the addition of phosphoric acid and decreased soil phs zhang et al 2013 more h and complex aluminum hydroxide ions e g al oh 2 were generated and less negative charges were available in the soils as a result more k were displaced from the soils through the cation exchange zhang et al 2007 the accumulation of k beneath drip line in soil transects indicated the less mobility of k with water flow which was different from na this finding was consistent with the results of hao and chang 2003 who also observed low k mobility in soil with manure application but inconsistent with that of mahmoodabadi et al 2013 who suggested that na and k had the same much higher mobility than ca2 and mg2 it is widely accepted that divalent cations ca2 and mg2 can replace adsorbed na in soil colloids cause flocculation of colloids and improve soil structure zhang and norton 2002 jalali 2008 this is the fundamental of the successful amelioration of sodic soil whether for the native calcareous soil or the additional calcium sources there were two sources of ca2 in this study irrigation water and dissolution of calcite caco3 present in the native soil the caco3 contents were around 14 in native soil table 1 and its dissolution was even enhanced by the decrease of soil ph and the increase of partial pressures of carbon dioxide caused by the microbial and root respiration under cropped condition and decomposition of organic matter in the soil qadir et al 2002 qadir and oster 2002 the higher concentration of mg2 in irrigation water table 1 should be mainly responsible for the increased mg2 to a great extent and the accumulation of ca2 and mg2 beneath drip line indicated the lower mobility of bivalent cations with water flow which was consistent with the previous findings mahmoodabadi et al 2013 additionally in a soil water system there is an equilibrium between monovalent and divalent cations on the soil s exchange site and solution the equilibrium condition will be altered if water is added to the system this dilution of the soil solution favors the adsorption of divalent caitons like ca2 at cost of monovalent cations such as na chi et al 2012 this is the valence dilution mechanism as reported by reeve and bower 1960 which should also be responsible for the removal of na and decreased soil sodicity 4 2 priorities of actions in ameliorating takyric solonetz because of large spatial variation it is difficult to quantify the spatial distribution of soil salt and ions in soil transects during the amelioration process pca was used in this study to explore the salt characteristics then the dominant restrictive factors soil chemical properties of takyric solonetz were proposed the clustering distribution of soil salt variables in pc factors loadings fig 2 obviously illustrated the restrictive factors that hindered the reclamation of takyric solonetz which orderly were soil salinity structure alkalinity and the concentrations of other ions e g k so during the reclamation of takyric solonetz the first consideration should be to reduce the soil salinity through water regulation and then to improve soil structure through changing ions composition in soil solution and reducing soil alkalinity and sodicity soil ph sar et al this new finding might provide a guide for the amelioration and agricultural utilization of takyric solonetz the adoption of sand filled niches beneath drip emitters in our study was just the actual measure aimed for the first consideration this improved water regulation method of drip irrigation could facilitate soil water infiltration ensure salt leaching and finally make the reclamation possible without any chemical amendment our previous study also stated that once the problem of soil infiltration problem at soil surface caused by bad combination of ec and sar is solved by the improved drip irrigation the salt ions compositions will change and the hydraulic conductivity of soil below the surface will not be a limiting factor zhang et al 2013 additionally after soil salinity reduction addition of phosphoric acid with irrigation water could be helpful in reducing soil sodicity sar since the native soil had considerable amount of caco3 table 1 and also supply the phosphorus nutrition for plant growth at the same time this strategy can be used for saline sodic and sodic soils in the regions with considerable amount of caco3 qadir et al 2001 4 3 different effects of cations in maintaining soil structure a literature review dating back to the 1930s supported a general conclusion that the relative order of deleterious effects of the four common cations on soil hydraulic properties is na k mg2 ca2 smith et al 2015 previous studies also confirmed that ca2 could improve soil structure through cationic bridging with clay particles and soil organic matter david and dimitrios 2002 qadir et al 2003 in addition ca2 could inhibit clay dispersion and associated disruption of aggregates by replacing na and mg2 in clay and aggregates thereby increased aggregate stability chan 1995 zhang and norton 2002 mace and amerhein 2001 observed a successful leaching reclamation of a sodic soil without amendments but it was also stated that the reclamation under such conditions could only take place when soil provided a good drainage along its profile when leaching water was adequate and when a source of ca2 e g caco3 was present keren 1996 as for this study the two sources of ca2 discussed above were available but drainage was not good enough drip irrigation improved soil infiltration considerably after the adoption of sand filled niches beneath drip emitters although soil salt could not be directly leached down to deep layer for drainage by the relatively low irrigation amount the setting of 50 cm height ridges provided room for leached salt to flow to the top layers of ridge slope and furrow which was supported by soil ece redistribution reported in our previous studies zhang et al 2013 zhang et al 2017 mg2 has long been considered to have effects similar to ca2 on soil physical properties leading the u s salinity lab staff 1954 to group these two bivalent cations together as promoting and maintaining good soil structure however it was also reported that the effects of ca2 and mg2 as complementary cations for na on soil stability could be very different zhang and norton 2002 for example some previous studies showed that mg2 could be a deleterious ion when its concentration was higher than ca2 yuan et al 2007 or that adsorbed mg2 had adverse effects on infiltration rate for montmorillonitic non calcareous and calcareous soils keren 1996 the ratio of ca2 mg2 in the soil water system was used to predict a potential ca2 deficiency in soil ayers and westcot 1985 in an mg dominated soil soil water molar ratio of ca2 mg2 less than 1 the potential effect of na may slightly increase smith et al 2015 in this study the molar ratio of ca2 mg2 of studied soil was less than 1 in top layers table 1 and fig 3 this might aggravate the adverse effect of na on soil structure quirk and schofield 1955 and partly helped resulting in the extremely poor hydraulic properties ks 0 1mmd 1 in the case of the fact that soil salinity ece and sodicity sar were not unacceptably high table 1 as for the reasons it was reported that high exchangeable mg2 was sometimes associated with conditions of low soil conductivity and crusting yuan et al 2007 oster and jayawardane 1998 stated that the surface soil was more unstable than the underlying at low soil salinity and exchangeable na and mg2 levels because the mechanical impact and the stirring action of the applied water on the soil surface destroyed soil aggregates and rearranged soil particles into a densely packed thin soil layer seal on the surface the surface impermeable crust seal was exactly the distinctive characteristic of takyric solonetz and the negative mechanical impact of applied water was partly eliminated by the sand filled niches beneath drip emitters and film mulching in this study in order to take into account of the different effects of different cations on soil structure the cation ratio of structural stability cross an improved irrigation water and soil quality parameter was proposed by smith et al 2015 to replace sar the study which was based on optimizing cross with threshold electrolyte concentration data for a sodosol in australia showed that the deleterious effect of k was estimated to be about one third of that of na while the concentration of mg2 needed to be about 13 times larger than ca2 to have the same beneficial effect the optimized cross was calculated as following in the concentration of mmolc l 1 smith et al 2015 2 cross na 0 335k ca 2 0 0758mg 2 2 0 5 according to this method we obtained the changes of cross in root zone during reclaiming takyric solonetz fig 4 the cross for uncultivated soil was around 70 and a large decrease in cross occurred after reclamation for one year down ot about 20 but little in the following two years this trend was similar to the changes of sar but larger than the latter in changing amplitude zia et al 2006 zhang et al 2013 this proposed cross is expected to be used more widely on various soils to provide more alternative and accurate parameters to evaluate the potential deleterious or beneficial effects of cations on soil structure 5 conclusions during the reclamation of takyric solonetz salt leaching through water regulation still had the highest priority followed by improvement of soil structure through changing ions composition in soil solution and reducing soil sodicity sar irrigation water and dissolution of calcite caco3 present in native soil provided sufficient ca2 to replace the excessive na the ridge cultivation made leached salt move to top layers of ridge slope and furrow then more na would be leached out of root zone which resulted in a decrease in soil sodicity and improvement of soil structure in root zone the reduced soil phs and the increasingly growing roots could enhance the beneficial effect of ca2 on soil physical properties the agronomic practices in this study exactly followed the priorities of reclamation actions derived from salt characteristics indicating the sustainability of this reclamation measure was proved theoretically thus this intergrated reclamation measure mainly including ridge cultivation sand filled niches beneath drip emitters mulched drip irrigation triggered by soil matric potential was expected to have a good sustainability in takyric solonetz and could be adopted more widely for ameliorating the impermeable saline sodic soils especially with considerable amount of caco3 however the cations na ca2 et al uptaken by plants were not measured in this study which was a shortcoming of this study because it was reported that the leaf cations content of lycium barbarum l increased under salt stress wei et al 2006 indicating that the plant has the phytoremediation potential for salt affected soils through biological salt removal zhao et al 2004 another shortcoming of this study was the unconsideration of exchangeable cations concentrations due to the possible errors involved in the direct measurement of esp bower and hatcher 1962 although soil esp is often approximated from the traditional generalized sar esp equation u s salinity lab staff 1954 this relationship varies with soil types and clay mineralogy under certain conditions kopittke et al 2006 additionally the mathematical hydrosalinity models e g hydrus 2d 3d need to be developed and used in the future so as to evaluate the long term reclamation

sodic soil e g high alkalinity poor soil structure low permeability as well as the high salinity among which only the last probably occurred in saline soils takyric solonetz iuss working group wrb 2007 is a saline sodic soil widely spread in arid regions northwest china generally it does not have very high salinity except for the surface layer but is always characterized by the high alkalinity ph 9 5 high sodicity exchangeable sodium percentage esp 60 extremely poor soil structure and compacted soil layers bulk density 1 6gcm 3 with the crusting prone surface all these soil properties result in a low soil hydraulic conductivity of takyric solonetz saturated hydraulic conductivity ks is usually less than 0 1mmd 1 wang et al 1993 chi et al 2012 zhang et al 2013 considerable caco3 generally exists in the form of calcite in the native profile no vegetation was supported in this soil except some blue green algae such as microcoleus growing in patches during the monsoon season comprehensive exploration team 1963 yin 1985 wang et al 1993 therefore the successful reclamation of this highly saline sodic wasteland is of great importance both for environmental improvement and for agricultural productivity in the recent decades many methods have been reported to be effective to reclaim saline sodic soils mace et al 1999 oster et al 1999 qadir et al 2001 clark et al 2007 yazdanpanah et al 2013 however many conventional methods e g deep ploughing application of organic fertilizer phytoremediation were not effective for takyric solonetz primarily due to the extremely low ks yin 1985 wang et al 1993 and application of the chemical amendments gypsum was too costly and provided only marginal economic interest for the local farmer wang et al 2016 since 2009 a field study had been conducted to test the possibility of reclaiming takyric solonetz with drip irrigation but without chemical amendments the vegetation planted was wolfberry lycium barbarum l a renowned medicinal fruit crop in northwest china zhang et al 2013 zhang et al 2017 the results showed that a considerable reclamation of this impermeable saline sodic wasteland could be achieved in three years zhang et al 2013 the drip irrigation used in this study was improved through adoption of the sand filled niches beneath drip emitters which facilitated the soil infiltration and finally made the reclamation possible then the changes of soil water and salt distribution zhang et al 2013 nutrients status zhang et al 2017 and soil enzymes activities zhang et al 2014 were studied an integrated agronomic measure was proposed for reclamation of takyric solonetz mainly including ridge cultivation sand filled niches beneath drip emitters mulched drip irrigation triggered by soil matric potential however some further studies are still needed for the amelioration mechanism and sustainability evaluation of the agronomic measure quantitative study of soil salt characteristics is the basis for salt affected soil management however the specific salt characteristics dominative and restrictive factors of reclamation and priorities of various actions in reclamation process are still unknown for takyric solonetz meanwhile the complexity and large spatial variability of soil salt compositions increased the difficulty of such quantitative study this problem might be partly solved by extensive sampling and appropriate factor analysis additionally a widely used amelioration method for sodicity induced degraded soil is addition of chemical amendment gypsum to promote the replacement of exchangeable na by ca2 and the replaced na is removed either below root zone or out of soil profile with leaching water oster et al 1999 qadir et al 2001 mahmoodabadi et al 2013 however in our study takyric solonetz was reclaimed through exclusive drip irrigation without any chemical amendments containing ca2 in this case some questions may be raised what were the ca2 resources and whether they were sufficient and how about the leaching efficiency of excessive na out of the root zone and even what were the migration and redistribution of soluble cations concurrent with the complex ions exchange adsorption and desorption the answers to these questions would help us to understand the amelioration mechanism and to evaluate the sustainability of agronomic measures in this study it was hypothesized that the theoretical possibility of our reclamation measures could be proved by the salt characteristics and restrictive factors emerged in takyric solonetz and that the solution of native calcite caco3 under cropped conditions can supply sufficient ca2 to reclaim this saline sodic soil the objectives of this study were 1 to analyze salt characteristics and dominative factors of takyric solonetz to prioritize the relevant actions during the reclamation and 2 to evaluate the migrations and redistributions of soluble cations in soil transects in three continuous planting years the results will not only provide an alternative soil amelioration technique for impermeable saline sodic soils but also help complete the methodology of salt affected soil amelioration 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental site the experimental site is located in xidatan area 38 47 38 57 n 106 20 106 30 e 1095m in pingluo county ningxia hui autonomous region northwest china the station has a typical arid continental climate with a mean annual temperature of 9 4 c and a mean annual precipitation of 178mm the mean annual potential evaporation is 2000mm the studied soil is classified as takyric solonetz iuss working group wrb 2007 xidatan where is the low lying area a natural collecting area of piedmont alluvial plain of helan mountain is the typical distribution area of takyric solonetz in china wang et al 1993 without any vegetation local soil environment is extremely infertile the local water table is about 2 5m and the mineral concentration of groundwater is generally 3gl 1 little inter annual variation existed in water table and salinity of ground water indicating that groundwater did not participate in modern soil formation probably due to the impermeability of takyric solonetz wang et al 1993 the typical arid climate and geographical conditions result in the high salinity and sodicity in the surface of takyric solonetz for the 0 30cm soil layer the average electrical conductivity of saturated paste extract ece ph of saturated paste phs and sodium adsorption ratio of saturated paste extract sar were 12 3dsm 1 9 4 and 44 1 mmolc l 1 0 5 respectively table 1 besides the high ph and sar takyric solonetz usually had a high bulk density of around 1 6gcm 3 a low ks of 0 1mmd 1 and a considerable caco3 in subsoil table 1 2 2 agronomic practices in april 2009 this highly saline sodic wasteland was reclaimed for growing wolfberry with ridge cultivation and drip irrigation the ridge had a height of 0 5m a width of 1m and an inter ridge distance of 3m between bed centers fig 1 a drip irrigation tapes emitter space of 0 2m flow rate of 0 76l h 1 at an operating pressure of 0 03mpa were placed in the center of each raised bed after constructing the beds semiellipsoid pits volume of about 4 2l with a ground surface diameter of 0 2m and a depth of 0 2m were dug beneath the emitters where wolfberry seedlings were planted fig 1a and filled with sands the purposes of sand filled niches could be summarized as following zhang et al 2013 1 to expand the soil water contact area and thereby increase the area over which infiltration of applied water occurs which will reduce the water application rates to levels that more closely match the hydraulic conductivity of the native soil 2 to provide a reservoir to hold the applied water before it infiltrates into the soil and 3 to alleviate the negative effects caused by the stirring action of applied water on surface soil seedlings of wolfberry cultivar of ningqi no 1 were transplanted into the center of the beds at an interval of 1m and the ridges were mulched with white polyethylene film fig 1 during the growing seasons drip irrigation was triggered by controlling the soil matric potential higher than 15kpa which was measured at a depth of 0 2m beneath drip emitter zhang et al 2013 the irrigation ratio was 5mm during the growing season and a 10 20mm irrigation was applied at the beginning of each growing season to leach the salts brought to soil surface in winter because of the lack of irrigation and upward water movement caused by the freeze thaw cycle and direct soil evaporation irrigation water with ec of 2 1dsm 1 and sar of 6 0 mmolc l 1 0 5 table 1 was obtained from a reservoir pumped from the yellow river urea phosphoric acid and potassium nitrate were dissolved and applied with the irrigation water in each irrigation event during the growing seasons the fertilization rates were about half of the corresponding level in local farmland table 2 a drainage ditch width of 0 5m and depth of 0 5m was dug around the field to minimize temporary waterlogging and associated soil saturation in the experimental plots similar to local high yield wolfberry fields field management mainly included regular pruning trimming weeding and application of pesticides to control insects 2 3 soil sampling and analysis soil samples were obtained with an auger a diameter of 4 0cm and length of 20cm at selected locations as shown in fig 1b and c at the end of three growing seasons i e 28 october in 2009 18 october in 2010 and 16 october in 2011 which were denoted as reclaimed for 1 2 and 3 years respectively the location of sampling soil transect was as close as possible to the sand filled niche but must avoid sampling the foreign sand in the niches fig 1c a total of 62 soil samples were obtained in each transect fig 1b and three replicate transects were sampled in each year after carefully removing surface organic materials and fine roots gravimetrical soil water content was determined for field moist subsamples the remaining soil subsamples were air dried and passed through a 1 mm sieve then the three replicates of soil samples were mixed for chemical analysis saturated soil paste was prepared for chemical analysis the phs was measured with a ph meter phs 3c shanghai precision scientific instrument co ltd shanghai china then clear extracts of saturated soil pastes were obtained by centrifugation 4000rpm 30min and analyzed for ece and ions concentrations the values of ece were measured with a conductivity meter dds 11a shanghai precision scientific instrument co ltd shanghai china concentrations of co3 2 and hco3 were measured by double indicator titration method cl by silver nitrate titration method so4 2 by edta complexiometric titration method ca2 and mg2 by edta titration method and na and k by flame photometry the detailed methods of ions concentration measurement were done as described by bao 2005 the total soluble salt content tss the sum of the eight ions concentrations and soluble sodium percentage ssp were calculated by mass concentration and sar was calculated by molar concentration using the following formula 1 sar na ca 2 mg 2 2 0 5 where a chemical element symbol indicates a concentration in mmolc l 1 2 4 data analysis the root zone was defined as 20cm horizontal distance from the drip line and 60cm in depth fig 1b average values of soil properties in root zone were calculated as the spatially weighted mean of all samples within this zone the kaiser meyer olkin kmo measure and bartlett s test of sphericity were used to test whether the samples were suitable for factor analysis results showed that the kmo value was 0 635 and the concomitant probability of sphericity test was 0 000 0 05 which indicated that these samples were suitable for factor analysis hao et al 2003 then principal component analysis pca was performed the principle components were selected when the cumulated contribution rate of total variance accounted for 85 then the factors were extracted and rotated by varimas and finally the eigenvalues of the selected eigenvectors and the factor loading were calculated spss 11 5 statistical software spss inc chicago il usa was used to analyze the data and the figures were created using surfer 8 0 golden software inc co usa and sigmaplot 10 0 systat software inc ca usa 3 results 3 1 establishment of soil salt eigenfactor the molar concentration of co3 2 was found very low during the analysis partly due to the non timely assay of some occasional samples so only hco3 concentrations were used in this study for the analysis to represent soil alkalinity co3 2 hco3 hao and chang 2003 the sum of eigenvalues of the first four principle components were 10 461 while the corresponding cumulated contribution rate of variance reached up to 87 18 table 3 this result illuminated that the first four principle components included the most variance of the initial 12factors while the loss information was only 12 82 the factor loading was the correlation coefficient between principle component and original variable factor the factors loadings exhibited a clustering distribution phenomenon obviously in the spaces defined by two components fig 2 for principle component 1 pc1 the four factors with biggest positive loadings were na ece tss and cl i e 0 952 0 942 0 929 and 0 91 respectively followed by sar and so4 2 concentrations this indicated that pc1 could represent the soil salinity of takyric solonetz and substitute six variables na ece tss cl sar and so4 2 among the original total 12 variables divalent cations mg2 and ca2 had the highest positive loadings in pc2 0 902 and 0 869 respectively fig 2a considering the positive effects of divalent cations on soil physical properties it could be concluded that pc2 represented the soil structural status meanwhile among the original factors in pc2 ssp had higher negative loadings which was because the decreases of ssp indicated the increased ratios of mg2 and ca2 in total cations therefore pc2 could substitute three variables mg2 ca2 and ssp among the original 12 variables the pc3 was characterized with higher positive loadings for soil phs and hco3 concentration fig 2b the reduction in soil phs not only indicated the mitigation of soil alkalinity co3 2 hco3 but also helped dissolution of mg and ca compounds in native soil thus pc3 represented the soil alkalinity and could substitute 2 variables phs and hco3 among the original 12 variables the high positive loading of k 0 958 was apparent in pc4 as shown in fig 2c since the ratio of na k mg2 ca2 is an important indicator of soil structure smith et al 2015 not only the cations composition pc4 represented the other cation k concentration in saline sodic soils besides the crucial cations na mg2 and ca2 and was the supplement component to pc1 soil salinity and pc2 soil structure 3 2 soluble cations redistribution after reclamation the correlation analysis between soil ions concentrations could help reveal the synergistc effects of some ions migrations to a certain extent correlation analysis show that as the dominating cation na had the biggest correlation coefficient with cl 0 902 p 0 01 followed by so4 2 0 846 p 0 01 and hco3 0 595 p 0 01 table 4 the correlations between na and other cations mg2 ca2 and k were completely non significant the correlation coefficient of ca2 and mg2 was up to 0 711 which was the biggest among the mutual of four cations k always gave a relative smaller coefficent with others table 4 probably due to the low concentration of k in soil solution excessive na is the most prominent characteristic of takyric solonetz undoubtedly na was the dominant cation among all soluble cations and accounted for over 70 of total cations concentrations in the uncultivated soil the na concentrations in saturated paste extract were even more than 100mmolc l 1 in the top layers of 0 20cm and decreased gradually to 15 4mmolc l 1 at depth of 80 120cm table 1 after reclamation the na concentrations beneath drip line decreased remarkably with the increasing planting years more na moved to the top layers of ridge slope and furrow which indicated the greater mobility of na with water flow these spatial redistributions of na were similar to the changes of soil ece after reclamation zhang et al 2013 indicating again the dominative contribution of na to soil total salt in uncultivated soil soluble k concentration was the smallest among the four cations always less than 1mmolc l 1 in saturated paste extract after reclamation soil k concentrations beneath drip line increased remarkably while no obvious change was observed in other regions the addition of potassium nitrate should be the main reason for the increased k content beneath drip line the bivalent cations ca2 and mg2 exhibited the same distribution in soil transect whether cultivated or not in uncultivated soil the concentrations of ca2 and mg2 showed a homogeneous distribution throughout the soil profile at a level of 2mmolc l 1 however with an exception of top layer 0 10cm where their concentrations were higher 5 5mmolc l 1 and 6 5mmolc l 1 for ca2 and mg2 respectively after cultivation the increases of bivalent cations concentrations only occurred in small regions beneath drip line with the increasing planting years fig 3 after 3 years the ca2 and mg2 concentrations increased moren than 10mmolc l 1 in the depth of 0 40cm beneath drip line but remained still around 2mmolc l 1 in other regions of soil transect no different from the uncultivated soil this result indicated litter mobility of ca2 and mg2 with water flow 4 discussion 4 1 the changing salt characteristics of takyric solonetz during reclamation reclaiming and managing a saline sodic or sodic soil requires an understanding of the adverse impacts of salinity and sodicity on soil properties the studied soil is characterized distingushingly by the excessive na ayers and westcot 1985 have stated that a relatively high na content the ratio of na ca2 3 1 often results in a severe water infiltration problem due to soil clay dispersion and swelling and sealing of the surface pores the ratio of na ca2 in takyric solonetz was up to 50 1 in top layers table 1 researches conducted since 1954 have also documented many instances in which the tencency for swelling aggregate failure and dispersion increases as soil salnity ece decreases even if the esp is less than 3 that is a soil with low salinity can behave like a sodic soil oster and jayawardane 1998 swelling reduces the radii of soil pores while dispersion after breakdown or slaking and subsequent clay movement lead to the blockage of soil pores it can be said that both swelling and dispersion reduce the saturated and unsaturated hydraulic conductivity of the soil oster and jayawardane 1998 this adverse effect of na on soil physical properties would be magnified when irrigated with non saline water quirk and schofield 1955 tedeschi and dell aquila 2005 basile et al 2012 these facts combinatively result in the extremely poor hydraulic properties ks 0 1mmd 1 in the undisturbed soil of takyric solonetz the high coefficient between na and cl table 4 indicated that a synergistic effect existed between na and cl migrations previous studies also showed that chloride was usually the most active in the soil salt movements sulfate the second and carbonate bicarbonate relatively static jiao et al 2008 mg2 had the biggest correlation coefficient with ca2 which endorsed the fact that these two cations have for practical purposes generally been grouped together as similar ions in maintaining soil structure when quantifying sodicity of soils and irrigation waters u s salinity lab staff 1954 salt affected soils in the arid area of northwest china are generally rich in potassium k since the main soil parent material is mica illite which has high k content bao 2005 however it does not mean that there is sufficient k for plant growth because most k exists as the insoluble mineral compounds in soil and the available k soluble and exchangeable k only account for 1 of total k bao 2005 this low k concentration in soil solution table 1 might result in the poor correlation of k with other ions table 4 as for the increased k after reclamation besides the addition of potassium nitrate it should also be noted that with the addition of phosphoric acid and decreased soil phs zhang et al 2013 more h and complex aluminum hydroxide ions e g al oh 2 were generated and less negative charges were available in the soils as a result more k were displaced from the soils through the cation exchange zhang et al 2007 the accumulation of k beneath drip line in soil transects indicated the less mobility of k with water flow which was different from na this finding was consistent with the results of hao and chang 2003 who also observed low k mobility in soil with manure application but inconsistent with that of mahmoodabadi et al 2013 who suggested that na and k had the same much higher mobility than ca2 and mg2 it is widely accepted that divalent cations ca2 and mg2 can replace adsorbed na in soil colloids cause flocculation of colloids and improve soil structure zhang and norton 2002 jalali 2008 this is the fundamental of the successful amelioration of sodic soil whether for the native calcareous soil or the additional calcium sources there were two sources of ca2 in this study irrigation water and dissolution of calcite caco3 present in the native soil the caco3 contents were around 14 in native soil table 1 and its dissolution was even enhanced by the decrease of soil ph and the increase of partial pressures of carbon dioxide caused by the microbial and root respiration under cropped condition and decomposition of organic matter in the soil qadir et al 2002 qadir and oster 2002 the higher concentration of mg2 in irrigation water table 1 should be mainly responsible for the increased mg2 to a great extent and the accumulation of ca2 and mg2 beneath drip line indicated the lower mobility of bivalent cations with water flow which was consistent with the previous findings mahmoodabadi et al 2013 additionally in a soil water system there is an equilibrium between monovalent and divalent cations on the soil s exchange site and solution the equilibrium condition will be altered if water is added to the system this dilution of the soil solution favors the adsorption of divalent caitons like ca2 at cost of monovalent cations such as na chi et al 2012 this is the valence dilution mechanism as reported by reeve and bower 1960 which should also be responsible for the removal of na and decreased soil sodicity 4 2 priorities of actions in ameliorating takyric solonetz because of large spatial variation it is difficult to quantify the spatial distribution of soil salt and ions in soil transects during the amelioration process pca was used in this study to explore the salt characteristics then the dominant restrictive factors soil chemical properties of takyric solonetz were proposed the clustering distribution of soil salt variables in pc factors loadings fig 2 obviously illustrated the restrictive factors that hindered the reclamation of takyric solonetz which orderly were soil salinity structure alkalinity and the concentrations of other ions e g k so during the reclamation of takyric solonetz the first consideration should be to reduce the soil salinity through water regulation and then to improve soil structure through changing ions composition in soil solution and reducing soil alkalinity and sodicity soil ph sar et al this new finding might provide a guide for the amelioration and agricultural utilization of takyric solonetz the adoption of sand filled niches beneath drip emitters in our study was just the actual measure aimed for the first consideration this improved water regulation method of drip irrigation could facilitate soil water infiltration ensure salt leaching and finally make the reclamation possible without any chemical amendment our previous study also stated that once the problem of soil infiltration problem at soil surface caused by bad combination of ec and sar is solved by the improved drip irrigation the salt ions compositions will change and the hydraulic conductivity of soil below the surface will not be a limiting factor zhang et al 2013 additionally after soil salinity reduction addition of phosphoric acid with irrigation water could be helpful in reducing soil sodicity sar since the native soil had considerable amount of caco3 table 1 and also supply the phosphorus nutrition for plant growth at the same time this strategy can be used for saline sodic and sodic soils in the regions with considerable amount of caco3 qadir et al 2001 4 3 different effects of cations in maintaining soil structure a literature review dating back to the 1930s supported a general conclusion that the relative order of deleterious effects of the four common cations on soil hydraulic properties is na k mg2 ca2 smith et al 2015 previous studies also confirmed that ca2 could improve soil structure through cationic bridging with clay particles and soil organic matter david and dimitrios 2002 qadir et al 2003 in addition ca2 could inhibit clay dispersion and associated disruption of aggregates by replacing na and mg2 in clay and aggregates thereby increased aggregate stability chan 1995 zhang and norton 2002 mace and amerhein 2001 observed a successful leaching reclamation of a sodic soil without amendments but it was also stated that the reclamation under such conditions could only take place when soil provided a good drainage along its profile when leaching water was adequate and when a source of ca2 e g caco3 was present keren 1996 as for this study the two sources of ca2 discussed above were available but drainage was not good enough drip irrigation improved soil infiltration considerably after the adoption of sand filled niches beneath drip emitters although soil salt could not be directly leached down to deep layer for drainage by the relatively low irrigation amount the setting of 50 cm height ridges provided room for leached salt to flow to the top layers of ridge slope and furrow which was supported by soil ece redistribution reported in our previous studies zhang et al 2013 zhang et al 2017 mg2 has long been considered to have effects similar to ca2 on soil physical properties leading the u s salinity lab staff 1954 to group these two bivalent cations together as promoting and maintaining good soil structure however it was also reported that the effects of ca2 and mg2 as complementary cations for na on soil stability could be very different zhang and norton 2002 for example some previous studies showed that mg2 could be a deleterious ion when its concentration was higher than ca2 yuan et al 2007 or that adsorbed mg2 had adverse effects on infiltration rate for montmorillonitic non calcareous and calcareous soils keren 1996 the ratio of ca2 mg2 in the soil water system was used to predict a potential ca2 deficiency in soil ayers and westcot 1985 in an mg dominated soil soil water molar ratio of ca2 mg2 less than 1 the potential effect of na may slightly increase smith et al 2015 in this study the molar ratio of ca2 mg2 of studied soil was less than 1 in top layers table 1 and fig 3 this might aggravate the adverse effect of na on soil structure quirk and schofield 1955 and partly helped resulting in the extremely poor hydraulic properties ks 0 1mmd 1 in the case of the fact that soil salinity ece and sodicity sar were not unacceptably high table 1 as for the reasons it was reported that high exchangeable mg2 was sometimes associated with conditions of low soil conductivity and crusting yuan et al 2007 oster and jayawardane 1998 stated that the surface soil was more unstable than the underlying at low soil salinity and exchangeable na and mg2 levels because the mechanical impact and the stirring action of the applied water on the soil surface destroyed soil aggregates and rearranged soil particles into a densely packed thin soil layer seal on the surface the surface impermeable crust seal was exactly the distinctive characteristic of takyric solonetz and the negative mechanical impact of applied water was partly eliminated by the sand filled niches beneath drip emitters and film mulching in this study in order to take into account of the different effects of different cations on soil structure the cation ratio of structural stability cross an improved irrigation water and soil quality parameter was proposed by smith et al 2015 to replace sar the study which was based on optimizing cross with threshold electrolyte concentration data for a sodosol in australia showed that the deleterious effect of k was estimated to be about one third of that of na while the concentration of mg2 needed to be about 13 times larger than ca2 to have the same beneficial effect the optimized cross was calculated as following in the concentration of mmolc l 1 smith et al 2015 2 cross na 0 335k ca 2 0 0758mg 2 2 0 5 according to this method we obtained the changes of cross in root zone during reclaiming takyric solonetz fig 4 the cross for uncultivated soil was around 70 and a large decrease in cross occurred after reclamation for one year down ot about 20 but little in the following two years this trend was similar to the changes of sar but larger than the latter in changing amplitude zia et al 2006 zhang et al 2013 this proposed cross is expected to be used more widely on various soils to provide more alternative and accurate parameters to evaluate the potential deleterious or beneficial effects of cations on soil structure 5 conclusions during the reclamation of takyric solonetz salt leaching through water regulation still had the highest priority followed by improvement of soil structure through changing ions composition in soil solution and reducing soil sodicity sar irrigation water and dissolution of calcite caco3 present in native soil provided sufficient ca2 to replace the excessive na the ridge cultivation made leached salt move to top layers of ridge slope and furrow then more na would be leached out of root zone which resulted in a decrease in soil sodicity and improvement of soil structure in root zone the reduced soil phs and the increasingly growing roots could enhance the beneficial effect of ca2 on soil physical properties the agronomic practices in this study exactly followed the priorities of reclamation actions derived from salt characteristics indicating the sustainability of this reclamation measure was proved theoretically thus this intergrated reclamation measure mainly including ridge cultivation sand filled niches beneath drip emitters mulched drip irrigation triggered by soil matric potential was expected to have a good sustainability in takyric solonetz and could be adopted more widely for ameliorating the impermeable saline sodic soils especially with considerable amount of caco3 however the cations na ca2 et al uptaken by plants were not measured in this study which was a shortcoming of this study because it was reported that the leaf cations content of lycium barbarum l increased under salt stress wei et al 2006 indicating that the plant has the phytoremediation potential for salt affected soils through biological salt removal zhao et al 2004 another shortcoming of this study was the unconsideration of exchangeable cations concentrations due to the possible errors involved in the direct measurement of esp bower and hatcher 1962 although soil esp is often approximated from the traditional generalized sar esp equation u s salinity lab staff 1954 this relationship varies with soil types and clay mineralogy under certain conditions kopittke et al 2006 additionally the mathematical hydrosalinity models e g hydrus 2d 3d need to be developed and used in the future so as to evaluate the long term reclamation

growing cleland et al 2007 and thus a decreased crop cwr the net response of crop production to the combined effects of co2 enrichment and warming has been evaluated in previous studies kim et al 1996 ruiz vera et al 2013 usui et al 2016 the majority of which suggested that the positive effect of co2 enrichment was often traded off by the negative effects of warming on crop production hasegawa et al 2017 wang et al 2016a therefore it is worthy to address the combined effects of co2 enrichment and warming on cwr and wue under field conditions modelling approaches had been employed in evaluating inter annual variability of water consumption by crop in response to climate change conditions cammarano et al 2016 o leary et al 2015 zhuo et al 2014 crop wue was modeled to increase in a range of 7 to 120 between years under co2 enrichment in field and greenhouse studies hunsaker et al 2000 niu et al 2011 shimono et al 2013 tausz posch et al 2013 wu et al 2004 in a modelling study by cammarano et al 2016 elevated temperature increased annual variability of cwr regardless of co2 enrichment effects however large uncertainties existed among the modelling predictions of cwr or wue for the lack of field observations cammarano et al 2016 li et al 2015 therefore to what extent the different climate change scenarios would impact the inter annual variability of cwr and wue is still unclear so far over 50 mathematical estimations had been used for predicting evapotranspiration et and cwr with varying complexity using different variables lu et al 2005 islam et al 2012 as recommended as a standard method of water requirement calculation by the international commission on irrigation and drainage icid and food and agricultural organization of the united nations fao the use of the penman monteith model directly incorporates the relevant meteorological variables and biophysical parameters allen et al 1998 later on penman monteith model had been concerned as the most reliable model worldwide kingston et al 2009 lu et al 2005 changes in atmospheric co2 concentration and temperature could modify the relevant physiological traits e g leaf area stomatal conductance and also meteorological variables e g temperature rainfall relative air humidity of cropland which are important for et kingston et al 2009 argued that panman monteith was most reliable method among the six methods including penman monteith hamon hargreaves priestley taylor blaney criddle and jensen haise models when assessing potential et this model was constructed on a robust physical basis with all relevant meteorological variables and allowed to address non meteorological uncertainties such as specification of canopy conductance the penman menteith model had been also preferable for future climate change impact studies for the model addresses changes rather in atmospheric variables than in edaphic conditions islam et al 2012 kingston et al 2009 by modifying the canopy resistance term penman monteith model could effectively evaluate the impacts of global warming and co2 enrichment on et islam et al 2012 priya et al 2014 wu et al 2012 therefore penman monteith model could directly be used to simulate et and evaluate cwr moreover the penman monteith equation had been widely used to estimate crop evapotranspiration and water demand in simulated climate change experiments cammarano et al 2016 ewert et al 2002 goyal 2004 lovelli et al 2010 savabi and stockle 2001 steduto et al 2009 china is one of the major crop production countries in the world frolking et al 2002 of which the food safety is vulnerable global change and the associated extreme weather events lesk et al 2016 pan 2010 ray et al 2015 rice and wheat production from asia could be greatly impacted by climate change conditions possibly enhanced under co2 enrichment but negatively impacted by global warming hasegawa et al 2017 wang et al 2016a at particular drought and water scarcity had become key constraints for crop production of china piao et al 2010 to understand the effects of climate change on cwr and wue is a prerequisite for developing such climate smart agriculture of china so far it remains unclear whether the effect of warming outweighed the effect of co2 enrichment in terms of cwr and wue this limits our ability to predict the potential impact of climate change on wheat productivity we hypothesize that wheat cwr or wue could vary with different sets of climate change conditions and exert inter annual variability between years of the climate change simulation based on micro meteorological data collected over three consecutive years from an open air field experiment in southeast china this study is to estimate the combined effects of co2 enrichment and warming on the status and stability of cwr and wue using an improved penman monteith equation we aimed to provide critical information for water management improvement for wheat production facing climate change

concurrent co2 enrichment and canopy air warming cw co2 enrichment and crop canopy air warming were sustained throughout the whole crop growing period the treatments were conducted in separated octagonal rings each having an area of 50m2 in the field each treatment was replicated in three rings with the same infrastructure and the rings arranged in a split row design all the rings were buffered by the adjacent open fields about 28m apart to avoid any cross over effects from the treatments for the atmospheric co2 enrichment treatments ce and cw pure co2 gas purity 99 99 were supplied using a liquid co2 tank that released co2 gas into the octagonal plot ring hereafter through perforated stainless steel pipes surrounding a ring the rate of co2 gas release was manipulated automatically in accordance with the existing air co2 concentration wind direction and speed a total of 17 co2 gas monitoring points were evenly equipped over an octagonal ring which was adjusted as

and incorporated into the soil by ploughing to the depth of plow layer and the topdressing was surface broadcast other farm managements including weed control fertilization and insecticide application were performed following the local conventional practices the wheat crops were cultivated under rain fed conditions in this study 2 4 sampling and measurement of wheat biomass and grain aboveground biomass ab t ha 1 and grain yield gy t ha 1 were determined to evaluate the impact of co2 enrichment and canopy warming on crop growth and production at the ripening stage all of the fresh aboveground biomass in each ring was collected and weighed individually in the field to determine the dry weight for the aboveground biomass three plant samples in a ring were randomly sampled and air dried at 105 c for 30min and subsequently at 70 c to constant weight meanwhile all the grains from the collected biomass in a ring were threshed using a portable thresher grain moisture content was measured by drying a portion of grain using similar method for dry biomass to allow estimation of grain production on dry weight base 2 5 meteorological monitoring and data archive daily weather conditions were

single treatment plot in the above equation a co2 factor is used to adjust the changes with elevated co2 concentration islam et al 2012 priya et al 2014 wu et al 2012 based on eighty data sets comparing stomatal conductance under atmospheric co2 concentration from 330μmolmol 1 to 660μmolmol 1 for a wide range of species including wheat stockle et al 1992 developed the linear relationship for leaf stomatal conductance as a function of co2 concentration morison and gifford 1983 used a 40 linear decrease in stomatal conductance as co2 concentration varied from 330μmolmol 1 to 660μmolmol

variability analysis given that the cultivars and farm management were consistent over the three year experiment the coefficient of variation c v could be used to evaluate the yearly variability in cwr and wue in response to climate change therefore the c v was calculated in this study as follows 13 c v i j c i j k m c i j 2 3 m c i j 100 where cvi j represents the c v of a ring i under a treatment j ci j k is the cwr or wue of a ring i under a treatment j in kth year and mci j is the mean cwr or wue of a ring i under a treatment j 2 7 statistical analysis all data were expressed as means plus standard deviation of three replicates one way anova followed by duncan s test was used to justify the differences between different treatments a general linear mixed model glm was used to test the major effects of co2 enrichment canopy warming and or growth year and their interactions on wheat production cwr wue and their variability all statistical analyses were carried out using ibm spss ver 20 0 a probability level of p 0 05 was considered as statistically significant 3 results 3 1 wheat productivity under simulated climate change as shown in table 2 the ab production of wheat on average was moderately increased by 10 7 under co2 enrichment moderately decreased by 17 0 under warming treatment the gy production followed a similar trend with a smaller extent of change compared to ab production 3 2 cwr and wue under simulated climate change the pattern of estimated daily cwr across the three wheat growing seasons is presented in fig 2 clearly daily cwr was remarkably variable with wheat growth stages being higher in the middle to latter growth stages than at the early growth stage over the three years moreover the dynamics of daily cwr with the growing stages was significantly affected by climatic change treatments the rate of cwr under ce was significantly decreased in contrast the rate of cwr was significantly increased under warming treatments wa and cw though the extent of such change varied among growth stages overall treatment of elevated temperature significantly increased the daily cwr at middle growth stage in 2014 2015 but over the entire growing season in 2012 2013 and 2013 2014 as illustrated in table 3 the cwr averaged over the three years was decreased by 8 3 under co2 enrichment p 0 013 but remarkably increased under canopy warming by a mean of 19 6 p 0 001 however the results from cw showed that cwr were increased by 3 1 15 8 over the three consecutive years when averaged for the three years the wueg and wueb were increased respectively under co2 enrichment by a mean of 23 1 and of 20 6 p 0 001 in contrast the wueg and wueb under canopy warming were both significantly p 0 001 decreased by over 25 0 p 0 001 during the three years 3 3 inter annual variability of cwr and wue under simulated climate change the values of cwr and wue are different among the three consecutive years p 0 05 with the highest cwr observed in the hot season of 2013 2014 and with the highest wueg and wueb found in the dry season of 2014 2015 table 3 unlike the biomass production table 2 decreases over ambient in wueg and wueb were by a range of 3 5 26 7 under cw throughout the three consecutive years however the wueg was significantly increased by co2 enrichment under canopy warming condition in 2014 2015 indicating a significant interaction of co2 warming year on wueg p 0 001 in addition an increase over ambient in wueg and wueb was observed respectively in a range of 2 7 43 2 and 13 1 34 0 under ce throughout the three years as exhibited in fig 3 the c v values with years of cwr wueb and wueg varied in a wide range of 4 8 53 8 exhibiting a great but different inter annual variability under different treatments generally the c v of cwr largely consistent among the simulated climate change treatments compared to ambient condition the c v values both of wueb and wueg were much higher under cw but much lower under ce while the c v values of wueg unchanged under wa 4 discussion 4 1 effect of co2 enrichment and canopy air warming on wheat cwr and wue over the three consecutive years the daily cwr was lower in early growth stage and higher in late growth stage due to the increased daily mean temperature in a study by liu et al 2016 using lysimetric experiment of winter wheat in a similar region of china daily cwr was low prior to the reviving stage but high after the jointing stage in this study winter wheat cwr was averaged of 256 5mm over the three years this could be comparable to the finding of 290mm by liu et al 2007 for the same crop from shanghai china decreases in cwr and increases in wue had been reported for rice and wheat under co2 enrichment in many field experiments houshmandfar et al 2016 shimono et al 2013 tausz posch et al 2013 yoshimoto et al 2005 firstly co2 fertilization effect could result in increases in photosynthetic rate and carbohydrate accumulation ainsworth and long 2005 hasegawa et al 2013 o leary et al 2015 accordingly we observed ab and gy of wheat being increased moderately both over 10 on average under co2 enrichment regardless of temperature table 2 secondly plant leaves received enough co2 for photosynthesis and greater depolarization of guard cells leading to a decline in stomatal aperture and in leaf transpiration rate and thus to a reduced cwr under co2 enrichment ainsworth and rogers 2007 shimono et al 2013 yu et al 2007 the present study revealed a significant positive effect of co2 enrichment on wueg and wueb which was increased respectively by 23 1 and 20 6 on average over the three years under co2 enrichment regardless of temperature table 3 this was comparable to finding by qiao et al 2010 in a greenhouse experiment where co2 concentration was up to 712μmolmol 1 of course our finding here was much lower than a 57 increase in wheat wue under atmospheric co2 concentrations up to 550μmolmol 1 in a face field study from australian tausz posch et al 2013 moreover co2 enrichment alone here increased wueg and wueb by over 30 and by over 20 respectively in normal precipitation season of 2012 2013 and 2013 2014 table 3 o leary et al 2015 observed an increase in wue of biomass and yield respectively by 31 and by 36 in wheat under co2 enrichment from australia whereas our results showed co2 enrichment slightly decreased cwr which was in contrast to the finding by o leary et al 2015 who reported that cwr was unchanged by co2 enrichment for late time of sowing wheat only under rain fed in a face experiment this inconsistency could be explained by the different co2 concentrations treatment methods and environmental conditions between studies meanwhile it is worth noting that the high variability of cwr and wue was observed for the decrements of cwr varied from 3 1 to 15 8 and increments of wue varied from 2 7 to 43 2 under co2 enrichment alone throughout the monitoring years in this study table 3 previous studies also showed the increments of wue varied from 7 to 120 under co2 enrichment conditions hunsaker et al 2000 niu et al 2011 tausz posch et al 2013 wu et al 2004 altogether these studies highlighted the uncertainty over the effects of co2 enrichment on agricultural cwr and wue cammarano et al 2016 huang et al 2016 ray et al 2015 wang et al 2016a in contrast to the positive effects of co2 enrichment negative effect of canopy air warming on wue were observed throughout the monitoring years table 3 warming caused declines in photosynthesis promoted vapor pressure deficit leaf transpiration surface evaporation and evapotranspiration decreasing wheat grain yield and wue goyal 2004 ruiz vera et al 2013 wang et al 2016a zelikova et al 2015 in present study the cwr was increased by about 20 under canopy warming regardless of co2 enrichment table 3 this result was consistent with an increase of 15 for evapotranspiration under warming from arid regions of rajasthan india goyal 2004 here a reduction by over 25 of wheat wueg and wueb was observed under wa treatment over the three years guo et al 2010 reported a lower decrease by 4 8 8 1 in wheat wue in a modeling study of wheat production with climate change condition in north china also relatively lower decreases in wue were noted in grassland and spring wheat under warming niu et al 2011 wall et al 2011 overall cwr could be increased under warming with an extent varying with growth stages weather plant and region specific conditions our results here demonstrated that both wueb and wueg were decreased moderately under concurrent co2 enrichment and warming over the three years table 3 unlike under co2 enrichment only canopy warming imposed the effect of co2 enrichment on wheat cwr because wheat cwr was slightly increased by 3 1 15 8 when crop was treated concurrently with co2 enrichment and warming over the three years table 3 this suggests that a positive effect of co2 enrichment could be partially offset by the negative impact of warming on wueg and wueb guo et al 2010 highlighted a potential increase in evapotranspiration and in turn a decrease in wue with concurrent co2 enrichment and warming in a simulation study of wheat and maize rotation system form north china evenmore cammarano et al 2016 reported that co2 enrichment 720μmolmol 1 did not offset crop wue reduction caused by elevated temperature in wheat these results indicated a stronger effect of canopy air warming on wue of wheat than co2 enrichment under field conditions therefore given the stronger responses detailed above the overall negative effect of concurrent co2 enrichment and warming on winter wheat wue should be considered in predicting the impacts of climatic change 4 2 inter annual variability as influenced by climate change conditions in this study with interaction of climate change conditions inter annual variability of cwr and wue were both higher under co2 enrichment and warming conditions seemingly the inter annual climate variations could alter the responses of wue to co2 enrichment and warming wisser et al 2008 pointed out the variability and uncertainties of agricultural water requirement and global irrigation arising from inter annual variability of weather and climate in addition canopy air warming decreased wueb and wueg with the extent varying from 21 9 to 37 5 during the three years in this study table 3 this is comparable to the finding by craufurd et al 1999 who reported that the decrement of wue under elevated temperature varied from 14 3 to 29 4 among years these results evidenced a large uncertainty concerning the effect of climatic and atmospheric change on cwr and wue to examine the causes of the inter annual variability of cwr and wue we analyzed the cumulative precipitation across wheat growing seasons table 1 plant water requirement could be affected by rainfall allen et al 1998 huang et al 2016 in this study cwr was affected by meteorological condition being hottest in the season of 2013 2014 over the three years tables 1 and 3 however the wueg and wueb were highest in the dry season of 2014 2015 over the monitoring years this change in wue could be ascribed to a decline in transpiration in lower temperature year and benefit winter wheat during dry season of 2014 2015 piao et al 2010 addressed the distribution of water resources as spatially and seasonally heterogeneous inter annual variation of precipitation could be one of the major factors for the variability of cwr and wue under co2 enrichment and warming yet canopy air warming significantly increased the inter annual variability of wueb regardless of co2 enrichment fig 3 warming increased uncertainties of cwr and wue of wheat under ambient and co2 enrichment conditions cammarano et al 2016 zhuo et al 2014 the results here demonstrated that the cwr change was sensitive to daily mean temperature rather under warming condition than under co2 enrichment condition figs 1 and 2 as simulated and predicted in previous studies elevated temperature could increase the uncertainty of water utilization in wheat cammarano et al 2016 canopy warming by 2 c resulted in higher inter annual variability in the treatments of wa and cw in this study additionally much higher inter annual variability of wueg and wueb was observed under concurrent co2 enrichment and warming condition than under co2 enrichment alone implying that warming significantly increased c v of wueg under co2 enrichment condition fig 3 thus an important interaction effect between co2 enrichment and canopy air warming was observed in water utilization variability therefore the future climate change research should simultaneously consider atmospheric co2 concentration and temperature these findings suggest that increasing wue under severe climate change is a great challenge faced by agriculture out of our expectation co2 enrichment alone tended to reduce the inter annual variability of cwr and wue fig 3 which is important information for adaptation to climate change over the three years of study of cwr and wue we found a reduction of cwr and c v of wue under co2 enrichment however winter wheat water consumption and uncertainty of cwr and wue may increase in future climate change concurrent co2 enrichment and warming as per the above discussion which will limit food production and supply to adapt and mitigate the climate change effects on crop production in developing countries technology to enhance wue needs to develop in future study one could breed wheat races to adapt to global warming and profit from co2 enrichment under climate change challenges ortiz et al 2008 it is an important task for breeding to develop a new wheat cultivar taking advantage of the positive aspects of co2 enrichment with restraining the negative effects of global warming on crop production and wue 5 conclusion in the present study co2 enrichment decreased cwr and increased wue in contrast canopy warming significantly decreased wue but increased cwr the results from concurrent co2 enrichment and warming treatment indicated that the positive effect of co2 enrichment was unable to compensate for the negative effect of warming on cwr and wue a larger inter annual variation of these responses was observed in concurrent co2 enrichment and warming condition whereas the coefficient of variation was decreased under co2 enrichment alone or unchanged under warming alone therefore the on going co2 enrichment and global warming could pose a critical challenge for sustaining food production globally moreover future agricultural cwr and wue under co2 enrichment and warming will face enormous challenges we need to develop technology for agricultural water management and take advantage of the positive aspects of co2 enrichment for adaptation to global warming in future climate change scenarios acknowledgement many thanks for dr toshihiro hasegawa and

11586,impact of climate change on water supply and use is a critical issue for dryland crop production in this study is assessed the potential impact of atmospheric co2 enrichment 500μmolmol 1 ce and canopy warming 2 c wa and their combination cw on crop water utilization efficiency wue of winter wheat in an open air field experiment from southeast china micro meteorological measurement and wheat growth under individual treatments over three executive years of 2012 2015 were used to estimate the crop water requirement cwr of wheat using an improved fao penman monteith equation overall co2 enrichment slightly decreased the cwr by 8 3 and increased the wue of grain production wueg by 23 1 averaged over the three years in contrast warming increased cwr by 19 6 but decreased wueg by 27 9 over the period under cw treatment however cwr was increased by 3 1 15 8 but wueg was decreased by 3 5 18 2 throughout three years clearly the positive impact of co2 enrichment on wue was largely negated under canopy warming moreover when assessing with individual year data inter annual variability of wueg was insignificant under wa smaller under ce but much higher under cw compared to ck these results indicated that an interaction by canopy warming overshadowed the potential increase in wue with co2 enrichment and enforced yearly fluctuation of the crop production under simulated climate change conditions therefore improving water supply and management in agriculture should thus be endeavored to address the potential constraints with future trends of concurrent atmospheric co2 enrichment and warming keywords climate change free air co2 enrichment face elevated temperature water utilization efficiency winter wheat crop water use 1 introduction world agriculture consumes about 70 of the world s freshwater and food security exerts a strong dependence on water resource availability bocchiola et al 2013 fader et al 2011 konar et al 2011 palazzoli et al 2015 water resource shortage has been increasingly constraining crop production piao et al 2010 wallace 2000 challenged with the global climate change rosenzweig et al 2014 wheeler and von braun 2013 increasing water utilization efficiency wue would be a priority task among the key measures to sustaining global crop production in the coming decades elliott et al 2014 hoekstra and mekonnen 2012 iglesias and garrote 2015 ye et al 2015 as one of most important non irrigated staple crops ladha 2003 winter wheat production has been constrained by decline in water availability with increasing drought frequency in recent years therefore technologies to increase wue would be measures to enhance climate smart agriculture paustian et al 2016 global atmospheric co2 concentration is expected to increase over 500μmolmol 1 while surface air temperature to elevate by about 2 c during the middle of 21st century ipcc 2013 solomon et al 2009 this climate change would have great impacts on crop production guo et al 2010 o leary et al 2015 potentially through decreasing wue by plants wallace 2000 however the impacts on crop water utilization could vary with climatic factors that influence the evapotranspiration and plant physiological processes elevated co2 concentration tends to decrease transpiration and seasonal crop water requirement cwr owing to decreased stomatal conductance shimono et al 2013 yu et al 2007 being often addressed as co2 fertilization effect co2 enrichment could increase plant biomass and grain production resulting in an apparent increase in wue bunce 2013 hunsaker et al 2000 o leary et al 2015 shimono et al 2013 yoshimoto et al 2005 however co2 enrichment could also negatively affect cwr for the potential increase in leaf area index lai kim et al 2003 shimono et al 2013 and photosynthetic rate ruiz vera et al 2013 on the other hand co2 enrichment could result in an increase in air temperature which would generally increase cwr since evaporation and canopy transpiration could be increased goyal 2004 and thus crop productivity decreased wang et al 2016a under elevated temperature meanwhile elevated temperature could induce a shortened duration of crop growing cleland et al 2007 and thus a decreased crop cwr the net response of crop production to the combined effects of co2 enrichment and warming has been evaluated in previous studies kim et al 1996 ruiz vera et al 2013 usui et al 2016 the majority of which suggested that the positive effect of co2 enrichment was often traded off by the negative effects of warming on crop production hasegawa et al 2017 wang et al 2016a therefore it is worthy to address the combined effects of co2 enrichment and warming on cwr and wue under field conditions modelling approaches had been employed in evaluating inter annual variability of water consumption by crop in response to climate change conditions cammarano et al 2016 o leary et al 2015 zhuo et al 2014 crop wue was modeled to increase in a range of 7 to 120 between years under co2 enrichment in field and greenhouse studies hunsaker et al 2000 niu et al 2011 shimono et al 2013 tausz posch et al 2013 wu et al 2004 in a modelling study by cammarano et al 2016 elevated temperature increased annual variability of cwr regardless of co2 enrichment effects however large uncertainties existed among the modelling predictions of cwr or wue for the lack of field observations cammarano et al 2016 li et al 2015 therefore to what extent the different climate change scenarios would impact the inter annual variability of cwr and wue is still unclear so far over 50 mathematical estimations had been used for predicting evapotranspiration et and cwr with varying complexity using different variables lu et al 2005 islam et al 2012 as recommended as a standard method of water requirement calculation by the international commission on irrigation and drainage icid and food and agricultural organization of the united nations fao the use of the penman monteith model directly incorporates the relevant meteorological variables and biophysical parameters allen et al 1998 later on penman monteith model had been concerned as the most reliable model worldwide kingston et al 2009 lu et al 2005 changes in atmospheric co2 concentration and temperature could modify the relevant physiological traits e g leaf area stomatal conductance and also meteorological variables e g temperature rainfall relative air humidity of cropland which are important for et kingston et al 2009 argued that panman monteith was most reliable method among the six methods including penman monteith hamon hargreaves priestley taylor blaney criddle and jensen haise models when assessing potential et this model was constructed on a robust physical basis with all relevant meteorological variables and allowed to address non meteorological uncertainties such as specification of canopy conductance the penman menteith model had been also preferable for future climate change impact studies for the model addresses changes rather in atmospheric variables than in edaphic conditions islam et al 2012 kingston et al 2009 by modifying the canopy resistance term penman monteith model could effectively evaluate the impacts of global warming and co2 enrichment on et islam et al 2012 priya et al 2014 wu et al 2012 therefore penman monteith model could directly be used to simulate et and evaluate cwr moreover the penman monteith equation had been widely used to estimate crop evapotranspiration and water demand in simulated climate change experiments cammarano et al 2016 ewert et al 2002 goyal 2004 lovelli et al 2010 savabi and stockle 2001 steduto et al 2009 china is one of the major crop production countries in the world frolking et al 2002 of which the food safety is vulnerable global change and the associated extreme weather events lesk et al 2016 pan 2010 ray et al 2015 rice and wheat production from asia could be greatly impacted by climate change conditions possibly enhanced under co2 enrichment but negatively impacted by global warming hasegawa et al 2017 wang et al 2016a at particular drought and water scarcity had become key constraints for crop production of china piao et al 2010 to understand the effects of climate change on cwr and wue is a prerequisite for developing such climate smart agriculture of china so far it remains unclear whether the effect of warming outweighed the effect of co2 enrichment in terms of cwr and wue this limits our ability to predict the potential impact of climate change on wheat productivity we hypothesize that wheat cwr or wue could vary with different sets of climate change conditions and exert inter annual variability between years of the climate change simulation based on micro meteorological data collected over three consecutive years from an open air field experiment in southeast china this study is to estimate the combined effects of co2 enrichment and warming on the status and stability of cwr and wue using an improved penman monteith equation we aimed to provide critical information for water management improvement for wheat production facing climate change in the near future 2 materials and methods 2 1 experiment site data for this study was from an open air field experiment base simulating climate change conditions in a summer rice winter wheat

concurrent co2 enrichment and canopy air warming cw co2 enrichment and crop canopy air warming were sustained throughout the whole crop growing period the treatments were conducted in separated octagonal rings each having an area of 50m2 in the field each treatment was replicated in three rings with the same infrastructure and the rings arranged in a split row design all the rings were buffered by the adjacent open fields about 28m apart to avoid any cross over effects from the treatments for the atmospheric co2 enrichment treatments ce and cw pure co2 gas purity 99 99 were supplied

and incorporated into the soil by ploughing to the depth of plow layer and the topdressing was surface broadcast other farm managements including weed control fertilization and insecticide application were performed following the local conventional practices the wheat crops were cultivated under rain fed conditions in this study 2 4 sampling and measurement of wheat biomass and grain aboveground biomass ab t ha 1 and grain yield gy t ha 1 were determined to evaluate the impact of co2 enrichment and canopy warming on crop growth and production at the ripening stage all of the fresh aboveground biomass in each ring was collected and weighed individually in the field to determine the dry weight for the aboveground biomass three plant samples in a ring were randomly sampled and air dried at 105 c for 30min and subsequently at 70 c to constant weight meanwhile all the grains from the collected biomass in a ring were threshed using a portable thresher grain moisture content was measured by drying a portion of grain using similar method for dry biomass to allow estimation of grain production on dry weight base 2 5 meteorological monitoring and data archive daily weather conditions were

comparing stomatal conductance under atmospheric co2 concentration from 330μmolmol 1 to 660μmolmol 1 for a wide range of species including wheat stockle et al 1992 developed the linear relationship for leaf stomatal conductance as a function of co2 concentration morison and gifford 1983 used a 40 linear decrease in stomatal conductance as co2 concentration varied from 330μmolmol 1 to 660μmolmol

variability analysis given that the cultivars and farm management were consistent over the three year experiment the coefficient of variation c v could be used to evaluate the yearly variability in cwr and wue in response to climate change therefore the c v was calculated in this study as follows 13 c v i j c i j k m c i j 2 3 m c i j 100 where cvi j represents the c v of a ring i under a treatment j ci j k is the cwr or wue of a ring i under a treatment j in kth year and mci j is the mean cwr or wue of a ring i under a treatment j 2 7 statistical analysis all data were expressed as means plus standard deviation of three replicates one way anova followed by duncan s test was used to justify the differences between different treatments a general linear mixed model glm was used to test the major effects of co2 enrichment canopy warming and or growth year and their interactions on wheat production cwr wue and their variability all statistical analyses were carried out using ibm spss ver 20 0 a probability level of p 0 05 was considered as statistically significant 3 results 3 1 wheat productivity under simulated climate change as shown in table 2 the ab production of wheat on average was moderately increased by 10 7 under co2 enrichment moderately decreased by 17 0 under warming treatment the gy production followed a similar trend with a smaller extent of change compared to ab production 3 2 cwr and wue under simulated climate change the pattern of estimated daily cwr across the three wheat growing seasons is presented in fig 2 clearly daily cwr was remarkably variable with wheat growth stages being higher in the middle to latter growth stages than at the early growth stage over the three years moreover the dynamics of daily cwr with the growing stages was significantly affected by climatic change treatments the rate of cwr under ce was significantly decreased in contrast the rate of cwr was significantly increased under warming treatments wa and cw though the extent of such change varied among growth stages overall treatment of elevated temperature significantly increased the daily cwr at middle growth stage in 2014 2015 but over the entire growing season in 2012 2013 and 2013 2014 as illustrated in table 3 the cwr averaged over the three years was decreased by 8 3 under co2 enrichment p 0 013 but remarkably increased under canopy warming by a mean of 19 6 p 0 001 however the results from cw showed that cwr were increased by 3 1 15 8 over the three consecutive years when averaged for the three years the wueg and wueb were increased respectively under co2 enrichment by a mean of 23 1 and of 20 6 p 0 001 in contrast the wueg and wueb under canopy warming were both significantly p 0 001 decreased by over 25 0 p 0 001 during the three years 3 3 inter annual variability of cwr and wue under simulated climate change the values of cwr and wue are different among the three consecutive years p 0 05 with the highest cwr observed in the hot season of 2013 2014 and with the highest wueg and wueb found in the dry season of 2014 2015 table 3 unlike the biomass production table 2 decreases over ambient in wueg and wueb were by a range of 3 5 26 7 under cw throughout the three consecutive years however the wueg was significantly increased by co2 enrichment under canopy warming condition in 2014 2015 indicating a significant interaction of co2 warming year on wueg p 0 001 in addition an increase over ambient in wueg and wueb was observed respectively in a range of 2 7 43 2 and 13 1 34 0 under ce throughout the three years as exhibited in fig 3 the c v values with years of cwr wueb and wueg varied in a wide range of 4 8 53 8 exhibiting a great but different inter annual variability under different treatments generally the c v of cwr largely consistent among the simulated climate change treatments compared to ambient condition the c v values both of wueb and wueg were much higher under cw but much lower under ce while the c v values of wueg unchanged under wa 4 discussion 4 1 effect of co2 enrichment and canopy air warming on wheat cwr and wue over the three consecutive years the daily cwr was lower in early growth stage and higher in late growth stage due to the increased daily mean temperature in a study by liu et al 2016 using lysimetric experiment of winter wheat in a similar region of china daily cwr was low prior to the reviving stage but high after the jointing stage in this study winter wheat cwr was averaged of 256 5mm over the three years this could be comparable to the finding of 290mm by liu et al 2007 for the same crop from shanghai china decreases in cwr and increases in wue had been reported for rice and wheat under co2 enrichment in many field experiments houshmandfar et al 2016 shimono et al 2013 tausz posch et al 2013 yoshimoto et al 2005 firstly co2 fertilization effect could result in increases in photosynthetic rate and carbohydrate accumulation ainsworth and long 2005 hasegawa et al 2013 o leary et al 2015 accordingly we observed ab and gy of wheat being increased moderately both over 10 on average under co2 enrichment regardless of temperature table 2 secondly plant leaves received enough co2 for photosynthesis and greater depolarization of guard cells leading to a decline in stomatal aperture and in leaf transpiration rate and thus to a reduced cwr under co2 enrichment ainsworth and rogers 2007 shimono et al 2013 yu et al 2007 the present study revealed a significant positive effect of co2 enrichment on wueg and wueb which was increased respectively by 23 1 and 20 6 on average over the three years under co2 enrichment regardless of temperature table 3 this was comparable to finding by qiao et al 2010 in a greenhouse experiment where co2 concentration was up to 712μmolmol 1 of course our finding here was much lower than a 57 increase in wheat wue under atmospheric co2 concentrations up to 550μmolmol 1 in a face field study from australian tausz posch et al 2013 moreover co2 enrichment alone here increased wueg and wueb by over 30 and by over 20 respectively in normal precipitation season of 2012 2013 and 2013 2014 table 3 o leary et al 2015 observed an increase in wue of biomass and yield respectively by 31 and by 36 in wheat under co2 enrichment from australia whereas our results showed co2 enrichment slightly decreased cwr which was in contrast to the finding by o leary et al 2015 who reported that cwr was unchanged by co2 enrichment for late time of sowing wheat only under rain fed in a face experiment this inconsistency could be explained by the different co2 concentrations treatment methods and environmental conditions between studies meanwhile it is worth noting that the high variability of cwr and wue was observed for the decrements of cwr varied from 3 1 to 15 8 and increments of wue varied from 2 7 to 43 2 under co2 enrichment alone throughout the monitoring years in this study table 3 previous studies also showed the increments of wue varied from 7 to 120 under co2 enrichment conditions hunsaker et al 2000 niu et al 2011 tausz posch et al 2013 wu et al 2004 altogether these studies highlighted the uncertainty over the effects of co2 enrichment on agricultural cwr and wue cammarano et al 2016 huang et al 2016 ray et al 2015 wang et al 2016a in contrast to the positive effects of co2 enrichment negative effect of canopy air warming on wue were observed throughout the monitoring years table 3 warming caused declines in photosynthesis promoted vapor pressure deficit leaf transpiration surface evaporation and evapotranspiration decreasing wheat grain yield and wue goyal 2004 ruiz vera et al 2013 wang et al 2016a zelikova et al 2015 in present study the cwr was increased by about 20 under canopy warming regardless of co2 enrichment table 3 this result was consistent with an increase of 15 for evapotranspiration under warming from arid regions of rajasthan india goyal 2004 here a reduction by over 25 of wheat wueg and wueb was observed under wa treatment over the three years guo et al 2010 reported a lower decrease by 4 8 8 1 in wheat wue in a modeling study of wheat production with climate change condition in north china also relatively lower decreases in wue were noted in grassland and spring wheat under warming niu et al 2011 wall et al 2011 overall cwr could be increased under warming with an extent varying with growth stages weather plant and region specific conditions our results here demonstrated that both wueb and wueg were decreased moderately under concurrent co2 enrichment and warming over the three years table 3 unlike under co2 enrichment only canopy warming imposed the effect of co2 enrichment on wheat cwr because wheat cwr was slightly increased by 3 1 15 8 when crop was treated concurrently with co2 enrichment and warming over the three years table 3 this suggests that a positive effect of co2 enrichment could be partially offset by the negative impact of warming on wueg and wueb guo et al 2010 highlighted a potential increase in evapotranspiration and in turn a decrease in wue with concurrent co2 enrichment and warming in a simulation study of wheat and maize rotation system form north china evenmore cammarano et al 2016 reported that co2 enrichment 720μmolmol 1 did not offset crop wue reduction caused by elevated temperature in wheat these results indicated a stronger effect of canopy air warming on wue of wheat than co2 enrichment under field conditions therefore given the stronger responses detailed above the overall negative effect of concurrent co2 enrichment and warming on winter wheat wue should be considered in predicting the impacts of climatic change 4 2 inter annual variability as influenced by climate change conditions in this study with interaction of climate change conditions inter annual variability of cwr and wue were both higher under co2 enrichment and warming conditions seemingly the inter annual climate variations could alter the responses of wue to co2 enrichment and warming wisser et al 2008 pointed out the variability and uncertainties of agricultural water requirement and global irrigation arising from inter annual variability of weather and climate in addition canopy air warming decreased wueb and wueg with the extent varying from 21 9 to 37 5 during the three years in this study table 3 this is comparable to the finding by craufurd et al 1999 who reported that the decrement of wue under elevated temperature varied from 14 3 to 29 4 among years these results evidenced a large uncertainty concerning the effect of climatic and atmospheric change on cwr and wue to examine the causes of the inter annual variability of cwr and wue we analyzed the cumulative precipitation across wheat growing seasons table 1 plant water requirement could be affected by rainfall allen et al 1998 huang et al 2016 in this study cwr was affected by meteorological condition being hottest in the season of 2013 2014 over the three years tables 1 and 3 however the wueg and wueb were highest in the dry season of 2014 2015 over the monitoring years this change in wue could be ascribed to a decline in transpiration in lower temperature year and benefit winter wheat during dry season of 2014 2015 piao et al 2010 addressed the distribution of water resources as spatially and seasonally heterogeneous inter annual variation of precipitation could be one of the major factors for the variability of cwr and wue under co2 enrichment and warming yet canopy air warming significantly increased the inter annual variability of wueb regardless of co2 enrichment fig 3 warming increased uncertainties of cwr and wue of wheat under ambient and co2 enrichment conditions cammarano et al 2016 zhuo et al 2014 the results here demonstrated that the cwr change was sensitive to daily mean temperature rather under warming condition than under co2 enrichment condition figs 1 and 2 as simulated and predicted in previous studies elevated temperature could increase the uncertainty of water utilization in wheat cammarano et al 2016 canopy warming by 2 c resulted in higher inter annual variability in the treatments of wa and cw in this study additionally much higher inter annual variability of wueg and wueb was observed under concurrent co2 enrichment and warming condition than under co2 enrichment alone implying that warming significantly increased c v of wueg under co2 enrichment condition fig 3 thus an important interaction effect between co2 enrichment and canopy air warming was observed in water utilization variability therefore the future climate change research should simultaneously consider atmospheric co2 concentration and temperature these findings suggest that increasing wue under severe climate change is a great challenge faced by agriculture out of our expectation co2 enrichment alone tended to reduce the inter annual variability of cwr and wue fig 3 which is important information for adaptation to climate change over the three years of study of cwr and wue we found a reduction of cwr and c v of wue under co2 enrichment however winter wheat water consumption and uncertainty of cwr and wue may increase in future climate change concurrent co2 enrichment and warming as per the above discussion which will limit food production and supply to adapt and mitigate the climate change effects on crop production in developing countries technology to enhance wue needs to develop in future study one could breed wheat races to adapt to global warming and profit from co2 enrichment under climate change challenges ortiz et al 2008 it is an important task for breeding to develop a new wheat cultivar taking advantage of the positive aspects of co2 enrichment with restraining the negative effects of global warming on crop production and wue 5 conclusion in the present study co2 enrichment decreased cwr and increased wue in contrast canopy warming significantly decreased wue but increased cwr the results from concurrent co2 enrichment and warming treatment indicated that the positive effect of co2 enrichment was unable to compensate for the negative effect of warming on cwr and wue a larger inter annual variation of these responses was observed in concurrent co2 enrichment and warming condition whereas the coefficient of variation was decreased under co2 enrichment alone or unchanged under warming alone therefore the on going co2 enrichment and global warming could pose a critical challenge for sustaining food production globally moreover future agricultural cwr and wue under co2 enrichment and warming will face enormous challenges we need to develop technology for agricultural water

11587,the nile delta and its 2 27 million ha of irrigated land makes up two thirds of egypt s agricultural land it is also the terminal part of a river basin that spans and feeds 11 countries increases in dam and irrigation development in upstream parts of the basin is poised to conflict with agricultural expansion and population growth in egypt understanding where and how waters comes into and leaves the delta is therefore a crucial question for the future of the country this paper revisits the surface and groundwater balances of the delta emphasizes the additional relevance of drainage water reuse and of the salt balance and evidences a relative stability of the outflow to the sea over the past 30 years various reasons for such a phenomenon and the scope for saving water are explored and discussed the confusion between plot level and delta level efficiency and the relatively limited gains possible are emphasized beyond the overall water balance and quantitative issues water management in the delta remains a complex task of spatially distributing the resource over a complex ramified network finally limitations in the analysis related to data availability and accuracy are emphasized keywords water balance salt balance water reuse irrigation efficiency nile delta egypt 1 introduction the nile delta is the terminal part of a 3 17 million km2 wide river basin that spans 11 countries before joining the mediterranean sea in egypt nile waters are diverted to irrigate 5 36 million hectares mha of land basin wide of which 3 4mha are to be found in egypt fao 2011 and around 2 27mha in the nile delta proper malr 2011 in egypt 55 of the population are dependent on the agricultural sector for their livelihood a sector that accounts for about 15 of a gross domestic product gdp of us 232 billion and close to one third of total employment fao 2000 a dense network of waterways dissects the nile delta including 40 000km of canals that branch off the nile river and convey water to over 2 million farmers across several nested geographical scales and institutional levels van achthoven et al 2004 intermingled with these conveyance canals are 18 000km of drains where water is partially both reused by farmers and pumped back to higher level delivery canals and eventually conveyed to coastal lakes and the sea as agriculture is the main user of water in egypt accounting for 85 of national demand the question of irrigation water use efficiency over a range of scales i e from on farm to basin is key to satisfying growing non agricultural needs and possibly to expanding agriculture to provide livelihood opportunities for egypt s rural population indeed increasing the efficiency productivity and equity of water use and management at all levels while conserving the resource base are the most salient objectives of both the national water resources plan 2017 mwri 2005 and the government of egypt s strategy for sustainable agricultural development 2030 ardc 2009 any discussion of the potential for increasing efficiency and how to achieve this is eventually linked to the question of the overall water availability in other words this starts with understanding how much water enters the nile delta how it is then distributed how much is drained to the sea and whether and how this amount can be reduced to free up water for other consumptive uses such knowledge is critically in demand at a time when egypt s water supply is threatened by dam and irrigation development in the upper part of the nile basin while its own needs increase this paper offers a general discussion of the delta water balance within the constraints associated with the limited availability and accuracy of data we review sequentially the various terms of the water balance then discuss the importance of associated salt balances while the relative stability of the outflow to the sea observed over the past 30 years leads us to discuss how this is compatible with known changes in supply and demand the conclusion emphasizes possible reasons for a stable outflow the limitations associated with the large uncertainty in most terms of the water balance and the limited means and scope for improving overall efficiency of water use in the delta 2 inflow to the delta 2 1 rainfall rainfall varies from 250mm on the north western coast to 50mm in cairo its contribution to the delta water balance is taken by irg 1998 to be 0 8 billion cubic meters bm3 we rely here on an average rounded up value of 1bm3 2 2 nile river the quantity of water that reaches the delta depends on how much has been released from the high aswan dam had and how much has been consumed for human and agricultural purposes along the nile valley this second term varies with cropping patterns but is relatively stable since all return flows end up back in the river with the exception of those in the fayoum which end up in a sink the qaraoun lake releases from had depend on the run off received by the dam but its high capacity has in general allowed managers to even out variations and average releases are estimated to be around 57bm3 y el atfy et al 2009 gohar and ward 2010 el kassar 1991 capmas 2007 this is slightly more than the official quota of 55 5bm3 partly because sudan is not taking its full share and partly due to favorable hydrological conditions in the late 2000s data on the total inflow to the delta for the period 2008 2012 indicate values between 38 3 and 47 4bm3 representing a substantial variation of over 9bm3 between 2008 and 2010 dri 2013 we rely here on an average inflow of 42bm3 3 groundwater use and balance 3 1 aquifer recharge the quaternary aquifer of the delta is semi confined as its top is covered by a thin clay layer whose thickness varies from 5m in the south to 20m in the middle and 50m in the north of the delta while disappearing in some places mabrouk et al 2013 depths to groundwater range between 1 and 2m in the north 3 4m in the middle and 5m in the south ibid deep percolation from excess irrigation water and seepage from the river branches notably the rosetta branch canals and drains in the southern and middle parts of the nile delta recharge the aquifer while there is some upward seepage in the northern part of the delta kashef 1983 sefelnasr and sherif 2013 the nubaria canal west and ismailia canal east that run along the fringes of the delta have substantial infiltrations enhanced by lighter soils and widening operations that disrupt the clay deposited in these canals african water facility 2007 downward leakage towards the aquifer due to water used for irrigation and canal infiltration has been estimated at between 0 25 and 0 80mm day in the central and southern parts of the delta dri 1989 nofal et al 2015 these values are associated with a total recharge rate by infiltration of 6 78bm3 y fao 2013 mabrouk et al 2013 mohamed and hua 2010 a value already used in the 1980s e g kashef 1983 however this key term of the water balance is extremely difficult to measure or estimate and is not known with much accuracy groundwater modeling studies generally neglect the contribution of rainfall with an average between 25 and 200mm year to recharge since it is very small compared to the recharge rate mabrouk et al 2013 additionally there is no data available for the inflow from the valley part of the nile aquifer it is therefore not considered here groundwater in the delta is not a separate or additional resource and is directly fed by surface water brought by the nile river 3 2 aquifer discharge groundwater discharge from the nile delta aquifer takes place in different indirect and direct ways through seepage to waterways drains and in some parts canals seepage to water bodies and evapotranspiration inter aquifer flow outflow to the sea and direct groundwater abstraction through wells 3 2 1 outflow to lateral aquifers outflow of the nile delta aquifer occurs towards the moghra aquifer along the fringe of the western nile delta with a transfer estimated by rigw iwaco 1990 between 50 and 100mm3 year because of the depletion of the moghra aquifer it is likely that this value has dramatically increased we have tentatively considered here a value of 100mm3 3 2 2 outflow to waterways and evapotranspiration in the northern fringe of the delta the aquifer is semi confined and subject to upward seepage groundwater is discharged to the relatively incised drainage system but also to canals during the off turn of water distribution some seepage of very saline water can be observed and this has to be flushed away at the beginning of the next on period before farmers can use the water some water also makes its way to the soil and the crop roots contributing to plot evapotranspiration in official water balances this contribution intrusion to both waterways and et is sometimes taken at 1 or 2bm3 oosterban 1999 mwri 2002 or disregarded altogether we may use the overall salt balance of the delta to estimate the order of magnitude of this contribution in rounded up values the amount of salt released by the aswan dam is roughly 11 million t 55bm3 0 2g l while the amount released to the sea is around 36 million t 12bm3 3g l this means that approximately 25 million tons of salt are brought up from saline aquifers in the semi confined part of the delta and residual soil salinity in the western delta dri s yearbook data show that the main salt flushing point corresponds to the drains coming from western new lands and that around one third of the total around 8 million tons can be attributed to the new lands we can estimate the corresponding volume of upward seepage with a rough calculation the salinity in drains near the lakes and seashore is around 3 10g l and includes a mix of drainage water at around 1g l and upward seepage taken tentatively here at 15g l on average 1 1 maps provided by morsy 2009 or fao 2013 show a large spatial variability of this value maps are often drawn based on the interpolation of very few points when it comes to the northern part of the delta this value is indicative of an average for the irrigated area undergoing upward groundwater seepage in order to account for 17 million t of salt 25 8 this upward seepage with an average salinity of 15g l has to amount to 1 1bm3 a significant value we rely here on a rounded value of 1bm3 3 2 3 outflow to the sea the question of how much groundwater ends up in the sea is difficult because answers that can be obtained through modeling are contingent upon a physical description of the aquifer itself and knowledge of the spatial distribution of both recharge and abstraction needless to say current knowledge on all these complex elements remains somewhat crude zeidan 2016 reports that in 1980 an extensive study was conducted to evaluate the safe yield of the nile delta aquifer and that the annual outflow of freshwater to the sea was estimated at 0 97bm3 for the west delta mohamed and hua 2010 have found a deficit of 0 14mm3 y in the aquifer which is promoting seawater intrusion abstraction of groundwater in the eastern delta is much more limited because its quality is in general degraded this maintains groundwater at a rather high level with instances of waterlogging and a net positive outflow to the sea khalil et al 2015 recent research has found that groundwater intrudes from the sea to the nile delta aquifer 0 56bm3 y at intermediate depths as well as flowing from the aquifer towards the sea 0 14bm3 y at deeper depths prompting the conclusion that overall the nile delta aquifer is not losing fresh groundwater flux to the sea nofal et al 2015 considering that this term of the balance is in all cases of a minor magnitude we have taken it here arbitrarily at 0 this is consistent with the fact that salinity isolines have not yet been substantially altered in past decades morsy 2009 3 2 4 abstraction by pumping groundwater abstraction by wells in the delta has consistently increased if judged by the number of wells inventoried from 5600 wells in 1952 to 13 000 in 1991 22 905 in 2011 11 120 wells in the west delta 2887 in the central delta and 8898 in the eastern delta mwri 2013 and finally 32 054 agricultural wells in 2016 zeidan 2016 mwri 2016 conjunctive use of surface and groundwater is now widely practiced by farmers especially during periods of peak irrigation demands groundwater is abstracted in the southern part of the delta underlain as it is by a non confined aquifer with water tables only a few meters below ground level north of a line that can be taken more or less as the 1g l or 1000ppm salinity isoline groundwater is too saline to be used and the soil has a thicker cap of clay but percolation of water in the old delta also benefits lateral areas where the aquifer is unconfined and where intensive use of groundwater has developed most notably in the western delta and along the nubaria canal the density of individual wells in the delta and why how and when they are used by farmers is an under researched topic a recent survey in an area of 30 000ha north east of tanta shed light on groundwater use dynamics el agha et al 2015a 2017 a total of 1815 wells were identified giving an average density of one well 16ha but with values locally reaching one well 2ha if we extrapolate the average density of wells found in the study area 1815 wells for 30 000ha to the roughly 60 of the delta 0 6 2 mha where wells are found we obtain a number of wells of around 73 000 this does not include the delta s fringes notably on the western side where overall groundwater abstraction is roughly as high as in the old delta rigw 2001 at this stage it is not possible to ascertain whether such an extrapolation is acceptable but multiple field observations in the eastern delta near zagazig and in the southern part of the central delta showed that a high number of wells can also be found there this order of magnitude is about twice higher than the number of wells found in 2016 22 905 as with individual pumping from drains it is very hard to derive quantitative estimates as to how much water is sourced from the aquifer from a total of 0 2bm3 y in 1952 2 77bm3 in 1991 and 3 5bm3 in 2003 zeidan 2016 abstraction reached 4 9bm3 in 2008 according to morsy 2009 recent updates mwri 2016 put agricultural overall abstraction at 5 89bm3 with 4 39 0 55 and 0 95bm3 for the west 2 2 the higher value for the western part of the delta is due to the conjunctive use that has developed in the new lands of the western delta central and east delta respectively we consider here a value of 7bm3 for domestic industrial and agricultural use in most official reports the values of both percolation around 6 7bm3 and abstraction are considered to be roughly equal hypothesizing that the delta aquifer is in a balanced state this is convenient shorthand for the recognition that neither of those two terms is actually known with a satisfactory degree of accuracy 4 outflow by evaporation and evapotranspiration 4 1 evaporation from water bodies the evaporation of all waterways and other water bodies is conventionally taken at 3bm3 in most studies for the whole nile system had not included e g mwri 2005 a value of 2bm3 is considered here for the delta alone 4 2 evaporation through domestic and industrial use according to recent estimates the industrial sector is diverting 5 4bm3 noureddin 2016 of which 1 8bm3 are consumed while the rest is returned to the system the share for the delta plus cairo is 1 2bm3 likewise domestic use incurs a consumption of 3 18bm3 of the 11 3bm3 diverted with a share of 2bm3 for the delta and cairo 4 3 plot evapotranspiration irrigated agriculture the evaporation of irrigated crops in the nile delta is of course the main term of the water balance contrary to what might be expected this term is not easy to estimate based on land use agronomic and climatic data the first difficulty relates to the very extent of agriculture itself the ministry of agriculture and land reclamation malr provides some yearly estimates of cultivated areas that often differ from those used by the mwri cultivated areas in the core nile delta are known to a certain extent but are modified each year due in particular to the encroachment of urbanization into agricultural areas of which more later the situation is less certain concerning agriculture in the new lands a large part of which has been based on groundwater in recent years it is also often unclear whether data refer to equipped command areas or actual cultivated areas in many areas there is often a significant difference between these values because a portion of the land is left uncultivated for a number of reasons poor soil poor access to roads salinity insufficient water supply etc which is well illustrated by the situation at the downstream end of the nubaria canal hamam canal and extension while some equipped areas are not being cultivated a lot of uncontrolled horizontal expansion and informal reclamation occurs along the valley and the margins of the delta see barnes 2012 sims 2015 uncontrolled horizontal expansion is very difficult to quantify but estimates in 2010 put it at 361 000 fed 36 of which in the delta and the rest in upper middle egypt mwri 2013 google earth provides stunning images of the expansion of this largely uncontrolled and even less monitored irrigation over the past 15 years see molle et al 2016 the areas irrigated either by surface or groundwater or both are not known accurately in addition to the total area itself comes the issue of cropping patterns here there is also significant divergence between the areas as considered by the malr and mwri particularly regarding the extent of rice cultivation farmers frequently divide their small plots into several smaller sections with different crops and monitoring aggregating this information is a herculean task the facts that cropping calendars are not uniform and are staggered over several months for a given crop and that for each type of crop there are several varieties with various cycle durations make it even harder to ascertain crop requirements based on estimated cropping patterns and calendars in the particular case of bersim egyptian clover farmers may vary the length of the cultivation period and the number of cuts based on their choice of cropping patterns and rotations last but not least there is no agreement on crop based water requirements the malr and mwri formed a working group that has been attempting to settle the issue for more than 10 years but has yet to reach a conclusion and this tells nothing about the efficiency coefficients of water conveyance and application at the tertiary and plot levels that need to be known to estimate gross water requirements iwmi and wmri 2013 have shown that official reports and technical studies present or use widely varying values of et and net or gross water requirements this is not specific to egypt but confirms that estimating theoretical crop requirements is not as easy or accurate as many would like to believe an alternative is to use satellite imagery and energy balances to estimate total evapotranspiration the accuracy of remote sensing data varies depending on several factors such as crop type and crop development stage and also the number of samples used for matching actual field data and remote sensing interpretations this approach is interesting in terms of identifying spatial contrasts at a given point in time between areas with high and low et but has its limitations when it comes to estimating absolute et values see droogers et al 2009 who found variations of up to 31 on delta et estimated by two different reports using remote sensing one such exercise simonneaux and adrabou 2010 has estimated et for the delta 2 6mha at 30bm3 in practice and in this paper actual et is often estimated as the closing term of the water balance for the entire nile delta and valley system estimates of total et in the literature vary between 36 and 41bm3 4 4 pond evaporation aquaculture having developed mainly in an informal manner the aquaculture found along the northern fringe of the delta is not usually computed together with agriculture this is also due to the fact that a large part of this aquaculture diverts drainage outflows after the terminal pump stations that lift drainage water to flush it to the sea or coastal lakes as a result they are not considered part of the official command area of the mwri the volumes used will have to be deducted from the computed outflow to the sea this aquaculture has developed into one of the largest such inland areas in the world estimated at 300 000 fed roughly 120 000ha rounded to 100 000ha to deduct aquaculture that developed within irrigation areas most fishpond owners do not raise fish during winter but some cultivate wheat or barley in rotation with fish however all ponds evaporate as open water bodies during the rest of the year if we assume an order of magnitude of 1m of evaporation during this period we can estimate the consumption of water in aquaculture at around 1bm3 5 drainage water reuse drainage water from irrigated fields is re injected into the distribution system at different locations in the nile delta this reuse substantially increases the overall efficiency of the delta water use however it is a process that merely facilitates water distribution across a long ramified and complex network reuse adds water locally and is therefore very important for local managers but it does not add water to the delta per se and therefore does not alter the overall macro level water balance we nevertheless briefly describe the various means through which water is reused in the nile delta since it is relevant to the salt balance of the delta 5 1 official water reuse drainage water reuse is a constitutive feature of the nile delta the upper central part of the delta for example is able to drain back into the rosetta branch from which drainage water mixes with nile water and is further distributed to downstream areas the mwri has long been constructing pump stations which abstract water from main drains at locations where they cross or come close to main canals and even branches of the nile drainage water is therefore lifted and re injected into the distribution system unfortunately this system has been challenged by the degraded water quality in many drains which does not always allow it to be re injected into canals especially when these convey water that is used downstream for domestic purposes this is the case for example on the main drain leading to the edku lake and on the omoum drain where several pump stations to divert drainage water to nearby new lands in nubaria were installed but never used as well as along the ismailia canal van achthoven et al 2004 by 2005 app 2005 only half of the 29 reuse pump stations that had been installed were functioning well or with only minor problems as a result of pollution the idea of reuse has been extended to secondary drains which with possible exceptions when these are collecting wastewater from nearby industries or a medium sized city still have reasonably good water quality this so called intermediate reuse has been extensively developed in the northern part of the delta in recent years often in response to local water shortages and public complaints iwmi and wmri 2013 in the lower meet yazid canal command area for example there are as many as 25 pump stations with a combined pumping capacity equivalent to roughly 25 of the discharge in the main irrigation canal iwmi and wmri 2013 these stations and their use however are not well inventoried and computed we take main official reuse which varied around 6 7bm3 over the past ten years el sayed 2011 dri 2015 at 8bm3 to account for some underestimation of return flows by gravity see molle et al 2016 and tentatively 2bm3 for intermediate reuse 5 2 informal drainage water reuse like the government individual or groups of farmers have long identified and implemented the idea of sourcing water from nearby drains according to ritzema 2009 this unofficial reuse was estimated in the 2000s to be between 2 8bm3 and 4 4bm3 per year although officially prohibited by the state it is tolerated as a response to the government s failure to supply adequate water for agriculture to our knowledge there has been no recent systematic assessment of informal drainage water reuse we have undertaken a survey to estimate the number of individual pump stations abstracting water from main and secondary drains in the meet yazid canal command area which roughly totals 100 000ha we recorded the location of individual pumps through field surveys along main and secondary drains and estimated the number of pumps at around 2500 molle et al 2016 as expected there was a very high density of pumps in the downstream half of the command area in contrast the secondary drains of the upstream part have few if any pumps it must be noted that the survey did not consider drainage water reuse from tertiary drains in some water short areas this reuse can be considerable for example the monitoring of a collective pump station in the abu mustafa canal area has shown that the command area of 44ha is also supplied by a total of 25 individual pumps that abstract water from tertiary drains unpublished data it is difficult to assess the amount of water effectively mobilized by individual reuse strategies while the number of pumps observed in the northern part of the area is impressive a large proportion of them are used only occasionally in summer we work here with a hypothetical volume of 4bm3 in line with the estimates mentioned above 6 outflow to the sea 6 1 outflow through nile river branches seckler and altaf 1997 have observed a clear reduction of the nile rosetta and damietta branches outflow to the sea from a value of 6 2bm3 in 1980 to 3 9bm3 in 1990 and 1 7bm3 in 1996 this amount of water released annually to the sea for navigation has been reduced from around 1 2bm3 in 1992 to only 0 3bm3 in 1996 by virtue of the staggering of the winter closure attia 1996 each branch of the nile rosetta and damietta is closed by a dam located near its respective estuary but locks allow for navigation what is lost to the sea through the two branches is now estimated at around 0 2bm3 year mwri 2005 6 2 outflow of drainage water where and how then does nile water flow out to the sea it is not well understood by the general public that 1 the main waterways and coastal lakes connecting the delta to the sea are closed by regulators with few exceptions and 2 that 90 of the drainage water volker 1979 must be lifted over a height of approximately 2 5m by pump stations constructed in parallel to these regulators the need for such regulators is to prevent sea water intrusion inland and to allow pump stations to lower water levels in irrigated lands both in the drains and in the soil which otherwise would be roughly at sea level a total of 53 pumping stations pump out drainage water to either the sea coastal lakes or from secondary drainage areas to main drains the ministry periodically calibrates the pumps to establish curves indicating actual discharge depending on the head height between downstream and upstream water levels operation times are recorded and used to calculate the monthly volumes pumped out to the sea at each station when aggregated these data provide an estimate of how much water is released to the sea fig 1 shows the main pumping stations and fig 2 the historical evolution of total drainage outflow and reveals an unexpected relative stability this is discussed later the importance of the quantitative estimation of drainage outflow to the sea raises questions around the data and the methodology used for this estimation first pumps are reportedly calibrated each year and declining efficiencies and discharges are therefore monitored if and when this is not the case the volumes pumped might be slightly overestimated because of the general downward trend in pump efficiency second there are questions about data on water levels and operation times the calculation of discharges factors in the head difference between downstream and upstream water levels those levels are recorded in books but values tend to be constant the upstream level being more or less the target level in the drain while downstream levels are considered less important and measures are less consistent el agha et al 2015b have monitored the pump stations on main drains 7 and 8 central part of the delta in 2004 and 2015 and showed that for drain 7 downstream levels in particular are not noted down accurately and tend to be lower than the value indicated by sensors installed in summer 2014 to monitor water levels the actual pumping head is therefore higher than the value assumed meaning that the volumes pumped are overestimated it is not possible to extend this conclusion to the other pump stations in the delta there is also a need to better account for the cultivated and fishpond areas located between the pump stations and the sea these areas divert part of the drainage water and consume it productively this includes the 1bm3 assumed earlier as consumption in fishponds and possibly some additional agricultural areas some areas are supplied by gravity from the terminal reaches of the main drains e g gharbia or main drain 1 in the central delta and estimating diversions is not easy 7 aspects of the salt balance water dynamics in the delta and the corresponding quantitative mass balance cannot be evaluated without a corresponding analysis of the salt balance depending on water management practices salt may accumulate in both the soil and specific drains which may impair agriculture and prevent conjunctive use fig 3 shows the spatial variability of drain water salinity in the meet yazid canal command area in summer iwmi and wmri 2013 the greater part of the upstream command area of meet yazid has a drainage water salinity under 1400μmhos 3 3 1000μmhos 1 mmhos millimhos 640mg l orppm 0 64g l with the exception of an area near matboul where salinity is between 1400 and 2500μmhos this is a low lying area which actually has to be drained by a large scale pump station medium salinity is observed on the western part in the w10 area which can be explained by the fact that this area is predominantly fed with drainage water from the nashart drain which has higher salinity the figure indicates a growing salinity as one moves northward until the moheet drain that defines the limit of the agricultural area the ghabat and halafy drains to the east exhibit a clear pattern of growing salinity as one moves northward indicating a south north gradient of soil salinity compatible with the fact that historically flooding impoundment and seawater influence were more pronounced and prolonged towards the sea the fact that these drains generate water with salinity approximately 4 times higher than in the upstream part of the canal command area indicates that deeper groundwater is constantly pushed upwards by the semi artesian conditions of the aquifer in the northern part of the delta this groundwater not only carries the salts accumulated in the soil profile upwards but is also affected by underground seawater intrusion the lower the elevation of the ground to the north the higher the effect drains and even canals intercept this upward seepage of salty water iwmi and wmri 2013 the results for winter 2014 15 show that the average ec of drainage water was 3033μmhos in winter against 2333μmhos in summer an increase of 33 limited to the downstream area because upstream has a mostly even and good drainage salinity level this is due to the fact that the amounts of irrigation and drainage water decrease in winter compared with the summer season when rice is cultivated additionally lower average levels in canals and drains promote the drainage of deeper soil layers which have a higher salt content this generation of salt in the northern part of the delta is responsible for the well known fact that the salt mass flushed down to the sea through the pumping station is almost three times larger than the salt mass brought into the delta by the nile river itself roest 1999 zhu et al 1996 as seen above section 3 2 2 there are several issues associated with the generation of salts in the drains of the nile delta the first is local and concerns those drains in the northern fringe that have high salinity but are also used by farmers to complement failing irrigation water should the irrigation efficiency in these areas be substantially improved the resulting decrease in return flows would translate into a proportional increase in salt concentration this would further limit the opportunity for farmers to rely occasionally on drainage water or would increase the impact of salt on yields this constraint does not apply to upstream areas where the phenomenon of increasing drainage water salinity would still keep the quality of this water within a range suitable for downstream reuse the second issue refers to the aquaculture that thrives on the drainage water generated in the highly saline northern drains and which could potentially be threatened by an increase in salinity whether due to increased upward seepage or improved irrigation efficiency fortunately this turns out not to be the case since the type of aquaculture found in these areas for example those around lake burullus can readily stand much more saline water than is the case at present dickson 2014 and would not be affected by possible changes in the salt balance of the delta the situation is less clear however with regard to the ecology and fisheries of the lakes themselves drainage water helps maintain a favorable salt balance in the lakes for fish production which according to abdel dayem et al 2007 should remain between 5500 and 6250μmhos likewise irg 1998 have estimated that to maintain an adequate environmental flow to the lakes a minimum volume of 8 5bm3 is needed in addition through percolation of water in ponds coastal aquaculture positively contributes to preventing seawater intrusion the third issue is regional and concerns the role of rice cultivation in salt management as a result of the upwelling of saline groundwater in the northern fringe of the delta lands that were reclaimed in the 1960s and 1970s need periodic leaching in practice rice cultivation and aquaculture are the only practical ways to do this kotb et al 2000 farmers in the area report a need to grow rice at least once every two sometimes three years to maintain an acceptable level of salinity in the soil of their plot this area covers around 310 000ha that is around 760 000 feddan molle et al 2016 a value very close to the conventional wisdom that 700 000 feddan of rice should be cultivated in order to control salinity intrusion el kady and molden 1995 mwri 2005 since around twice that amount of rice is cultivated in the delta it currently represents a far larger area than environmental conditions dictate a fourth issue is the impact of drainage water salinity on reuse as discussed earlier a total of around 8 2bm3 of drainage water is tapped by gravity or pumping at different points in the system to augment supply to specific areas the common practice in egypt is to mix drainage water with fresh water so that the resulting salinity would be around 1g l abdel dayem et al 2007 there is difficulty retrieving good quality drainage water due to its spatial and temporal variability according to el atfy et al 2009 a third of the drainage outflow to the sea has acceptable salinity for irrigation of tolerant crops and halophytes as mentioned earlier however pollution constitutes a constraint that in many cases prevents reuse even where salinity does not if the salt concentration in the drains increases because of a reduced return flow then a lower portion of drainage water will be usable if current irrigation with say 50 efficiency is improved to 66 then return flows will be reduced from one half to one third meaning that the salinity of drainage water concentration will be multiplied by 1 5 at the same time less water applied at the farm level would allow more to be distributed to downstream areas which would in turn have less need to pump from drains this would not be the case however where shortages are due to a lack of canal capacity in the face of an overextended rice area this identifies an important and complex trade off between increasing irrigation efficiency and reusing drainage water which has to be looked at for each specific location 8 water balance of the delta fig 4 provides a summary of the terms of the annual water balance reviewed above total inflow into the delta is 45bm3 including 42bm3 of nile water 1bm3 of rainfall a hypothetical net depletion of 1bm3 of groundwater plus 1bm3 of intrusion this last term however should not be computed as inflow and is merely pumped out to the sea the total of all diversions adding reuse volumes is around 63bm3 42bm3 of nile water 7 of groundwater and 14bm3 of official unofficial reuse with an average of 13bm3 minus 1bm3 consumed by aquaculture flushed out to sea the depleted fraction is 44 12 44 73 if we assume that a minimum outflow of 8bm3 must be ensured then only 4bm3 that is 9 of the water supplied could be made available for consumption by additional uses in other words this means that the nile delta system functions with an efficiency equivalent to 93 of its potential meaning that 31 10 44 93 of the water is consumed in either beneficial agricultural or municipal and industrial water m i 31 2bm3 or unavoidable processes 8bm3 to the lakes 2bm3 of water body evaporation this percentage is even higher if we consider the valley and the delta together because with the exception of the drainage water lost to sinks in fayoum 0 7bm3 all the return flow in the valley whether superficial or underground eventually reaches the nile river again of the say 57bm3 released by the dam plus 1bm3 of rainfall and 1bm3 of groundwater only 12 1 go to the sea 81 of water is consumed while potential savings 3bm3 make up only 5 of total releases a first observation is that this balance is not fundamentally different from that established in the late 1990s molden et al 1996 seckler 1996 because inflow and outflow terms have remained largely stable changes include substantial growth in the role and use of groundwater encroachment of urbanization on agricultural land higher consumption of water by m i expansion of aquaculture and more intensive intermediate and unofficial reuse the balance of the aquifer 1bm3 y is a key area of uncertainty and is not based here on hard science we merely reproduce the official wisdom that abstraction is close to infiltrations estimated at 6 7bm3 the lack of consistency in the data showing the movement of salinity isolines in the delta does not allow us to assume a higher net depletion of groundwater see morsy 2009 9 discussion where and how much water can be saved in the nile delta several interesting observations can first be made based on the data presented above on outflow to the sea a first drop from 14bm3 to 12bm3 took place between 1987 and 1989 a period of drought when lake nasser reached its minimum level usaid 2002 the outflow remained at this level until 1998 99 an exceptional year with 65bm3 release from had followed by four years with values over 60bm3 capmas 2007 fig 5 shows that years with a higher release tend to produce higher outflow to the sea although total outflow peaked at around 15bm3 between 1998 and 2002 it can be observed that the increase by about 3bm3 is far less than the increase in dam release it can be inferred that the delta and its associated new lands actually have the capacity to absorb and consume much more water than in an average year with say 56bm3 available this added capacity is roughly between 3 and 5bm3 a corollary from this conclusion is that in an average year some area must be undergoing a degree of stress even receiving no water at all as can be inferred from google earth with regard to some new lands see molle et al 2016 we lack adequately accurate and spatially disaggregated data on cropping areas and patterns on the reduction of groundwater use in areas with conjunctive use and on irrigation water supply to analyze the expansion of agriculture within the existing command area during these four excess years but it is possible that the increase in water availability was paralleled by an increase in the rice cultivation area which may have enhanced water consumption although rice has an effect on gross diversions in particular for land preparation rather than on consumption itself faostat data show that this is not the case since the 600 000ha level the plateau observed in recent years with some variations had already been reached in 1997 while the rice acreage increased by 50 in the period 1988 96 this was not reflected in the amount of drainage water drained out to sea which remained stable during that time this is a striking result which shows that the magnitude of the area cultivated with rice has little effect on the outflow to the sea this suggests that 1 either the et of rice is not substantially different from alternative crops 4 4 rice needs more water to ensure pounding water in the fields and also for land preparation but its consumption evapotranspiration is not very different from other cereals like maize especially because varieties with shorter cycle durations are now available 90days or 2 most of the drainage water comes from rice grown in the northern part of the delta which has not seen much change in terms of rice area conversely the expansion of rice possibly occurred mainly in upstream areas the return flow of which is partly re injected into the system what can we say more generally about changes in cultivated area the fao indicator on agricultural area shows growth from 2 46 to 3 75mha between 1984 and 2014 for egypt as a whole during the same period the harvested area of edible crops moved from 3 45 to 5 62 mha according to aquastat the area equipped for irrigation rose from 2 59mha in 1990 to 3 61mha in 2010 while the area effectively irrigated and harvested was 5 38mha in 1993 and 6 33 in 2010 5 5 http www fao org nr water aquastat countries regions egy capmas updates this value at 6 50mha for 2014 6 6 www capmas gov eg other reports provide different values such as mwri 2010 which reports a shift in harvested area from 4 69mha in 1985 to only 4 99mha in 1998 could the cultivated area be better estimated through remote sensing droogers et al 2009 and el desoky 2006 review various estimates of cropping areas by remote sensing and official reports and show stunning differences the net agricultural area is growing however remote sensing studies by shalaby and ali 2010 found that agricultural land in egypt grew by 14 1 between 1992 and 2000 with regard to the delta proper el desoky 2006 found agricultural areas of 3 52 4 15 and 4 75 million fed in 1972 1984 and 2003 respectively while elhag et al 2013 found that agricultural land including aquaculture had increased by 8 1 between 1984 and 2000 before dropping by 1 between 2000 and 2005 with a net decline in the cropping area of 1 1 if this decline during the first half of the 2000s is confirmed it may have been subsequently reversed according to hereher 2013 who found an increase from 5 10 to 5 51 million fed between 2003 and 2012 although promising remote sensing studies frequently present inconsistent data since issues of spatial resolution frequency of images or limited ground truthing still impair its performance the overall net growth in harvested areas occurs despite the phenomenon of land lost to urban expansion as early as the mid 1980s the annual loss in egypt was estimated at 45 000 feddan year mwri and usaid 1986 while the national plan mwri 2005 estimated that 10 000ha of old lands 42 000 fed were annually lost through urbanization the ministry of agriculture recently released a study showing that between 1974 and 2007 32 000 acres were lost each year on average increasing to 41 000 feddan between 2007 and 2010 al ahram 2017 ahramonline 2017 since the revolution several formal and informal sources report that this figure has multiplied by three despite some inconsistency in data the net increase in the cultivated area shows that land expansion has outpaced reduction through urbanization though the magnitude of this is uncertain as are the respective contributions of surface and groundwater the conclusion is that despite the net expansion of agriculture and despite the growing share of rice in the crop mix the amount of outflow to the sea and aquaculture has remained largely stable since 1985 at around 13bm3 with occasional higher values largely explained by higher releases from had fig 5 one would have expected that the net increase in cultivated harvested area in both the delta and the valley would cause greater et meaning less outflow to the sea the latter is the return flow of an irrigation process that has changed little in terms of technique although the gradual installation of subsurface drainage across the entire delta combined with the increase in rice cultivation must have worked to increase the drainage flow this trend may have been counterbalanced by lower per feddan water application and consumption on an expanding land and marginally by inland aquaculture 7 7 inland aquaculture has developed in the official irrigation command area it is illegal to use irrigation water for aquaculture but those farms largely abstract water from drains in areas where irrigation water is too uncertain to grow crops which has largely developed based on drainage water it is hard to disentangle these various and counteracting trends based on the available data the question remains as to where the increased water consumption has come from besides excess years such as those following 1998 possible answers are 1 deficit irrigation in some parts of the delta less water being distributed creating local water shortages 2 a depletion of the aquifer which may be affecting the prevailing balance between freshwater percolation and seawater intrusion but has not yet manifested itself in a clear way other than in the western delta 3 a reduction in crop requirements associated with a change in the crop mix not investigated in this paper for lack of data but unlikely to be substantial 4 an overestimation of cultivated areas 5 an increase in upward seepage in the north of the delta 8 8 this does not seem to be the case because the salt load pumped out to sea as calculated by dri and available in its yearbooks does not show any rising trend the crop mix is largely stable because a large area of the delta is dedicated to wheat and rice partly for home consumption bersim and maize for animals cotton and vegetables this basic crop mix is rather stable and cannot be altered dramatically the exception is perhaps the total rice area but even a drop from 1 500 000 to 700 000 fed affects only 10 of the delta with et consumption differences with regard to alternative crops that are in addition not huge for a given volume released from the had and a constant outflow real savings can also come from improved on farm practices that reduce soil evaporation and unproductive losses such as laser levelling lining of marwas quaternary ditches distribution of water through piped networks see molle et al 2015 mulching and raised beds karrou et al 2011 9 9 see www icarda org sites default files u158 science 20impact 20raised bed final pdf these measures have been and are being implemented by the malr and farmers but have not been systematized though limited opportunities remain to reduce non beneficial water consumption at the system level for example through the maintenance of drains in upper egypt which are clogged up with weeds preventing proper drainage and causing higher evaporation losses hegazy and nadr 1995 the reduction of return flows to lake qaroun the sink of drainage flows in fayoum the improvement of irrigation efficiency in parts of the new lands e g in nubaria and along the ismailia canal to avoid percolation to saline aquifers and or water logging the treatment of polluted water currently going to the sea because it cannot be taken up by reuse pump stations because return flows are partly recycled or needed to maintain an adequate salt balance in the system not mentioning to flush pollution improvements in plot level efficiency do not necessarily translate into gains at the system level although mwri well acknowledges the scale sensitive nature of water use efficiency this is not generally the case elsewhere egyptian newspapers frequently refer to alleged wastage of water resources some claiming that 12bm3 are wasted this lack of understanding of the situation is passed on to the public likewise it is announced that a drop in rice cultivation from 2 2 to 1 2 million feddan saved 6bm3 of water almasry alyoum 2010a while the target of 18 5 million cubic meters of recycled waste water is understood as an addition to the available resource almasry alyoum 2010b such misunderstandings can even lead to absurd projects such as the idea of conveying and distributing had waters through pipes on both sides of the nile with the promise of increasing the agricultural area by 7 million feddans al ahram hebdo 2013 dubbed the third egyptian irrigation revolution the sustainable agricultural development strategy towards 2030 developed in the late 2000s by the malr ardc 2009 had the ambition to improve water use efficiency from 50 to 80 by 2013 which would save quantities of water estimated at 5 3 and 12 4bm3 by the years 2017 and 2030 respectively and allow an expansion of 5 million feddan these are puzzling numbers since it is hard to imagine how a quantity of 12 4bm3 roughly the outflow to the sea could be relocated to new lands it would mean no water being allowed to reach the sea and a rapid collapse of the delta due to extreme concentrations of salts and pollution such efficiency targets 5 million feddan converted in 10 years which will contribute to the provision of 10bm3 of water are announced by some officials and spread by the media daily news egypt 2014 amwal al ghad 2015 such fanciful numbers fail to understand the difference between water use efficiency on the plot and in the system delta an issue that was identified and discussed as far back as the mid 1990s within the mwri 10 conclusions despite a variety of changes including an increase in groundwater abstraction and water reuse the expansion of new lands on both sides of the delta and on its northern fringe urbanization and land encroachment an increase in m i diversions and consumption and a slight expansion of aquaculture the overall delta balance has not dramatically altered in the past 35 years an uncertain point is the actual quantity of groundwater being abstracted by farmers in the delta while very clearly on the rise judging by the number of wells it is hard to assess in quantitative terms and also in terms of risks associated with an overall inland shift of salinity isolines as well as of local upconing phenomena the most striking conclusion is the relative stability of the outflow to the sea over the past 30 years the amount of water pumped out to sea considering aquaculture has basically remained around 12bm3 with higher values clearly associated with excess hydrologic years and higher releases from had the stability is extremely puzzling because neither the expansion of rice cultivation in the late 1980s early 1990s nor the overall net expansion of cultivated harvested areas seems to have had a significant effect on observed overall return flows reasons for this state of affairs are unclear but may include 1 deficit irrigation in some areas with losses in yields actual water consumption is lower than potential optimal values 2 overestimation of agricultural net expansion possibly partly due to insufficient consideration of agricultural land lost to urbanization confusion between equipped and effectively irrigated areas political interests in announcing the reclamation of new lands or the achievement of planned targets 3 a net depletion of groundwater stocks 4 changes in overall crop requirements due to a change in the crop mix associated in particular with shorter cycle durations and the decline of cotton production a factor not investigated in this report 5 underestimation of the amount of water reused after drainage pumping stations notably in gharbia drain and drain 1 2 and therefore overestimation of outflow to the sea 6 overestimation of volumes pumped out or drained to the sea because the downstream water levels and pump calibration are not monitored with adequate rigor frequency 7 an increase in upward seepage in the north of the delta one key point that should be restated is that rather than a lack of water per se local shortages are principally due to management difficulties with a peak demand in summer that exceeds canal capacity and disrupts the traditional rotation system iwmi and wmri 2013 water reuse does not add water to the delta but it does inject drainage water in locations where supply is insufficient thus it is chiefly a means of improving distribution and supply to specific locations in a complex and ramified system rice in particular is often seen as a great consumer of water while the preparation of the land does involve a peak in demand et in itself is not dramatically higher than for other crops especially with the wide adoption of varieties with 90 day duration the problem it poses to managers is its higher demand in terms of applied water which may exceed the physical capacity of the distribution system and disrupt rotations in addition half the current rice cropping area is essential to maintain a viable salt balance in the soils of the northern part of the delta a 3 4bm3 reduction in the outflow to the sea is an ambitious target in itself there are benefits in reducing return flows through improving efficiency at the plot level although this is not true in all parts of the delta particularly where return flows are recycled because their quality will be degraded such an overall reduction would mean that farmer demand in terms of gross abstraction would be reduced easing distribution at the secondary and main distribution levels the main potential for this lies in improving farm level irrigation practices which include a number of technical options that have been and are being considered by the marl in particular laser levelling and raised beds gains at the irrigation system level are harder to achieve studies have shown that spillage at the end of secondary canals has already been dramatically reduced if not nullified and the complexity and nature of the irrigation network have so far resisted attempts at modernisation such as the introduction of continuous flow see iwmi and wmri 2013 and molle et al 2015 yet some potential exists in the fayoum or the new lands where return flows often go to sinks all in all the current efficiency of the delta is 93 of its estimated potential considering the water consumed by both productive and unavoidable processes and possible improvements would overall affect around 4 of the resource spatial and temporal distribution of the resource however remains a central management challenge another key conclusion is that the confusion between plot level and system level irrigation efficiencies still fuels unqualified media releases and overoptimistic and sometimes absurd policies claims that 10 or 12bm3 of water can be saved are simply nonsensical last it must be reiterated that a finer analysis of the balance is probably not possible due to uncertainty in most of the variables that need to be assessed this speaks to the need to strengthen data collection and analysis but also to the sheer complexity of the system under consideration acknowledgements this research has been conducted with funding from aciar australia under project n lwr 2011 045 titled management of water and salinity in the nile delta 
11587,the nile delta and its 2 27 million ha of irrigated land makes up two thirds of egypt s agricultural land it is also the terminal part of a river basin that spans and feeds 11 countries increases in dam and irrigation development in upstream parts of the basin is poised to conflict with agricultural expansion and population growth in egypt understanding where and how waters comes into and leaves the delta is therefore a crucial question for the future of the country this paper revisits the surface and groundwater balances of the delta emphasizes the additional relevance of drainage water reuse and of the salt balance and evidences a relative stability of the outflow to the sea over the past 30 years various reasons for such a phenomenon and the scope for saving water are explored and discussed the confusion between plot level and delta level efficiency and the relatively limited gains possible are emphasized beyond the overall water balance and quantitative issues water management in the delta remains a complex task of spatially distributing the resource over a complex ramified network finally limitations in the analysis related to data availability and accuracy are emphasized keywords water balance salt balance water reuse irrigation efficiency nile delta egypt 1 introduction the nile delta is the terminal part of a 3 17 million km2 wide river basin that spans 11 countries before joining the mediterranean sea in egypt nile waters are diverted to irrigate 5 36 million hectares mha of land basin wide of which 3 4mha are to be found in egypt fao 2011 and around 2 27mha in the nile delta proper malr 2011 in egypt 55 of the population are dependent on the agricultural sector for their livelihood a sector that accounts for about 15 of a gross domestic product gdp of us 232 billion and close to one third of total employment fao 2000 a dense network of waterways dissects the nile delta including 40 000km of canals that branch off the nile river and convey water to over 2 million farmers across several nested geographical scales and institutional levels van achthoven et al 2004 intermingled with these conveyance canals are 18 000km of drains where water is partially both reused by farmers and pumped back to higher level delivery canals and eventually conveyed to coastal lakes and the sea as agriculture is the main user of water in egypt accounting for 85 of national demand the question of irrigation water use efficiency over a range of scales i e from on farm to basin is key to satisfying growing non agricultural needs and possibly to expanding agriculture to provide livelihood opportunities for egypt s rural population indeed increasing the efficiency productivity and equity of water use and management at all levels while conserving the resource base are the most salient objectives of both the national water resources plan 2017 mwri 2005 and the government of egypt s strategy for sustainable agricultural development 2030 ardc 2009 any discussion of the potential for increasing efficiency and how to achieve this is eventually linked to the question of the overall water availability in other words this starts with understanding how much water enters the nile delta how it is then distributed how much is drained to the sea and whether and how this amount can be reduced to free up water for other consumptive uses such knowledge is critically in demand at a time when egypt s water supply is threatened by dam and irrigation development in the upper part of the nile basin while its own needs increase this paper offers a general discussion of the delta water balance within the constraints associated with the limited availability and accuracy of data we review sequentially the various terms of the water balance then discuss the importance of associated salt balances while the relative stability of the outflow to the sea observed over the past 30 years leads us to discuss how this is compatible with known changes in supply and demand the conclusion emphasizes possible reasons for a stable outflow the limitations associated with the large uncertainty in most terms of the water balance and the limited means and scope for improving overall efficiency of water use in the delta 2 inflow to the delta 2 1 rainfall rainfall varies from 250mm on the north western coast to 50mm in cairo its contribution to the delta water balance is taken by irg 1998 to be 0 8 billion cubic meters bm3 we rely here on an average rounded up value of 1bm3 2 2 nile river the quantity of water that reaches the delta depends on how much has been released from the high aswan dam had and how much has been consumed for human and agricultural purposes along the nile valley this second term varies with cropping patterns but is relatively stable since all return flows end up back in the river with the exception of those in the fayoum which end up in a sink the qaraoun lake releases from had depend on the run off received by the dam but its high capacity has in general allowed managers to even out variations and average releases are estimated to be around 57bm3 y el atfy et al 2009 gohar and ward 2010 el kassar 1991 capmas 2007 this is slightly more than the official quota of 55 5bm3 partly because sudan is not taking its full share and partly due to favorable hydrological conditions in the late 2000s data on the total inflow to the delta for the period 2008 2012 indicate values between 38 3 and 47 4bm3 representing a substantial variation of over 9bm3 between 2008 and 2010 dri 2013 we rely here on an average inflow of 42bm3 3 groundwater use and balance 3 1 aquifer recharge the quaternary aquifer of the delta is semi confined as its top is covered by a thin clay layer whose thickness varies from 5m in the south to 20m in the middle and 50m in the north of the delta while disappearing in some places mabrouk et al 2013 depths to groundwater range between 1 and 2m in the north 3 4m in the middle and 5m in the south ibid deep percolation from excess irrigation water and seepage from the river branches notably the rosetta branch canals and drains in the southern and middle parts of the nile delta recharge the aquifer while there is some upward seepage in the northern part of the delta kashef 1983 sefelnasr and sherif 2013 the nubaria canal west and ismailia canal east that run along the fringes of the delta have substantial infiltrations enhanced by lighter soils and widening operations that disrupt the clay deposited in these canals african water facility 2007 downward leakage towards the aquifer due to water used for irrigation and canal infiltration has been estimated at between 0 25 and 0 80mm day in the central and southern parts of the delta dri 1989 nofal et al 2015 these values are associated with a total recharge rate by infiltration of 6 78bm3 y fao 2013 mabrouk et al 2013 mohamed and hua 2010 a value already used in the 1980s e g kashef 1983 however this key term of the water balance is extremely difficult to measure or estimate and is not known with much accuracy groundwater modeling studies generally neglect the contribution of rainfall with an average between 25 and 200mm year to recharge since it is very small compared to the recharge rate mabrouk et al 2013 additionally there is no data available for the inflow from the valley part of the nile aquifer it is therefore not considered here groundwater in the delta is not a separate or additional resource and is directly fed by surface water brought by the nile river 3 2 aquifer discharge groundwater discharge from the nile delta aquifer takes place in different indirect and direct ways through seepage to waterways drains and in some parts canals seepage to water bodies and evapotranspiration inter aquifer flow outflow to the sea and direct groundwater abstraction through wells 3 2 1 outflow to lateral aquifers outflow of the nile delta aquifer occurs towards the moghra aquifer along the fringe of the western nile delta with a transfer estimated by rigw iwaco 1990 between 50 and 100mm3 year because of the depletion of the moghra aquifer it is likely that this value has dramatically increased we have tentatively considered here a value of 100mm3 3 2 2 outflow to waterways and evapotranspiration in the northern fringe of the delta the aquifer is semi confined and subject to upward seepage groundwater is discharged to the relatively incised drainage system but also to canals during the off turn of water distribution some seepage of very saline water can be observed and this has to be flushed away at the beginning of the next on period before farmers can use the water some water also makes its way to the soil and the crop roots contributing to plot evapotranspiration in official water balances this contribution intrusion to both waterways and et is sometimes taken at 1 or 2bm3 oosterban 1999 mwri 2002 or disregarded altogether we may use the overall salt balance of the delta to estimate the order of magnitude of this contribution in rounded up values the amount of salt released by the aswan dam is roughly 11 million t 55bm3 0 2g l while the amount released to the sea is around 36 million t 12bm3 3g l this means that approximately 25 million tons of salt are brought up from saline aquifers in the semi confined part of the delta and residual soil salinity in the western delta dri s yearbook data show that the main salt flushing point corresponds to the drains coming from western new lands and that around one third of the total around 8 million tons can be attributed to the new lands we can estimate the corresponding volume of upward seepage with a rough calculation the salinity in drains near the lakes and seashore is around 3 10g l and includes a mix of drainage water at around 1g l and upward seepage taken tentatively here at 15g l on average 1 1 maps provided by morsy 2009 or fao 2013 show a large spatial variability of this value maps are often drawn based on the interpolation of very few points when it comes to the northern part of the delta this value is indicative of an average for the irrigated area undergoing upward groundwater seepage in order to account for 17 million t of salt 25 8 this upward seepage with an average salinity of 15g l has to amount to 1 1bm3 a significant value we rely here on a rounded value of 1bm3 3 2 3 outflow to the sea the question of how much groundwater ends up in the sea is difficult because answers that can be obtained through modeling are contingent upon a physical description of the aquifer itself and knowledge of the spatial distribution of both recharge and abstraction needless to say current knowledge on all these complex elements remains somewhat crude zeidan 2016 reports that in 1980 an extensive study was conducted to evaluate the safe yield of the nile delta aquifer and that the annual outflow of freshwater to the sea was estimated at 0 97bm3 for the west delta mohamed and hua 2010 have found a deficit of 0 14mm3 y in the aquifer which is promoting seawater intrusion abstraction of groundwater in the eastern delta is much more limited because its quality is in general degraded this maintains groundwater at a rather high level with instances of waterlogging and a net positive outflow to the sea khalil et al 2015 recent research has found that groundwater intrudes from the sea to the nile delta aquifer 0 56bm3 y at intermediate depths as well as flowing from the aquifer towards the sea 0 14bm3 y at deeper depths prompting the conclusion that overall the nile delta aquifer is not losing fresh groundwater flux to the sea nofal et al 2015 considering that this term of the balance is in all cases of a minor magnitude we have taken it here arbitrarily at 0 this is consistent with the fact that salinity isolines have not yet been substantially altered in past decades morsy 2009 3 2 4 abstraction by pumping groundwater abstraction by wells in the delta has consistently increased if judged by the number of wells inventoried from 5600 wells in 1952 to 13 000 in 1991 22 905 in 2011 11 120 wells in the west delta 2887 in the central delta and 8898 in the eastern delta mwri 2013 and finally 32 054 agricultural wells in 2016 zeidan 2016 mwri 2016 conjunctive use of surface and groundwater is now widely practiced by farmers especially during periods of peak irrigation demands groundwater is abstracted in the southern part of the delta underlain as it is by a non confined aquifer with water tables only a few meters below ground level north of a line that can be taken more or less as the 1g l or 1000ppm salinity isoline groundwater is too saline to be used and the soil has a thicker cap of clay but percolation of water in the old delta also benefits lateral areas where the aquifer is unconfined and where intensive use of groundwater has developed most notably in the western delta and along the nubaria canal the density of individual wells in the delta and why how and when they are used by farmers is an under researched topic a recent survey in an area of 30 000ha north east of tanta shed light on groundwater use dynamics el agha et al 2015a 2017 a total of 1815 wells were identified giving an average density of one well 16ha but with values locally reaching one well 2ha if we extrapolate the average density of wells found in the study area 1815 wells for 30 000ha to the roughly 60 of the delta 0 6 2 mha where wells are found we obtain a number of wells of around 73 000 this does not include the delta s fringes notably on the western side where overall groundwater abstraction is roughly as high as in the old delta rigw 2001 at this stage it is not possible to ascertain whether such an extrapolation is acceptable but multiple field observations in the eastern delta near zagazig and in the southern part of the central delta showed that a high number of wells can also be found there this order of magnitude is about twice higher than the number of wells found in 2016 22 905 as with individual pumping from drains it is very hard to derive quantitative estimates as to how much water is sourced from the aquifer from a total of 0 2bm3 y in 1952 2 77bm3 in 1991 and 3 5bm3 in 2003 zeidan 2016 abstraction reached 4 9bm3 in 2008 according to morsy 2009 recent updates mwri 2016 put agricultural overall abstraction at 5 89bm3 with 4 39 0 55 and 0 95bm3 for the west 2 2 the higher value for the western part of the delta is due to the conjunctive use that has developed in the new lands of the western delta central and east delta respectively we consider here a value of 7bm3 for domestic industrial and agricultural use in most official reports the values of both percolation around 6 7bm3 and abstraction are considered to be roughly equal hypothesizing that the delta aquifer is in a balanced state this is convenient shorthand for the recognition that neither of those two terms is actually known with a satisfactory degree of accuracy 4 outflow by evaporation and evapotranspiration 4 1 evaporation from water bodies the evaporation of all waterways and other water bodies is conventionally taken at 3bm3 in most studies for the whole nile system had not included e g mwri 2005 a value of 2bm3 is considered here for the delta alone 4 2 evaporation through domestic and industrial use according to recent estimates the industrial sector is diverting 5 4bm3 noureddin 2016 of which 1 8bm3 are consumed while the rest is returned to the system the share for the delta plus cairo is 1 2bm3 likewise domestic use incurs a consumption of 3 18bm3 of the 11 3bm3 diverted with a share of 2bm3 for the delta and cairo 4 3 plot evapotranspiration irrigated agriculture the evaporation of irrigated crops in the nile delta is of course the main term of the water balance contrary to what might be expected this term is not easy to estimate based on land use agronomic and climatic data the first difficulty relates to the very extent of agriculture itself the ministry of agriculture and land reclamation malr provides some yearly estimates of cultivated areas that often differ from those used by the mwri cultivated areas in the core nile delta are known to a certain extent but are modified each year due in particular to the encroachment of urbanization into agricultural areas of which more later the situation is less certain concerning agriculture in the new lands a large part of which has been based on groundwater in recent years it is also often unclear whether data refer to equipped command areas or actual cultivated areas in many areas there is often a significant difference between these values because a portion of the land is left uncultivated for a number of reasons poor soil poor access to roads salinity insufficient water supply etc which is well illustrated by the situation at the downstream end of the nubaria canal hamam canal and extension while some equipped areas are not being cultivated a lot of uncontrolled horizontal expansion and informal reclamation occurs along the valley and the margins of the delta see barnes 2012 sims 2015 uncontrolled horizontal expansion is very difficult to quantify but estimates in 2010 put it at 361 000 fed 36 of which in the delta and the rest in upper middle egypt mwri 2013 google earth provides stunning images of the expansion of this largely uncontrolled and even less monitored irrigation over the past 15 years see molle et al 2016 the areas irrigated either by surface or groundwater or both are not known accurately in addition to the total area itself comes the issue of cropping patterns here there is also significant divergence between the areas as considered by the malr and mwri particularly regarding the extent of rice cultivation farmers frequently divide their small plots into several smaller sections with different crops and monitoring aggregating this information is a herculean task the facts that cropping calendars are not uniform and are staggered over several months for a given crop and that for each type of crop there are several varieties with various cycle durations make it even harder to ascertain crop requirements based on estimated cropping patterns and calendars in the particular case of bersim egyptian clover farmers may vary the length of the cultivation period and the number of cuts based on their choice of cropping patterns and rotations last but not least there is no agreement on crop based water requirements the malr and mwri formed a working group that has been attempting to settle the issue for more than 10 years but has yet to reach a conclusion and this tells nothing about the efficiency coefficients of water conveyance and application at the tertiary and plot levels that need to be known to estimate gross water requirements iwmi and wmri 2013 have shown that official reports and technical studies present or use widely varying values of et and net or gross water requirements this is not specific to egypt but confirms that estimating theoretical crop requirements is not as easy or accurate as many would like to believe an alternative is to use satellite imagery and energy balances to estimate total evapotranspiration the accuracy of remote sensing data varies depending on several factors such as crop type and crop development stage and also the number of samples used for matching actual field data and remote sensing interpretations this approach is interesting in terms of identifying spatial contrasts at a given point in time between areas with high and low et but has its limitations when it comes to estimating absolute et values see droogers et al 2009 who found variations of up to 31 on delta et estimated by two different reports using remote sensing one such exercise simonneaux and adrabou 2010 has estimated et for the delta 2 6mha at 30bm3 in practice and in this paper actual et is often estimated as the closing term of the water balance for the entire nile delta and valley system estimates of total et in the literature vary between 36 and 41bm3 4 4 pond evaporation aquaculture having developed mainly in an informal manner the aquaculture found along the northern fringe of the delta is not usually computed together with agriculture this is also due to the fact that a large part of this aquaculture diverts drainage outflows after the terminal pump stations that lift drainage water to flush it to the sea or coastal lakes as a result they are not considered part of the official command area of the mwri the volumes used will have to be deducted from the computed outflow to the sea this aquaculture has developed into one of the largest such inland areas in the world estimated at 300 000 fed roughly 120 000ha rounded to 100 000ha to deduct aquaculture that developed within irrigation areas most fishpond owners do not raise fish during winter but some cultivate wheat or barley in rotation with fish however all ponds evaporate as open water bodies during the rest of the year if we assume an order of magnitude of 1m of evaporation during this period we can estimate the consumption of water in aquaculture at around 1bm3 5 drainage water reuse drainage water from irrigated fields is re injected into the distribution system at different locations in the nile delta this reuse substantially increases the overall efficiency of the delta water use however it is a process that merely facilitates water distribution across a long ramified and complex network reuse adds water locally and is therefore very important for local managers but it does not add water to the delta per se and therefore does not alter the overall macro level water balance we nevertheless briefly describe the various means through which water is reused in the nile delta since it is relevant to the salt balance of the delta 5 1 official water reuse drainage water reuse is a constitutive feature of the nile delta the upper central part of the delta for example is able to drain back into the rosetta branch from which drainage water mixes with nile water and is further distributed to downstream areas the mwri has long been constructing pump stations which abstract water from main drains at locations where they cross or come close to main canals and even branches of the nile drainage water is therefore lifted and re injected into the distribution system unfortunately this system has been challenged by the degraded water quality in many drains which does not always allow it to be re injected into canals especially when these convey water that is used downstream for domestic purposes this is the case for example on the main drain leading to the edku lake and on the omoum drain where several pump stations to divert drainage water to nearby new lands in nubaria were installed but never used as well as along the ismailia canal van achthoven et al 2004 by 2005 app 2005 only half of the 29 reuse pump stations that had been installed were functioning well or with only minor problems as a result of pollution the idea of reuse has been extended to secondary drains which with possible exceptions when these are collecting wastewater from nearby industries or a medium sized city still have reasonably good water quality this so called intermediate reuse has been extensively developed in the northern part of the delta in recent years often in response to local water shortages and public complaints iwmi and wmri 2013 in the lower meet yazid canal command area for example there are as many as 25 pump stations with a combined pumping capacity equivalent to roughly 25 of the discharge in the main irrigation canal iwmi and wmri 2013 these stations and their use however are not well inventoried and computed we take main official reuse which varied around 6 7bm3 over the past ten years el sayed 2011 dri 2015 at 8bm3 to account for some underestimation of return flows by gravity see molle et al 2016 and tentatively 2bm3 for intermediate reuse 5 2 informal drainage water reuse like the government individual or groups of farmers have long identified and implemented the idea of sourcing water from nearby drains according to ritzema 2009 this unofficial reuse was estimated in the 2000s to be between 2 8bm3 and 4 4bm3 per year although officially prohibited by the state it is tolerated as a response to the government s failure to supply adequate water for agriculture to our knowledge there has been no recent systematic assessment of informal drainage water reuse we have undertaken a survey to estimate the number of individual pump stations abstracting water from main and secondary drains in the meet yazid canal command area which roughly totals 100 000ha we recorded the location of individual pumps through field surveys along main and secondary drains and estimated the number of pumps at around 2500 molle et al 2016 as expected there was a very high density of pumps in the downstream half of the command area in contrast the secondary drains of the upstream part have few if any pumps it must be noted that the survey did not consider drainage water reuse from tertiary drains in some water short areas this reuse can be considerable for example the monitoring of a collective pump station in the abu mustafa canal area has shown that the command area of 44ha is also supplied by a total of 25 individual pumps that abstract water from tertiary drains unpublished data it is difficult to assess the amount of water effectively mobilized by individual reuse strategies while the number of pumps observed in the northern part of the area is impressive a large proportion of them are used only occasionally in summer we work here with a hypothetical volume of 4bm3 in line with the estimates mentioned above 6 outflow to the sea 6 1 outflow through nile river branches seckler and altaf 1997 have observed a clear reduction of the nile rosetta and damietta branches outflow to the sea from a value of 6 2bm3 in 1980 to 3 9bm3 in 1990 and 1 7bm3 in 1996 this amount of water released annually to the sea for navigation has been reduced from around 1 2bm3 in 1992 to only 0 3bm3 in 1996 by virtue of the staggering of the winter closure attia 1996 each branch of the nile rosetta and damietta is closed by a dam located near its respective estuary but locks allow for navigation what is lost to the sea through the two branches is now estimated at around 0 2bm3 year mwri 2005 6 2 outflow of drainage water where and how then does nile water flow out to the sea it is not well understood by the general public that 1 the main waterways and coastal lakes connecting the delta to the sea are closed by regulators with few exceptions and 2 that 90 of the drainage water volker 1979 must be lifted over a height of approximately 2 5m by pump stations constructed in parallel to these regulators the need for such regulators is to prevent sea water intrusion inland and to allow pump stations to lower water levels in irrigated lands both in the drains and in the soil which otherwise would be roughly at sea level a total of 53 pumping stations pump out drainage water to either the sea coastal lakes or from secondary drainage areas to main drains the ministry periodically calibrates the pumps to establish curves indicating actual discharge depending on the head height between downstream and upstream water levels operation times are recorded and used to calculate the monthly volumes pumped out to the sea at each station when aggregated these data provide an estimate of how much water is released to the sea fig 1 shows the main pumping stations and fig 2 the historical evolution of total drainage outflow and reveals an unexpected relative stability this is discussed later the importance of the quantitative estimation of drainage outflow to the sea raises questions around the data and the methodology used for this estimation first pumps are reportedly calibrated each year and declining efficiencies and discharges are therefore monitored if and when this is not the case the volumes pumped might be slightly overestimated because of the general downward trend in pump efficiency second there are questions about data on water levels and operation times the calculation of discharges factors in the head difference between downstream and upstream water levels those levels are recorded in books but values tend to be constant the upstream level being more or less the target level in the drain while downstream levels are considered less important and measures are less consistent el agha et al 2015b have monitored the pump stations on main drains 7 and 8 central part of the delta in 2004 and 2015 and showed that for drain 7 downstream levels in particular are not noted down accurately and tend to be lower than the value indicated by sensors installed in summer 2014 to monitor water levels the actual pumping head is therefore higher than the value assumed meaning that the volumes pumped are overestimated it is not possible to extend this conclusion to the other pump stations in the delta there is also a need to better account for the cultivated and fishpond areas located between the pump stations and the sea these areas divert part of the drainage water and consume it productively this includes the 1bm3 assumed earlier as consumption in fishponds and possibly some additional agricultural areas some areas are supplied by gravity from the terminal reaches of the main drains e g gharbia or main drain 1 in the central delta and estimating diversions is not easy 7 aspects of the salt balance water dynamics in the delta and the corresponding quantitative mass balance cannot be evaluated without a corresponding analysis of the salt balance depending on water management practices salt may accumulate in both the soil and specific drains which may impair agriculture and prevent conjunctive use fig 3 shows the spatial variability of drain water salinity in the meet yazid canal command area in summer iwmi and wmri 2013 the greater part of the upstream command area of meet yazid has a drainage water salinity under 1400μmhos 3 3 1000μmhos 1 mmhos millimhos 640mg l orppm 0 64g l with the exception of an area near matboul where salinity is between 1400 and 2500μmhos this is a low lying area which actually has to be drained by a large scale pump station medium salinity is observed on the western part in the w10 area which can be explained by the fact that this area is predominantly fed with drainage water from the nashart drain which has higher salinity the figure indicates a growing salinity as one moves northward until the moheet drain that defines the limit of the agricultural area the ghabat and halafy drains to the east exhibit a clear pattern of growing salinity as one moves northward indicating a south north gradient of soil salinity compatible with the fact that historically flooding impoundment and seawater influence were more pronounced and prolonged towards the sea the fact that these drains generate water with salinity approximately 4 times higher than in the upstream part of the canal command area indicates that deeper groundwater is constantly pushed upwards by the semi artesian conditions of the aquifer in the northern part of the delta this groundwater not only carries the salts accumulated in the soil profile upwards but is also affected by underground seawater intrusion the lower the elevation of the ground to the north the higher the effect drains and even canals intercept this upward seepage of salty water iwmi and wmri 2013 the results for winter 2014 15 show that the average ec of drainage water was 3033μmhos in winter against 2333μmhos in summer an increase of 33 limited to the downstream area because upstream has a mostly even and good drainage salinity level this is due to the fact that the amounts of irrigation and drainage water decrease in winter compared with the summer season when rice is cultivated additionally lower average levels in canals and drains promote the drainage of deeper soil layers which have a higher salt content this generation of salt in the northern part of the delta is responsible for the well known fact that the salt mass flushed down to the sea through the pumping station is almost three times larger than the salt mass brought into the delta by the nile river itself roest 1999 zhu et al 1996 as seen above section 3 2 2 there are several issues associated with the generation of salts in the drains of the nile delta the first is local and concerns those drains in the northern fringe that have high salinity but are also used by farmers to complement failing irrigation water should the irrigation efficiency in these areas be substantially improved the resulting decrease in return flows would translate into a proportional increase in salt concentration this would further limit the opportunity for farmers to rely occasionally on drainage water or would increase the impact of salt on yields this constraint does not apply to upstream areas where the phenomenon of increasing drainage water salinity would still keep the quality of this water within a range suitable for downstream reuse the second issue refers to the aquaculture that thrives on the drainage water generated in the highly saline northern drains and which could potentially be threatened by an increase in salinity whether due to increased upward seepage or improved irrigation efficiency fortunately this turns out not to be the case since the type of aquaculture found in these areas for example those around lake burullus can readily stand much more saline water than is the case at present dickson 2014 and would not be affected by possible changes in the salt balance of the delta the situation is less clear however with regard to the ecology and fisheries of the lakes themselves drainage water helps maintain a favorable salt balance in the lakes for fish production which according to abdel dayem et al 2007 should remain between 5500 and 6250μmhos likewise irg 1998 have estimated that to maintain an adequate environmental flow to the lakes a minimum volume of 8 5bm3 is needed in addition through percolation of water in ponds coastal aquaculture positively contributes to preventing seawater intrusion the third issue is regional and concerns the role of rice cultivation in salt management as a result of the upwelling of saline groundwater in the northern fringe of the delta lands that were reclaimed in the 1960s and 1970s need periodic leaching in practice rice cultivation and aquaculture are the only practical ways to do this kotb et al 2000 farmers in the area report a need to grow rice at least once every two sometimes three years to maintain an acceptable level of salinity in the soil of their plot this area covers around 310 000ha that is around 760 000 feddan molle et al 2016 a value very close to the conventional wisdom that 700 000 feddan of rice should be cultivated in order to control salinity intrusion el kady and molden 1995 mwri 2005 since around twice that amount of rice is cultivated in the delta it currently represents a far larger area than environmental conditions dictate a fourth issue is the impact of drainage water salinity on reuse as discussed earlier a total of around 8 2bm3 of drainage water is tapped by gravity or pumping at different points in the system to augment supply to specific areas the common practice in egypt is to mix drainage water with fresh water so that the resulting salinity would be around 1g l abdel dayem et al 2007 there is difficulty retrieving good quality drainage water due to its spatial and temporal variability according to el atfy et al 2009 a third of the drainage outflow to the sea has acceptable salinity for irrigation of tolerant crops and halophytes as mentioned earlier however pollution constitutes a constraint that in many cases prevents reuse even where salinity does not if the salt concentration in the drains increases because of a reduced return flow then a lower portion of drainage water will be usable if current irrigation with say 50 efficiency is improved to 66 then return flows will be reduced from one half to one third meaning that the salinity of drainage water concentration will be multiplied by 1 5 at the same time less water applied at the farm level would allow more to be distributed to downstream areas which would in turn have less need to pump from drains this would not be the case however where shortages are due to a lack of canal capacity in the face of an overextended rice area this identifies an important and complex trade off between increasing irrigation efficiency and reusing drainage water which has to be looked at for each specific location 8 water balance of the delta fig 4 provides a summary of the terms of the annual water balance reviewed above total inflow into the delta is 45bm3 including 42bm3 of nile water 1bm3 of rainfall a hypothetical net depletion of 1bm3 of groundwater plus 1bm3 of intrusion this last term however should not be computed as inflow and is merely pumped out to the sea the total of all diversions adding reuse volumes is around 63bm3 42bm3 of nile water 7 of groundwater and 14bm3 of official unofficial reuse with an average of 13bm3 minus 1bm3 consumed by aquaculture flushed out to sea the depleted fraction is 44 12 44 73 if we assume that a minimum outflow of 8bm3 must be ensured then only 4bm3 that is 9 of the water supplied could be made available for consumption by additional uses in other words this means that the nile delta system functions with an efficiency equivalent to 93 of its potential meaning that 31 10 44 93 of the water is consumed in either beneficial agricultural or municipal and industrial water m i 31 2bm3 or unavoidable processes 8bm3 to the lakes 2bm3 of water body evaporation this percentage is even higher if we consider the valley and the delta together because with the exception of the drainage water lost to sinks in fayoum 0 7bm3 all the return flow in the valley whether superficial or underground eventually reaches the nile river again of the say 57bm3 released by the dam plus 1bm3 of rainfall and 1bm3 of groundwater only 12 1 go to the sea 81 of water is consumed while potential savings 3bm3 make up only 5 of total releases a first observation is that this balance is not fundamentally different from that established in the late 1990s molden et al 1996 seckler 1996 because inflow and outflow terms have remained largely stable changes include substantial growth in the role and use of groundwater encroachment of urbanization on agricultural land higher consumption of water by m i expansion of aquaculture and more intensive intermediate and unofficial reuse the balance of the aquifer 1bm3 y is a key area of uncertainty and is not based here on hard science we merely reproduce the official wisdom that abstraction is close to infiltrations estimated at 6 7bm3 the lack of consistency in the data showing the movement of salinity isolines in the delta does not allow us to assume a higher net depletion of groundwater see morsy 2009 9 discussion where and how much water can be saved in the nile delta several interesting observations can first be made based on the data presented above on outflow to the sea a first drop from 14bm3 to 12bm3 took place between 1987 and 1989 a period of drought when lake nasser reached its minimum level usaid 2002 the outflow remained at this level until 1998 99 an exceptional year with 65bm3 release from had followed by four years with values over 60bm3 capmas 2007 fig 5 shows that years with a higher release tend to produce higher outflow to the sea although total outflow peaked at around 15bm3 between 1998 and 2002 it can be observed that the increase by about 3bm3 is far less than the increase in dam release it can be inferred that the delta and its associated new lands actually have the capacity to absorb and consume much more water than in an average year with say 56bm3 available this added capacity is roughly between 3 and 5bm3 a corollary from this conclusion is that in an average year some area must be undergoing a degree of stress even receiving no water at all as can be inferred from google earth with regard to some new lands see molle et al 2016 we lack adequately accurate and spatially disaggregated data on cropping areas and patterns on the reduction of groundwater use in areas with conjunctive use and on irrigation water supply to analyze the expansion of agriculture within the existing command area during these four excess years but it is possible that the increase in water availability was paralleled by an increase in the rice cultivation area which may have enhanced water consumption although rice has an effect on gross diversions in particular for land preparation rather than on consumption itself faostat data show that this is not the case since the 600 000ha level the plateau observed in recent years with some variations had already been reached in 1997 while the rice acreage increased by 50 in the period 1988 96 this was not reflected in the amount of drainage water drained out to sea which remained stable during that time this is a striking result which shows that the magnitude of the area cultivated with rice has little effect on the outflow to the sea this suggests that 1 either the et of rice is not substantially different from alternative crops 4 4 rice needs more water to ensure pounding water in the fields and also for land preparation but its consumption evapotranspiration is not very different from other cereals like maize especially because varieties with shorter cycle durations are now available 90days or 2 most of the drainage water comes from rice grown in the northern part of the delta which has not seen much change in terms of rice area conversely the expansion of rice possibly occurred mainly in upstream areas the return flow of which is partly re injected into the system what can we say more generally about changes in cultivated area the fao indicator on agricultural area shows growth from 2 46 to 3 75mha between 1984 and 2014 for egypt as a whole during the same period the harvested area of edible crops moved from 3 45 to 5 62 mha according to aquastat the area equipped for irrigation rose from 2 59mha in 1990 to 3 61mha in 2010 while the area effectively irrigated and harvested was 5 38mha in 1993 and 6 33 in 2010 5 5 http www fao org nr water aquastat countries regions egy capmas updates this value at 6 50mha for 2014 6 6 www capmas gov eg other reports provide different values such as mwri 2010 which reports a shift in harvested area from 4 69mha in 1985 to only 4 99mha in 1998 could the cultivated area be better estimated through remote sensing droogers et al 2009 and el desoky 2006 review various estimates of cropping areas by remote sensing and official reports and show stunning differences the net agricultural area is growing however remote sensing studies by shalaby and ali 2010 found that agricultural land in egypt grew by 14 1 between 1992 and 2000 with regard to the delta proper el desoky 2006 found agricultural areas of 3 52 4 15 and 4 75 million fed in 1972 1984 and 2003 respectively while elhag et al 2013 found that agricultural land including aquaculture had increased by 8 1 between 1984 and 2000 before dropping by 1 between 2000 and 2005 with a net decline in the cropping area of 1 1 if this decline during the first half of the 2000s is confirmed it may have been subsequently reversed according to hereher 2013 who found an increase from 5 10 to 5 51 million fed between 2003 and 2012 although promising remote sensing studies frequently present inconsistent data since issues of spatial resolution frequency of images or limited ground truthing still impair its performance the overall net growth in harvested areas occurs despite the phenomenon of land lost to urban expansion as early as the mid 1980s the annual loss in egypt was estimated at 45 000 feddan year mwri and usaid 1986 while the national plan mwri 2005 estimated that 10 000ha of old lands 42 000 fed were annually lost through urbanization the ministry of agriculture recently released a study showing that between 1974 and 2007 32 000 acres were lost each year on average increasing to 41 000 feddan between 2007 and 2010 al ahram 2017 ahramonline 2017 since the revolution several formal and informal sources report that this figure has multiplied by three despite some inconsistency in data the net increase in the cultivated area shows that land expansion has outpaced reduction through urbanization though the magnitude of this is uncertain as are the respective contributions of surface and groundwater the conclusion is that despite the net expansion of agriculture and despite the growing share of rice in the crop mix the amount of outflow to the sea and aquaculture has remained largely stable since 1985 at around 13bm3 with occasional higher values largely explained by higher releases from had fig 5 one would have expected that the net increase in cultivated harvested area in both the delta and the valley would cause greater et meaning less outflow to the sea the latter is the return flow of an irrigation process that has changed little in terms of technique although the gradual installation of subsurface drainage across the entire delta combined with the increase in rice cultivation must have worked to increase the drainage flow this trend may have been counterbalanced by lower per feddan water application and consumption on an expanding land and marginally by inland aquaculture 7 7 inland aquaculture has developed in the official irrigation command area it is illegal to use irrigation water for aquaculture but those farms largely abstract water from drains in areas where irrigation water is too uncertain to grow crops which has largely developed based on drainage water it is hard to disentangle these various and counteracting trends based on the available data the question remains as to where the increased water consumption has come from besides excess years such as those following 1998 possible answers are 1 deficit irrigation in some parts of the delta less water being distributed creating local water shortages 2 a depletion of the aquifer which may be affecting the prevailing balance between freshwater percolation and seawater intrusion but has not yet manifested itself in a clear way other than in the western delta 3 a reduction in crop requirements associated with a change in the crop mix not investigated in this paper for lack of data but unlikely to be substantial 4 an overestimation of cultivated areas 5 an increase in upward seepage in the north of the delta 8 8 this does not seem to be the case because the salt load pumped out to sea as calculated by dri and available in its yearbooks does not show any rising trend the crop mix is largely stable because a large area of the delta is dedicated to wheat and rice partly for home consumption bersim and maize for animals cotton and vegetables this basic crop mix is rather stable and cannot be altered dramatically the exception is perhaps the total rice area but even a drop from 1 500 000 to 700 000 fed affects only 10 of the delta with et consumption differences with regard to alternative crops that are in addition not huge for a given volume released from the had and a constant outflow real savings can also come from improved on farm practices that reduce soil evaporation and unproductive losses such as laser levelling lining of marwas quaternary ditches distribution of water through piped networks see molle et al 2015 mulching and raised beds karrou et al 2011 9 9 see www icarda org sites default files u158 science 20impact 20raised bed final pdf these measures have been and are being implemented by the malr and farmers but have not been systematized though limited opportunities remain to reduce non beneficial water consumption at the system level for example through the maintenance of drains in upper egypt which are clogged up with weeds preventing proper drainage and causing higher evaporation losses hegazy and nadr 1995 the reduction of return flows to lake qaroun the sink of drainage flows in fayoum the improvement of irrigation efficiency in parts of the new lands e g in nubaria and along the ismailia canal to avoid percolation to saline aquifers and or water logging the treatment of polluted water currently going to the sea because it cannot be taken up by reuse pump stations because return flows are partly recycled or needed to maintain an adequate salt balance in the system not mentioning to flush pollution improvements in plot level efficiency do not necessarily translate into gains at the system level although mwri well acknowledges the scale sensitive nature of water use efficiency this is not generally the case elsewhere egyptian newspapers frequently refer to alleged wastage of water resources some claiming that 12bm3 are wasted this lack of understanding of the situation is passed on to the public likewise it is announced that a drop in rice cultivation from 2 2 to 1 2 million feddan saved 6bm3 of water almasry alyoum 2010a while the target of 18 5 million cubic meters of recycled waste water is understood as an addition to the available resource almasry alyoum 2010b such misunderstandings can even lead to absurd projects such as the idea of conveying and distributing had waters through pipes on both sides of the nile with the promise of increasing the agricultural area by 7 million feddans al ahram hebdo 2013 dubbed the third egyptian irrigation revolution the sustainable agricultural development strategy towards 2030 developed in the late 2000s by the malr ardc 2009 had the ambition to improve water use efficiency from 50 to 80 by 2013 which would save quantities of water estimated at 5 3 and 12 4bm3 by the years 2017 and 2030 respectively and allow an expansion of 5 million feddan these are puzzling numbers since it is hard to imagine how a quantity of 12 4bm3 roughly the outflow to the sea could be relocated to new lands it would mean no water being allowed to reach the sea and a rapid collapse of the delta due to extreme concentrations of salts and pollution such efficiency targets 5 million feddan converted in 10 years which will contribute to the provision of 10bm3 of water are announced by some officials and spread by the media daily news egypt 2014 amwal al ghad 2015 such fanciful numbers fail to understand the difference between water use efficiency on the plot and in the system delta an issue that was identified and discussed as far back as the mid 1990s within the mwri 10 conclusions despite a variety of changes including an increase in groundwater abstraction and water reuse the expansion of new lands on both sides of the delta and on its northern fringe urbanization and land encroachment an increase in m i diversions and consumption and a slight expansion of aquaculture the overall delta balance has not dramatically altered in the past 35 years an uncertain point is the actual quantity of groundwater being abstracted by farmers in the delta while very clearly on the rise judging by the number of wells it is hard to assess in quantitative terms and also in terms of risks associated with an overall inland shift of salinity isolines as well as of local upconing phenomena the most striking conclusion is the relative stability of the outflow to the sea over the past 30 years the amount of water pumped out to sea considering aquaculture has basically remained around 12bm3 with higher values clearly associated with excess hydrologic years and higher releases from had the stability is extremely puzzling because neither the expansion of rice cultivation in the late 1980s early 1990s nor the overall net expansion of cultivated harvested areas seems to have had a significant effect on observed overall return flows reasons for this state of affairs are unclear but may include 1 deficit irrigation in some areas with losses in yields actual water consumption is lower than potential optimal values 2 overestimation of agricultural net expansion possibly partly due to insufficient consideration of agricultural land lost to urbanization confusion between equipped and effectively irrigated areas political interests in announcing the reclamation of new lands or the achievement of planned targets 3 a net depletion of groundwater stocks 4 changes in overall crop requirements due to a change in the crop mix associated in particular with shorter cycle durations and the decline of cotton production a factor not investigated in this report 5 underestimation of the amount of water reused after drainage pumping stations notably in gharbia drain and drain 1 2 and therefore overestimation of outflow to the sea 6 overestimation of volumes pumped out or drained to the sea because the downstream water levels and pump calibration are not monitored with adequate rigor frequency 7 an increase in upward seepage in the north of the delta one key point that should be restated is that rather than a lack of water per se local shortages are principally due to management difficulties with a peak demand in summer that exceeds canal capacity and disrupts the traditional rotation system iwmi and wmri 2013 water reuse does not add water to the delta but it does inject drainage water in locations where supply is insufficient thus it is chiefly a means of improving distribution and supply to specific locations in a complex and ramified system rice in particular is often seen as a great consumer of water while the preparation of the land does involve a peak in demand et in itself is not dramatically higher than for other crops especially with the wide adoption of varieties with 90 day duration the problem it poses to managers is its higher demand in terms of applied water which may exceed the physical capacity of the distribution system and disrupt rotations in addition half the current rice cropping area is essential to maintain a viable salt balance in the soils of the northern part of the delta a 3 4bm3 reduction in the outflow to the sea is an ambitious target in itself there are benefits in reducing return flows through improving efficiency at the plot level although this is not true in all parts of the delta particularly where return flows are recycled because their quality will be degraded such an overall reduction would mean that farmer demand in terms of gross abstraction would be reduced easing distribution at the secondary and main distribution levels the main potential for this lies in improving farm level irrigation practices which include a number of technical options that have been and are being considered by the marl in particular laser levelling and raised beds gains at the irrigation system level are harder to achieve studies have shown that spillage at the end of secondary canals has already been dramatically reduced if not nullified and the complexity and nature of the irrigation network have so far resisted attempts at modernisation such as the introduction of continuous flow see iwmi and wmri 2013 and molle et al 2015 yet some potential exists in the fayoum or the new lands where return flows often go to sinks all in all the current efficiency of the delta is 93 of its estimated potential considering the water consumed by both productive and unavoidable processes and possible improvements would overall affect around 4 of the resource spatial and temporal distribution of the resource however remains a central management challenge another key conclusion is that the confusion between plot level and system level irrigation efficiencies still fuels unqualified media releases and overoptimistic and sometimes absurd policies claims that 10 or 12bm3 of water can be saved are simply nonsensical last it must be reiterated that a finer analysis of the balance is probably not possible due to uncertainty in most of the variables that need to be assessed this speaks to the need to strengthen data collection and analysis but also to the sheer complexity of the system under consideration acknowledgements this research has been conducted with funding from aciar australia under project n lwr 2011 045 titled management of water and salinity in the nile delta 
11588,the response of wine grapes to irrigation systems was investigated in a cabernet sauvignon 140 ru vineyard in sandy loam soil in sicily during a two year study two different drip irrigation systems were evaluated one surface drip and two subsurface drip irrigation systems with the trickle line located at different distances from vine trunks vegetative and quantitative parameters must quality and root distribution were compared among irrigation treatments during the two study years irrigation of grapevines via a subsurface drip system resulted in greater water use efficiency without affecting must composition establishing the trickle line near the trunk positively influenced trunk growth and total root contact while establishing the trickle line 1 20m from the trunk increased yield dry mass partitioning was modified in subsurface irrigation treatments in favour of reproductive organs we conclude that subsurface drip irrigation under the trunk can be successfully used under water deficit irrigation management even in sandy loam soil and in the hot climate conditions of the mediterranean vineyard some aspects of management deserve further investigation and further studies may better define the optimum conditions for the successful utilization of the sdi 120 irrigation strategy keywords predawn leaf water potential regulated deficit irrigation water use efficiency yield and grape quality root distribution 1 introduction sicily is a region in southern italy with a history of wine production the climate is warm and arid and farmers are thus faced with the problem of achieving high grape yields and good grape quality with limited water supply water use efficiency plays an important role in irrigation strategies particularly considering the water scarcity in mediterranean areas as a consequence of climate change tomás et al 2014 irrigation method significantly affects yield vegetative quality components and root development as well as water use efficiency irrigation system choice by grape farmers should also include consideration of many variables such as type depth and uniformity of soil rooting zone availability and quality of water and total cost myburgh 2012 the advantages of drip irrigation over sprinklers and other conventional irrigation systems van zyl 1988 for vegetative reproductive and qualitative parameters in vitis vinifera are well known but only in subsurface system striegel et al 1996 sharma et al 2005 myburgh 2007a b sharma and upadhyay 2011 and more in depth investigations are required many researchers define subsurface drip irrigation as a method of dispensing water below the soil surface with the same emitters and discharge rates range as surface drip irrigation davis and nelson 1970 camp and lamn 2003 subsurface systems are an important component of lower pressure systems although the literature present contrasting results of subsurface drip irrigation major issues mainly involve irrigation management and more specifically as in all irrigation systems establishing the optimal water dose and drip line depth and distance from the row for different crops ayars et al 2015 the choice of the appropriate drip line depth is influenced by crop soil and climate characteristics soil hydraulic properties and emitters discharge affect vertical water movement in the soil and thus are factors that should be considered in the choice of dripline depth for perennial crops trees and grapes the dripline is typically installed at a depth of 12 20inches sandy soils allow shallower installation depth and regardeless of soil type the dripline should be positioned in the upper portion of the root zone to prevent excessive drainage among other effects lamm 2009 myburgh 2007a b in studies of a subsurface drip irrigation system in a layered alluvial soil showed a lower concentration of roots around the drip lines located at depth of 15cm compared with those at 30 and 45cm but without negatively influencing grape production and quality gaiotti 2010 in on a four year old merlot 161 49 vineyard found that roots were deeper and better developed when the trickle line was positioned at 1 35m from the vine row whereas when positioned at 0 4m growth was shallower and denser similar to that of surface drip irrigation and resulted in higher grape production and vigour subsurface drip irrigation is a system designed to improve water use efficiency wue compared with surface drip irrigation systems the usage of subsurface drip irrigation has always lead to an enhancement of crop yield and quality a decreased water requirement and decreased costs for other cultural practices in annual crops e g tomato cotton sweet corn cantaloupe garlic broccoli pepper and lettuce ayars et al 1999 as well as in fruit crops and in some cases nut crops long term research of subsurface drip irrigation needed especially to better understand the potential uses in nut crops fruit trees and vines as acknowledged by ayars et al 2015 for nut crops such as almond and pistachio subirrigation system are considered especially useful due to potential for water and energy savings enhancement of pest management and ultimately increased production and nut quality ayars et al 2015 moreover in french prune orchards in the northern sacramento valley ca the subirrigation method is used to better support water infiltration in clay and silt loam soils compared to surface drip irrigation ayars et al 2015 considering that sicily is a region with a warm arid climate and limited water supply a change in irrigation strategy may become essential to save water in viticulture without reducing the profitability of grapevines for this reason the objectives of this study were to 1 investigate as an alternative the subsurface irrigation system and to compare results to the standard surface drip irrigation system the most common method in sicily and 2 compare trickle line positioning at two different distances from the vine row within a subsurface drip irrigation system placed under the vine row and in the middle of the interrow the choice of distances of trickle line from vine row in subsurface drip irrigation was established to ensure the uniformity of root development on both side of the rows maintaining only one trickle line 2 materials and methods 2 1 field conditions plant material and irrigation treatments the response of grapevines to two different irrigation systems was investigated during the 2004 and 2005 vegetative seasons in a nine year old cabernet sauvignon 140 ru experimental vineyard planted in 1996 planting distance was 2 4 0 95m row orientation was north south and vines were trellised in a vertical shoot positioned system and cane pruned 8 buds per cane and 2 buds per spur the vineyard was located in western sicily mazara del vallo area 37 36 10 93 n 12 39 15 26 e 34m a s l in 80cm deep soil characterized by 10 gravel 20 8 clay 35 2 silt and 44 sand soil management practices included a cover crop vicia faba during winter and incorporating the biomass into the soil in april by ploughing three shallow tillages 10 12cm deep from spring to summer were adopted to control weeds and prevent soil cracking crescimanno and garofalo 2006 during the two years of this trial weather data were collected through an automated weather station at the servizio informativo agrometeorologico siciliano 2017 www sias regione sicilia it located near the vineyard three irrigation treatments with the same drip line emitter configuration were investigated 1 surface drip irrigation dr with one drip line at 0cm from the vine row and 50cm above the soil fixed on a dedicated wire below the cane 2 subsurface drip irrigation with one drip line at 0cm from the vine row under the vine and 0 35m deep sdi 0 3 subsurface drip irrigation with one drip line at 1 20m positioned equidistantly between adjacent vine rows and 0 35m deep sdi 120 the drip line was mechanically installed before vineyard establishment deep enough 0 35m to prevent damage by tillage but sufficiently shallow to supply water to the root zone van huyssteen and weber 1980 without wetting the soil surface camp and lamn 2003 surface and subsurface methods entailed a drip line irrigation system with pressure compensating emitters with a flow rate of 4l hour were located one metre apart the amount of water applied in each treatment was measured using flow meters 2 2 irrigation scheduling the time of irrigation was determined physiologically by measuring plant water status through leaf water potential at various stages during the trial including the harvest stage these measures were taken at predawn using a scholander pressure chamber model 3115 soilmoisture equipment corp santa barbara ca on 3 fully expanded leaves from primary stems per block and treatment irrigation for all treatments was managed by using a threshold predawn leaf water potential ψpd of 0 4mpa from berry set to the end of veraison and 0 6mpa from the end of veraison di lorenzo et al 2005 in both years irrigation was stopped 15days before the probable harvest date optimum irrigation volumes were calculated based on data gathered in the same vineyard from an experimental trial performed in parallel to this experiment aimed characterizing soil moisture profiles using fdr probes provenzano et al 2016 in particular at each irrigation date the volumes of water administered were regulated to reach field capacity within soil zone wetted by the emitters and the soil layers most populated by roots while avoiding deep percolation field capacity and wilting point were determined using richard s plates richards 1947 the amount of water was reduced by 20 in sdi treatments to account for the lower evaporation from the soil allen et al 1998 this latter term was calculated as the ratio between fw fraction of the surface wetted and fc fraction of ground surface coverage with fc 0 20 and fw 0 04 considering a diameter of the wetted zone under the emitters equal to 0 23m therefore irrigation volume at each event was 75m3 ha in dr and 60m3 ha in sdi ψpd was considered as a stress indicator and fluctuation of this variable between irrigations for all treatments was measured in 2004 at 1 3 5 and 7days after irrigation in two periods once from fruit set to veraison and once from the end of veraison to harvest 2 3 experimental design the experimental design consisted of three randomized complete blocks each with 9 rows 95m in length with 100 vines within each block each irrigation treatment was imposed on 3 contiguous rows for each treatment and block observations were performed on 15 vines of the central row leaving the other two as buffer rows to separate irrigation treatments 2 4 phenology data on the occurrence of budburst flowering beginning of veraison 20 end of veraison and harvest dates for all treatments in 2004 and 2005 were recorded baggiolini 1952 the budburst stage c and flowering stages i were considered to occur when 50 of buds and flowers respectively showed the same phenological stage after veraison about 200 berries were weekly randomly picked and 30days after veraison more frequently every 4days from vines of each irrigation treatments and replicates to measure total soluble solids tss and titratable acidity ta jackson and lombard 1992 useful to define harvest time stage n when tss did not increase for two subsequent measurements and ta was not lower than 5gl 1 grapes were harvested 2 5 leaf area pruning mass and trunk diameter leaf area of primary and lateral shoots was measured at veraison and harvest using an image analysis system windias delta t devices uk and 5 shoots per block and treatment barbagallo et al 1996 pruning mass was measured in winter in all marked vines 45 per treatment trunk circumference at 35cm from the soil was assessed by a measuring tape after rhytidome removal at the beginning and at the end of the trial march 2004 march 2006 on 75 vines per treatment 25 per block and treatment trunk diameter d was calculated by the formula d circumference π 2 6 root system 2 6 1 root number and distribution trench profile technique root evaluation was performed in february 2006 using the trench profile technique böhm 1979 trenches with 0 8m depth 2 0m length and 0 6m width were dug parallel to the rows to expose half of the root system of two vines for each irrigation treatment two trenches i e two vines were analysed trenches were sequentially dug at three distances from the trunk 1 2 0 6 and 0m more specifically the first trench was dug at 1 2m from the vine then after root measurements the second 0 6m and the third 0m trenches were dug in the same location refining the existing trench at the fixed distances fig 1 a thin layer of soil 1 2cm was carefully removed from the wall along the entire trench and visible roots diameter 2mm and 2mm were painted with white varnish to enhance the colour contrast between the roots and the soil a 1 5m 0 8m wire iron frame with a grid of 0 1m 0 1m was pressed into the trench wall and root contacts were counted and expressed as the number of root interceptions per dm2 and as percentage of incidence of fine 2mm medium and large 2mm roots hence 360 grids per treatment were analysed 8 15 grids per frame and three distances from trunk 2 6 2 root length density rld total length and surface the core break method root length density rld cm root cm3 soil was measured for each treatment as follows six 1000cm3 samples of soil within the layer from 0 30 to 0 60m depth were randomly selected from the three trench walls at 0 0 60 and 1 20m from the trunk using a cylindrical core a total of 18 soil samples were analysed per treatment roots from soil samples were classified according to their diameter as fine less than 2mm medium between 2 and 3 5mm and large larger than 3 5mm total root length per soil sample and per root class was also determined root surface was calculated by multiplying root diameter average per class i e 1mm per class fine roots 2 75mm per class medium roots 5mm per class large roots π total root length present in 1 000cm3 of soil root surface per vine was calculated by multiplying the root surface in 1 000cm3 of soil soil volume available per vine 2 4m 0 7m 0 95m böhm 1979 2 7 grape yield and quality data are reported from the 2004 and 2005 vegetative seasons shoot fruitfulness in 2005 and 2006 was assessed on the same vines observed in the previous year at harvest in all vines 45 per treatment the productive parameters were determined yield cluster number and weight berry weight and total anthocyanins expressed as mg per berry di stefano and cravero 1991 were measured from a sample of 50 berries per block and treatment the skins of each sample were separated from the pulp and placed in a flask containing 25ml of tartaric buffer ph 3 2 500ml of distilled water 5g of tartaric acid 22ml of 1n naoh 2g of sodium metabisulphite and 120ml ethanol 95 the volume of buffer was adjusted to 1l by with distilled water skins were placed in the buffer for four hours at room temperature prior to homogenization and centrifugation the supernatant was collected in a 100ml volumetric flask the residue was washed again with tartaric buffer ph 3 2 added to the volumetric flask and the volume was raised to 100ml with tartaric buffer ph 3 2 the extract 10ml was diluted 25 times with acidified ethanol ethanol h2o and concentrated hcl 70 30 1v v v and absorbance was read at 540nm using a uv vis spectrophotometer varian cary 50 bio uv vis spectrophotometer mckinley scientific sparta new jersey usa from these values estimates of total anthocyanins per berry content and mg per fresh weight of grape concentration were calculated total soluble solids tts brix were measured from 1kg samples of grapes per block and treatment using an atago pr 32 digital refractometer atago tokyo japan and titratable acidity was measured from the same samples using a crison compact titrator crison instruments barcelona spain by titration 0 1n naoh to ph 7 expressed in gl 1 of tartaric acid 2 8 vine balance and water use efficiency from each block and treatment yield to pruning weight ratio kgkg 1 and total leaf area at harvest to yield ratio m2 kg 1 were calculated to evaluate the dry mass percentage distribution grape and wood dry matter per shoot were calculated on the basis of the dry weight ratio to fresh weight determined on oven dried samples calò et al 1999 separately for bunches and shoots water use efficiency was quantified considering the yield wuey and the fresh biomass wueb grapes shoots and leaves produced per total water amount in tml 1 rainfall from budburst to harvest plus irrigation the following above to belowground growth ratios were calculated only for 2005 yield to root surface ratio kgm 2 wood mass to root surface ratio kgm 2 and yield plus wood mass to root surface ratio kgm 2 in detail for all these ratios yield and wood mass values on a per vine basis were divided by the average root surface per vine determined by the two trenches excavated for each treatment as detailed in paragraph 2 6 2 9 statistical analysis data describing vegetative and quantitative parameters and grape quality values were analysed separately by year comparisons of irrigation treatment groups were performed with tukey s hsd test at p 0 05 for fine root contacts 2mm diameter comparisons of irrigation treatment groups were performed with tukey s hsd test at p 0 05 for each distance and depth arc sine square root transformation was used for proportions the correlation between root contact trench profile technique and root surface core break method was evaluated using a pearson correlation analysis statistical analyses were run using the systat statistical software package ver 10 systat software inc san jose ca 3 results 3 1 climatic data weather data for the two years 2004 and 2005 are reported in table 1 total rainfall during the two seasons showed a high variability with 902 8mm in 2004 and 645 2mm in 2005 the most significant differences were observed in autumn and winter particularly rainfall before budburst was higher in 2005 than in 2004 310 8mm and 216 0mm respectively while the lowest rainfall was recorded from budburst to end of veraison in 2005 late in the season between the end of veraison and harvest in 2004 was drier than the same period in 2005 table 2 the highest precipitation was recorded in september 2004 after harvest data not shown in the two summers there was little differences in maximum and minimum temperatures in june and july august 2004 was hotter than august 2005 and september 2005 was hotter than september 2004 winter was warmer in 2004 table 1 et0 calculated from budbreak to harvest did not differ between the two years 661 1mm and 651 2 in 2004 and 2005 respectively data not shown 3 2 phenology since irrigation system did not affect vine phenology data are reported as the average of all treatments table 2 the earlier budbreak in 2004 compared to 2005 nine days before was likely determined by the warmer winter differences in phenological stages were maintained until harvest five days earlier in 2004 table 2 3 3 predawn water potential irrigation dates and amounts irrigation began on the 6th of july in 2004 and the 2nd of july in 2005 when the ψpd reached approximately 0 4mpa fig 1a b the earlier starting point for irrigation in 2005 was due to having a drier period from budburst to flowering table 2 rainfall between the first and the second irrigation data not reported induced a delay in water supply in both years table 2 and fig 1a b subirrigation treatments sdi 0 sdi 120 received 480m3 ha and 540m3 ha in 2004 and 2005 respectively whereas 600m3 ha and 675m3 ha were applied to dr in 2004 and 2005 respectively after irrigation ψpd showed a daily decrease from about 0 2mpa to reach the 0 4mpa threshold in the pre veraison period fig 1c and from 0 4mpa to the 0 6mpa threshold in the post veraison period fig 1d in all cases the ψpd thresholds were attained in seven days both for the pre veraison and the post veraison irrigation regimes vines in sdi treatments even after receiving 20 less water than the dr treatment showed similar water stress values measured in terms of ψpd at harvest irrigation treatments showed similar ψpd values for both years fig 1a b 3 4 vegetative parameters irrigation treatments showed no significant differences in main and lateral leaf area per shoot at veraison in 2004 and 2005 for main and lateral leaf abscission during the veraison harvest period in sdi 0 and sdi 120 the differences became significant at harvest especially in sdi 120 a reduction of leaf area was registered in both years in main 44 and 40 respectively and lateral shoots 37 and 57 however the irrigation treatments did not affect wood weight at pruning table 3 3 5 root system number distribution length and surface both trench profile and core break were effective for measuring root systems and values of root contacts and root length were significantly correlated r2 0 87 fig 2 roots were significantly affected by irrigation system with differences in quantity ndm 2 type fine medium and large table 4 and growth either horizontally or vertically fig 3 a b surface drip irrigation resulted in a higher density of root contacts ndm 2 and incidence of fine roots compared to the subsurface systems table 4 fine roots decreased from row to interrow except for in sdi 120 fig 3a where the trickle line was positioned fine roots were more abundant near the trunk in the surface drip system whereas in all subirrigated treatments they were higher near the trickle line fig 3a furthermore fine root development followed water movement in sandy soil in the surface drip irrigated treatment resulting in a deeper root system compared to subirrigated vines fig 3b which remained more gathered near the trickle line the root surface per vine was higher in the surface drip irrigation system 6 03m2 vine 1 than in the sdi 0 4 67m2 vine 1 and sdi 120 3 96m2 vine 1 irrigation systems and the dr treatment showed a higher incidence of fine roots 2mm data not shown 3 6 grape yield and quality irrigation system considerably influenced yield per vine bunch and berry mass table 5 but did not affect shoot fruitfulness data not shown in all treatments yield decreased from the 2004 to 2005 vintage and shoot fruitfulness increased from 2005 to 2006 grape productivity was enhanced by subsurface drip irrigation especially when the trickle line was positioned more distant from the vine row sdi 120 showed a 44 yield greater than dr in 2004 and 49 7 greater yield in 2005 table 5 cluster weight in dr and sdi 0 was lower than in sdi 120 and sdi 0 did not differ in cluster weight in either year water applied in the inter row area sdi 120 appeared to have a positive and significant effect on bunch mass differences in cluster weight were due to the higher berry weight in sdi 120 reductions in berry weight were especially evident in the dr treatment table 5 in all treatments clusters had a lower number of berries in 2005 than in 2004 this reduction in berry numbers can probably be ascribed to the higher temperatures during flowering particularly during may and higher temperature in 2005 these weather conditions probably modified the setting reducing the number of berries per cluster may 2004 number of berries did not significantly differ among treatments in either year data not shown additionally irrigation treatment started every year after setting and this did not influence the setting process grape qualitative parameters were partially affected by irrigation treatment sugar level in 2004 was higher in inrow irrigated vines dr and sdi 0 than in interrow vines sdi 120 a significant difference was found only between sdi 0 and sdi 120 table 5 in 2005 higher sugar level was found in dr but the differences were not significant between treatments the highest soluble solid value in both years was 22 4 brix combined with lower titratable acidity for both the 2004 and 2005 seasons a higher titratable acidity was found where higher yields per vine were observed sdi 120 had the highest values during 2004 and 2005 and these values significantly different from sdi 0 in 2004 and dr in 2005 table 5 irrigation treatment had also significant effects on anthocyanins expressed per berry with the highest anthocyanin values observed in sdi 120 table 5 which significantly different from dr and sdi 0 however there were no differences in anthocyanins expressed in mg kg 1 of grapes data not shown 3 7 dry mass and trunk diameter total dry mass was higher in the treatments in which water was applied in the subsoil dry mass partitioning differed between the two subirrigated treatments specifically it was preferentially allocated to the reproductive parts when water was applied in the inter row area sdi 120 table 6 when the water supply was near the vine dr and sdi 0 the highest seasonal trunk growth percentage was recorded between march 2004 and march 2006 table 6 it appeared that trunk growth was mainly dependent on the yield per vine and leaf fall when leaf fall per shoot and yield per vine were higher reduced trunk growth was observed and vice versa tables 3 5 and 6 3 8 vine balance the total leaf area yield ratio was lower in sdi 120 than in dr in both years table 7 because of lower yield and higher leaf area per vine data not shown in dr on the contrary in 2004 the highest values for the yield to pruning weight ratio per vine were observed in sdi 120 table 7 when the highest yield per vine was registered table 5 while difference among treatments were less pronounced in 2005 aerial biomass and root surface index values were highest in the sdi 120 treatment table 8 3 9 water use efficiency wuey was generally higher in subsurface irrigation sdi 0 and sdi 120 compared to dr treatments coherently with the lower irrigation volumes administered furthermore the higher yield values observed in sdi 120 table 5 may have contributed to further increase wue at plant level wueb minor 2005 or no differences 2004 observed among treatments can be related to the compensating effect of the larger vegetative biomass table 3 observed in dr and sd 0 relative to sdi 120 this is in agreement also with the larger leaf area per unit of grape yield observed in dr and sd 0 in both years table 7 4 discussion results from our study showed that subsurface irrigation systems reduced water supply and increased yield without influencing grape quality many contrasting results are reported in the literature regarding the productive qualitative and vegetative responses of vines to subsurface drip irrigation versus surface drip irrigation systems in fact myburgh 2007b found no advantages in terms of the amount of irrigation yield and berry mass using subsurface irrigation compared to a drip system perhaps because the field trial was carried out in a table grape vineyard sultanina 143b mgt in an alluvial soil along the lower orange river with an application of 7 000m3 ha irrigation water in cv godello a grapevine cultivar native to galicia no statistically significant differences were detected in yield and number of clusters per vine among subsurface and surface drip irrigation systems although a slightly higher yield was recorded in subsurface drip irrigation due to a higher cluster weight probably the lack of significant differences were due to rainfall 354mm during the growing season trigo córdoba et al 2013 furthermore in cv thompson seedless grapevine growing in india subsurface irrigation produced a higher yield than surface drip irrigation sharma et al 2005 sharma and upadhyay 2011 observed higher productive vegetative and total soluble solid performances using a subsurface drip irrigation system receiving 25 less water than surface drip irrigation gaiotti 2010 on a four year old cv merlot 161 49 vineyard grown on a loam sandy soil in the doc piave area discovered that yield and berry weight were lower when using a subsurface drip irrigation located at 135cm from the row compared to surface drip irrigation and subsurface drip irrigation placed at 40cm from the row in lemon trees the use of a subsurface system with approximately 19 less water compared to surface irrigation increased water use efficiency without affecting yield and fruit growth robles et al 2016 similar results were obtained in a cv arbequina organic olive orchard with an increase of olive and oil yield martínez and reca 2014 at harvest the dr and sdi 0 treatments displayed a higher leaf area because of lower percentage of main and lateral leaf abscission after veraison which occurs frequently in semi arid conditions di lorenzo et al 1992 keller 2005 lovisolo et al 2010 romero et al 2010 merli et al 2015 however all irrigation systems showed the same vigour in terms of vegetative growth up to veraison and similar wood weight at pruning studies of vegetative performance among different irrigation systems have shown contrasting results for example no effect on pruning weight per plant of cv sultanina myburgh 2007b and cv godello trigo córdoba et al 2013 grapevine was observed when comparing surface and subsurface drip irrigation while gaiotti 2010 found a noticeable effect of irrigation method on shoot vigour in cv merlot surface drip irrigation and subsurface irrigation systems located close to the trunk had a positive influence on leaf area and shoot growth compared to subsurface irrigation driplines located more distant from the trunk no difference in vegetative growth was shown when maintaining predawn water potential values between 0 2 and 0 4mpa up to veraison while maintaining predawn water potential values between 0 4 and 0 6mpa after veraison resulted natural defoliation especially in the subsurface drip irrigation treatments leaf abscission in sdi 120 was probably caused by non uniformity in root wetting and a lower presence of fine roots which were unable to support the high atmospheric water demand during the day when combined with regulated deficit irrigation strategies however over the ripening period fine roots located wet zone maintained a constant predawn leaf water potential in subsurface irrigation only the terminal root portions in contact with the wet soil area are active in absorbing water while the roots nearest to the trunk close to dry layers are functionally inactive we do not know whether sdi treatments after prolonged exposure to drying soil conditions produced a lower number of fine roots or were lost as occurs in partial rootzone drying prd lovisolo et al 2010 results obtained by researchers studying root apparatus number distribution and length in different irrigation systems are also often contradictory probably due to the different levels of water stress imposed in different experiment in this study surface drip irrigation showed a higher fine root contacts and length per dm2 more presence of fine roots near the trunk bassoi et al 2003 and a deeper root development and growth following water movement in sandy soil gaiotti 2010 on cv merlot observed that in surface drip irrigation and subsurface drip irrigation with lines positioned closer to the vine row there was higher root density but shallower development on the contrary myburgh 2007b found lower root density in the above ground drip compared to subsurface drip irrigation and lower root density around the trickle lines at 30cm and 45cm depths in mature almond subsurface drip irrigation produced a greater horizontal distribution of fine roots in the soil profile than in a surface drip system and finer root density near the emitters moreover root growth was deeper and root density was higher in subsurface drip irrigation under regulated deficit irrigation condition romero et al 2004 these root patterns were also discovered in some species where subsurface drip irrigation was applied phene et al 1991 ayars et al 1999 a lower leaf area yield ratio at harvest in sdi 120 probably increased carbohydrate reserves translocation from the permanent structures to the reproductive organs to support grape ripening resulting in lower trunk growth candolfi vasconcelos et al 1994 reduction in trunk growth in subsurface irrigation systems was also found in lemon trees robles et al 2016 but not in almond romero et al 2004 grape quality largely depends on the sugar acid balance at harvest these parameters are generally dependent on the terroir cultivar soil climate and vineyard management in this study the cabernet sauvignon must was characterized by low sugar and low acidity values there is a clear vintage effect on yield and sugar accumulation because of rainfall during the two years moreover zoldoske et al 1998 in california using cv sauvignon blanc on freedom found contrasting results in yield sugar ph and titratable acidity from year to year when comparing subsurface versus surface drip irrigation system differences in sugar levels between irrigation treatments in this study are consistent with differences in total leaf area yield ratios similar to results reported by kliewer and dokoozlian 2005 in surface drip irrigation a higher sugar level was observed when total leaf area per shoot was higher due also to a lower leaf fall during the ripening period and productivity was lower titratable acidity strongly contributes to juice stability and is also a parameter commonly used as an indicator of quality during the 2004 and 2005 seasons higher titratable acidity was found in sdi 120 where higher yields per vine were observed however myburgh 2007b found that different subsurface irrigation treatments did not have a significant effect on sugar and acid content in the must compared to furrow irrigation or above ground drip over three seasons regulating grapevine water deficit is an efficient approach for managing the amount of secondary metabolites and improving wine quality kennedy et al 2002 castellarin et al 2007 the sdi 120 irrigation treatment had a significantly higher level of anthocyanins expressed per berry probably due to the larger berry size barbagallo et al 2011 pisciotta et al 2013 and or to differential root growth and architecture together with the associated differences in aba synthesis factors that were shown to affect the metabolism of secondary compounds in prd experiments by stoll et al 2000 and jiang and hartung 2008 however there were no differences in anthocyanins expressed in mgkg 1 of grapes among irrigation treatments gaiotti 2010 in arid and semi arid regions where a water resources for irrigation are scarce improvement of water use efficiency wue is needed through the optimization of the yield to water consumption ratio for vineyards chaves et al 2010 tomás et al 2014 medrano et al 2015 costa et al 2016 this research manipulated irrigation schedule by introducing the subirrigation systems to reduce water supply the wuey was modified by applying less water and having higher yield the same results have been obtained in lemon crop where the sdi system has improved the irrigation water use efficiency compared to a traditional dr system in our research 20 water savings were achieved with this new irrigation method subsurface drip irrigation sdi could influence water use potential water losses water uptake and vine behaviour compared to drip and other irrigation methods sharma et al 2005 myburgh 2007b gaiotti 2010 sharma and upadhyay 2011 fandiño et al 2012 trigo córdoba et al 2013 cancela et al 2015 phogat et al 2017 5 conclusions the irrigation treatments influenced vegetative reproductive and qualitative parameters root distribution and water use efficiency subsurface irrigation systems reduced water consumption yielding higher grape production with 20 less water all subirrigation treatments resulted in increased yield without a significant reduction in grape quality moreover better results were found with inter row water application rather than with inrow application placing the drip lines 120cm away from the vine resulted in an increase in yield and carbon partitioning towards the reproductive organs one potential shortcoming of the sdi 120 irrigation strategy combined with regulated deficit irrigation in sandy soil is possible negative effects on the storage of reserves in permanent organs considering higher leaf senescence lower root presence and lower trunk growth these aspects deserve further investigation and further studies may help to define the optimum parameters and conditions for successful adoption of the sdi 120 irrigation strategy 
11588,the response of wine grapes to irrigation systems was investigated in a cabernet sauvignon 140 ru vineyard in sandy loam soil in sicily during a two year study two different drip irrigation systems were evaluated one surface drip and two subsurface drip irrigation systems with the trickle line located at different distances from vine trunks vegetative and quantitative parameters must quality and root distribution were compared among irrigation treatments during the two study years irrigation of grapevines via a subsurface drip system resulted in greater water use efficiency without affecting must composition establishing the trickle line near the trunk positively influenced trunk growth and total root contact while establishing the trickle line 1 20m from the trunk increased yield dry mass partitioning was modified in subsurface irrigation treatments in favour of reproductive organs we conclude that subsurface drip irrigation under the trunk can be successfully used under water deficit irrigation management even in sandy loam soil and in the hot climate conditions of the mediterranean vineyard some aspects of management deserve further investigation and further studies may better define the optimum conditions for the successful utilization of the sdi 120 irrigation strategy keywords predawn leaf water potential regulated deficit irrigation water use efficiency yield and grape quality root distribution 1 introduction sicily is a region in southern italy with a history of wine production the climate is warm and arid and farmers are thus faced with the problem of achieving high grape yields and good grape quality with limited water supply water use efficiency plays an important role in irrigation strategies particularly considering the water scarcity in mediterranean areas as a consequence of climate change tomás et al 2014 irrigation method significantly affects yield vegetative quality components and root development as well as water use efficiency irrigation system choice by grape farmers should also include consideration of many variables such as type depth and uniformity of soil rooting zone availability and quality of water and total cost myburgh 2012 the advantages of drip irrigation over sprinklers and other conventional irrigation systems van zyl 1988 for vegetative reproductive and qualitative parameters in vitis vinifera are well known but only in subsurface system striegel et al 1996 sharma et al 2005 myburgh 2007a b sharma and upadhyay 2011 and more in depth investigations are required many researchers define subsurface drip irrigation as a method of dispensing water below the soil surface with the same emitters and discharge rates range as surface drip irrigation davis and nelson 1970 camp and lamn 2003 subsurface systems are an important component of lower pressure systems although the literature present contrasting results of subsurface drip irrigation major issues mainly involve irrigation management and more specifically as in all irrigation systems establishing the optimal water dose and drip line depth and distance from the row for different crops ayars et al 2015 the choice of the appropriate drip line depth is influenced by crop soil and climate characteristics soil hydraulic properties and emitters discharge affect vertical water movement in the soil and thus are factors that should be considered in the choice of dripline depth for perennial crops trees and grapes the dripline is typically installed at a depth of 12 20inches sandy soils allow shallower installation depth and regardeless of soil type the dripline should be positioned in the upper portion of the root zone to prevent excessive drainage among other effects lamm 2009 myburgh 2007a b in studies of a subsurface drip irrigation system in a layered alluvial soil showed a lower concentration of roots around the drip lines located at depth of 15cm compared with those at 30 and 45cm but without negatively influencing grape production and quality gaiotti 2010 in on a four year old merlot 161 49 vineyard found that roots were deeper and better developed when the trickle line was positioned at 1 35m from the vine row whereas when positioned at 0 4m growth was shallower and denser similar to that of surface drip irrigation and resulted in higher grape production and vigour subsurface drip irrigation is a system designed to improve water use efficiency wue compared with surface drip irrigation systems the usage of subsurface drip irrigation has always lead to an enhancement of crop yield and quality a decreased water requirement and decreased costs for other cultural practices in annual crops e g tomato cotton sweet corn cantaloupe garlic broccoli pepper and lettuce ayars et al 1999 as well as in fruit crops and in some cases nut crops long term research of subsurface drip irrigation needed especially to better understand the potential uses in nut crops fruit trees and vines as acknowledged by ayars et al 2015 for nut crops such as almond and pistachio subirrigation system are considered especially useful due to potential for water and energy savings enhancement of pest management and ultimately increased production and nut quality ayars et al 2015 moreover in french prune orchards in the northern sacramento valley ca the subirrigation method is used to better support water infiltration in clay and silt loam soils compared to surface drip irrigation ayars et al 2015 considering that sicily is a region with a warm arid climate and limited water supply a change in irrigation strategy may become essential to save water in viticulture without reducing the profitability of grapevines for this reason the objectives of this study were to 1 investigate as an alternative the subsurface irrigation system and to compare results to the standard surface drip irrigation system the most common method in sicily and 2 compare trickle line positioning at two different distances from the vine row within a subsurface drip irrigation system placed under the vine row and in the middle of the interrow the choice of distances of trickle line from vine row in subsurface drip irrigation was established to ensure the uniformity of root development on both side of the rows maintaining only one trickle line 2 materials and methods 2 1 field conditions plant material and irrigation treatments the response of grapevines to two different irrigation systems was investigated during the 2004 and 2005 vegetative seasons in a nine year old cabernet sauvignon 140 ru experimental vineyard planted in 1996 planting distance was 2 4 0 95m row orientation was north south and vines were trellised in a vertical shoot positioned system and cane pruned 8 buds per cane and 2 buds per spur the vineyard was located in western sicily mazara del vallo area 37 36 10 93 n 12 39 15 26 e 34m a s l in 80cm deep soil characterized by 10 gravel 20 8 clay 35 2 silt and 44 sand soil management practices included a cover crop vicia faba during winter and incorporating the biomass into the soil in april by ploughing three shallow tillages 10 12cm deep from spring to summer were adopted to control weeds and prevent soil cracking crescimanno and garofalo 2006 during the two years of this trial weather data were collected through an automated weather station at the servizio informativo agrometeorologico siciliano 2017 www sias regione sicilia it located near the vineyard three irrigation treatments with the same drip line emitter configuration were investigated 1 surface drip irrigation dr with one drip line at 0cm from the vine row and 50cm above the soil fixed on a dedicated wire below the cane 2 subsurface drip irrigation with one drip line at 0cm from the vine row under the vine and 0 35m deep sdi 0 3 subsurface drip irrigation with one drip line at 1 20m positioned equidistantly between adjacent vine rows and 0 35m deep sdi 120 the drip line was mechanically installed before vineyard establishment deep enough 0 35m to prevent damage by tillage but sufficiently shallow to supply water to the root zone van huyssteen and weber 1980 without wetting the soil surface camp and lamn 2003 surface and subsurface methods entailed a drip line irrigation system with pressure compensating emitters with a flow rate of 4l hour were located one metre apart the amount of water applied in each treatment was measured using flow meters 2 2 irrigation scheduling the time of irrigation was determined physiologically by measuring plant water status through leaf water potential at various stages during the trial including the harvest stage these measures were taken at predawn using a scholander pressure chamber model 3115 soilmoisture equipment corp santa barbara ca on 3 fully expanded leaves from primary stems per block and treatment irrigation for all treatments was managed by using a threshold predawn leaf water potential ψpd of 0 4mpa from berry set to the end of veraison and 0 6mpa from the end of veraison di lorenzo et al 2005 in both years irrigation was stopped 15days before the probable harvest date optimum irrigation volumes were calculated based on data gathered in the same vineyard from an experimental trial performed in parallel to this experiment aimed characterizing soil moisture profiles using fdr probes provenzano et al 2016 in particular at each irrigation date the volumes of water administered were regulated to reach field capacity within soil zone wetted by the emitters and the soil layers most populated by roots while avoiding deep percolation field capacity and wilting point were determined using richard s plates richards 1947 the amount of water was reduced by 20 in sdi treatments to account for the lower evaporation from the soil allen et al 1998 this latter term was calculated as the ratio between fw fraction of the surface wetted and fc fraction of ground surface coverage with fc 0 20 and fw 0 04 considering a diameter of the wetted zone under the emitters equal to 0 23m therefore irrigation volume at each event was 75m3 ha in dr and 60m3 ha in sdi ψpd was considered as a stress indicator and fluctuation of this variable between irrigations for all treatments was measured in 2004 at 1 3 5 and 7days after irrigation in two periods once from fruit set to veraison and once from the end of veraison to harvest 2 3 experimental design the experimental design consisted of three randomized complete blocks each with 9 rows 95m in length with 100 vines within each block each irrigation treatment was imposed on 3 contiguous rows for each treatment and block observations were performed on 15 vines of the central row leaving the other two as buffer rows to separate irrigation treatments 2 4 phenology data on the occurrence of budburst flowering beginning of veraison 20 end of veraison and harvest dates for all treatments in 2004 and 2005 were recorded baggiolini 1952 the budburst stage c and flowering stages i were considered to occur when 50 of buds and flowers respectively showed the same phenological stage after veraison about 200 berries were weekly randomly picked and 30days after veraison more frequently every 4days from vines of each irrigation treatments and replicates to measure total soluble solids tss and titratable acidity ta jackson and lombard 1992 useful to define harvest time stage n when tss did not increase for two subsequent measurements and ta was not lower than 5gl 1 grapes were harvested 2 5 leaf area pruning mass and trunk diameter leaf area of primary and lateral shoots was measured at veraison and harvest using an image analysis system windias delta t devices uk and 5 shoots per block and treatment barbagallo et al 1996 pruning mass was measured in winter in all marked vines 45 per treatment trunk circumference at 35cm from the soil was assessed by a measuring tape after rhytidome removal at the beginning and at the end of the trial march 2004 march 2006 on 75 vines per treatment 25 per block and treatment trunk diameter d was calculated by the formula d circumference π 2 6 root system 2 6 1 root number and distribution trench profile technique root evaluation was performed in february 2006 using the trench profile technique böhm 1979 trenches with 0 8m depth 2 0m length and 0 6m width were dug parallel to the rows to expose half of the root system of two vines for each irrigation treatment two trenches i e two vines were analysed trenches were sequentially dug at three distances from the trunk 1 2 0 6 and 0m more specifically the first trench was dug at 1 2m from the vine then after root measurements the second 0 6m and the third 0m trenches were dug in the same location refining the existing trench at the fixed distances fig 1 a thin layer of soil 1 2cm was carefully removed from the wall along the entire trench and visible roots diameter 2mm and 2mm were painted with white varnish to enhance the colour contrast between the roots and the soil a 1 5m 0 8m wire iron frame with a grid of 0 1m 0 1m was pressed into the trench wall and root contacts were counted and expressed as the number of root interceptions per dm2 and as percentage of incidence of fine 2mm medium and large 2mm roots hence 360 grids per treatment were analysed 8 15 grids per frame and three distances from trunk 2 6 2 root length density rld total length and surface the core break method root length density rld cm root cm3 soil was measured for each treatment as follows six 1000cm3 samples of soil within the layer from 0 30 to 0 60m depth were randomly selected from the three trench walls at 0 0 60 and 1 20m from the trunk using a cylindrical core a total of 18 soil samples were analysed per treatment roots from soil samples were classified according to their diameter as fine less than 2mm medium between 2 and 3 5mm and large larger than 3 5mm total root length per soil sample and per root class was also determined root surface was calculated by multiplying root diameter average per class i e 1mm per class fine roots 2 75mm per class medium roots 5mm per class large roots π total root length present in 1 000cm3 of soil root surface per vine was calculated by multiplying the root surface in 1 000cm3 of soil soil volume available per vine 2 4m 0 7m 0 95m böhm 1979 2 7 grape yield and quality data are reported from the 2004 and 2005 vegetative seasons shoot fruitfulness in 2005 and 2006 was assessed on the same vines observed in the previous year at harvest in all vines 45 per treatment the productive parameters were determined yield cluster number and weight berry weight and total anthocyanins expressed as mg per berry di stefano and cravero 1991 were measured from a sample of 50 berries per block and treatment the skins of each sample were separated from the pulp and placed in a flask containing 25ml of tartaric buffer ph 3 2 500ml of distilled water 5g of tartaric acid 22ml of 1n naoh 2g of sodium metabisulphite and 120ml ethanol 95 the volume of buffer was adjusted to 1l by with distilled water skins were placed in the buffer for four hours at room temperature prior to homogenization and centrifugation the supernatant was collected in a 100ml volumetric flask the residue was washed again with tartaric buffer ph 3 2 added to the volumetric flask and the volume was raised to 100ml with tartaric buffer ph 3 2 the extract 10ml was diluted 25 times with acidified ethanol ethanol h2o and concentrated hcl 70 30 1v v v and absorbance was read at 540nm using a uv vis spectrophotometer varian cary 50 bio uv vis spectrophotometer mckinley scientific sparta new jersey usa from these values estimates of total anthocyanins per berry content and mg per fresh weight of grape concentration were calculated total soluble solids tts brix were measured from 1kg samples of grapes per block and treatment using an atago pr 32 digital refractometer atago tokyo japan and titratable acidity was measured from the same samples using a crison compact titrator crison instruments barcelona spain by titration 0 1n naoh to ph 7 expressed in gl 1 of tartaric acid 2 8 vine balance and water use efficiency from each block and treatment yield to pruning weight ratio kgkg 1 and total leaf area at harvest to yield ratio m2 kg 1 were calculated to evaluate the dry mass percentage distribution grape and wood dry matter per shoot were calculated on the basis of the dry weight ratio to fresh weight determined on oven dried samples calò et al 1999 separately for bunches and shoots water use efficiency was quantified considering the yield wuey and the fresh biomass wueb grapes shoots and leaves produced per total water amount in tml 1 rainfall from budburst to harvest plus irrigation the following above to belowground growth ratios were calculated only for 2005 yield to root surface ratio kgm 2 wood mass to root surface ratio kgm 2 and yield plus wood mass to root surface ratio kgm 2 in detail for all these ratios yield and wood mass values on a per vine basis were divided by the average root surface per vine determined by the two trenches excavated for each treatment as detailed in paragraph 2 6 2 9 statistical analysis data describing vegetative and quantitative parameters and grape quality values were analysed separately by year comparisons of irrigation treatment groups were performed with tukey s hsd test at p 0 05 for fine root contacts 2mm diameter comparisons of irrigation treatment groups were performed with tukey s hsd test at p 0 05 for each distance and depth arc sine square root transformation was used for proportions the correlation between root contact trench profile technique and root surface core break method was evaluated using a pearson correlation analysis statistical analyses were run using the systat statistical software package ver 10 systat software inc san jose ca 3 results 3 1 climatic data weather data for the two years 2004 and 2005 are reported in table 1 total rainfall during the two seasons showed a high variability with 902 8mm in 2004 and 645 2mm in 2005 the most significant differences were observed in autumn and winter particularly rainfall before budburst was higher in 2005 than in 2004 310 8mm and 216 0mm respectively while the lowest rainfall was recorded from budburst to end of veraison in 2005 late in the season between the end of veraison and harvest in 2004 was drier than the same period in 2005 table 2 the highest precipitation was recorded in september 2004 after harvest data not shown in the two summers there was little differences in maximum and minimum temperatures in june and july august 2004 was hotter than august 2005 and september 2005 was hotter than september 2004 winter was warmer in 2004 table 1 et0 calculated from budbreak to harvest did not differ between the two years 661 1mm and 651 2 in 2004 and 2005 respectively data not shown 3 2 phenology since irrigation system did not affect vine phenology data are reported as the average of all treatments table 2 the earlier budbreak in 2004 compared to 2005 nine days before was likely determined by the warmer winter differences in phenological stages were maintained until harvest five days earlier in 2004 table 2 3 3 predawn water potential irrigation dates and amounts irrigation began on the 6th of july in 2004 and the 2nd of july in 2005 when the ψpd reached approximately 0 4mpa fig 1a b the earlier starting point for irrigation in 2005 was due to having a drier period from budburst to flowering table 2 rainfall between the first and the second irrigation data not reported induced a delay in water supply in both years table 2 and fig 1a b subirrigation treatments sdi 0 sdi 120 received 480m3 ha and 540m3 ha in 2004 and 2005 respectively whereas 600m3 ha and 675m3 ha were applied to dr in 2004 and 2005 respectively after irrigation ψpd showed a daily decrease from about 0 2mpa to reach the 0 4mpa threshold in the pre veraison period fig 1c and from 0 4mpa to the 0 6mpa threshold in the post veraison period fig 1d in all cases the ψpd thresholds were attained in seven days both for the pre veraison and the post veraison irrigation regimes vines in sdi treatments even after receiving 20 less water than the dr treatment showed similar water stress values measured in terms of ψpd at harvest irrigation treatments showed similar ψpd values for both years fig 1a b 3 4 vegetative parameters irrigation treatments showed no significant differences in main and lateral leaf area per shoot at veraison in 2004 and 2005 for main and lateral leaf abscission during the veraison harvest period in sdi 0 and sdi 120 the differences became significant at harvest especially in sdi 120 a reduction of leaf area was registered in both years in main 44 and 40 respectively and lateral shoots 37 and 57 however the irrigation treatments did not affect wood weight at pruning table 3 3 5 root system number distribution length and surface both trench profile and core break were effective for measuring root systems and values of root contacts and root length were significantly correlated r2 0 87 fig 2 roots were significantly affected by irrigation system with differences in quantity ndm 2 type fine medium and large table 4 and growth either horizontally or vertically fig 3 a b surface drip irrigation resulted in a higher density of root contacts ndm 2 and incidence of fine roots compared to the subsurface systems table 4 fine roots decreased from row to interrow except for in sdi 120 fig 3a where the trickle line was positioned fine roots were more abundant near the trunk in the surface drip system whereas in all subirrigated treatments they were higher near the trickle line fig 3a furthermore fine root development followed water movement in sandy soil in the surface drip irrigated treatment resulting in a deeper root system compared to subirrigated vines fig 3b which remained more gathered near the trickle line the root surface per vine was higher in the surface drip irrigation system 6 03m2 vine 1 than in the sdi 0 4 67m2 vine 1 and sdi 120 3 96m2 vine 1 irrigation systems and the dr treatment showed a higher incidence of fine roots 2mm data not shown 3 6 grape yield and quality irrigation system considerably influenced yield per vine bunch and berry mass table 5 but did not affect shoot fruitfulness data not shown in all treatments yield decreased from the 2004 to 2005 vintage and shoot fruitfulness increased from 2005 to 2006 grape productivity was enhanced by subsurface drip irrigation especially when the trickle line was positioned more distant from the vine row sdi 120 showed a 44 yield greater than dr in 2004 and 49 7 greater yield in 2005 table 5 cluster weight in dr and sdi 0 was lower than in sdi 120 and sdi 0 did not differ in cluster weight in either year water applied in the inter row area sdi 120 appeared to have a positive and significant effect on bunch mass differences in cluster weight were due to the higher berry weight in sdi 120 reductions in berry weight were especially evident in the dr treatment table 5 in all treatments clusters had a lower number of berries in 2005 than in 2004 this reduction in berry numbers can probably be ascribed to the higher temperatures during flowering particularly during may and higher temperature in 2005 these weather conditions probably modified the setting reducing the number of berries per cluster may 2004 number of berries did not significantly differ among treatments in either year data not shown additionally irrigation treatment started every year after setting and this did not influence the setting process grape qualitative parameters were partially affected by irrigation treatment sugar level in 2004 was higher in inrow irrigated vines dr and sdi 0 than in interrow vines sdi 120 a significant difference was found only between sdi 0 and sdi 120 table 5 in 2005 higher sugar level was found in dr but the differences were not significant between treatments the highest soluble solid value in both years was 22 4 brix combined with lower titratable acidity for both the 2004 and 2005 seasons a higher titratable acidity was found where higher yields per vine were observed sdi 120 had the highest values during 2004 and 2005 and these values significantly different from sdi 0 in 2004 and dr in 2005 table 5 irrigation treatment had also significant effects on anthocyanins expressed per berry with the highest anthocyanin values observed in sdi 120 table 5 which significantly different from dr and sdi 0 however there were no differences in anthocyanins expressed in mg kg 1 of grapes data not shown 3 7 dry mass and trunk diameter total dry mass was higher in the treatments in which water was applied in the subsoil dry mass partitioning differed between the two subirrigated treatments specifically it was preferentially allocated to the reproductive parts when water was applied in the inter row area sdi 120 table 6 when the water supply was near the vine dr and sdi 0 the highest seasonal trunk growth percentage was recorded between march 2004 and march 2006 table 6 it appeared that trunk growth was mainly dependent on the yield per vine and leaf fall when leaf fall per shoot and yield per vine were higher reduced trunk growth was observed and vice versa tables 3 5 and 6 3 8 vine balance the total leaf area yield ratio was lower in sdi 120 than in dr in both years table 7 because of lower yield and higher leaf area per vine data not shown in dr on the contrary in 2004 the highest values for the yield to pruning weight ratio per vine were observed in sdi 120 table 7 when the highest yield per vine was registered table 5 while difference among treatments were less pronounced in 2005 aerial biomass and root surface index values were highest in the sdi 120 treatment table 8 3 9 water use efficiency wuey was generally higher in subsurface irrigation sdi 0 and sdi 120 compared to dr treatments coherently with the lower irrigation volumes administered furthermore the higher yield values observed in sdi 120 table 5 may have contributed to further increase wue at plant level wueb minor 2005 or no differences 2004 observed among treatments can be related to the compensating effect of the larger vegetative biomass table 3 observed in dr and sd 0 relative to sdi 120 this is in agreement also with the larger leaf area per unit of grape yield observed in dr and sd 0 in both years table 7 4 discussion results from our study showed that subsurface irrigation systems reduced water supply and increased yield without influencing grape quality many contrasting results are reported in the literature regarding the productive qualitative and vegetative responses of vines to subsurface drip irrigation versus surface drip irrigation systems in fact myburgh 2007b found no advantages in terms of the amount of irrigation yield and berry mass using subsurface irrigation compared to a drip system perhaps because the field trial was carried out in a table grape vineyard sultanina 143b mgt in an alluvial soil along the lower orange river with an application of 7 000m3 ha irrigation water in cv godello a grapevine cultivar native to galicia no statistically significant differences were detected in yield and number of clusters per vine among subsurface and surface drip irrigation systems although a slightly higher yield was recorded in subsurface drip irrigation due to a higher cluster weight probably the lack of significant differences were due to rainfall 354mm during the growing season trigo córdoba et al 2013 furthermore in cv thompson seedless grapevine growing in india subsurface irrigation produced a higher yield than surface drip irrigation sharma et al 2005 sharma and upadhyay 2011 observed higher productive vegetative and total soluble solid performances using a subsurface drip irrigation system receiving 25 less water than surface drip irrigation gaiotti 2010 on a four year old cv merlot 161 49 vineyard grown on a loam sandy soil in the doc piave area discovered that yield and berry weight were lower when using a subsurface drip irrigation located at 135cm from the row compared to surface drip irrigation and subsurface drip irrigation placed at 40cm from the row in lemon trees the use of a subsurface system with approximately 19 less water compared to surface irrigation increased water use efficiency without affecting yield and fruit growth robles et al 2016 similar results were obtained in a cv arbequina organic olive orchard with an increase of olive and oil yield martínez and reca 2014 at harvest the dr and sdi 0 treatments displayed a higher leaf area because of lower percentage of main and lateral leaf abscission after veraison which occurs frequently in semi arid conditions di lorenzo et al 1992 keller 2005 lovisolo et al 2010 romero et al 2010 merli et al 2015 however all irrigation systems showed the same vigour in terms of vegetative growth up to veraison and similar wood weight at pruning studies of vegetative performance among different irrigation systems have shown contrasting results for example no effect on pruning weight per plant of cv sultanina myburgh 2007b and cv godello trigo córdoba et al 2013 grapevine was observed when comparing surface and subsurface drip irrigation while gaiotti 2010 found a noticeable effect of irrigation method on shoot vigour in cv merlot surface drip irrigation and subsurface irrigation systems located close to the trunk had a positive influence on leaf area and shoot growth compared to subsurface irrigation driplines located more distant from the trunk no difference in vegetative growth was shown when maintaining predawn water potential values between 0 2 and 0 4mpa up to veraison while maintaining predawn water potential values between 0 4 and 0 6mpa after veraison resulted natural defoliation especially in the subsurface drip irrigation treatments leaf abscission in sdi 120 was probably caused by non uniformity in root wetting and a lower presence of fine roots which were unable to support the high atmospheric water demand during the day when combined with regulated deficit irrigation strategies however over the ripening period fine roots located wet zone maintained a constant predawn leaf water potential in subsurface irrigation only the terminal root portions in contact with the wet soil area are active in absorbing water while the roots nearest to the trunk close to dry layers are functionally inactive we do not know whether sdi treatments after prolonged exposure to drying soil conditions produced a lower number of fine roots or were lost as occurs in partial rootzone drying prd lovisolo et al 2010 results obtained by researchers studying root apparatus number distribution and length in different irrigation systems are also often contradictory probably due to the different levels of water stress imposed in different experiment in this study surface drip irrigation showed a higher fine root contacts and length per dm2 more presence of fine roots near the trunk bassoi et al 2003 and a deeper root development and growth following water movement in sandy soil gaiotti 2010 on cv merlot observed that in surface drip irrigation and subsurface drip irrigation with lines positioned closer to the vine row there was higher root density but shallower development on the contrary myburgh 2007b found lower root density in the above ground drip compared to subsurface drip irrigation and lower root density around the trickle lines at 30cm and 45cm depths in mature almond subsurface drip irrigation produced a greater horizontal distribution of fine roots in the soil profile than in a surface drip system and finer root density near the emitters moreover root growth was deeper and root density was higher in subsurface drip irrigation under regulated deficit irrigation condition romero et al 2004 these root patterns were also discovered in some species where subsurface drip irrigation was applied phene et al 1991 ayars et al 1999 a lower leaf area yield ratio at harvest in sdi 120 probably increased carbohydrate reserves translocation from the permanent structures to the reproductive organs to support grape ripening resulting in lower trunk growth candolfi vasconcelos et al 1994 reduction in trunk growth in subsurface irrigation systems was also found in lemon trees robles et al 2016 but not in almond romero et al 2004 grape quality largely depends on the sugar acid balance at harvest these parameters are generally dependent on the terroir cultivar soil climate and vineyard management in this study the cabernet sauvignon must was characterized by low sugar and low acidity values there is a clear vintage effect on yield and sugar accumulation because of rainfall during the two years moreover zoldoske et al 1998 in california using cv sauvignon blanc on freedom found contrasting results in yield sugar ph and titratable acidity from year to year when comparing subsurface versus surface drip irrigation system differences in sugar levels between irrigation treatments in this study are consistent with differences in total leaf area yield ratios similar to results reported by kliewer and dokoozlian 2005 in surface drip irrigation a higher sugar level was observed when total leaf area per shoot was higher due also to a lower leaf fall during the ripening period and productivity was lower titratable acidity strongly contributes to juice stability and is also a parameter commonly used as an indicator of quality during the 2004 and 2005 seasons higher titratable acidity was found in sdi 120 where higher yields per vine were observed however myburgh 2007b found that different subsurface irrigation treatments did not have a significant effect on sugar and acid content in the must compared to furrow irrigation or above ground drip over three seasons regulating grapevine water deficit is an efficient approach for managing the amount of secondary metabolites and improving wine quality kennedy et al 2002 castellarin et al 2007 the sdi 120 irrigation treatment had a significantly higher level of anthocyanins expressed per berry probably due to the larger berry size barbagallo et al 2011 pisciotta et al 2013 and or to differential root growth and architecture together with the associated differences in aba synthesis factors that were shown to affect the metabolism of secondary compounds in prd experiments by stoll et al 2000 and jiang and hartung 2008 however there were no differences in anthocyanins expressed in mgkg 1 of grapes among irrigation treatments gaiotti 2010 in arid and semi arid regions where a water resources for irrigation are scarce improvement of water use efficiency wue is needed through the optimization of the yield to water consumption ratio for vineyards chaves et al 2010 tomás et al 2014 medrano et al 2015 costa et al 2016 this research manipulated irrigation schedule by introducing the subirrigation systems to reduce water supply the wuey was modified by applying less water and having higher yield the same results have been obtained in lemon crop where the sdi system has improved the irrigation water use efficiency compared to a traditional dr system in our research 20 water savings were achieved with this new irrigation method subsurface drip irrigation sdi could influence water use potential water losses water uptake and vine behaviour compared to drip and other irrigation methods sharma et al 2005 myburgh 2007b gaiotti 2010 sharma and upadhyay 2011 fandiño et al 2012 trigo córdoba et al 2013 cancela et al 2015 phogat et al 2017 5 conclusions the irrigation treatments influenced vegetative reproductive and qualitative parameters root distribution and water use efficiency subsurface irrigation systems reduced water consumption yielding higher grape production with 20 less water all subirrigation treatments resulted in increased yield without a significant reduction in grape quality moreover better results were found with inter row water application rather than with inrow application placing the drip lines 120cm away from the vine resulted in an increase in yield and carbon partitioning towards the reproductive organs one potential shortcoming of the sdi 120 irrigation strategy combined with regulated deficit irrigation in sandy soil is possible negative effects on the storage of reserves in permanent organs considering higher leaf senescence lower root presence and lower trunk growth these aspects deserve further investigation and further studies may help to define the optimum parameters and conditions for successful adoption of the sdi 120 irrigation strategy

southwestern part of the field was not covered by the uas surveys fig 1a the pix4d sa ecublens switzerland software pix4dmapper pro was employed to process data from each uas survey particularly regarding stitching together the overlapping images obtained by each camera sensor into a single image covering the entire uas survey area table 1 provides information on uas camera sensor characteristics and set up for the two aerial surveys one of the ebee ag surveys was carried out with a parrot sa paris france sequoia camera while the sensefly sa thermomap camera was utilized in the other ebee ag survey the sequoia camera had five sensors 1 a combined red green blue rgb wavelength bandwidth 2 a green wavelength bandwidth 3 a red wavelength bandwidth 4 a red edge wavelength bandwidth and 5 a near infrared wavelength bandwidth the red edge wavelength bandwidth is in the near infrared portion of the electromagnetic spectrum near the boundary between the red and near infrared wavelengths the one thermomap camera sensor has a thermal infrared wavelength bandwidth each sensor obtains numerous individual image captures during a single uas survey and table 1 shows that for each sensor during the uas surveys conducted there was substantial overlap between neighboring images the flight altitude above ground level agl for the two uas surveys was near the maximum height 122m allowed by u s federal aviation administration faa regulations 3 results and discussion 3 1 field rainfall and soil water temperature monitoring in the seven days prior to the to the june 12 2017 uas surveys the onsite rain gauge recorded only 4 3mm of precipitation during the two hour period of time the uas surveys were carried out 11 30 13 30 volumetric water content at the soil surface over the drain line averaged 10 7 and volumetric water content at the soil surface between drain lines averaged 15 1 while temperature at the soil surface over the drain line averaged 33 7 c and the temperature at the soil surface between drain lines averaged 33 5 c consequently soil surface conditions in the field were very dry with the installed soil sensors showing lower water content and slightly higher temperature over the drain line versus higher water content and slightly lower temperatures between two drain lines these soil water temperature results provide at best some general insight on conditions at the ground surface during the uas surveys conducted on june 12 2017 but in future uas surveys at this site more locations will have to be monitored in order to get a better understanding of spatial temporal differences at the soil surface across the field both over the drain lines and between drain lines 3 2 uas test site surveys test site composite aerial images i e stitched together from numerous overlapping images obtained along the flight path for each of the sequoia camera sensors are provided in fig 3 with fig 1a for reference none of fig 3 aerial images depict linear features consistent with the known drainage pipe networks present within the farm field i e drainage zone 1 and drainage zone 2 by inspection even the most subtle linear features present in fig 3 images do not seem to coincide with known drainage pipe patterns so it is highly unlikely that the employment of advanced image processing techniques would in this case provide any benefit with respect to drainage pipe detection due to very dry field conditions at the time the uas sequoia camera survey was conducted there were likely insufficient differences in soil surface water content over the drain lines versus the soil surface water content between drain lines thereby muting any strong disparities in visible vis or near infrared nir reflected energy at the surface over the drain lines versus the surface between the drain lines verma et al 1996 and naz et al 2009 note that the ideal time to conduct a vis or nir aerial survey to delineate drainage pipe patterns is two to three days after a large rainfall 2 5cm when there are significantly large differences in soil water content and hence reflected vis nir energy at the surface over the drain lines higher reflectance lighter shaded versus the surface between the drain lines lower reflectance darker shaded consequently the timing of the june 12 2017 uas survey was not optimal relative to prior rainfall events for depicting drain lines in the vis nir imagery obtained by the sequoia camera however given better timing relative to a large rainfall event uas vis nir surveys with the sequoia camera may be far more successful delineating drain lines so for future evaluations at this field site uas surveys with the sequoia camera will be carried out under wetter field conditions results from the uas survey with the thermomap camera are provided in fig 4 the composite thermal infrared tir image of the farm field test site is shown in fig 4a and the field is divided into six regions fig 4b based on the tir response relative to known presence absence of drain lines drain lines are indentified by lightly shaded linear features in the tir image and this lightly shaded linear response is due to the soil surface over the drain line being at least slightly warmer than the soil surface between drain lines thermal infrared sensors respond to surface temperature with lighter shades indicating a warmer surface and darker shades indicating a cooler surface furthermore due to the specific heat capacity of water the daily temperature fluctuations in a field for wet soils will be less than for dry soils and as a result during late morning and early afternoon after several hours of daylight heating dry soil will be warmer and wet soil cooler so essentially tir is also responsive to soil moisture unlike the vis nir imagery obtained with the sequoia camera the thermomap tir image proved successful in detecting roughly 60 of the subsurface drainage infrastructure present in the field area covered fig 4a and b many of the drainage zone 1 north south drain lines fig 1a were detected in region i the estimated spacing distance between drain lines in region i is approximately 15m which agrees with the 15m drain line spacing distance measured in the field using ground penetrating radar no drain lines were detected in region v thereby confirming the known position of the drainage zone 1 southern boundary for drainage zone 2 fig 1a many of its east west drain lines were detected in region ii while many of its north south drain lines were detected in region iii interestingly the region iii north south drain lines near the rainfall and soil water temperature monitoring location were detected even though the measured surface temperature over the drain line was just slightly warmer 0 2 c than the measured surface temperature between drain lines some unidentified north south trending linear features extend southward from region ii into regions iii and iv with the possible exception of some very old random clay tile drain lines region iv was expected to be free of any subsurface drainage infrastructure even though some drain lines are known to be present in region vi especially the eastern side none could be clearly detected lightly shaded dendritic features in fig 4a tir image are very pronounced and tend to mask drain line responses in many parts of the field particularly region vi these lightly shaded dendritic features may be the result of prior gully erosion that has since been graded over abdel hadi et al 1970 showed a similar tir response obtained on a larger scale for a buried stream channel consequently the most important finding from these preliminary uas surveys is that tir imagery exhibits substantial promise for use in mapping agricultural drainage pipes furthermore when field conditions are fairly dry tir imagery may be better for delineating drain line locations than vis or nir imagery thermal infrared imagery drainage pipe detection was quite effective even though the ground was partially covered with prior growing season crop residue and existing early growth stage corn soybeans these results are from the initial stage of an ongoing research investigation in which vis nir and tir imagery will be evaluated under different soil wetness dryness conditions at a number of test sites having different types of soil and drainage system characteristics the goal for this research will be to develop guidelines as to when and where vis nir and or tir imagery can be successfully employed to map agricultural drainage pipes 4 summary and conclusions due to both economic and environmental considerations there is an important need for the development of better methods to map subsurface drainage systems in agricultural landscapes surveys carried out by unmanned aircraft systems uas with visible vis near infrared nir and thermal infrared tir sensors could be an effective and efficient way to map agricultural drainage pipes for preliminary evaluation purposes uas surveys with vis nir and tir sensors were conducted on june 12 2017 at a central ohio u s a farm field test site that was chosen in part because of available knowledge and documentation regarding the existing subsurface drainage system prior to the uas surveys a rain gauge and two soil water temperature sensors were installed to monitor the soil surface during the two hours the uas surveys were carried out the soil surface was very dry less than 5mm of rainfall the previous week soil surface volumetric water content below 16 and soil surface temperature above 33 c and the ground was partially covered with past growing season crop residue and existing early growth stage corn soybeans the uas survey with the vis and nir sensors was not successful detecting drainage pipes however 60 of the drain lines were found on imagery obtained from the uas tir survey consequently when field conditions are fairly dry tir imagery may be better suited for delineating drainage pipe locations than vis or nir imagery drainage pipe detection from uas surveys with vis and nir sensors is likely to be much better under more optimally wetter field conditions therefore the goal for our future research will be to develop guidelines as to when and where uas vis nir and or tir imagery can be successfully employed to map agricultural drainage pipes which will require the evaluation of vis nir and tir imagery under different soil wetness dryness conditions at a number of test sites having different types of soil and drainage system

that for each sensor during the uas surveys conducted there was substantial overlap between neighboring images the flight altitude above ground level agl for the two uas surveys was near the maximum height 122m allowed by u s federal aviation administration faa regulations 3 results and discussion 3 1 field rainfall and soil water temperature monitoring in the seven days prior to the to the june 12 2017 uas surveys the onsite rain gauge recorded only 4 3mm of precipitation during the two hour period of time the uas surveys were carried out 11 30 13 30 volumetric water content at the soil surface over the drain line averaged 10 7 and volumetric water content at the soil surface between drain lines averaged 15 1 while temperature at the soil surface over the drain line averaged 33 7 c and the temperature at the soil surface between drain lines averaged 33 5 c consequently soil surface conditions in the field were very dry with the installed soil sensors showing lower water content and slightly higher temperature over the drain line versus higher water content and slightly lower temperatures between two drain lines these soil water temperature results provide at best some general insight on conditions at the ground surface during the uas surveys conducted on june 12 2017 but in future uas surveys at this site more locations will have to be monitored in order to get a better understanding of spatial temporal differences at the soil surface across the field both over the drain lines and between drain lines 3 2 uas test site surveys test site composite aerial images i e stitched together from numerous overlapping images obtained along the flight path for each of the sequoia camera sensors are provided in fig 3 with fig 1a for reference none of fig 3 aerial images depict linear features consistent with the known drainage pipe networks present within the farm field i e drainage zone 1 and drainage zone 2 by inspection even the most subtle linear features present in fig 3 images do not seem to coincide with known drainage pipe patterns so it is highly unlikely that the employment of advanced image processing techniques would in this case provide any benefit with respect to drainage pipe detection due to very dry field conditions at the time the uas sequoia camera survey was conducted there were likely insufficient differences in soil surface water content over the drain lines versus the soil surface water content between drain lines thereby muting any strong disparities in visible vis or near infrared nir reflected energy at the surface over the drain lines versus the surface between the drain lines verma et al 1996 and naz et al 2009 note that the ideal time to conduct a vis or nir aerial survey to delineate drainage pipe patterns is two to three days after a large rainfall 2 5cm when there are significantly large differences in soil water content and hence reflected vis nir energy at the surface over the drain lines higher reflectance lighter shaded versus the surface between the drain lines lower reflectance darker shaded consequently the timing of the june 12 2017 uas survey was not optimal relative to prior rainfall events for depicting drain lines in the vis nir imagery obtained by the sequoia camera however given better timing relative to a large rainfall event uas vis nir surveys with the sequoia camera may be far more successful delineating drain lines so for future evaluations at this field site uas surveys with the sequoia camera will be carried out under wetter field conditions results from the uas survey with the thermomap camera are provided in fig 4 the composite thermal infrared tir image of the farm field test site is shown in fig 4a and the field is divided into six regions fig 4b based on the tir response relative to known presence absence of drain lines drain lines are indentified by lightly shaded linear features in the tir image and this lightly shaded linear response is due to the soil surface over the drain line being at least slightly warmer than the soil surface between drain lines thermal infrared sensors respond to surface temperature with lighter shades indicating a warmer surface and darker shades indicating a cooler surface furthermore due to the specific heat capacity of water the daily temperature fluctuations in a field for wet soils will be less than for dry soils and as a result during late morning and early afternoon after several hours of daylight heating dry soil will be warmer and wet soil cooler so essentially tir is also responsive to soil moisture unlike the vis nir imagery obtained with the sequoia camera the thermomap tir image proved successful in detecting roughly 60 of the subsurface drainage infrastructure present in the field area covered fig 4a and b many of the drainage zone 1 north south drain lines fig 1a were detected in region i the estimated spacing distance between drain lines in region i is approximately 15m which agrees with the 15m drain line spacing distance measured in the field using ground penetrating radar no drain lines were detected in region v thereby confirming the known position of the drainage zone 1 southern boundary for drainage zone 2 fig 1a many of its east west drain lines were detected in region ii while many of its north south drain lines were detected in region iii interestingly the region iii north south drain lines near the rainfall and soil water temperature monitoring location were detected even though the measured surface temperature over the drain line was just slightly warmer 0 2 c than the measured surface temperature between drain lines some unidentified north south trending linear features extend southward from region ii into regions iii and iv with the possible exception of some very old random clay tile drain lines region iv was expected to be free of any subsurface drainage infrastructure even though some drain lines are known to be present in region vi especially the eastern side none could be clearly detected lightly shaded dendritic features in fig 4a tir image are very pronounced and tend to mask drain line responses in many parts of the field particularly region vi these lightly shaded dendritic features may be the result of prior gully erosion that has since been graded over abdel hadi et al 1970 showed a similar tir response obtained on a larger scale for a buried stream channel consequently the most important finding from these preliminary uas surveys is that tir imagery exhibits substantial promise for use in mapping agricultural drainage pipes furthermore when field conditions are fairly dry tir imagery may be better for delineating drain line locations than vis or nir imagery thermal infrared imagery drainage pipe detection was quite effective even though the ground was partially covered with prior growing season crop residue and existing early growth stage corn soybeans these results are from the initial stage of an ongoing research investigation in which vis nir and tir imagery will be evaluated under different soil wetness dryness conditions at a number of test sites having different types of soil and drainage system characteristics the goal for this research will be to develop guidelines as to when and where vis nir and or tir imagery can be successfully employed to map agricultural drainage pipes 4 summary and conclusions due to both economic and environmental considerations there is an important need for the development of better methods to map subsurface drainage systems in agricultural landscapes surveys carried out by unmanned aircraft systems uas with visible vis near infrared nir and thermal infrared tir sensors could be an effective and efficient way to map agricultural drainage pipes for preliminary evaluation purposes uas surveys with vis nir and tir sensors were conducted on june 12 2017 at a central ohio u s a farm field test site that was chosen in part because of available knowledge and documentation regarding the existing subsurface drainage system prior to the uas surveys a rain gauge and two soil water temperature sensors were installed to monitor the soil surface during the two hours the uas surveys were carried out the soil surface was very dry less than 5mm of rainfall the previous week soil surface volumetric water content below 16 and soil surface temperature above 33 c and the ground was partially covered with past growing season crop residue and existing early growth stage corn soybeans the uas survey with the vis and nir sensors was not successful detecting drainage pipes however 60 of the drain lines were found on imagery obtained from the uas tir survey consequently when field conditions are fairly dry tir imagery may be better suited for delineating drainage pipe locations than vis or nir imagery drainage pipe detection from uas surveys with vis and nir sensors is likely to be much better under more optimally wetter field conditions therefore the goal for our future research will be to develop guidelines as to when and where uas vis nir and or tir imagery can be successfully employed to map agricultural drainage pipes which will require the evaluation of vis nir and tir imagery under different soil wetness dryness conditions at a number of test sites having different types of soil and drainage system characteristics
