20,managed aquifer recharge mar techniques are in demand to cope with water scarcity challenges posed by climate change and groundwater overexploitation one of the long lasting technical issues associated with mar systems is physical clogging the intrusion and deposition of external fines during water recharge reduce the infiltration capacity of the site over time operation and maintenance o m costs are experienced directly at the site to restore the original efficiency of infiltration rates thus investors need reliable estimations of the risk of clogging during the planning of the site as a rule in mar design the main parameter of concern for physical clogging is the total suspended solids tss and most clogging models rely on experiment calibrations in 1d sand columns however secondary processes can control the development and spatial distribution of physical clogging in field conditions the proposed work aims to detect key clogging factors directly in the field and to model these processes for reproducibility at other sites the fieldwork is conducted at the two stage infiltration basin in suvereto tuscany italy spatial factors are included in the analysis i e basin topography to explain clogging patterns in the field altered by erosion processes the observed clogging profiles at two sampled locations exhibiting clogging are replicated by a mathematical model based on the computation of annual erosion rates in the pond and fines redistribution the exceeding fines contents over depth are validated with an rmse of 2 53 and 12 53 the infiltration capacity of the site is estimated to reach a stable value of 90 of the initial infiltration capacity over 20 years given the suvereto basin features the model s parameterisation from field measurements represents a great advantage over existing clogging models due to its transferability to other mar sites the assessment of the risk of clogging supported by field characterization and numerical modelling is cost effective and assists the deduction of o m schemes for mar sites keywords managed aquifer recharge infiltration basin hydraulic conductivity physical clogging erosion data availability data will be

combating groundwater depletion and increasing groundwater availability dillon et al 2018 sprenger et al 2017 zhang et al 2020 mar sites design and management aim to increase these technologies operational efficiency in this regard clogging the reduction of recharge rates in space and time during mar operations is typically the key constraint in mar facility performance bouwer 2002 dillon

and bio flocs accumulation cause biological clogging baveye et al 1998 kim et al 2010 precipitation of minerals such as calcium carbonate irons and manganese oxide hydrates is responsible for chemical clogging while mechanical clogging results in the clogging layer s compression and air binding bouwer 1996 pyne 2005 although these are interrelated processes numerous studies appointed physical

mar infiltration pond recharge water high in total suspended solids tss concentrations can primarily affect the clogging layer s formation in mar s basins when tss concentrations are low biological processes are mainly responsible for declines in recharge rates and physical clogging processes are controlled by other transports and deposition mechanisms such as erosion wave action and windborne dust hutchinson et al 2013a in mar literature the effect of clogging on infiltration dynamics has been integrated into numerical simulations by the increase in the filter cake thickness around the well screen in modflow majumdar et al 2008 and by a time varying scaling factor for the hydraulic conductivity at the infiltration interface in hydrus glass et al 2020 adjusting parameters for clogging effects requires calibration from laboratory experiments or observations of water levels to replicate the overall behaviour furthermore these models do not account for different clogging rates in the spatial domain and are not a function of both the soil type and water quality glass et al 2020 clogging processes have been simulated with the numerical model clog applied in various laboratory experiments and one field study case p√©rez paricio 2001 however mathematical models for physical clogging in mar based on the mass balances of suspended particles are calibrated on the breakthrough concentrations of a specific column set up torkzaban et al 2015 xie et al 2020 besides the limited parameter transferability to other hydrogeological contexts there could be gaps from the 1d processes to the field scale representation wennberg et al 1995 spatial development and distribution of physical clogging on the field should be included in physical clogging predictions at mar sites few studies have been undertaken to understand clogging development directly in the field gette bouvarot et al 2014 collected and analysed soil samples from two basins to relate the influence of accumulated fines and biofilm growth to the decline in hydraulic properties gonzalez merchan et al 2012 continuously monitored water inflow depth and temperature for seven years in a stormwater infiltration pond and found vegetation to control clogging by creating macropores detecting spatial patterns of clogging in the field can provide further information on key clogging factors that cannot be reproduced in column experiments cannavo et al 2018 observed a heterogeneous spatial distribution of sediment layer thickness and organic matter content om mainly driven by the water flow and sediment granulometry from the inlet to the outlet zaidi et al 2020 and fetzer et al 2017 buried sand filled columns in the field to observe vertical clogging gradation at different locations by implanting pickets higher deposit thickness was observed in topographical depressions due to water stagnation and in the bank not covered by vegetation due to surface erosion zaidi et al 2020 escalante 2013 mapped the distribution of clogging processes and observed physical clogging in topographical depressions due to clay and silt deposition and subsequent compression the same consideration for the bottom geometry can be applied to furrows design as fine silts accumulate on the valleys compared to the crests escalante 2013 further work is thus necessary to assess the risk of physical clogging at mar sites including understanding spatial clogging patterns in the field potential locations for sediment accumulation and penetration or biofouling play a role in this regard racz et al 2012 existing mathematical models for physical clogging have not been applied to explain local observations of physical clogging at the field and predict the overall evolutions in infiltration capacity our work aims at assessing the risk of physical clogging in mar systems by means of site characterization techniques and mathematical modelling to achieve this aim we integrate secondary factors controlling clogging at the field spatial patterns for fines remobilisation and accumulation are detected to incorporate the controlling factors in the analysis e g the basin topography to achieve this aim we conducted a field characterization at the eu life rewat two stage infiltration basin in suvereto italy the site is distinguished by recharge water with low turbidity crossing a sedimentation pond before infiltration the presence and degree of clogging can thus be related to the remobilization of fines inside the basin section 2 materials and methods reports the description of the site the methods involved in the characterization of the site and the laboratory analysis section 3 modelling framework reports the modelling steps to reproduce the input of fines in this case from erosion processes the retention profiles formation and effect of fines on the hydraulic conductivity the modelling outcomes are validated against field observations illustrated and discussed in section 4 results and discussion section 5 conclusion highlights these findings relevance in designing new mar sites and developing operation and maintenance o m strategies the approach we propose can be transferred to other mar sites collecting data from site characterization and modelling the impact on the infiltration capacity of the site 2 material and methods in order to collect field parameters to assess the formation and distribution of clogging we conducted a field campaign in october 2021 at the eu life rewat infiltration site in suvereto tuscany italy caligaris et al 2022 the mar site and its operations are described in section 2 1 followed by the methodology for the site characterization in section 2 2 and the laboratory analysis in section 2 3 2 1 study area the mar site is located in the alluvial plain of the cornia river the area is characterized by holocene alluvial deposits presenting alternated sandy gravel layers and silty clay deposits up to 40 m in depth barazzuoli et al 1999 the recharge scheme consists of a two stage infiltration basin infiltrating harvested water from the cornia river during high flow periods caligaris et al 2022 the basin is seated in a former gravel quarry and it is divided into a settling pond 700 m2 and an infiltration pond 1600 m2 benucci et al 2017 the soil consisting of sandy silty gravel is hydraulically connected with the phreatic aquifer the drilling of a piezometer inside the basin displayed a 3 m soil core of coarse gravels in a silty matrix gm in uscs recharge operations follow two steps first the water is diverted from the river cornia through a conveyance channel and pumped at a rate of 80 l s second the water enters the settling pond where the suspended solids are deposited and then moves to the adjacent pond by three outlets a supervisory control and data acquisition scada system regulates the pump switching on off only based on the monitored water quality and the river s minimum environmental flow set thresholds e g during river peak discharge periods if the turbidity value exceeds 100 ntu the water is not pumped as the pump diverts water at 80 l s and the basin infiltration rate is lower than that a level sensor at 1 70 m depth at the centre of the basin checks that the water level is below a set level to avoid basin overflow when the threshold is exceeded the pump stops and only infiltration takes place once the level is restored to a set minimum threshold pumping starts again fig 1 presents the mar scheme upstream and downstream of the recharge plant a network of instrumented piezometers monitor the groundwater head and quality parameters in compliance with the current italian regulation for managed aquifer recharge dm 100 2016 recharge operations usually expand from december to june of the following year fig 2 shows the ponding depths and daily infiltration rates from the seasonal operations recorded at the suvereto infiltration basin italy maintenance operations are related to the scada and monitoring system maintenance sensors maintenance software update etc vegetation clearance around the site and yearly basin ploughing the basin floor is ploughed once a year before the start of the recharge season usually in november 2 2 site characterization the scope of the fieldwork at the eu life rewat infiltration site is to detect the physical and hydraulic parameters affecting clogging inside the basin at the end of the recharge season 2020 2021 an electromagnetic induction emi survey was performed with the cmd mini explorer gf instruments brno cz electromagnetic conductivity metre operated in horizontal dipole orientation emi surveys are employed to map the variability of soil properties such as the soil texture and clay content doolittle and brevik 2014 the surveyed effective penetration depths were up to 0 25 m 0 5 m and 0 9 m respectively apparent electrical conductivity eca values were recorded in continuous mode with the dgps leica tps1200 leica geosystems heerbrugg ch at 0 2 s frequency the data were post processed in rstudio to remove outliers and maps were computed via ordinary kriging interpolation in saga gis software fitting the variograms with a power model six locations were selected for soil sampling covering the infiltration pond s inlet centre and opposite side in each location soil samples were collected within an area of 20 20 cm at depth intervals of 0 1 cm 1 3 cm 3 8 cm 8 13 cm 18 23 cm coarse gravels did not always allow the augers to collect the necessary soil material for the deepest sampling depth and nor to perform soil porosity measurements by core sampling the surface crust detectable at the top with a thickness 1 mm was collected for analysis a turbidity tss correlation could not be established from the river water samples due to concentrations of suspended solids 1 mg l at the time of investigations in the proximity of the sampled locations the hydraulic characterization was performed via double ring infiltrometer tests eijkelkamp soil water giesbeek nl astm d33 85 03 standard test method the measurement points were selected in flat areas located between ridges the infiltration curve obtained from the course of infiltration capacity in time was interpreted with the philip 1957 model we set a robust regression with bisquare weights to reduce the effect of the extreme initial infiltration rates in initially dry soils the full weights were given to the bulk data reaching the saturated hydraulic conductivity asymptotically finally the map of the slopes of the basin was computed from the dgps elevation measurements in qgis 2 18 24 a filter was applied to reclassify the values in three slope classes and reduce noise based on the predominant value in a neighbourhood of 3 3 cells 2 3 laboratory analysis the soil samples collected at the field were dried and split in the laboratory for particle size and total carbon analysis first the grain size analysis was performed by wet sieving up to the 63 ¬µm diameter grain size no chemical pre treatment was deemed necessary for the analysis laser diffraction determined the volumetric grain size proportions for the fine material 63 0 7 ¬µm cilas particle size 920 in wet dispersion mode the suspension was stirred and underwent ultrasound treatment before the measuring cycle each measurement was repeated three times and the particle s size distribution statistics were computed the complete particle s size curve in the range 0 7 4000 ¬µm was then reconstructed for each sample weight loss on ignition loi test was performed to measure the organic matter content in samples the residual water content was initially removed at 105 c and then samples were placed at 360 c in the muffle furnace for two hours annotating the loss in ignition 3 modelling framework the modelling framework illustrated here has been developed based on the results of the site characterization at the suvereto infiltration site and the transferable mathematical model for physical clogging developed by lippera et al 2023 the modelling steps are reported and the workflow is illustrated in fig 3 to provide a comprehensive data analysis framework the objective of the modelling study is to validate whether the parameters collected in the field sufficiently explain the observed clogging for reproducibility at other sites first a module for soil erosion computes the eroded fines at the basin slopes providing the input of remobilized fines material the mass of remobilized fines is then assumed to be evenly distributed at the basin bottom the clogging module reproduced the vertical retention profile of fines over the sediment matrix and thus the resulting type of clogging at the locations finally reductions in infiltration rates at clogged locations are computed through the infiltration rate module and the resulting evolutions in the infiltration capacity of the basin 3 1 fines input the suvereto infiltration site presents extended banks and low concentrations of suspended solids in the recharge water thus erosion processes are included in the analysis to quantify the remobilized and redistributed fines contributing to physical clogging wind erosion from surrounding agricultural areas was excluded due to the basin location at a topographical low depression the embankments are fully covered by vegetation and a fence surrounds the area wind can still contribute in internally redistributing the fines inside a mar basin however the applicability of wind erosion models is questioned jarrah et al 2020 during recharge operations the water level fluctuates at a very slow rate wave induced shear stress is excluded given the absences of turbulences inside the basin furthermore turbidity measurements from water samples collected at the pond during operations didn t provide evidence of resuspension of sediments erosion processes pertaining to the suvereto infiltration can be attributed mainly to sheet and rill erosion during the pond s initial filling and drainage besides the soil textures other factors govern soil erodibility such as the soil structure organic matter content and permeability sheet and rill erosion models are widely used in soil and water conservation programs and can assist the assessment of sediment loads and sediment control planning flanagan et al 2001 ketema and dwarakish 2021 nearing 2013 renard et al 1997 the universal soil loss equation usle wischmeier and smith 1960 wischmeier and smith 1978 was chosen for

et al 2023 the median diameter d 50 of the sediment matrix is computed from the soil samples at the suvereto site from the median values of the curves analysed at 8 13 cm depths due to the low variation in fines content in the deeper layers the sediment distribution at depth 8 13 cm is assumed for initial conditions to be the undisturbed matrix since the last cleaning operations in november 2020 with the site ploughing a uniform sediment matrix is recreated at the top 15 cm by mixing the sediments at the start of the recharge season under this assumption for the initial conditions however deep clogging profiles cannot be discerned over the observed depth since the remobilized and deposited fines exhibited a bimodal distribution one median diameter d 50 silt is computed for the

probable stochastic maps of soil texture classes conditioned at the sampled locations are computed by sequential gaussian simulations sgs dietrich and newsam 1993 the spatial distribution of the silt attribute in the basin given the constant clay from the soil samples reflects the uncertainty in the spatial distribution of soil texture classes inside the basin the physical and hydraulic parameters

permeability at the basin bottom is converted to a decline in the bottom infiltration component ibottom and the total infiltration rate itot is iteratively computed the initial total infiltration rate itot taken as the model input is the median measured value at the suvereto infiltration basin for the recharge season 2020 2021 concluded before the site characterization the decline in total infiltration rates is thus computed exclusively from the decline in hydraulic properties at the basin bottom replicating the accumulation of sediments from the banks erosion the process accounts for the cleaning operations with the mixing the sediment matrix every year thus the overall effect of the redistribution of the sediment budget from the sides of the pond to the bottom is simulated allowing forecasting the evolution in infiltration capacity at mar sites 4 results and discussion the site characterization led to the detection of clogging patterns and the collection of clogging key parameters affecting the remobilization and redistribution of fines the maps in fig 4a show the interpolated eca values at effective penetration depths up to 0 25 m and up to 0 9 m respectively the basin appears homogenous in soil properties at both investigation depths the presence of gravel inside the basin likely contributed to obtaining uniform readings the low range of electrical conductivity values respectively 3 65 5 ms m and 3 35 4 7 ms m indicate sand and gravel sediments von suchodoletz et al 2022 the emi data confirm that mixed sediments are evenly distributed over the basin up to 1 m depth fig 4b shows the soil texture classes for the six locations at the sampled depth of 0 1 cm 1 3 cm 3 8 cm and 8 13 cm the soil classification is according to the usda soil textural triangle the sampled soils fall into the classes very gravelly sandy loam gravelly sandy loam very gravelly loam gravelly loam very gravelly silt loam and gravelly silt loam usda nrcs classification the maximum clay content for the fine earth fraction 2 mm is 12 87 in this regard the emi investigation cannot provide information on fine grained material presence at the very top because clay minerals are only present to a minor extent and effective penetration depths differ from sampling depth from the textural triangle in fig 4b locations 1 and 6 at the extremes of the pond length show clustered soil classes over depth in other sampling locations the most superficial layers exhibit a different class than the deeper layers by visual inspection the presence of clay material deposited was partially noticeable on the field however the measurements conducted by laser diffraction might have underestimated the clay content in the soil samples laser diffraction was employed for the sediment analysis for comparison with other field clogging investigations gette bouvarot et al 2014 zaidi et al 2020 4 1 erosion rates the information from the soil samples collected at different depths can be related to the spatial features of the basin in fig 5a the area with slopes in the range of 0 3 is assigned to the basin bottom 3 8 slope is the area with gentle slope and 8 30 slopes outline the basin banks on the other side fig 5b shows the observed profiles of fines content in mass percentages for the size diameter d 125 ¬µm locations 3 and 5 present increasing fines content at the surface indicating superficial clogging the other locations inside the basin do not show clear signs of clogging in contrast locations 2 and 4 show depletion of fines at the surface which might be explained by lateral erosion loamy soils with a large amount of fine sand and silt particles are susceptible to erosion since they are non cohesive sediments especially the fine sand particles could not have been transported as suspended particles from the recharge water and overcome the sedimentation pond unless redistributed internally by erosion the turbidity measurements revealed a mean value of 1 07 ntu with a standard deviation sd of 0 72 ntu for the river while concomitant turbidity measurements taken inside the recharged pond had a mean value 1 08 ntu and 0 98 ntu sd given the clear water conditions and absence of turbulences during the recharge operations the changes over the sediment matrix in locations 3 and 5 can thus be attributed to the erosion processes observed at the other locations from the locations of the analysed samples and the basin s topography in fig 5 it can be inferred that fines material is accumulated at the basin bottom from the remobilization of fines at the basin slopes this process might be enhanced during flushes at the initial time of recharge also at the start of the recharge season the fall ploughing operation might contribute to the re siting of fine particles from the erosion module described in section 3 1 an input of 54 29 kg m 2 year of soil in the fine sand silt range is estimated from the basin areas with a slope 3 and redistributed over the bottom 4 2 clogging profiles for the clogged locations 3 and 5 at the bottom of the basin the observed complete grain sized distribution curves are illustrated in detail in fig 6a and 6b the grain size distribution curves are shown for the sediments collected at the four sampled depths for comparison the particle size distributions of eroded fines in the fine sand and silt range are displayed these two groups of eroded fine material were obtained from the laser diffraction analysis of the surface crust and the finer accumulated material from the samples the clogging module described in section 3 2 is used to explain the vertical distribution of fines for these two locations from eq 5 the model estimates that 99 74 of the eroded fine sand is accumulated superficially in location 3 while the fines in the silt range deposit internally with an average deposition of 0 89 over depth at location 5 the model exhibits superficial clogging by the deposition of both eroded fine sand and finer material 100 retention in z 0 for a total thickness of the external cake of 2 05 cm the expected vertical distributions of fines computed by eq 5 are in agreement with the soil grain distributions observed at the sampled locations in location 3 fig 6a at the very superficial layer 0 1 cm mostly particles in the fine sand range are clearly accumulated superficially the matrix s deeper layers are not disturbed by intrusive sediments in the silt fraction for location 5 the estimated superficial accumulation of the total eroded sediments and the formation of a 2 05 cm thick cake layer is in agreement with the observed sediments in fig 6b the superficial layer 0 1 cm consists only of eroded fine material and the layer at 1 3 cm depth is composed partly of gravels and partly of accumulated fines material thus the sampled top 2 05 cm sediments might be solely eroded fines as explained by the model in addition in location 5 at depth 3 8 cm fig 6b the coarse fraction in the gravel range approaches the one at 8 13 cm depth being the undisturbed matrix differently from the other sampled locations the deepest layer shows higher content of particles in the fine sand range the erosion and surface accumulation processes likely heightened the bottom of the basin confirming the initial hypothesis that a uniform sediment matrix at the top 15 cm is recreated at every year cleaning operation by ploughing the site the quantification of the input of fines from the lateral erosion according to the modified usle model and the consequent retention profiles expressed as fines volume over porous media volume are validated with the observed content of fines material in the samples fig 5b here reported in detail for the clogged locations 3 and 5 fig 7a and 7b the yearly eroded mass intruded in the sediment matrix is summed to the pre existing fines content in layer 8 13 cm considered the undisturbed matrix the estimated contents of fines are compared with the observed ones from the sieving analysis for the fraction d 125 ¬µm in fig 7 the modified usle model coupled with the model for the clogging profiles explains the surplus of fines depositing over depth with a root mean square error rmse of 2 53 for location 3 and 12 53 for location 5 the parameter uncertainty in the model output is reported for ranges of total porosity values from literature according to their soil textural classes rawls et al 1983 4 3 infiltration rates the infiltration tests performed at the field during the site characterization section 2 2 indicated clogging at the basin bottom in agreement with the information from the soil samples higher hydraulic conductivity values were measured close to the basin banks where potentially erosion occurred table 1 shows that location 1 with gravelly sandy loam has an infiltration rate one order of magnitude higher than the rest of the basin with 223 56 mm h infiltration rates are lower in the two locations at the bottom of the basin presenting accumulated fines location 3 exhibits a k value near saturation of 6 67 mm h drastically lower compared to location 1 having same textural class fig 4b location 5 also exhibits a k value near saturation of 2 34 mm h a lower infiltration rate compared to location 6 also having a silt loam texture fig 4b it should be noted that according to bouwer 1986 double ring measurements can still be affected by lateral spreading of flow and edge effects this method is robust in case of an impending layer on the surface minimizing the effect of the leakage along the inner cylinder wall however the greater accuracy of the single ring with the divergence correction method has been proved by rice et al 2014 and it is recommended for the design of infiltration sites this method requires the determination of the wetting depth and distance x of lateral divergence by partially digging out the wetted soil at the conclusion of the test from the infiltration rates module presented in section 3 3 reductions in hydraulic properties eq 8 can be estimated starting from the modelled erosion of fine material over one year and deposition at the basin bottom as illustrated in the overall workflow fig 3 the accumulation of fines in location 3 and estimated reduction in soil permeability would explain an original k value of 50 17 mm h from the last cleaning operations while for location 5 the k value would have been 9 15 mm h despite location 5 presenting a higher accumulation of sediments at the surface compared to location 3 the sediment matrix is composed already of fine material at the deeper layers thus a further accumulation at the top would not lead to a drastic reduction in infiltration rates in location 3 the fine sand material on the top would have a higher impact on the native coarser matrix instead overall the estimated reductions in hydraulic conductivity can explain an initial value in the range of the deeper layer s textural classes the same analysis can be extended to the entire basin and for the next operating years other factors typically implicated in field clogging are the precipitation of calcium carbonate or biofilm formation the dilute hydrochloric acid hcl solution test revealed a violent effervescence for the surface crust thus a high content of carbonates also the higher content of soil organic carbon 7 80 in the surface crust indicated potential for biological clogging e g biofilm formation on the substrate the modelling of chemical and biological activities interconnected with the fines mobilization goes beyond the purposes of this study although the surface crust might have had a role in superficially retaining fines and a crust of 1 mm thickness can reduce infiltration rates during the wetting period forming an impermeable layer measuring the hydraulic conductivity in dry conditions the crust layer was already cracked during the infiltration tests hence having a low impact on the infiltration rates which were controlled by the thicker deposits of fine material the infiltration basin undergoes a long drying period typically from june to november favouring the decomposition and shrinking of the biological and chemical clogging materials the recharge operations taking place mostly in winter and spring time due to the recharge source availability considerably reduce the hydraulic loading and the associated biological chemical clogging compared to other mar schemes the analysis is extended to the entire basin based on the already described physical processes to assess the impact of the redistribution and accumulation of sediments due to the limited number of sampling points inside the basin the uncertainty in the local variability of soil texture classes within the basin was incorporated by performing multiple equally probable stochastic realizations by sequential gaussian simulations sgs see dietrich and newsam 1993 the modelling procedure is described in section 3 3 fig 8 shows the decrease in infiltration capacity following 20 years of operations with a highlight on the median estimation the overall model assumes that the soil is mixed by the cleaning operation at the start of each operation year thus recreating a uniform sediment matrix in the upper 15 cm due to the remobilization and redistribution of fines from the basin slopes to the bottom the total infiltration capacity might decrease to a stable value of 90 of the original infiltration capacity mixing operations for the upper 15 cm of sediments at the start of the operating season are included in the analysis when the total infiltration capacity reaches a stable value the bottom is clogged and the basin s infiltration mainly occurs at the sides as shown in fig 8 the decrease in infiltration rates would be negligible over the years the extensive slopes of the basin undergoing erosion would not be impacted by clogging despite the fines colmation at the bottom the investigated mar site maintained high stable infiltration rates over the past four years of operations in agreement with our simulation the median value measured in the operation year 2019 2020 is 2 97 m d while in the operation year 2020 2021 is 2 91 m d in comparison to the year before it is a 98 ratio given the low suspended solids in the recharge water the low content of clays the presence of gravels and vegetation at the banks contributing to slope stability the suvereto infiltration basin has proved to be an excellent example for mar design 5 conclusions our work contributes to understanding secondary factors controlling physical clogging in mar systems with low input of suspended solids despite the excellent quality of the recharged water and the sediment matrix s apparent homogeneity physical clogging was detected at the bottom of the investigated basin this study highlights the role of basin topography in the formation of clogging patterns we found in the field that particles ranging from fine sand to silt were eroded superficially starting from a 3 slope these fines are likely transported in topographic depressions during rainfall events and the washing of slopes caused by the complete drainage and following filling of the mar site during recharge operations the universal soil loss equation usle present limitations in incorporating soil losses from other types of erosion than rainfall processes accounting for seasonal effects or suiting specific site conditions benavidez et al 2018 the modified usle could approximate the quantity of remobilized fines and redistribution over the bottom through the observation of lateral erosion at sampled locations concepts for process based erosion models to predict lateral erosion of infiltration basins should be developed due to the lack in literature given the fines input to the bottom the developed model for clogging was validated with a rmse of 2 53 and 12 53 compared to the fines content variations observed at discrete depths from the two clogged locations under the current maintenance procedures the consequent analysis of the reduction in hydraulic properties was extended to the whole basin for the next 20 years of operations for the suvereto infiltration basin the remobilization of fines constituted mainly by silt particles leads to a median stable value of infiltration capacity at 90 of the initial infiltration capacity our analysis shows that the basin s topographical features can contribute to sustaining high infiltration rates prior one dimensional analysis of clogging from the literature in sand columns cannot depict soil heterogeneity and spatial factors contributing to fines remobilization and accumulation field studies on surface spreading facilities also observed higher permeability at the sidewalls of the basins due to the redistribution of fines in infiltration systems conley et al 2020 noted that the bottom clogged rapidly and very little material accumulated on the side infiltration surfaces although it might appear convenient to design a deep basin to maintain lateral infiltration it is not recommended in shallow aquifer systems to avoid groundwater mounding moreover maximum side slopes of 1 3 v h are recommended by hutchinson et al 2013a for infiltration practices design to avoid instability basin banks should also be protected from erosion and wave action as a design strategy and it is warned of the inability to clean deeper basins on banks with a 1 3 slope hutchinson et al 2013b to conclude in basins with extended banks the assessment of the risk of clogging should account not only for the input in suspended particles from the recharge water but also for the potential erosion at the sides given the specific basin features design consideration can be derived to reduce clogging at mar sites during the planning phase our work based on site characterization combined with modelling is a cost effective method to assess the risk of physical clogging and can be replicated at multiple sites improving estimations of o m costs funding the research leading to these results has received funding from the european

20,managed aquifer recharge mar techniques are in demand to cope with water scarcity challenges posed by climate change and groundwater overexploitation one of the long lasting technical issues associated with mar systems is physical clogging the intrusion and deposition of external fines during water recharge reduce the infiltration capacity of the site over time operation and maintenance o m costs are experienced directly at the site to restore the original efficiency of infiltration rates thus investors need reliable estimations of the risk of clogging during the planning of the site as a rule in mar design the main parameter of concern for physical clogging is the total suspended solids tss and most clogging models rely on experiment calibrations in 1d sand columns however secondary processes can control the development and spatial distribution of physical clogging in field conditions the proposed work aims to detect key clogging factors directly in the field and to model these processes for reproducibility at other sites the fieldwork is conducted at the two stage infiltration basin in suvereto tuscany italy spatial factors are included in the analysis i e basin topography to explain clogging patterns in the field altered by erosion processes the observed clogging profiles at two sampled locations exhibiting clogging are replicated by a mathematical model based on the computation of annual erosion rates in the pond and fines redistribution the exceeding fines contents over depth are validated with an rmse of 2 53 and 12 53 the infiltration capacity of the site is estimated to reach a stable value of 90 of the initial infiltration capacity over 20 years given the suvereto basin features the model s parameterisation from field measurements represents a great advantage over existing clogging models due to its transferability to other mar sites the assessment of the risk of clogging supported by field characterization and numerical modelling is cost effective and assists the deduction of o m schemes for mar sites keywords managed aquifer recharge infiltration basin hydraulic conductivity physical clogging erosion data availability data will be

operational efficiency in this regard clogging the reduction of recharge rates in space and time during mar operations is typically the key constraint in mar facility performance bouwer 2002 dillon

mar infiltration pond recharge water high in total suspended solids tss concentrations can primarily affect the clogging layer s formation in mar s basins when tss concentrations are low biological processes are mainly responsible for declines in recharge rates and physical clogging processes are controlled by other transports and deposition mechanisms such as erosion wave action and windborne dust hutchinson et al 2013a in mar literature the effect of clogging on infiltration dynamics has been integrated into numerical simulations by the increase in the filter cake thickness around the well screen in modflow majumdar et al 2008 and by a time varying scaling factor for the hydraulic conductivity at the infiltration interface in hydrus glass et al 2020 adjusting parameters for clogging effects requires calibration from laboratory experiments or observations of water levels to replicate the overall behaviour furthermore these models do not account for different clogging rates in the spatial domain and are not a function of both the soil type and water quality glass et al 2020 clogging processes have been simulated with the numerical model clog applied in various

breakthrough concentrations of a specific column set up torkzaban et al 2015 xie et al 2020 besides the limited parameter transferability to other hydrogeological contexts there could be gaps from the 1d processes to the field scale representation wennberg et al 1995 spatial development and distribution of physical clogging on the field should be included in physical clogging predictions at mar sites few studies have been undertaken to understand clogging development directly in the field gette bouvarot et al 2014 collected and analysed soil samples from two basins to relate the influence of accumulated fines and biofilm growth to the decline in hydraulic properties gonzalez merchan et al 2012 continuously monitored water inflow depth and temperature for seven years in a stormwater infiltration pond and found vegetation to control clogging by creating macropores detecting spatial patterns of clogging in the field can provide further information on key clogging factors that cannot be reproduced in column experiments cannavo et al 2018 observed a heterogeneous spatial distribution of sediment layer thickness and organic matter content om mainly driven by the water flow and sediment granulometry from the inlet to the outlet zaidi et al 2020 and fetzer et al 2017 buried sand filled columns in the field to observe vertical clogging gradation at different locations by implanting pickets higher deposit thickness was observed in topographical depressions due to water stagnation and in the bank not covered by vegetation due to surface erosion zaidi et al 2020 escalante 2013 mapped the distribution of clogging processes and observed physical clogging in topographical depressions due to clay and silt deposition and subsequent compression the same consideration for the bottom geometry can be applied to furrows design as fine silts accumulate on the valleys compared to the crests escalante 2013 further work is thus necessary to assess the risk of physical clogging at mar sites including understanding spatial clogging patterns in the field potential locations for sediment accumulation and penetration or biofouling play a role in this regard racz et al 2012 existing mathematical models for physical clogging have not been applied to explain local observations of physical clogging at the field and predict the overall evolutions in infiltration capacity our work aims at assessing the risk of physical clogging in mar systems by means of site characterization techniques and mathematical modelling to achieve this aim we integrate secondary factors controlling clogging at the field spatial patterns for fines remobilisation and accumulation are detected to incorporate the controlling factors in the analysis e g the basin topography to achieve this aim we conducted a field characterization at the eu life rewat two stage infiltration basin in suvereto italy the site is distinguished by recharge water with low turbidity crossing a sedimentation pond before infiltration the presence and degree of clogging can thus be related to the remobilization of fines inside the basin section 2 materials and methods reports the description of the site the methods involved in the characterization of the site and the laboratory analysis section 3 modelling framework reports the modelling steps to reproduce the input of fines

discussed in section 4 results and discussion section 5 conclusion highlights these findings relevance in designing new mar sites and developing operation and maintenance o m strategies the approach we propose can be transferred to other mar sites collecting data from site characterization and modelling the impact on the infiltration capacity of the site 2 material and methods in order to collect field parameters to assess the formation and distribution of clogging we conducted a field campaign in october 2021 at the eu life rewat infiltration site in suvereto tuscany italy caligaris et al 2022 the mar site and its operations are described in section 2 1 followed by the methodology for the site characterization in section 2 2 and the laboratory analysis in section 2 3 2 1 study area the mar site is located in the alluvial plain of the cornia river the area is characterized by holocene alluvial deposits presenting alternated sandy gravel layers and silty clay deposits up to 40 m in depth barazzuoli et al 1999 the recharge scheme consists of a two stage infiltration basin infiltrating harvested water from the cornia river during high flow periods caligaris et al 2022 the basin is seated in a former gravel quarry and it is divided into a settling pond 700 m2 and an infiltration pond 1600 m2 benucci et al 2017 the soil consisting of sandy silty gravel is hydraulically connected with the phreatic aquifer the drilling of a piezometer inside the basin displayed a 3 m soil core of coarse gravels in a silty matrix gm in uscs recharge operations follow two steps first the water is diverted from the river cornia through a conveyance channel and pumped at a rate of 80 l s second the water enters the settling pond where the suspended solids are deposited and then moves to the adjacent pond by three outlets a supervisory control and data acquisition scada system regulates the pump switching on off only based on the monitored water quality and the river s minimum environmental flow set thresholds e g during river peak discharge periods if the turbidity value exceeds 100 ntu the water is not pumped as the pump diverts water at 80 l s and the basin infiltration rate is lower than that a level sensor at 1 70 m depth at the centre of the basin checks that the water level is below a set level to avoid basin overflow when the threshold is exceeded the pump stops and only infiltration takes place once the level is restored to a set minimum threshold pumping starts again fig 1 presents the mar scheme upstream and downstream of the recharge plant a network of instrumented piezometers monitor the groundwater head and quality parameters in compliance with the current italian regulation for managed aquifer recharge dm 100 2016 recharge operations usually expand from december to june of the following year fig 2 shows the ponding depths and daily infiltration rates from the seasonal operations recorded at the suvereto infiltration basin italy

floor is ploughed once a year before the start of the recharge season usually in november 2 2 site characterization the scope of the fieldwork at the eu life rewat infiltration site is to detect the physical and hydraulic parameters affecting clogging inside the basin at the end of the recharge season 2020 2021 an electromagnetic induction emi survey was performed with the cmd mini explorer gf instruments brno cz electromagnetic conductivity metre operated in horizontal dipole orientation emi surveys are employed to map the variability of soil properties such as the soil texture and clay

with the dgps leica tps1200 leica geosystems heerbrugg ch at 0 2 s frequency the data were post processed in rstudio to remove outliers and maps were computed via ordinary kriging interpolation in saga gis software fitting the variograms with a power model six locations were selected for soil sampling covering the infiltration pond s inlet centre and opposite side in each location soil samples were collected within an area of 20 20 cm at depth intervals of 0 1 cm 1 3 cm 3 8 cm 8 13 cm 18 23 cm coarse gravels did not always allow the augers to collect the necessary soil material for the deepest sampling depth and nor to perform soil porosity measurements by core sampling the surface crust detectable at the top with a thickness 1 mm was collected for analysis a turbidity tss correlation could not be established from the river water samples due to concentrations of suspended solids 1 mg l at the time of investigations in the proximity of the sampled locations the hydraulic characterization was performed via double ring infiltrometer tests eijkelkamp soil water giesbeek nl astm d33 85 03 standard test method the measurement points were selected in flat areas located between ridges the infiltration curve obtained from the course of infiltration capacity in time was interpreted with the philip 1957 model we set a robust regression with bisquare weights to reduce the effect of the extreme initial infiltration rates in initially dry soils the full weights were given to the bulk data reaching the saturated hydraulic conductivity asymptotically finally the map of the slopes of the basin was computed from the dgps elevation measurements in qgis 2 18 24 a filter was applied to reclassify the values in three slope classes and reduce noise based on the predominant value in a neighbourhood of 3 3 cells 2 3 laboratory analysis the soil samples collected at the field were dried and split in the laboratory for particle size and total carbon analysis first the grain size analysis was performed by wet sieving up to the 63 ¬µm diameter grain size no chemical pre treatment was deemed necessary for the analysis laser diffraction determined the volumetric grain size proportions for the fine material 63 0 7 ¬µm cilas particle size 920 in wet dispersion mode the suspension was stirred and underwent ultrasound treatment before the measuring cycle each measurement was repeated three times and the particle s size distribution statistics were computed the complete particle s size curve in the range 0 7 4000 ¬µm was then reconstructed for each sample weight loss on ignition loi test was performed to measure the organic matter content in samples the residual water content was initially removed at 105 c and then samples were placed at 360 c in the muffle furnace for two hours annotating the loss in ignition 3 modelling framework the modelling framework illustrated here has been developed based on the results of the site characterization at the suvereto infiltration site and the transferable mathematical model for physical clogging developed by lippera et al 2023 the modelling steps are reported and the workflow is illustrated in fig 3 to provide a comprehensive data analysis framework the objective of the modelling study is to validate whether the parameters collected in the field sufficiently explain the observed clogging for reproducibility at other sites first a module for soil erosion computes the eroded fines at the basin slopes providing the input of remobilized fines material the mass of remobilized fines is then assumed to be evenly distributed at the basin bottom the clogging module reproduced the vertical retention profile of fines over the sediment matrix and thus the resulting type of clogging at the locations finally reductions in infiltration rates at clogged locations are computed through the infiltration rate module and the resulting evolutions in the infiltration capacity of the basin 3 1 fines input the suvereto infiltration site presents extended banks and low concentrations of suspended solids in the recharge water thus erosion processes are included in the analysis to quantify the remobilized and redistributed fines contributing to physical clogging wind erosion from surrounding agricultural areas was excluded due to the basin location at a topographical low depression the embankments are fully covered by vegetation and a fence surrounds the area wind can still contribute in internally redistributing the fines inside a mar basin however the applicability of wind erosion models is questioned jarrah et al 2020 during recharge operations the water level fluctuates at a very slow rate wave induced shear stress is excluded given the absences of turbulences inside the basin furthermore turbidity measurements from water samples collected at the pond during operations didn t provide evidence of resuspension of sediments erosion processes pertaining to the suvereto infiltration can be attributed mainly to sheet and rill erosion during the pond s initial filling and drainage besides the soil textures other factors govern soil erodibility such as the soil structure organic matter content and permeability sheet and rill erosion models are widely used in soil and water conservation programs and can assist the assessment of sediment loads and sediment

et al 2023 the median diameter d 50 of the sediment matrix is computed from the soil samples at the suvereto site from the median values of the curves analysed at 8 13 cm depths due to the low variation in fines content in the deeper layers the sediment distribution at depth 8 13 cm is assumed for initial conditions to be the undisturbed matrix since the last cleaning operations in november 2020 with the site ploughing a uniform sediment matrix is recreated at the top 15 cm by mixing the sediments at the start of the recharge season under this assumption for the initial conditions

itot taken as the model input is the median measured value at the suvereto infiltration basin for the recharge season 2020 2021 concluded before the site characterization the decline in total infiltration rates is thus computed exclusively from the decline in hydraulic properties at the basin bottom replicating the accumulation of sediments from the banks erosion the process accounts for the cleaning operations with the mixing the sediment matrix every year thus the overall effect of the redistribution of the sediment budget from the sides of the pond to the bottom is simulated allowing forecasting the evolution in infiltration capacity at mar sites 4 results and discussion the site characterization led to the detection of clogging patterns and the collection of clogging key parameters affecting the remobilization and redistribution of fines the maps in fig 4a show the interpolated eca values at effective penetration depths up to 0 25 m and up to 0 9 m respectively the basin appears homogenous in soil properties at both investigation depths the presence of gravel inside the basin likely contributed to obtaining uniform readings the low range of electrical

classification the maximum clay content for the fine earth fraction 2 mm is 12 87 in this regard the emi investigation cannot provide information on fine grained material presence at the very top because clay minerals are only present to a minor extent and effective penetration depths differ from sampling depth from the textural triangle in fig 4b locations 1 and 6 at the extremes of the pond length show clustered soil classes over depth in other sampling locations the most superficial layers exhibit a different class than the deeper layers by visual inspection the presence of clay material deposited was partially noticeable on the field however the measurements conducted by laser diffraction might have underestimated the clay content in the soil samples laser diffraction was employed for the sediment analysis for comparison with other field clogging investigations gette bouvarot et al 2014 zaidi et al 2020 4 1 erosion rates the information from the soil samples collected at different depths can be related to the spatial features of the basin in fig 5a the area with slopes in the range of 0 3 is assigned to the basin bottom 3 8 slope is the area with gentle slope and 8 30 slopes outline the basin banks on the other side fig 5b shows the observed profiles of fines content in mass percentages for the size diameter d 125 ¬µm locations 3 and 5 present increasing fines content at the surface indicating superficial clogging the other locations inside the basin do not show clear signs of clogging in contrast locations 2 and 4 show depletion of fines at the surface which might be explained by lateral erosion loamy soils with a large amount of fine sand and silt particles are susceptible to erosion since they are non cohesive sediments especially the fine sand particles could not have been transported as suspended particles from the recharge water and overcome the sedimentation pond unless redistributed internally by erosion the turbidity measurements revealed a mean value of 1 07 ntu with a standard deviation sd of 0 72 ntu for the river while concomitant turbidity measurements taken inside the recharged pond had a mean value 1 08 ntu and 0 98 ntu sd given the clear water conditions and absence of turbulences during the recharge operations the changes over the sediment matrix in locations 3 and 5 can thus be attributed to the erosion processes observed at the other locations from the locations of the analysed samples and the basin s topography in fig 5 it can be inferred that fines material is accumulated at the basin bottom from the remobilization of fines at the basin slopes this process might be enhanced during flushes at the initial time of recharge also at the start of the recharge season the fall ploughing operation might contribute to the re siting of fine particles from the erosion module described in section 3 1 an input of 54 29 kg m 2 year of soil in the fine sand silt range is estimated from the basin areas with a slope 3 and redistributed over the bottom 4 2 clogging profiles for the clogged locations 3 and 5 at the bottom of the basin the observed complete grain sized distribution curves are illustrated in detail in fig 6a and 6b the grain size distribution curves are shown for the sediments collected at the four sampled depths for comparison the particle size distributions of eroded fines in the fine sand and silt range are displayed these two groups of eroded fine material were obtained from the laser diffraction analysis of the surface crust and the finer accumulated material from the samples the clogging module described in section 3 2 is used to explain the vertical distribution of fines for these two locations from eq 5 the model estimates that 99 74 of the eroded fine sand is accumulated superficially in location 3 while the fines in the silt range deposit internally with an average deposition of 0 89 over depth at location 5 the model exhibits superficial clogging by the deposition of both eroded fine sand and finer material 100 retention in z 0 for a total thickness of the external cake of 2 05 cm the expected vertical distributions of fines computed by eq 5 are in agreement with the soil grain distributions observed at the sampled locations in location 3 fig 6a at the very superficial layer 0 1 cm mostly particles in the fine sand range are clearly accumulated superficially the matrix s deeper layers are not disturbed by intrusive sediments in the silt fraction for location 5 the estimated superficial accumulation of the total eroded sediments and the formation of a 2 05 cm thick cake layer is in agreement with the observed sediments in fig 6b the superficial layer 0 1 cm consists only of eroded fine material and the layer at 1 3 cm depth is composed partly of gravels and partly of accumulated fines material thus the sampled top 2 05 cm sediments might be solely eroded fines as explained by the model in addition in location 5 at depth 3 8 cm fig 6b the coarse fraction in the gravel range approaches the one at 8 13 cm depth being the undisturbed matrix differently from the other sampled locations the deepest layer shows higher content of particles in the fine sand range the erosion and surface accumulation processes likely heightened the bottom of the basin confirming the initial hypothesis that a uniform sediment matrix at the top 15 cm is recreated at every year cleaning operation by ploughing the site the quantification of the input of fines from the lateral erosion according to the modified usle model and the consequent retention profiles expressed as fines volume over porous media volume are validated with the observed content of fines material in the samples fig 5b here reported in detail for the clogged locations 3 and 5 fig 7a and 7b the yearly eroded mass intruded in the sediment matrix is summed to the pre existing fines content in layer 8 13 cm considered the undisturbed matrix the estimated contents of fines are compared with the observed ones from the sieving analysis for the fraction d 125 ¬µm in fig 7 the modified usle model coupled with the model for the clogging profiles explains the surplus of fines depositing over depth with a root mean square error rmse of 2 53 for location 3 and 12 53 for location 5 the parameter uncertainty in the model output is reported for ranges of total porosity values from literature according to their soil textural classes rawls et al 1983 4 3 infiltration rates the infiltration tests performed at the field during the site characterization section 2 2 indicated clogging at the basin bottom in agreement with the information from the soil samples higher hydraulic conductivity values were measured close to the basin banks where potentially erosion occurred table 1 shows that location 1 with gravelly sandy loam has an infiltration rate one order of magnitude higher than the rest of the basin with 223 56 mm h infiltration rates are lower in the two locations at the bottom of the basin presenting accumulated fines location 3 exhibits a k value near saturation of 6 67 mm h drastically lower compared to location 1 having same textural class fig 4b location 5 also exhibits a k value near saturation of 2 34 mm h a lower infiltration rate compared to location 6 also having a silt loam texture fig 4b it should be noted that according to bouwer 1986 double ring measurements can still be affected by lateral spreading of flow and edge effects this method is robust in case of an impending layer on the surface minimizing the effect of the leakage along the inner cylinder wall however the greater accuracy of the single ring with the divergence correction method has been proved by rice et al 2014 and it is recommended for the design of infiltration sites this method requires the determination of the wetting depth and distance x of lateral divergence by partially digging out the wetted soil at the conclusion of the test from the infiltration rates module presented in section 3 3 reductions in hydraulic properties eq 8 can be estimated starting from the modelled erosion of fine material over one year and deposition at the basin bottom as illustrated in the overall workflow fig 3 the accumulation of fines in location 3 and estimated reduction in soil permeability would explain an original k value of 50 17 mm h from the last cleaning operations while for location 5 the k value would have been 9 15 mm h despite location 5 presenting a higher accumulation of sediments at the surface compared to location 3 the sediment matrix is composed already of fine material at the deeper layers thus a further accumulation at the top would not lead to a drastic reduction in infiltration rates in location 3 the fine sand material on the top would have a higher impact on the native coarser matrix instead overall the estimated reductions in hydraulic conductivity can explain an initial value in the range of the deeper layer s textural classes the same analysis can be extended to the entire basin and for the next operating years other factors typically implicated in field clogging are the precipitation of calcium carbonate or biofilm formation the dilute hydrochloric acid hcl solution test revealed a violent effervescence for the surface crust thus a high content of carbonates also the higher content of soil organic carbon 7 80 in the surface crust indicated potential for biological clogging e g biofilm formation on the substrate the modelling of chemical and biological activities interconnected with the fines mobilization goes beyond the purposes of this study although the surface crust might have had a role in superficially retaining fines and a crust of 1 mm thickness can reduce infiltration rates during the wetting period forming an impermeable layer measuring the hydraulic conductivity in dry conditions the crust layer was already cracked during the infiltration tests hence having a low impact on the infiltration rates which were controlled by the thicker deposits of fine material the infiltration basin undergoes a long drying period typically from june to november favouring the decomposition and shrinking of the biological and chemical clogging materials the recharge operations taking place mostly in winter and spring time due to the recharge source availability considerably reduce the hydraulic loading and the associated biological chemical clogging compared to other mar schemes the analysis is extended to the entire basin based on the already described physical processes to assess the impact of the redistribution and accumulation of sediments due to the limited number of sampling points inside the basin the uncertainty in the local variability of soil texture classes within the basin was incorporated by performing multiple equally probable stochastic realizations by sequential gaussian simulations sgs see dietrich and newsam 1993 the modelling procedure is described in section 3 3 fig 8 shows the decrease in infiltration capacity following 20 years of operations with a highlight on the median estimation the overall model assumes that the soil is mixed by the cleaning operation at the start of each operation year thus recreating a uniform sediment matrix in the upper 15 cm due to the remobilization and redistribution of fines from the basin slopes to the bottom the total infiltration capacity might decrease to a stable value of 90 of the original infiltration capacity mixing operations for the upper 15 cm of sediments at the start of the operating season are included in the analysis when the total infiltration capacity reaches a stable value the bottom is clogged and the basin s infiltration mainly occurs at the sides as shown in fig 8 the decrease in infiltration rates would be negligible over the years the extensive slopes of the basin undergoing erosion would not be impacted by clogging despite the fines colmation at the bottom the investigated mar site maintained high stable infiltration rates over the past four years of operations in agreement with our simulation the median value measured in the operation year 2019 2020 is 2 97 m d while in the operation year 2020 2021 is 2 91 m d in comparison to the year before it is a 98 ratio given the low suspended solids in the recharge water the low content of clays the presence of gravels and vegetation at the banks contributing to slope stability the suvereto infiltration basin has proved to be an excellent example for mar design 5 conclusions our work contributes to understanding secondary factors controlling physical clogging in mar systems with low input of suspended solids despite the excellent quality of the recharged water and the sediment matrix s apparent homogeneity physical clogging was detected at the bottom of the investigated basin this study highlights the role of basin topography in the formation of clogging patterns we found in the field that particles ranging from fine sand to silt were eroded superficially starting from a 3 slope these fines are likely transported in topographic depressions during rainfall events and the washing of slopes caused by the complete drainage and following filling of the mar site during recharge operations the universal soil loss equation usle present limitations in incorporating soil losses from other types of erosion than rainfall processes accounting for seasonal effects or suiting specific site conditions benavidez et al 2018 the modified usle could approximate the quantity of remobilized fines and redistribution over the bottom through the observation of lateral erosion at sampled locations concepts for process based erosion models to predict lateral erosion of infiltration basins should be developed due to the lack in literature given the fines input to the bottom the developed model for clogging was validated with a rmse of 2 53 and 12 53 compared to the fines content variations observed at discrete depths from the two clogged locations under the current maintenance procedures the consequent analysis of the reduction in hydraulic properties was extended to the whole basin for the next 20 years of operations for the suvereto infiltration basin the remobilization of fines constituted mainly by silt particles leads to a median stable value of infiltration capacity at 90 of the initial infiltration capacity our analysis shows that the basin s topographical features can contribute to sustaining high infiltration rates prior one dimensional analysis of clogging from the literature in sand columns cannot depict soil heterogeneity and spatial factors contributing to fines remobilization and accumulation field studies on surface spreading facilities also observed higher permeability at the sidewalls of the basins due to the redistribution of fines in infiltration systems conley et al 2020 noted that the bottom clogged rapidly and very little material accumulated on the side infiltration surfaces although it might appear convenient to design a deep basin to maintain lateral infiltration it is not recommended in shallow aquifer systems to avoid groundwater mounding moreover maximum side slopes of 1 3 v h are recommended by hutchinson et al 2013a for infiltration practices design to avoid instability basin banks should also be protected from erosion and wave action as a design strategy and it is warned of the inability to clean deeper basins on banks with a 1 3 slope hutchinson et al 2013b to conclude in basins with extended banks the assessment of the risk of clogging should account not only for the input in suspended particles from the recharge water but also for the potential erosion at the sides given the specific basin features design consideration can be derived to reduce clogging at mar sites during the planning phase our work based on site characterization combined with modelling is a cost effective method to assess the risk of physical clogging and can be replicated at multiple sites improving estimations of o m costs funding the research leading to these results has received funding from the european

21,the stable isotopic signature of xylem water differs from those of rainfall and river water without considering the water exchange through the vapor phase this phenomenon implies that when the event water new water infiltrates the soil a part of the pre event water old water is isolated the isolation and immobilization of old water are suspected because of the low matrix potential because evaporation is the main process that can reduce the matrix potential after quick gravitational drainage we conjectured that after evaporation the old water hides in small pores and increases the likelihood of air entrapment which separates the new and old water to examine and visualize the potential effect of evaporation on the interactions between old and new water we performed a series of wetting drainage evaporation wetting experiments within pore doublet micromodels pdms the experimental results showed that air bubbles are trapped when the menisci of the residual liquid are sufficiently far from the inlet and outlet of the pdm evaporation can increase these distances resulting in the formation of larger air bubbles the air bubble trapped upstream prevents the invading liquid from quickly flushing the original residual liquid out of the pdm nevertheless the invading wetting liquid is still able to bypass the trapped air bubbles and mix with the residual wetting phase via corner flow in addition the remobilization of the upstream bubble enhances the process of removing the old trapped liquid keywords wetting phase entrapment pore doublet micromodels new old water interaction data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction the interplay between pre event water old water and event water new water e g from rainfall irrigation and leakage in the vadose zone affects the water flow path and solution transport the interplay therefore influences the water components and quality in streams and groundwater and the nutrients uptaken by plants experiments and numerical simulations have shown that some of the old water is not mixed or displaced by the new water and remains in porous media berkowitz 2014 gouet kaplan and berkowitz 2011 gouet kaplan et al 2009 oerter and bowen 2017 this observation has resulted in different conceptions of the old water and new water interaction horton and hawkins 1965 conducted soil column experiments and found that rainwater tended to flow through the columns along flow paths that were wet because of water retained by soil at field capacity this result implied that the retained water old water is replaced by rainwater and the retained water flows out of the column earlier than the rainwater sklash et al 1986 observed that both the current storm rain and stored water contributed the stream runoff generated by catchments during storm events and the stored water mainly contributed to the earlier occurrence of runoff kirchner et al 2000 reported that the concentration of contaminants flushed into a stream is higher at the beginning of rainfall and then decreases after the rainfall event the macropore flow of new water cannot explain the through flow response in catchments pearce et al 1986 sklash et al 1986 using a rainfall simulator in a tracer test turton et al 1995 observed a decreasing ratio of subsurface flow contributed by the water from the first rainfall event in the second and third rainfall events using similar hydrographs when rainfall intensity increased the old water contribution ratio decreased turton et al 1995 concluded that the macropore flow was the most likely flow path the results of stable water isotope analyses have shown that the source of xylem water is different from those of groundwater and stream water during wet seasons brooks et al 2010 evaristo et al 2015 sprenger et al 2016 instead the isotopic signature of xylem water is similar to that of pre event water rather than to that of event water in a seasonally irrigated urban landscaped garden oerter and bowen 2017 analyzed the stable water isotope of irrigation xylem and soil water based on the isotope analysis results the authors deduced that after long periods of drying the old water from the initial infiltration event is not easily replaced by or does not easily mix with the new water brooks et al 2010 proposed the two water worlds hypothesis which supposes that no isotopic exchange occurs between the soil bound and mobile water during the wet season vargas et al 2017 examined the two water worlds hypothesis through pot experiments with successive wet and dry periods the results of isotope analyses of xylem water from these periods however showed that approximately 74 96 of the bond water was exchanged with mobile water as such an investigation into the fundamental mechanisms controlling the occurrence of these two water worlds is required microfluidic technology has been applied to investigate the pore scale mechanisms of porous media flow optically transparent microfluidic devices micromodels allow researchers to directly observe the behavior of fluids at the pore scale celia et al 1995 rufai 2018 wu et al 2017 xu et al 2017 different materials including glass quartz polydimethylsiloxane pdms polymethylmethacrylate pmma and different types of plastics hsu et al 2017 karadimitriou and hassanizadeh 2012 rufai 2018 have been used to fabricate these micromodels the designed pore structure can be constructed in a micromodel using different approaches karadimitriou and hassanizadeh 2012 rufai 2018 chatenever and calhoun jr 1952 packed a monolayer of glass beads between two flat glass plates which was the earliest micromodel used for studying flow in porous media wang et al 2014 milled the microchannel using a mechanical milling device gouet kaplan and berkowitz 2011 created microchannels on glass using chemical etching which have since been widely used to fabricate glass micromodels xu et al 2017 with a lattice micromodel gouet kaplan and berkowitz 2011 performed two successive cycles of infiltration experiments and determined the old water remaining in the micromodel at the end of the experiments after the second infiltration most of the old water were flushed out whereas many pure old water pockets remained stable in the micromodel although gouet kaplan and berkowitz 2011 did not discuss the pore scale mechanism in detail the remaining pure old water pockets implied that air can separate old and new water in addition trapped air can enhance the stability of the old water pockets owing to the jamin effect smith and crane 1930 and the hysteresis of the contact angle hsu et al 2012 air entrapment can influence old new water interactions such as through air blocking the contact between the new and old water air entrapment is related to the pore geometry invading rate of the wetting phase viscosity and capillaries of the fluids geistlinger et al 2016 lake 1989 topp et al 1967 in addition a long drying duration can change the geometry of the trapped old water and enhance air bubble formation during new water invasion the high mixing rate in the pot experiments reported by vargas et al 2017 might have been due to the limited evaporation since the pots were covered with plastic sheets in other studies in undisturbed areas and urban parks brooks et al 2010 evaristo et al 2015 oerter and bowen 2017 sprenger et al 2016 the residual soil water saturation should be significantly decreased by evapotranspiration nevertheless how evaporation affects new water interplay has not yet been well studied and discussed to better understand the influence of trapped air bubbles and evaporation on old new water interactions in this study we performed two cycle infiltration experiments in pore doublet models pdms which we connected to two parallel pore channels with different widths the designed channel width ratios were 1 4 d100 and 2 4 d200 the narrow channel in the pdm represented a small pore in which the wetting phase could be retained we observed different levels of evaporation between the two wetting cycles the wetting drainage evaporation wetting process was analogous to the rainfall drying rainfall cycle we demonstrated the interplay between the old liquid the residual wetting phase after the first drainage and a new liquid invading wetting liquid in the second wetting the results of experimentation and theoretical analysis showed that when air bubbles were trapped between the new and old liquids the air bubbles prevented the displacement of the old liquid by the new liquid when the film in the wetting phase existed the invading new liquid flowed and connected with the old liquid through the film at the corners 2 mathematical models for pdm we performed two sets of experiments with different wetting drainage and evaporation steps wetting drainage wetting wdw and wetting drainage evaporation wetting wdew with pdms with a shrinking part in one of the channels as shown in fig 1 a in terms of our suppositions of the impact of evaporation on interactions between old and new liquids and relative mathematical models we conjecture that the conditions of trapping air that separated the liquids are dominated by the relative position between the liquids this position can be changed due to evaporation in wdew for wdw this relative position should be determined by the movement of the bulk menisci in the channels during the drainage step and ideally this trapped old liquid is the initial condition in the second wetting steps to analyze factors influencing new and old water interaction we derived simple models describing the menisci movement during the drainage step and the conditions of the air entrapment in the second wetting step 2 1 receding length of menisci lŒ∂m and lŒ∂m during drainage two flow paths in the micromodel are placed in the horizontal the bottom path has the shrinking part and the upper path does not fig 1b in the drainage step the variant velocities of the menisci result in the specific volume and position of the residual wetting phase which is the key to determining how the invading wetting liquid interacts with the residual wetting phase we analogized the menisci movement in the pdm fig 1a to the menisci movement in the two parallel tubes fig 1b in fig 1b four positions x0 x1 x2 and x3 are

and stainless steel tubes 0 91 mm diameter we microfabricated the micromodels via the regular pdms modeling process shao et al 2012 using pmma mold inserts master molds the master molds contained the pattern of the designed channel that we transferred onto a pdms piece we fabricated the pmma mold inserts with a cnc milling machine roland egx400 with 0 2 and 0 3 mm diameter square end mills taiwan microdrill co ltd new taipei city taiwan by casting the pdms solution onto the pmma mold we obtained negative pdms stamps we prepared flat pdms pieces to cover and close the negative stamps we pierced two holes 0 75 mm in diameter into the flat pdms pieces on which we inserted stainless steel tubes as the inlet and outlet of the microfluidic chips after covering to bond the negative stamp and flat piece we applied an oxidizing plasma treatment plasma cleaner pdc 32 g on the bonded surfaces of the two pdms pieces before closing the channel contacting the two pieces surface treatment creates silanol groups on the surface and enhances bonding chaudhury and whitesides 1991 1992 shao et al 2012 we used the micromodels in our experiment after inserting the stainless steel tubes we measured the geometry of the master molds using the top view images and images of the cross section of the negative stamp table 1 comparing the geometry between the designs of the pdms and of the pmma mold inserts we found that a small bias was caused by milling in the d100 master mold wm was 427 5 Œºm and wm was 137 5 Œºm for the d200 master mold wm was 406 4 Œºm and wm was 206 2 Œºm the convex corner radius rv was 238 14 Œºm and 256 29 Œºm in the d100 and d200 master molds respectively the concave corner radius rc was 172 6 Œºm and 173 7 Œºm in the d100 and d200 master molds respectively we measured the h wm and wm of the pdms micromodels using their cross sectional photos fig 4 the values of l0 1 l1 2 l2 3 rv and rc of the pdms micromodels were measured from the fluid experiment images and listed in table 1 table 1 also lists the am am rm and rm values the channel height h was 129 9 Œºm and 130 9 Œºm in the d100 and d200 micromodels respectively in the d100 micromodel wm and wm were 423 10 Œºm and 135 7 Œºm respectively in the d200 micromodel wm and wm were 410 9 Œºm and 212 5 Œºm respectively from the cross sectional photos fig 4a b d and e we found cracks at the bonding contact surface of the pdms pieces in the d100 and d200 micromodels we therefore fabricated another micromodel without any cracked corners fig 4c and f based on the d100 and named d100 nc of which the geometric properties are listed in table 1 3 2 experimental setup and steps of pdm experiments fig 5 shows the experimental setup of the pdm experiments the fluids we used for the experiments were air nonwetting phase and ethyl alcohol 95 v v alcohol wetting phase dyed with rhodamine 6 g sigma aldrich the contact angle of the dyed alcohol was approximately 30o we used a syringe pump nw 4000 kf technology srl to inject fluids with controlled constant flow rates qin we recorded the experiments using a camera gs2 fw 14s5c point grey research canada placed at the top of the pdms micromodel the applied frame rates were different in experiments with a different setting pumping rate the highest frame rate was 200 frames per second fps and the lowest was 0 1 fps other camera settings shutter time white balance gamma etc were fixed no change with time in each experiment the wdw and wdew experiments had been conducted respectively during the wetting step we injected the wetting phase into the pdm during the drainage step we injected the nonwetting phase that replaced the wetting phase until the amount of remaining wetting phase was nearly steady which usually occurred when air penetrated the pdm we allowed the remaining wetting phase to evaporate during the evaporation step the wdw experiment showed the old new fluid interplay without the evaporation of the old fluid and the wdew experiment showed the effect of the evaporation of the old fluid on the interplay we used the d100 and d200 micromodels in the wdw experiment we prepared two concentrations 64 and 4800 mg l of dyed alcohol that we injected into the micromodel during the 1st and 2nd wetting steps we injected new liquid into the micromodel immediately after completion of the drainage step we implemented this process by using a tube connecting the inlet and pump which contained an air bubble that separated the wetting liquids of the first and second wetting processes we set the injection rates from 5 to 1000 Œºl min 5 50 100 150 175 200 300 400 600 and 1000 Œºl min we used a wide flow rate range to test the suitable injection rate setting for the wdew experiments at any of the setting injection rates tested the micromodels were fully saturated after the first wetting step the wdw experiment also showed the influence of drainage rate on the entrapment of the wetting phase in the wdew experiment we used the d100 d100 nc and d200 micromodels similar to the wdw experiment we injected two dyed alcohols at concentrations of 64 and 4800 mg l during the 1st and 2nd wetting steps respectively during the first wetting process we injected the dyed alcohol solution at a pumping rate of 50 Œºl min and the micromodel was fully saturated during the drainage step the syringe pump injected air into the micromodel at an injection rate of 50 Œºl min after air penetrated the micromodel we applied different evaporation durations in the evaporation step resulting in different evaporation levels during the 2nd wetting step based on the previous injection rate test the set injection rates were to 5 50 100 and 500 Œºl min we practically implemented the above processes of the wdew experiments by linking two tubes and then connecting the micromodel inlet and pump during the first wetting step a slug of alcohol solution was placed in the tube connecting the micromodel and air filled the other tube and the syringe meaning it was injected immediately after the wetting liquid during the evaporation step the tubes were manually unlinked wetting liquid was drawn into the tube connecting the syringe the syringe pump reset and the tubes re linked the evaporation step ranged from approximately 2 to 40 min 3 3 image process and analysis for pdm experiments imagej https imagej nih gov ij was used to measure the experimental lŒ∂m lŒ∂m and lŒæm in the image sequences according to their definitions fig 1a and fig 2 in both wdw and wdew the set pumping rates were inconsistent with the true flow rates estimated from the experimental images figure s1 the experimental qin values were therefore revised and calculated by analyzing the image sequence text s1 the capillary numbers were calculated using eq 1 with the experimental qin in each step Œº 1 074 mpa m and œÉ 22 27 mn m the time scale length t0 was calculated with the corrected qin the zero time œÑ 0 for the drainage steps was the time when the bulk meniscus arrived through the x0 point for the second wetting step the zero time was the previous frame time when the invading liquid first appeared on the recording images the old and new liquid ratios were estimated by using the image intensities among the color channels text s3 and figure s2 the saturation of color was applied and linearly normalized to 0 and 100 in which 0 refers to the pure new liquid and 100 refers to the pure old liquid the normalized image intensity indicated the relative new and old liquid ratio sc per pixel figure s2e this method cannot correctly reflect the relative concentration near the channel wall menisci and other air liquid interfaces text s4 and figure s3 nevertheless our approach effectively standardizes the image intensity and quantifies the relative amounts of old and new liquid in most of the pixels in the liquid area to quantify the relative ratios between the old and new liquids in the liquid phase of the channel we proposed s c as 20 s c s c s c old s c new s c old 100 where s c is the average saturation of the color in the liquid portion s c old is the saturation of the color of the old liquid portion at the end of the evaporation step and s c new is the saturation of the color of the new liquid portion s c equals 100 when the liquid phase is all new liquid and 0 when the liquid is all old liquid the method cannot accurately indicate the ratio between new and old liquids in the liquid phase text s4 however it can indicate the relative ratio between them 4 results and discussion 4 1 termination of Œ∂m and Œ∂m during the drainage step in the wdw experiment in the wdw experiment as well as the wdew all micromodels were fully saturated after the first wetting step at any qin fig 6 shows the experimental and simulated Œ∂m and Œ∂m during the drainage step in which the simulation results are calculated with the geometry listed in table 1 the zero time œÑ 0 in fig 6a b and c was when the bulk meniscus arrived through the x0 point fig 6a and b show that Œ∂m œÑ accelerated over time in both the d100 and d200 micromodels in contrast Œ∂m œÑ decelerated and ceased at a specific position until the air passed through x3 i e Œ∂m œÑ 1 d100 nc micromodel resulted in a similar relationship fig 6c overall in the d100 micromodel the maximum Œ∂m was approximately 0 18 0 04 over various drainage rates fig 6a and d in the d200 micromodel the various drainage rates caused substantially different Œ∂m and Œ∂m relationships the maximum Œ∂m value was related to ca fig 6d when ca was smaller than approximately 2e 4 red dashed line in fig 6d the meniscus stuck at the entrance of the shrinking part Œ∂m 0 31 the terminal Œ∂m and Œ∂m are important for determining the volume and location upper or bottom path of the trapped old liquid because Œ∂m reached 1 first in our experiments the wetting phase was trapped in the bottom path with the shrinking part the classical pore double model lake 1989 moore and slobod 1956 indicates that smaller pores have a slower replacement velocity which causes the residual wetting phase to be trapped in smaller pores additionally lowering the capillary force smaller Œ∫ or larger ca results in a decrease in the residual phase using the proposed mathematical models for our micromodel the geometry of the pdm can determine whether the length of the trapped wetting phase is related to ca in our pdm the smaller pore i e the shrink part was only part of the bottom path our mathematical model indicated that if b eq 7 is larger than or equal to 1 l 0 1 2 2 l 0 1 the terminal Œ∂m is smaller than l 0 1 eq 8 and is only related to the geometry i e perimeter b of the pdm the distance Œ∂m increased as ca increased when b 1 l 0 1 2 2 l 0 1 and ca cath1 eq 13 in this case it is needed to solve eqs 9 and 10 to the terminal Œ∂m from our mathematical model the terminal Œ∂m for d100 and d100 nc should be independent of ca and equal to approximately 0 18 and 0 22 respectively for d100 the experimental Œ∂m value at Œ∂m 1 was close to 0 18 for d100 nc most of the experimental Œ∂m values at Œ∂m 1 were approximately 0 30 nevertheless the terminal Œ∂m was independent of ca in d200 Œ∂m was dependent on ca when ca was larger than the critical value cath1 fig 6d the range of maximum Œ∂m was 0 31 to 0 41 in d200 the modeled cath1 was 1 3 10 3 however cath1 was approximately 2 10 4 according to the experimental results although the theoretical prediction and experimental results were not fully consistent the trends were comparable first in the experiments with d100 the maximum Œ∂m was not strongly related to ca as indicated by eq 8 which shows that Œ∂m should be independent of ca if Œ∂ m l 0 1 second the maximum Œ∂m increased as ca increased when ca cath1 in experiments with d200 the maximum Œ∂m ceased to increase when ca was extremely large the experimental and theoretical Œ∂m ca curves were different owing to the difference between the assumed and actual shapes of the rectangular cross sectional areas the mathematical model considered a rectangular cross section and idealized the paths of the channels as straight lines whereas the cross section of the pdm channel was closer to a trapezoid with cracks fig 4 the theoretical models did not consider the effects of corner flow dynamic contact angle or the concentrations of dye and ethyl alcohol in the wetting liquid in addition the paths were not straight fig 1a as assumed in the theoretical models fig 1b as the liquid meniscus passed through the second bend in the upper channel the channel width increased and decreased the increase in the channel width caused Œªm Œ≤ and Œ∫ to increase and am to slightly decrease in the d100 micromodel according to eqs 4 and 5 dŒ∂m dœÑ should be slower than that without the increase in channel width for the d200 micromodel eqs 9 and 10 also indicated that dŒ∂m dœÑ should be slower than predicted by the ideal pdm model the terminal Œ∂m in the d200 micromodel would not be as large as that predicted in the ideal pdm model 4 2 result of old and new liquids in wdw experiment during the second wetting step air bubbles formed in the d200 but not the d100 micromodel in most of the d100 micromodel experiments the micromodel did not trap any air bubbles during the second wetting step therefore the new liquid contacted and displaced the old liquid fig 7 shows a time lapse image of the liquid phase during the second wetting step where the color represents normalized color saturation which indicates the relative dye concentration the zero time in figs 7 and 8 was the previous frame time when the invading liquid first appeared on the recording images in the case without bubble entrapment the new liquid intruded into the old liquid the residual liquid on the wall slowly washed out of the pdm in the case of an immobile trapped bubble the new liquid slowly crossed the bubble and invaded the old liquid fig 7 in the case of a mobile bubble the normalized color saturation rapidly increased when the new liquid began to invade a longer time was required for the air bubble to pass through the shrinking channel with a smaller ca after the air bubble penetrated the shrinking channel most of the old liquid washed out of the pdm 4 3 result of old and new liquids in wdew experiment in the wdew experiment the evaporation step reduced the old liquid volume thereby increasing Œ∂m and Œæm fig 8 shows examples of new interplay during the second wetting step we grouped the evaporation levels into three categories from high to low a b and c at level a the entire old liquid segment was in the shrinking part of the pdm at level b the menisci of the old liquid segment were near the ends of the shrinking part x1 and x2 at level c the menisci of the old water were located at the corners between x0 and x1 and between x2 and x3 during the second wetting step in contrast to the wdw results most of the pdms formed two bubbles the trapped air bubbles were immobile when ca was smaller than approximately 8 10 4 in d100 and d100 nc and 5 10 4 in d200 in the case without bubble entrapment the new liquid displaced the majority of the old liquid and slowly mixed with the old liquid in the corner of the channels in the case of immobile bubbles the new liquid required a long time to cross the air bubble via the old liquid film and invade the old liquid in the case of a mobile bubble a longer time was required for the air bubble to pass through the shrinking channel with a smaller ca after the air bubble penetrated the shrinking channel most of the old liquid washed out of the pdm in the micromodels with cracks i e d100 and d200 even though the bubbles were immobile the new liquid still flowed around the air bubble and invaded the old liquid in contrast to the cases of the immobile air bubbles in d100 and d200 the immobile air bubbles in d100 nc separated the new and old liquids 4 4 formation of air bubble during second wetting step 4 4 1 air entrapment in pdm fig 7 and fig 8 show differing results of air formation and entrapment which were influenced by the geometry of the micromodels injection rate and the evaporation according to the proposed theory an upstream bubble will form if Œ∂m d1 a downstream bubble will form if Œæm d2 the entrapped upstream bubble will form if Œ∂m d1 and ca cath2 no bubbles form if Œ∂m d1 and Œæm d2 the d1 and d2 are related to Œ∏a of which experimental range was approximately from 30o to 50o when the new liquid invaded table 2 lists experimental Œ∂m Œ∂m and Œæm and their modeling values by using the wm and rv in table 1 table 2 shows the predicted d1 and d2 fig 9 a shows the phase diagram of the forming bubbles without the evaporation step the predicted and experimental Œæm values for d100 d100 nc and d200 were approximately 0 05 which was smaller than d2 therefore no bubble was trapped downstream of the old liquid the predicted Œ∂m values for d100 and d100 nc were approximately 0 18 and 0 22 slightly larger than d1 however due to the redistribution of the menisci the experimental Œ∂m in d100 was smaller than d1 section 4 4 2 fig 10 b and no bubble was likely to be trapped upstream fig 9a for d200 the predicted Œ∂m was larger than 0 31 the experimental Œ∂m reduced from the Œ∂m value at the end of drainage step fig 10b nevertheless the experimental Œ∂m was larger than d1 and a bubble was trapped upstream of the old liquid fig 9a the results of wdw and wdew experiments showed the importance of the evaporation step by which the Œ∂m and Œæm increased and exceed the critical lengths fig 9a in fig 9b most of the circle markers are located in low ca conditions moreover no circle marker exists when ca 10 3 applying œÄ 6 of Œ∏rec and Œ∏adv the predicted cath2 was 5 4 10 4 2 1 10 4 and 3 3 10 4 for d100 d200 and d100 nc micromodels respectively as shown in fig 9b the estimated cath2 from experimental data was approximately 5 10 4 to 8 10 4 which was slightly larger than the predicted value the contact angle hysteresis Œ∏rev Œ∏adv is a potential reason for this underestimation while other factors influencing contact angle and surface tension also impacted the uncertainty in the experiment the sustained evaporation of the dye alcohol solutions reduced the ethyl alcohol concentration and increased the dye concentration nonetheless we have shown that the conditions to form bubbles could be achieved by the evaporation step and the upstream bubble can be trapped at small ca 4 4 2 residual old liquid movement before the second wetting step in the wdw experiment in the wdw experiment with the d100 micromodel terminal Œ∂m was 0 18 the experimental Œ∏a varied perhaps due to the concentration dye and the sustained evaporation of liquids and d1 should range between 0 231 and 0 13 table 2 forming an upstream air bubble is expected in the wdw experiment with d100 however few experiments did this because of the movement of residual old liquid movement before the second wetting step fig 10 as illustrated in fig 10a the old liquid was trapped in the bottom path after the drainage step however the liquid moved because of the different curvatures of the menisci we labeled ts1 as the time when air penetrated the pdm and ts2 as the time when the new liquid passed through x0 from ts1 to ts2 Œ∂m decreased fig 10b and Œæm increased fig 10c in most of the experiments at ts2 the Œ∂m values in the d200 experiments were larger than 0 2 0 26 0 03 in average fig 10b the Œæm value was 0 046 0 01 on average fig 10c only an upstream bubble formed the bubbles were immobile when ca was smaller than approximately 3 10 4 in d100 Œ∂m 0 12 0 10 on average and was smaller than 0 2 at ts2 and no upstream bubble formed fig 10b except in the experiment with drainage ca 8 26 10 3 the large drainage rate caused Œ∂m to increase before ts2 although an upstream air bubble was formed it was flushed out of the pdm 4 5 s c during second wetting step the curve of s c œÑ during the second wetting step was the result of the interplay between the new and old liquids as shown in fig 11 a e the new liquid entered the pdm at œÑ 0 and s c œÑ rapidly increased from œÑ 0 to 1 in all the experiments at a œÑ of approximately 0 5 to 1 the rate of increase of s c œÑ when the capacity of the new liquid displacing the old liquid decreased s c œÑ stabilized after a time point œÑst which was close to one based on the definition of œÑ œÑ 0 5 indicated the injection volume was equal to the volume of the upper channel the injection volume equaled the total volume of the upper and bottom channels when œÑ 1 thus after œÑ was approximately 0 5 to 1 i e after œÑst the new liquid penetrated the pdm and removed most of the old liquid in the major flow path as shown in the snapshots of the experiments in fig 7 in the wdw experiment s c œÑ st was approximately 80 in the d100 micromodel and slowly increased after œÑst without any air bubbles fig 11a the old liquid occupied a small portion of the channel e g channel wells and connections and slowly mixed with and was displaced by the new liquid fig 7 in the d200 micromodel the smaller s c œÑ st of approximately 70 occurred due to the wider wm and air bubbles fig 11b the air bubble was immobile at ca cath2 and obstructed the new liquid from displacing the old liquid at ca cath2 the air bubble was mobile s c increased again at the breakthrough time œÑbt when the air bubble exceeded the range of image and the area of the bubble on the image started to decrease a larger ca resulted in a smaller œÑbt owing to the higher bubble advancing velocity s c approached 100 after the upstream air bubble left the micromodel because the mobile air bubble removed most of the old liquid in the bottom path after the exhausting time œÑex s c entered a saturation stabilization period thus for the case with a mobile bubble œÑex was larger than œÑbt and was determined by ca which was larger than cath2 for the wdew experiment during the second wetting process the new liquid rapidly filled the upper channel at œÑ 0 5 1 and occupied a major part of the pdm area because the area of the old liquid was reduced by evaporation s c œÑ st was large at a high evaporation level in the d100 micromodel s c œÑ st was approximately 94 90 and 83 at evaporation levels a b and c respectively fig 11c in the d200 micromodel s c œÑ st was approximately 92 88 and 81 at evaporation levels a b and c respectively fig 11d similar to the wdw result the mobile upstream bubble removed the old liquid from the micromodels and resulted in a high s c approaching 100 when the bubble was immobile the new liquid inefficiently displaced the old liquid nevertheless s c œÑ œÑ st slightly increased as shown in fig 8 the new liquid flowed with cracks bypassed the air bubble and intruded into the shrinking part of the model in some experiments the crack film flow increased the area of liquid in the shrinking part fig 8i in contrast s c in the d100 nc micromodel almost ceased fig 11e and the new liquid did not appear in the shrinking part as shown in fig 8 the comparison showed that cracks resulted in a notable corner flow more discussions about the flow though the crack can be found in section 4 6 looking at the overall experimental results a larger s c œÑ value indicates a more invading liquid replacing the old liquid in the fluid channel when the event liquid new liquid was injected into the pdm s c œÑ rapidly increased and the increasing rate of s c œÑ suddenly slowed at œÑst when the new liquid penetrated the pdm in all experiments after œÑst the existence and mobility of the upstream bubble and corner films influenced the evolution of s c œÑ without any trapped bubbles the old liquid gradually mixed with the old liquid and s c œÑ was close to one at the end of the experiment when the upstream bubble existed s c œÑ more slowly increased than without any bubbles nevertheless the invading liquid intruded into the residual liquid through wetting corner films the film flow was substantial in the d100 and d200 models owing to the cracks in d100 nc only a small film flow crossed the upstream air bubble and the increase rate of s c t t st was the smallest however if the mobile upstream air bubble penetrated the shrinking part it would swept away most of the old liquid resulting in a remarkably high s c œÑ near 100 from the experimental results fig 12 summarizes the trend of the evolution of the ratio between old and new liquids in different bubble formation cases without any air bubbles the new liquid gently replaces the old from a pdm with one immobile upstream bubble or two immobile bubbles the new liquid barely replaced the old liquid in a pdm if the corner flow is large the new liquid ratio increases considerably when the upstream bubble is mobile and penetrates the pdm old liquid is efficiently replaced 4 6 corner flow effect on new old liquid interplay khorshidian et al 2018 demonstrated that fine capillaries e g cracks enhance the hydraulic continuity of the wetting phase similarly our experimental results showed that the cracks in the pdms became the link connecting the wetting phase in the d100 and d200 micromodels s c still increased after œÑst despite the presence of trapped bubbles in contrast the s c in the d100 nc micromodel almost ceased after œÑst the comparison showed that the cracks resulted in considerable corner flow qc to demonstrate that the crack can result in a considerable qc beside the bubbles we estimated the ratio of qc in d100 and d100 nc and qc qin of d100 d100 nc and d200 the approximations were conducted simply with the geometry of the corner cross section assuming total bubble lengths determining the film length and the model derived by ransohoff and radke 1988 immobile air bubbles are assumed this derivation is shown in appendix a the total corner flow rate is described by equation a 1 equation a 3 describes qc qin which is related to the nondimensional total bubble length l b by assuming rc h 2 Œ∏ 0 the same length of trapped bubbles and the same Œ¥p in the d100 and d100 nc micromodels from on equation a 1 the ratio of qc in the d100 micromodel is 17 times that of d100 nc this ratio though a roughly approximation indicates that the cracks in the d100 micromodel resulted in a notable qc which is larger than that in the d100 nc micromodel the length of the corner film should be close to the bubble length at the evaporation level b the immobile bubbles had a nondimensional total bubble length l b of approximately 0 35 l b nondimensionalized by l which we calculated as 1 d 1 d 2 l 1 2 with l b 0 35 the qc qin was 7 0 and 0 7 in the d100 and d100 nc micromodels respectively for a lower evaporation level such as level c because of the longer residual old liquid l b was shorter than 0 35 the shortening l b increased qc qin taking l b 0 27 as an example qc qin was 9 1 and 0 9 in the d100 and d100 nc micromodels respectively therefore the high evaporation level reduced the flow rate in the corners and the mixing of old and new liquids the new liquid flowed across the trapped bubble via corner flow the invading new liquid not only mixed with the old liquid but also enlarged the liquid area between the two trapped bubbles the capillary pressure sucked new liquid into the shrinking part and pushed the bubble out for instance the experiment with d200 micromodel at evaporation level a and ca 9 28 10 4 shown in fig 8 i more snapshots in fig s3 demonstrated that this expansion slowed and even ceased when this expanding liquid area filled the shrinking part at the same time the bubbles were outside the shrinking part the hydraulic radii of the menisci at the ends of the bubble were similar indicating that the capillary pressures were similar because ca was less than cath2 the upstream bubble was not able to squeeze through the shrinking part in contrast the downstream bubble could move slightly forward for instance in the d200 micromodel with level b evaporation and ca 7 92 10 4 the downstream meniscus was outside of the shrinking area as shown in fig 8 j 4 7 film flow in 3d porous media our study highlights the role of wetting films in the interaction between new and old liquids which may have significant implications in real world 3d porous media systems classical infiltration experiments by horton and hawkins 1965 have shown that rainwater moves along pre wetted paths in soil columns leading to the mixing of new and old water however residual liquid can be disconnected in real soil assouline and or 2014 hoogland et al 2016 and this discrepancy may be related to the development of film flow which can be influenced by factors such as pore morphology surface roughness wettability and imbibition rate geistlinger et al 2016 tsao et al 2021 zulfiqar et al 2020 tsao et al 2021 demonstrated the importance of film flow in non wetting phase entrapment by modifying a 2d micromodel into a 2 5d model they found that the relationship between the residual non wetting phase and ca in 2 5d models more closely resembled that of natural 3d porous media rock or soil than thin 2d micromodels in the 2d micromodels the non wetting phase air was trapped in dead end pores due to by pass while in the 2 5d models the air was trapped in pore bodies due to snap off the trapped bubbles caused by snap off did not break up the wetting film the pore morphology surface wettability and surface roughness also influenced air trapping zulfiqar et al 2020 conducted water displacement experiments revealing that air was trapped in a 1 mm glass bead packed sample when the contact angle was greater than 90 with water as a non wetting phase however in 1 mm sand packed samples air was trapped even when water was the wetting phase due to the similar pore morphology zulfiqar et al 2020 deduced that the difference was due to surface roughness the precursor thin film flow might not occur in glass bead packed samples because of their smooth surface geistlinger et al 2016 kibbey 2013 the root mean square roughness for glass beads may be 0 3 Œºm while it is 1 2 Œºm for natural sands kibbey 2013 by coating a rough surface on a glass micromodel channel geistlinger et al 2016 reported that a wetting film developed on the surface during drainage imbibition rate also controls the film flow development geistlinger et al 2016 tsao et al 2021 with a low amount of ca capillary fingering dominates the imbibition process however trapped bubbles may not form with too little ca tsao et al 2021 our study highlights the role of wetting films in the interaction between new and old liquids which may have significant implications in real world 3d porous media systems the film flow effect presented in this study could be applicable to fully 3d systems nevertheless there remain many challenges to overcome in investigations on film flow in 3d porous media 5 conclusions by conducting wdw and wdew experiments we determined the influence of evaporation and trapped non wetting phase bubbles on new and old wetting liquid interactions in pore doublet micromodels in the wdw experiments the pore geometry in the d200 micromodel satisfied the upstream air bubble formation condition Œ∂m d1 and trapped an upstream bubble in the second wetting step as ca was small however the pore geometry in the d100 micromodel did not satisfy any bubble formation conditions in the wdew experiments the evaporation step substantially decreased the size of the old liquid and increased Œ∂m and Œæm when Œ∂m d1 and Œæm d2 two bubbles formed in both the d100 and d200 micromodels in the second wetting step the entrapped upstream bubble reduced the efficiency with which the new liquid intruded on the old liquid however the cracks along the channels caused the corner flow of the new liquid via corner flow the new liquid was able to flow across the trapped bubble and intrude upon the old trapped liquid in addition the trapped bubbles were remobilized when the ca number reached the critical value predicted by the derived model while the upstream bubble was remobilized the bubble swept away a major part of the old liquid therefore the trapped bubbles separated the new and old liquids during the second wetting step and reduced the mixing of the old and new liquids however when the bubble was mobilized it enhanced the process of removing the old trapped liquid data availability data will be made available on request credit authorship contribution statement qun zhan huang methodology validation formal analysis investigation

21,the stable isotopic signature of xylem water differs from those of rainfall and river water without considering the water exchange through the vapor phase this phenomenon implies that when the event water new water infiltrates the soil a part of the pre event water old water is isolated the isolation and immobilization of old water are suspected because of the low matrix potential because evaporation is the main process that can reduce the matrix potential after quick gravitational drainage we conjectured that after evaporation the old water hides in small pores and increases the likelihood of air entrapment which separates the new and old water to examine and visualize the potential effect of evaporation on the interactions between old and new water we performed a series of wetting drainage evaporation wetting experiments within pore doublet micromodels pdms the experimental results showed that air bubbles are trapped when the menisci of the residual liquid are sufficiently far from the inlet and outlet of the pdm evaporation can increase these distances resulting in the formation of larger air bubbles the air bubble trapped upstream prevents the invading liquid from quickly flushing the original residual liquid out of the pdm nevertheless the invading wetting liquid is still able to bypass the trapped air bubbles and mix with the residual wetting phase via corner flow in addition the remobilization of the upstream bubble enhances the process of removing the old trapped liquid keywords wetting phase entrapment pore doublet micromodels new old water interaction data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction the interplay between pre event water old water and event water new water e g from rainfall irrigation and leakage in the vadose zone affects the water flow path and solution transport the interplay therefore influences the water components and quality in streams and groundwater and the nutrients uptaken by plants experiments and numerical simulations have shown that some of the old water is not mixed or displaced by the new water and remains in porous media berkowitz 2014 gouet kaplan and berkowitz 2011 gouet kaplan et al 2009 oerter and bowen 2017 this observation has resulted in different conceptions of the old water and new water interaction horton and hawkins 1965 conducted soil column experiments and found that rainwater tended to flow through the columns along flow paths that were wet because of water retained by soil at field capacity this result implied that the retained water old water is replaced by rainwater and the retained water flows out of the column earlier than the rainwater sklash et al 1986 observed that both the current storm rain and stored water contributed the stream runoff generated by catchments during storm events and the stored water mainly contributed to the earlier occurrence of runoff kirchner et al 2000 reported that the concentration of contaminants flushed into a stream is higher at the beginning of rainfall and then decreases after the rainfall event the macropore flow of new water cannot explain the through flow response in catchments pearce et al 1986 sklash et al 1986 using a rainfall simulator in a tracer test turton et al 1995 observed a decreasing ratio of subsurface flow contributed by the water from the first rainfall event in the second and third rainfall events using similar hydrographs when rainfall intensity increased the old water contribution ratio decreased turton et al 1995 concluded that the macropore flow was the most likely flow path the results of stable water isotope analyses have shown that the source of xylem water is different from those of groundwater and stream water during wet seasons brooks et al 2010 evaristo et al 2015 sprenger et al 2016 instead the isotopic signature of xylem water is similar to that of pre event water rather than to that of event water in a seasonally irrigated urban landscaped garden oerter and bowen 2017 analyzed the stable water isotope of irrigation xylem and soil water based on the isotope analysis results the authors deduced that after long periods of drying the old water from the initial infiltration event is not easily replaced by or does not easily mix with the new water brooks et al 2010 proposed the two water worlds hypothesis which supposes that no isotopic exchange occurs between the soil bound and mobile water during the wet season vargas et al 2017 examined the two water worlds hypothesis through pot experiments with successive wet and dry periods the results of isotope analyses of xylem water from these periods however showed that approximately 74 96 of the bond water was exchanged with mobile water as such an investigation into the fundamental mechanisms controlling the occurrence of these two water worlds is required microfluidic technology has been applied to investigate the pore scale mechanisms of porous media flow optically transparent microfluidic devices micromodels allow researchers to directly observe the behavior of fluids at the pore scale celia et al 1995 rufai 2018 wu et al 2017 xu et al 2017 different materials including glass quartz polydimethylsiloxane pdms polymethylmethacrylate pmma and different types of plastics hsu et al 2017 karadimitriou and hassanizadeh 2012 rufai 2018 have been used to fabricate these micromodels the designed pore structure can be constructed in a micromodel using different approaches karadimitriou and hassanizadeh 2012 rufai 2018 chatenever and calhoun jr 1952 packed a monolayer of glass beads between two flat glass plates which was the earliest micromodel used for studying flow in porous media wang et al 2014 milled the microchannel using a mechanical milling device gouet kaplan and berkowitz 2011 created microchannels on glass using chemical etching which have since been widely used to fabricate glass micromodels xu et al 2017 with a lattice micromodel gouet kaplan and berkowitz 2011 performed two successive cycles of infiltration experiments and determined the old water remaining in the micromodel at the end of the experiments after the second infiltration most of the old water were flushed out whereas many pure old water pockets remained stable in the micromodel although gouet kaplan and berkowitz 2011 did not discuss the pore scale mechanism in detail the remaining pure old water pockets implied that air can separate old and new water in addition trapped air can enhance the stability of the old water pockets owing to the jamin effect smith and crane 1930 and the hysteresis of the contact angle hsu et al 2012 air entrapment can influence old new water interactions such as through air blocking the contact between the new and old water air entrapment is related to the pore geometry invading rate of the wetting phase viscosity and capillaries of the fluids geistlinger et al 2016 lake 1989 topp et al 1967 in addition a long drying duration can change the geometry of the trapped old water and enhance air bubble formation during new water invasion the high mixing rate in the pot experiments reported by vargas et al 2017 might have been due to the limited evaporation since the pots were covered with plastic sheets in other studies in undisturbed areas and urban parks brooks et al 2010 evaristo et al 2015 oerter and bowen 2017 sprenger et al 2016 the residual soil water saturation should be significantly decreased by evapotranspiration nevertheless how evaporation affects new water interplay has not yet been well studied and discussed to better understand the influence of trapped air bubbles and evaporation on old new water interactions in this study we performed two cycle infiltration experiments in pore doublet models pdms which we connected to two parallel pore channels with different widths the designed channel width ratios were 1 4 d100 and 2 4 d200 the narrow channel in the pdm represented a small pore in which the wetting phase could be retained we observed different levels of evaporation between the two wetting cycles the wetting drainage evaporation wetting process was analogous to the rainfall drying rainfall cycle we demonstrated the interplay between the old liquid the residual wetting phase after the first drainage and a new liquid invading wetting liquid in the second wetting the results of experimentation and theoretical analysis showed that when air bubbles were trapped between the new and old liquids the air bubbles prevented the displacement of the old liquid by the new liquid when the film in the wetting phase existed the invading new liquid flowed and connected with the old liquid through the film at the corners 2 mathematical models for pdm we performed two sets of experiments with different wetting drainage and evaporation steps wetting drainage wetting wdw and wetting drainage evaporation wetting wdew with pdms with a shrinking part in one of the channels as shown in fig 1 a in terms of our suppositions of the impact of evaporation on interactions between old and new liquids and relative mathematical models we conjecture that the conditions of trapping air that separated the liquids are dominated by the relative position between the liquids this position can be changed due to evaporation in wdew for wdw this relative position should be determined by the movement of the bulk menisci in the channels during the drainage step and ideally this trapped old liquid is the initial condition in the second wetting steps to analyze factors influencing new and old water interaction we derived simple models describing the menisci movement during the drainage step and the conditions of the air entrapment in the second wetting step 2 1 receding length of menisci lŒ∂m and lŒ∂m during drainage two flow paths in the micromodel are placed in the horizontal the bottom path has the shrinking part and the upper path does not fig 1b in the drainage step the variant velocities of the menisci result in the specific volume and position of the residual wetting phase which is the key to determining how the invading wetting liquid interacts with the residual wetting phase we analogized the menisci movement in the pdm fig 1a to the menisci movement in the two parallel tubes fig 1b in fig 1b four positions x0 x1 x2 and x3 are marked positions x0 and x3 are the junctions of the upper and bottom paths and positions x1 and x2 are the ends of the shrinking part length li j is the path length from xi to xj where i and j are

hydraulic radius rm the other region has a width wm a cross sectional area am and a hydraulic radius rm hydraulic radius rm m wm mh wm m h in the capillary force and viscosity dominating system the flow rate is often non dimensionalized into the capillary number ca and the ratio between viscosity and capillary forces which results from different conditions may be more consistent or comparable

of the liquid eq 1 includes the influences of both am and am and should enable experimental results from different pdms to become more comparable we calculated the menisci movement based on poiseuille s law lake 1989 washburn 1921 we neglected the viscosity of air inertial effect and dynamic contact angle we assumed the contact angle Œ∏ of the wetting phase was constant we assumed the fluids were

owing to the small jamin effect smith and crane 1930 in cases b and d the upstream bubble resulted in a significant jamin effect resisting the push of the invading liquid the immobile bubble can

pdms fig 3 shows the designs of the d100 and d200 pdms the height h of the fluid channels was 100 Œºm the width wm of the channels was 400 Œºm except for the shrinking part of the bottom path the widths of the shrinking parts were 100 and 200 Œºm for d100 and d200 respectively the length of the shrinking part was 3 mm in both models the corners of the channel wall from the top view were rounded in which both the convex fillet radius rv and concave fillet radius rc were 100 Œºm in our design table 1 two flow paths in the micromodel were placed in the horizontal the materials we used to fabricate the micromodels included polydimethylsiloxane pdms dow corning sylgard pdms 184 dow chemical taiwan limited taipei taiwan and polymethylmethacrylate pmma foursun tech inc tainan taiwan and stainless steel tubes 0 91 mm diameter we microfabricated the micromodels via the regular pdms modeling process shao et al 2012 using pmma mold inserts master molds the master molds contained the pattern of the designed channel that we transferred onto a pdms piece we fabricated the pmma mold inserts with a cnc milling machine roland egx400 with 0 2 and 0 3 mm diameter square end mills taiwan microdrill co ltd new taipei city taiwan by casting the pdms solution onto the pmma mold we obtained negative pdms stamps we prepared flat pdms pieces to cover and close the negative stamps we pierced two holes 0 75 mm in diameter into the flat pdms pieces on which we inserted stainless steel tubes as the inlet and outlet of the microfluidic chips after covering to bond the negative stamp and flat piece we applied an oxidizing plasma treatment plasma cleaner pdc 32 g on the bonded surfaces of the two pdms pieces before closing the channel contacting the two pieces surface treatment creates silanol groups on the surface and enhances bonding chaudhury and whitesides 1991 1992 shao et al 2012 we used the micromodels in our experiment after inserting the stainless steel tubes we measured the geometry of the master molds using the top view images and images of the cross section of the negative stamp table 1 comparing the geometry between the designs of the pdms and of the pmma mold inserts we found that a small bias was caused by milling in the d100 master mold wm was 427 5 Œºm and wm was 137 5 Œºm for the d200 master mold wm was 406 4 Œºm and wm was 206 2 Œºm the convex corner radius rv was 238 14 Œºm and 256 29 Œºm in the d100 and d200 master molds respectively the concave corner radius rc was 172 6 Œºm and 173 7 Œºm in the d100 and d200 master molds respectively we measured the h wm and wm of the pdms micromodels using their cross sectional photos fig 4 the values of l0 1 l1 2 l2 3 rv and rc of the pdms micromodels were measured from the fluid experiment images and listed in table 1 table 1 also lists the am am rm and rm values the channel height h was 129 9 Œºm and 130 9 Œºm in the d100 and d200 micromodels respectively in the d100 micromodel wm and wm were 423 10 Œºm and 135 7 Œºm respectively in the d200 micromodel wm and wm were 410 9 Œºm and 212 5 Œºm respectively from the cross sectional photos fig 4a b d and e we found cracks at the bonding contact surface of the pdms pieces in the d100 and d200 micromodels we therefore fabricated another micromodel without any cracked corners fig 4c and f based on the d100 and named d100 nc of which the geometric properties are listed in table 1 3 2 experimental setup and steps of pdm experiments fig 5 shows the experimental setup of the pdm experiments the fluids we used for the experiments were air nonwetting phase and ethyl alcohol 95 v v alcohol wetting phase dyed with rhodamine 6 g sigma aldrich the contact angle of the dyed alcohol was approximately 30o we used a syringe pump nw 4000 kf technology srl to inject fluids with controlled constant flow rates qin we recorded the experiments using a camera gs2 fw 14s5c point grey research canada placed at the top of the pdms micromodel the applied frame rates were different in experiments with a different setting pumping rate the highest frame rate was 200 frames per second fps and the lowest was 0 1 fps other camera settings shutter time white balance gamma etc were fixed no change with time in each experiment the wdw and wdew experiments had been conducted respectively during the wetting step we injected the wetting phase into the pdm during the drainage step we injected the nonwetting phase that replaced the wetting phase until the amount of remaining wetting phase was nearly steady which usually occurred when air penetrated the pdm we allowed the remaining wetting phase to evaporate during the evaporation step the wdw experiment showed the old new fluid interplay without the evaporation of the old fluid and the wdew experiment showed the effect of the evaporation of the old fluid on the interplay we used the d100 and d200 micromodels in the wdw experiment we prepared two concentrations 64 and 4800 mg l of dyed alcohol that we injected into the micromodel during the 1st and 2nd wetting steps we injected new liquid into the micromodel immediately after completion of the drainage step we implemented this process by using a tube connecting the inlet and pump which contained an air bubble that separated the wetting liquids of the first and second wetting processes we set the injection rates from 5 to 1000 Œºl min 5 50 100 150 175 200 300 400 600 and 1000 Œºl min we used a wide flow rate range to test the suitable injection rate setting for the wdew experiments at any of the setting injection rates tested the micromodels were fully saturated after the first wetting step the wdw experiment also showed the influence of drainage rate on the entrapment of the wetting phase in the wdew experiment we used the d100 d100 nc and d200 micromodels similar to the wdw experiment we injected two dyed alcohols at concentrations of 64 and 4800 mg l during the 1st and 2nd wetting steps respectively during the first wetting process we injected the dyed alcohol solution at a pumping rate of 50 Œºl min and the micromodel was fully saturated during the drainage step the syringe pump injected air into the micromodel at an injection rate of 50 Œºl min after air penetrated the micromodel we applied different evaporation durations in the evaporation step resulting in different evaporation levels during the 2nd wetting step based on the previous injection rate test the set injection rates were to 5 50 100 and 500 Œºl min we practically implemented the above processes of the wdew experiments by linking two tubes and then connecting the micromodel inlet and pump during the first wetting step a slug of alcohol solution was placed in the tube connecting the micromodel and air filled the other tube and the syringe meaning it was injected immediately after the wetting liquid during the evaporation step the tubes were manually unlinked wetting liquid was drawn into the tube connecting the syringe the syringe pump reset and the tubes re linked the evaporation step ranged from approximately 2 to 40 min 3 3 image process and analysis for pdm experiments imagej https imagej nih gov ij was used to measure the experimental lŒ∂m lŒ∂m and lŒæm in the image sequences according to their definitions fig 1a and fig 2 in both wdw and wdew the set pumping rates were inconsistent with the true flow rates estimated from the experimental images figure s1 the experimental qin values were therefore revised and calculated by analyzing the image sequence text s1 the capillary numbers were calculated using eq 1 with the experimental qin in each step Œº 1 074 mpa m and œÉ 22 27 mn m the time scale length t0 was calculated with the corrected qin the zero time œÑ 0 for the drainage steps was the time when the bulk meniscus arrived through the x0 point for the second wetting step the zero time was the previous frame time when the invading liquid first appeared on the recording images the old and new liquid ratios were estimated by using the image intensities among the color channels text s3 and figure s2 the saturation of color was applied and linearly normalized to 0 and 100 in which 0 refers to the pure new liquid and 100 refers to the pure old liquid the normalized image intensity indicated the relative new and old liquid ratio sc per pixel figure s2e this method cannot correctly reflect the relative concentration near the channel wall menisci and other air liquid interfaces text s4 and figure s3 nevertheless our approach effectively standardizes the image intensity and quantifies the relative amounts of old and new liquid in most of the pixels in the liquid area to quantify the relative ratios between the old and new liquids in the liquid phase of the channel we proposed s c as 20 s c s c s c old s c new s c old 100 where s c is the average saturation of the color in the liquid portion s c old is the saturation of the color of the old liquid portion at the end of the evaporation step and s c new is the saturation of the color of the new liquid portion s c equals 100 when the liquid phase is all new liquid and 0 when the liquid is all old liquid the method cannot accurately indicate the ratio between new and old liquids in the liquid phase text s4 however it can indicate the relative ratio between them 4 results and discussion 4 1 termination of Œ∂m and Œ∂m during the drainage step in the wdw experiment in the wdw experiment as well as the wdew all micromodels were fully saturated after the first wetting step at any qin fig 6 shows the experimental and simulated Œ∂m and Œ∂m during the drainage step in which the simulation results are calculated with the geometry listed in table 1 the zero time œÑ 0 in fig 6a b and c was when the bulk meniscus arrived through the x0 point fig 6a and b show that Œ∂m œÑ accelerated over time in both the d100 and d200 micromodels in contrast Œ∂m œÑ decelerated and ceased at a specific position until the air passed through x3 i e Œ∂m œÑ 1 d100 nc micromodel resulted in a similar relationship fig 6c overall in the d100 micromodel the maximum Œ∂m was approximately 0 18 0 04 over various drainage rates fig 6a and d in the d200 micromodel the various drainage rates caused substantially different Œ∂m and Œ∂m relationships the maximum Œ∂m value was related to ca fig 6d when ca was smaller than approximately 2e 4 red dashed line in fig 6d the meniscus stuck at the entrance of the shrinking part Œ∂m 0 31 the terminal Œ∂m and Œ∂m are important for determining the volume and location upper or bottom path of the trapped old liquid because Œ∂m reached 1 first in our experiments the wetting phase was trapped in the bottom path with the shrinking part the classical pore double model lake 1989 moore and slobod 1956 indicates that smaller pores have a slower replacement velocity which causes the residual wetting phase to be trapped in smaller pores additionally lowering the capillary force smaller Œ∫ or larger ca results in a decrease in the residual phase using the proposed mathematical models for our micromodel the geometry of the pdm can determine whether the length of the trapped wetting phase is related to ca in our pdm the smaller pore i e the shrink part was only part of the bottom path our mathematical model indicated that if b eq 7 is larger than or equal to 1 l 0 1 2 2 l 0 1 the terminal Œ∂m is smaller than l 0 1 eq 8 and is only related to the geometry i e perimeter b of the pdm the distance Œ∂m increased as ca increased when b 1 l 0 1 2 2 l 0 1 and ca cath1 eq 13 in this case it is needed to solve eqs 9 and 10 to the terminal Œ∂m from our mathematical model the terminal Œ∂m for d100 and d100 nc should be independent of ca and equal to approximately 0 18 and 0 22 respectively for d100 the experimental Œ∂m value at Œ∂m 1 was close to 0 18 for d100 nc most of the experimental Œ∂m values at Œ∂m 1 were approximately 0 30 nevertheless the terminal Œ∂m was independent of ca in d200 Œ∂m was dependent on ca when ca was larger than the critical value cath1 fig 6d the range of maximum Œ∂m was 0 31 to 0 41 in d200 the modeled cath1 was 1 3 10 3 however cath1 was approximately 2 10 4 according to the experimental results although the theoretical prediction and experimental results were not fully consistent the trends were comparable first in the experiments with d100 the maximum Œ∂m was not strongly related to ca as indicated by eq 8 which shows that Œ∂m should be independent of ca if Œ∂ m l 0 1 second the maximum Œ∂m increased as ca increased when ca cath1 in experiments with d200 the maximum Œ∂m ceased to increase when ca was extremely large the experimental and theoretical Œ∂m ca curves were different owing to the difference between the assumed and actual shapes of the rectangular cross sectional areas the mathematical model considered a rectangular cross section and idealized the paths of the channels as straight lines whereas the cross section of the pdm channel was closer to a trapezoid with cracks fig 4 the theoretical models did not consider the effects of corner flow dynamic contact angle or the concentrations of dye and ethyl alcohol in the wetting liquid in addition the paths were not straight fig 1a as assumed in the theoretical models fig 1b as the liquid meniscus passed through the second bend in the upper channel the channel width increased and decreased the increase in the channel width caused Œªm Œ≤ and Œ∫ to increase and am to slightly decrease in the d100 micromodel according to eqs 4 and 5 dŒ∂m dœÑ should be slower than that without the increase in channel width for the d200 micromodel eqs 9 and 10 also indicated that dŒ∂m dœÑ should be slower than predicted by the ideal pdm model the terminal Œ∂m in the d200 micromodel would not be as large as that predicted in the ideal pdm model 4 2 result of old and new liquids in wdw experiment during the second wetting step air bubbles formed in the d200 but not the d100 micromodel in most of the d100 micromodel experiments the micromodel did not trap any air bubbles during the second wetting step therefore the new liquid contacted and displaced the old liquid fig 7 shows a time lapse image of the liquid phase during the second wetting step where the color represents normalized color saturation which indicates the relative dye concentration the zero time in figs 7 and 8 was the previous frame time when the invading liquid first appeared on the recording images in the case without bubble entrapment the new liquid intruded into the old liquid the residual liquid on the wall slowly washed out of the pdm in the case of an immobile trapped bubble the new liquid slowly crossed the bubble and invaded the old liquid fig 7 in the case of a mobile bubble the normalized color saturation rapidly increased when the new liquid began to invade a longer time was required for the air bubble to pass through the shrinking channel with a smaller ca after the air bubble penetrated the shrinking channel most of the old liquid washed out of the pdm 4 3 result of old and new liquids in wdew experiment in the wdew experiment the evaporation step reduced the old liquid volume thereby increasing Œ∂m and Œæm fig 8 shows examples of new interplay during the second wetting step we grouped the evaporation levels into three categories from high to low a b and c at level a the entire old liquid segment was in the shrinking part of the pdm at level b the menisci of the old liquid segment were near the ends of the shrinking part x1 and x2 at level c the menisci of the old water were located at the corners between x0 and x1 and between x2 and x3 during the second wetting step in contrast to the wdw results most of the pdms formed two bubbles the trapped air bubbles were immobile when ca was smaller than approximately 8 10 4 in d100 and d100 nc and 5 10 4 in d200 in the case without bubble entrapment the new liquid displaced the majority of the old liquid and slowly mixed with the old liquid in the corner of the channels in the case of immobile bubbles the new liquid required a long time to cross the air bubble via the old liquid film and invade the old liquid in the case of a mobile bubble a longer time was required for the air bubble to pass through the shrinking channel with a smaller ca after the air bubble penetrated the shrinking channel most of the old liquid washed out of the pdm in the micromodels with cracks i e d100 and d200 even though the bubbles were immobile the new liquid still flowed around the air bubble and invaded the old liquid in contrast to the cases of the immobile air bubbles in d100 and d200 the immobile air bubbles in d100 nc separated the new and old liquids 4 4 formation of air bubble during second wetting step 4 4 1 air entrapment in pdm fig 7 and fig 8 show differing results of air formation and entrapment which were influenced by the geometry of the micromodels injection rate and the evaporation according to the proposed theory an upstream bubble will form if Œ∂m d1 a downstream bubble will form if Œæm d2 the entrapped upstream bubble will form if Œ∂m d1 and ca cath2 no bubbles form if Œ∂m d1 and Œæm d2 the d1 and d2 are related to Œ∏a of which experimental range was approximately from 30o to 50o when the new liquid invaded table 2 lists experimental Œ∂m Œ∂m and Œæm and their modeling values by using the wm and rv in table 1 table 2 shows the predicted d1 and d2 fig 9 a shows the phase diagram of the forming bubbles without the evaporation step the predicted and experimental Œæm values for d100 d100 nc and d200 were approximately 0 05 which was smaller than d2 therefore no bubble was trapped downstream of the old liquid the predicted Œ∂m values for d100 and d100 nc were approximately 0 18 and 0 22 slightly larger than d1 however due to the redistribution of the menisci the experimental Œ∂m in d100 was smaller than d1 section 4 4 2 fig 10 b and no bubble was likely to be trapped upstream fig 9a for d200 the predicted Œ∂m was larger than 0 31 the experimental Œ∂m reduced from the Œ∂m value at the end of drainage step fig 10b nevertheless the experimental Œ∂m was larger than d1 and a bubble was trapped upstream of the old liquid fig 9a the results of wdw and wdew experiments showed the importance of the evaporation step by which the Œ∂m and Œæm increased and exceed the critical lengths fig 9a in fig 9b most of the circle markers are located in low ca conditions moreover no circle marker exists when ca 10 3 applying œÄ 6 of Œ∏rec and Œ∏adv the predicted cath2 was 5 4 10 4 2 1 10 4 and 3 3 10 4 for d100 d200 and d100 nc micromodels respectively as shown in fig 9b the estimated cath2 from experimental data was approximately 5 10 4 to 8 10 4 which was slightly larger than the predicted value the contact angle hysteresis Œ∏rev Œ∏adv is a potential reason for this underestimation while other factors influencing contact angle and surface tension also impacted the uncertainty in the experiment the sustained evaporation of the dye alcohol solutions reduced the ethyl alcohol concentration and increased the dye concentration nonetheless we have shown that the conditions to form bubbles could be achieved by the evaporation step and the upstream bubble can be trapped at small ca 4 4 2 residual old liquid movement before the second wetting step in the wdw experiment in the wdw experiment with the d100 micromodel terminal Œ∂m was 0 18 the experimental Œ∏a varied perhaps due to the concentration dye and the sustained evaporation of liquids and d1 should range between 0 231 and 0 13 table 2 forming an upstream air bubble is expected in the wdw experiment with d100 however few experiments did this because of the movement of residual old liquid movement before the second wetting step fig 10 as illustrated in fig 10a the old liquid was trapped in the bottom path after the drainage step however the liquid moved because of the different curvatures of the menisci we labeled ts1 as the time when air penetrated the pdm and ts2 as the time when the new liquid passed through x0 from ts1 to ts2 Œ∂m decreased fig 10b and Œæm increased fig 10c in most of the experiments at ts2 the Œ∂m values in the d200 experiments were larger than 0 2 0 26 0 03 in average fig 10b the Œæm value was 0 046 0 01 on average fig 10c only an upstream bubble formed the bubbles were immobile when ca was smaller than approximately 3 10 4 in d100 Œ∂m 0 12 0 10 on average and was smaller than 0 2 at ts2 and no upstream bubble formed fig 10b except in the experiment with drainage ca 8 26 10 3 the large drainage rate caused Œ∂m to increase before ts2 although an upstream air bubble was formed it was flushed out of the pdm 4 5 s c during second wetting step the curve of s c œÑ during the second wetting step was the result of the interplay between the new and old liquids as shown in fig 11 a e the new liquid entered the pdm at œÑ 0 and s c œÑ rapidly increased from œÑ 0 to 1 in all the experiments at a œÑ of approximately 0 5 to 1 the rate of increase of s c œÑ when the capacity of the new liquid displacing the old liquid decreased s c œÑ stabilized after a time point œÑst which was close to one based on the definition of œÑ œÑ 0 5 indicated the injection volume was equal to the volume of the upper channel the injection volume equaled the total volume of the upper and bottom channels when œÑ 1 thus after œÑ was approximately 0 5 to 1 i e after œÑst the new liquid penetrated the pdm and removed most of the old liquid in the major flow path as shown in the snapshots of the experiments in fig 7 in the wdw experiment s c œÑ st was approximately 80 in the d100 micromodel and slowly increased after œÑst without any air bubbles fig 11a the old liquid occupied a small portion of the channel e g channel wells and connections and slowly mixed with and was displaced by the new liquid fig 7 in the d200 micromodel the smaller s c œÑ st of approximately 70 occurred due to the wider wm and air bubbles fig 11b the air bubble was immobile at ca cath2 and obstructed the new liquid from displacing the old liquid at ca cath2 the air bubble was mobile s c increased again at the breakthrough time œÑbt when the air bubble exceeded the range of image and the area of the bubble on the image started to decrease a larger ca resulted in a smaller œÑbt owing to the higher bubble advancing velocity s c approached 100 after the upstream air bubble left the micromodel because the mobile air bubble removed most of the old liquid in the bottom path after the exhausting time œÑex s c entered a saturation stabilization period thus for the case with a mobile bubble œÑex was larger than œÑbt and was determined by ca which was larger than cath2 for the wdew experiment during the second wetting process the new liquid rapidly filled the upper channel at œÑ 0 5 1 and occupied a major part of the pdm area because the area of the old liquid was reduced by evaporation s c œÑ st was large at a high evaporation level in the d100 micromodel s c œÑ st was approximately 94 90 and 83 at evaporation levels a b and c respectively fig 11c in the d200 micromodel s c œÑ st was approximately 92 88 and 81 at evaporation levels a b and c respectively fig 11d similar to the wdw result the mobile upstream bubble removed the old liquid from the micromodels and resulted in a high s c approaching 100 when the bubble was immobile the new liquid inefficiently displaced the old liquid nevertheless s c œÑ œÑ st slightly increased as shown in fig 8 the new liquid flowed with cracks bypassed the air bubble and intruded into the shrinking part of the model in some experiments the crack film flow increased the area of liquid in the shrinking part fig 8i in contrast s c in the d100 nc micromodel almost ceased fig 11e and the new liquid did not appear in the shrinking part as shown in fig 8 the comparison showed that cracks resulted in a notable corner flow more discussions about the flow though the crack can be found in section 4 6 looking at the overall experimental results a larger s c œÑ value indicates a more invading liquid replacing the old liquid in the fluid channel when the event liquid new liquid was injected into the pdm s c œÑ rapidly increased and the increasing rate of s c œÑ suddenly slowed at œÑst when the new liquid penetrated the pdm in all experiments after œÑst the existence and mobility of the upstream bubble and corner films influenced the evolution of s c œÑ without any trapped bubbles the old liquid gradually mixed with the old liquid and s c œÑ was close to one at the end of the experiment when the upstream bubble existed s c œÑ more slowly increased than without any bubbles nevertheless the invading liquid intruded into the residual liquid through wetting corner films the film flow was substantial in the d100 and d200 models owing to the cracks in d100 nc only a small film flow crossed the upstream air bubble and the increase rate of s c t t st was the smallest however if the mobile upstream air bubble penetrated the shrinking part it would swept away most of the old liquid resulting in a remarkably high s c œÑ near 100 from the experimental results fig 12 summarizes the trend of the evolution of the ratio between old and new liquids in different bubble formation cases without any air bubbles the new liquid gently replaces the old from a pdm with one immobile upstream bubble or two immobile bubbles the new liquid barely replaced the old liquid in a pdm if the corner flow is large the new liquid ratio increases considerably when the upstream bubble is mobile and penetrates the pdm old liquid is efficiently replaced 4 6 corner flow effect on new old liquid interplay khorshidian et al 2018 demonstrated that fine capillaries e g cracks enhance the hydraulic continuity of the wetting phase similarly our experimental results showed that the cracks in the pdms became the link connecting the wetting phase in the d100 and d200 micromodels s c still increased after œÑst despite the presence of trapped bubbles in contrast the s c in the d100 nc micromodel almost ceased after œÑst the comparison showed that the cracks resulted in considerable corner flow qc to demonstrate that the crack can result in a considerable qc beside the bubbles we estimated the ratio of qc in d100 and d100 nc and qc qin of d100 d100 nc and d200 the approximations were conducted simply with the geometry of the corner cross section assuming total bubble lengths determining the film length and the model derived by ransohoff and radke 1988 immobile air bubbles are assumed this derivation is shown in appendix a the total corner flow rate is described by equation a 1 equation a 3 describes qc qin which is related to the nondimensional total bubble length l b by assuming rc h 2 Œ∏ 0 the same length of trapped bubbles and the same Œ¥p in the d100 and d100 nc micromodels from on equation a 1 the ratio of qc in the d100 micromodel is 17 times that of d100 nc this ratio though a roughly approximation indicates that the cracks in the d100 micromodel resulted in a notable qc which is larger than that in the d100 nc micromodel the length of the corner film should be close to the bubble length at the evaporation level b the immobile bubbles had a nondimensional total bubble length l b of approximately 0 35 l b nondimensionalized by l which we calculated as 1 d 1 d 2 l 1 2 with l b 0 35 the qc qin was 7 0 and 0 7 in the d100 and d100 nc micromodels respectively for a lower evaporation level such as level c because of the longer residual old liquid l b was shorter than 0 35 the shortening l b increased qc qin taking l b 0 27 as an example qc qin was 9 1 and 0 9 in the d100 and d100 nc micromodels respectively therefore the high evaporation level reduced the flow rate in the corners and the mixing of old and new liquids the new liquid flowed across the trapped bubble via corner flow the invading new liquid not only mixed with the old liquid but also enlarged the liquid area between the two trapped bubbles the capillary pressure sucked new liquid into the shrinking part and pushed the bubble out for instance the experiment with d200 micromodel at evaporation level a and ca 9 28 10 4 shown in fig 8 i more snapshots in fig s3 demonstrated that this expansion slowed and even ceased when this expanding liquid area filled the shrinking part at the same time the bubbles were outside the shrinking part the hydraulic radii of the menisci at the ends of the bubble were similar indicating that the capillary pressures were similar because ca was less than cath2 the upstream bubble was not able to squeeze through the shrinking part in contrast the downstream bubble could move slightly forward for instance in the d200 micromodel with level b evaporation and ca 7 92 10 4 the downstream meniscus was outside of the shrinking area as shown in fig 8 j 4 7 film flow in 3d porous media our study highlights the role of wetting films in the interaction between new and old liquids which may have significant implications in real world 3d porous media systems classical infiltration experiments by horton and hawkins 1965 have shown that rainwater moves along pre wetted paths in soil columns leading to the mixing of new and old water however residual liquid can be disconnected in real soil assouline and or 2014 hoogland et al 2016 and this discrepancy may be related to the development of film flow which can be influenced by factors such as pore morphology surface roughness wettability and imbibition rate geistlinger et al 2016 tsao et al 2021 zulfiqar et al 2020 tsao et al 2021 demonstrated the importance of film flow in non wetting phase entrapment by modifying a 2d micromodel into a 2 5d model they found that the relationship between the residual non wetting phase and ca in 2 5d models more closely resembled that of natural 3d porous media rock or soil than thin 2d micromodels in the 2d micromodels the non wetting phase air was trapped in dead end pores due to by pass while in the 2 5d models the air was trapped in pore bodies due to snap off the trapped bubbles caused by snap off did not break up the wetting film the pore morphology surface wettability and surface roughness also influenced air trapping zulfiqar et al 2020 conducted water displacement experiments revealing that air was trapped in a 1 mm glass bead packed sample when the contact angle was greater than 90 with water as a non wetting phase however in 1 mm sand packed samples air was trapped even when water was the wetting phase due to the similar pore morphology zulfiqar et al 2020 deduced that the difference was due to surface roughness the precursor thin film flow might not occur in glass bead packed samples because of their smooth surface geistlinger et al 2016 kibbey 2013 the root mean square roughness for glass beads may be 0 3 Œºm while it is 1 2 Œºm for natural sands kibbey 2013 by coating a rough surface on a glass micromodel channel geistlinger et al 2016 reported that a wetting film developed on the surface during drainage imbibition rate also controls the film flow development geistlinger et al 2016 tsao et al 2021 with a low amount of ca capillary fingering dominates the imbibition process however trapped bubbles may not form with too little ca tsao et al 2021 our study highlights the role of wetting films in the interaction between new and old liquids which may have significant implications in real world 3d porous media systems the film flow effect presented in this study could be applicable to fully 3d systems nevertheless there remain many challenges to overcome in investigations on film flow in 3d porous media 5 conclusions by conducting wdw and wdew experiments we determined the influence of evaporation and trapped non wetting phase bubbles on new and old wetting liquid interactions in pore doublet micromodels in the wdw experiments the pore geometry in the d200 micromodel satisfied the upstream air bubble formation condition Œ∂m d1 and trapped an upstream bubble in the second wetting step as ca was small however the pore geometry in the d100 micromodel did not satisfy any bubble formation conditions in the wdew experiments the evaporation step substantially decreased the size of the old liquid and increased Œ∂m and Œæm when Œ∂m d1 and Œæm d2 two bubbles formed in both the d100 and d200 micromodels in the second wetting step the entrapped upstream bubble reduced the efficiency with which the new liquid intruded on the old liquid however the cracks along the channels caused the corner flow of the new liquid via corner flow the new liquid was able to flow across the trapped bubble and intrude upon the old trapped liquid in addition the trapped bubbles were remobilized when the ca number reached the critical value predicted by the derived model while the upstream bubble was remobilized the bubble swept away a major part of the old liquid therefore the trapped bubbles separated the new and old liquids during the second wetting step and reduced the mixing of the old and new liquids however when the bubble was mobilized it enhanced the process of removing the old trapped liquid data availability data will be made available on request credit authorship contribution statement qun zhan huang methodology validation formal analysis investigation

22,low permeability aquitards are important sedimentary units that protect the underlying confined aquifers from contamination by seawater and anthropogenic sources in coastal leaky aquifer systems therefore the integrity of the aquitard is of crucial importance however the aquitard integrity may be vulnerable to horizontal heterogeneities in the form of aquitard windows in this study an innovative analytical model was developed to describe groundwater flow in a coastal leaky aquifer system with horizontal heterogeneities in hydraulic properties of either the aquitard or the confined aquifer consequently the effects of aquitard windows which manifest as horizontally local heterogeneities in hydraulic conductivity and or specific storage on the tidal wave propagation can be considered in the analysis analytical solutions were derived for tidal head or constant flux inland boundary conditions the derivation process avoided previous methodologies that involved the assembly of large size matrices the newly developed analytical model can cover multiple existing analytical models that are associated with the assumptions of homogeneity in hydraulic properties of the aquifer and the aquitard infinite horizontal extent of the coastal leaky aquifer system impermeability of the aquitard or ignorance of aquitard storativity analytical investigations revealed that high permeability aquitard windows acting as preferential flow conduits tended to dampen the tide induced head propagation within the underlying confined aquifer moreover an aquitard with a higher storativity but the same permeability and of considerable size can result in an apparent propagation bias the newly developed analytical model in this study was further corroborated through sandbox experiments both piezometer measurements and parameter estimates indicated the non negligible effects of high permeability aquitard windows on the tidal wave propagation the sandbox investigation also highlighted the importance of geostatistical inverse modeling in characterizing local heterogeneities within the confined aquifer and in detecting the location and size of aquitard windows when measurement data of tide induced aquifer head fluctuations were provided keywords coastal leaky aquifer system tidal wave propagation heterogeneities aquitard windows analytical model sandbox experiments data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction hydraulic responses of groundwater flow in coastal aquifer systems forced by ocean tides have long been interesting to hydrologists and the general public the alluvial aquifer system consists of multiple aquifers with alternating aquitards in between e g zhan and bian 2006 cihan et al 2014 thus the leakage across the aquitard may play an important role in the tidal dynamics in adjacent aquifers and disregarding the leakage effects by using perfectly confined aquifer models such as jacob jacob 1950 and monachesi and guarracino monachesi and guarracino 2011 may lead to improper or completely erroneous interpretation of flow characteristics zhao et al 2019 horizontal heterogeneity is a common feature of coastal aquifer systems the main reason is that alluvial fans formed at the base of mountains usually deposit coarser sediments at upstream and finer sediment at downstream chuang et al 2010 liang and zhang 2013 furthermore hydrogeological investigations have revealed horizontal heterogeneity within coastal aquifer systems for instances as can be seen in the phreatic aquifer located next to the river ajo in the coastal plain environment of the samboromb√≥n bay wetland argentina carol et al 2009 and the coastal aquifer in dongzhai harbor hainan province china guo et al 2010 notably such a horizontally heterogeneous feature can also be caused by reclamation asadi aghbolaghi et al 2014 or outlet capping guo et al 2007 for a leaky aquifer system a special feature associated with the horizontal heterogeneity is that the integrity of the aquitard layer is broken by high permeability windows which might be produced by faulting or paleo erosion waldron et al 2009 or even large earthquakes wang et al 2016 liao et al 2015 these high permeability aquitard windows can be at a scale of tens to hundreds of meters timms 2001 and they behave as conduits for rapid vertical movement of water and or contaminants cherry et al 2004 wiese and n√ºtzmann 2011 typical examples of leaky aquifer systems containing high permeability aquitard windows include the lower murrumbidgee fan in australia timms 2001 the waterloo moraine aquifer system in ontario canada stotler et al 2011 martin and frind 1998 and the mississippi embayment aquifer system in shelby county memphis tennessee usa waldron et al 2009 jazaei et al 2019 as pointed out by timms timms 2001 high permeability aquitard windows are probably common in many groundwater environments thus high permeability aquitard windows can also be prevalent in coastal leaky aquifer systems since the 1950s many analytical models have been developed to analyze tide induced groundwater fluctuations in coastal leaky aquifers e g zhao et al 2019 sun et al 2008 li and jiao 2001 wang et al 2015 however existing analytical models that consider the integrity or homogeneity for coastal leaky aquifer systems are unable to explain some of the propagation bias caused by aquitard windows instead a heterogeneous model that discretizes the spatial domain into a number of homogenous zones can handle the particular heterogeneity where the horizontal aquitard contains one or more windows and the zones corresponding to high permeability aquitard windows may be assigned with hydraulic conductivity values comparable to those of aquifers above or below the aquitard trefry trefry 1999 was the first to conduct an analytical study of tidal wave propagation in a coastal aquifer with discrete variation in the hydraulic properties but he did not consider the groundwater leakage through the aquitard although chuang et al chuang et al 2010 considered the leakage through the aquitard the aquitard storativity was ignored and the effects of high permeability aquitard windows on the tidal wave propagation were not examined in addition the analytical solutions provided by both trefry trefry 1999 and chuang et al chuang et al 2010 involved the assembly of complex large size matrix systems potentially distracting attention from the underlying physics if the aquitard storativity is ignored the vertical leakage across the aquitard is assumed to be linearly proportional to the head differences between the leaky confined aquifer below the aquitard and the confined or unconfined aquifer above the aquitard e g zhao et al 2019 sun et al 2008 wang et al 2015 jiao and tang 1999 however li and jiao li and jiao 2001 found that the effect of aquitard storativity on the aquifer head fluctuations can be negligible only when the aquitard storativity is comparable to or smaller than that of the confined aquifer in nature aquitards generally consist of finer and softer sediments and have higher storativity values than those of sandy aquifers providing that the aquitard thicknesses are comparable with the aquifer thicknesses e g konikow and neuzil 2007 leake 1990 thus the effects of aquitard storativity should be taken into account similar to high permeability aquitard windows windows associated with high or low storativity in the aquitard could also be prevalent in groundwater environments however the topic of high low storativity aquitard windows is deficient in literatures windows associated with small scale yet remarkable permeability or storativity anomalies in the aquitard may result in apparent propagation bias within a coastal aquifer the objective of this study is to explore the effects of local aquitard heterogeneity i e aquitard windows where the hydraulic conductivity and or specific storage differ substantially on the tide induced aquifer head fluctuations we will first develop a quasi two dimensional 2d model for a horizontally heterogeneous coastal leaky aquifer system with a finite length second the analytical solutions associated with tidal head and constant flux inland boundary conditions will be derived third some special cases of the derived analytical solutions will be provided fourth we will examine the propagation bias of aquifer head fluctuations caused by aquitard windows of hydraulic conductivity and or specific storage lastly laboratory sandbox experiments will be conducted to visualize the effects of a high permeability aquitard window on the propagation bias and to further interpret piezometric head measurements using the newly developed analytical model 2 mathematical model and analytical solutions 2 1 mathematical model in groundwater hydrology the spatial heterogeneity is regularly characterized by the varying distribution of hydraulic properties like hydraulic conductivity and or specific storage in particular most analytical and semi analytical approaches adopt the common practice of discretizing the problem domain into zones of piecewise constant hydraulic properties craig 2015 here we consider a horizontally extended coastal leaky aquifer system as shown in fig 1 the aquitard and underlying confined aquifer of interest are discontinuous in material properties and can be divided into n distinct zones each of which is assumed to be homogeneous and isotropic in hydraulic conductivity or transmissivity and or specific storage or storage coefficient the overlying unconfined aquifer is considered to have a large specific yield to effectively dampen the tidal effect causing the water table to remain nearly constant e g li and jiao 2001 jiao and tang 1999 let the x axis be positive in the landward direction and coincide with the contact interface between the aquitard and the confined aquifer and the z axis be vertical and positive upward the origin of the cartesian coordinate system is located at the coastline fig 1 the x coordinate of the interface between zones n and n 1 is referred to as xn the hydraulic conductivity of the aquitard is assumed to be at least two orders of magnitude smaller than that of the confined aquifer so that the groundwater flow is essentially vertical within the aquitard e g sep√∫lveda 2008 neuman and witherspoon 1969 in comparison groundwater flow is horizontal in the confined aquifer besides the difference in density between seawater and aquifer groundwater is neglected while deriving this analytical solution as it has been verified that this results in an error no greater than 2 5 of the tidal amplitude and the error decreases landward wang et al 2012 under the above assumptions the governing equation for groundwater flow within the confined aquifer corresponding to zone n n 1 2 3 n is chuang et al 2010 1 s n h n t t n 2 h n x 2 k n h n z z 0 where hn hn x t is the aquifer hydraulic head at location x at time t tn and sn are the transmissivity and storage coefficient of the confined aquifer respectively k n is the vertical hydraulic conductivity of the aquitard h n h n x z t is the aquitard hydraulic head at location x z at time t for zone n the governing equation for vertical groundwater flow in the aquitard is 2 k n 2 h n z 2 s s n h n t 0 z b where s s n is the aquitard specific storage and b is the uniform aquitard thickness for all zones the tidal boundary for the confined aquifer at x 0 as shown in fig 1 can be expressed in complex form as 3 h 1 0 t h m s l 0 a 0 exp i w t c where h m s l 0 is the mean sea level msl i 1 a 0 w and c are the amplitude angular frequency and initial radian phase shift of the tidal fluctuations respectively we consider two kinds of boundary conditions at the inland side i e x xn the first kind is the tidal head inland boundary condition which can be expressed in a complex form as 4 h n x n t h m s l n a n exp i Œ∏ exp i w t c where h m s l n an and Œ∏ are the mean hydraulic head amplitude and initial phase difference at the inland side boundary respectively it should be noted that eq 4 is typically representative for an island responding to dual tides sun et al 2008 huang et al 2012 trefry and bekele 2004 where h m s l n h m s l 0 and an a 0 seem to coincide with the real world situation if the hydraulic head does not tidally fluctuate i e an 0 eq 4 degenerates to a constant head inland boundary condition the prescribed boundary head turns from h m s l n to hn which could be suitable for a horizontally extensive coastal aquifer system a typical example for the constant head inland boundary is the field site located at the seine river estuary northwest france zhao et al 2019 in addition if the coastal aquifer system is assumed to be horizontally infinite h n h m s l 0 at xn is frequently considered in existing analytical models e g guo et al 2010 li and jiao 2001 the second kind is the constant flux inland boundary condition which can be expressed as 5 t n h n x t x x x n q n where qn is a prescribed constant flux in general many existing analytical models consider qn 0 at xn e g asadi aghbolaghi et al 2014 wang et al 2015 if xn is finite the second kind of inland boundary condition associated with qn 0 can apply to the particular hydrogeological setting in which the aquifer system encounters a rocky mountain at the inland side so that lateral recharge to groundwater can be neglected liang and zhang 2013 another hydrogeological setting is that the aquifer system has a subsurface cutoff wall constructed parallel to the coastline using grouted low permeability material to prevent the saline plume from moving inland and protect groundwater resources e g abdoulhalik and ahmed 2017 zheng et al 2021 the zero flux inland boundary condition for either an infinite or a finite length aquifer system is a special case to eq 5 at the interface between zones n and n 1 i e x xn the groundwater flow within the confined aquifer has to meet the continuity requirement of head and flux as a consequence one has 6 h n x n t h n 1 x n t and 7 t n h n x t x x x n t n 1 h n 1 x t x x x n in terms of the aquitard the boundary conditions for eq 2 are 8 h n x 0 t h n x n t 9 h n x b t h u where hu is the hydraulic head within the overlying unconfined aquifer that remains constant with coordinate x and time t 2 2 analytical solutions based on the separation of variables method which has been widely employed to handle analytical models of tide induced aquifer head fluctuations the analytical solutions for the aquifer hydraulic head hn x t associated with the tidal head and constant flux inland boundary conditions are given as follows see

superscripts 1 and 2 in the above equations correspond to the tidal head and constant flux inland boundary conditions respectively and Œª n 1 x Œª n 2 x œá n 1 œá n 2 œë n 1 x œë n 2 x are coefficients produced in the derivation of analytical solutions see appendix for details it should be noted that the coefficients Œª n 1 x Œª n 2 x œá n 1 œá n 2 œë n 1 x and œë n 2 x reflect the heterogeneity effects of the confined aquifer and the aquitard considering the horizontal heterogeneity of a coastal aquifer system trefry trefry 1999 and chuang et al chuang et al 2010 managed to obtain the analytical solutions for each zone simultaneously by assembling a 2 n 2 n matrix whose complexity and massive size could make it troublesome for readers to focus on the underlying physics for the typical n values of concern instead this study carries out a group of 2 2 matrix calculations to sequentially obtain the analytical solutions for each zone using a much more concise form which is numerically efficient the derivation process is to some extent similar to liang and zhang liang and zhang 2013 in which analytical solutions for the transient groundwater flow in an unconfined aquifer with piecewise constant hydraulic properties in the horizontal direction were derived based on the distributed transfer function method proposed by yang yang 2008 in comparison our derivation process does not involve defining state equations and determining system eigenvalues as introduced in the distributed transfer function method the normalized amplitude Œ± n j i e the ratio of the amplitude of the periodic head fluctuation to that of the tide and radian phase shift œÑ n j of aquifer head fluctuations in zone n corresponding to the j th j 1 2 type inland boundary condition are computed as 12 Œ± n j x h n p j x a 0 13 œÑ n j x arctan im h n p j x re h n p j x where h n p j x contains the information of amplitude and phase shift of periodic aquifer hydraulic head fluctuations and im and re denote the imaginary and real parts of a complex function respectively for the two kinds of inland boundary conditions one has h n p 1 x œá n 1 x a 0 œá n 2 x a n exp i Œ∏ and h n p 2 x Œ¥ n x a 0 h n p j x is the modulus of h n p j x that represents the amplitude at the horizontal location x 2 3 special cases the newly developed analytical solutions can be used to deal with several existing analytical models for coastal aquifer systems as long as the following five operations are considered 1 in terms of an infinite horizontal extent one can set the x coordinate of inland boundary xn to be infinite i e xn or large enough 2 in terms of a homogeneous leaky aquifer system one can designate all the zones to have the same hydraulic properties i e k n k n 1 s s n s s n 1 tn t n 1 and sn s n 1 3 if the aquitard storativity can be neglected one can set the aquitard specific storage s s n to be very small e g s s n 1 10 8 m 1 4 if the aquitard is ideally impermeable one can set the aquitard hydraulic conductivity to be zero i e k n 0 5 the piecewise constant type heterogeneity considered in this study can be used to approximate any type of horizontal heterogeneity for instances the linearly varying situation as reported in monachesi and guarracino monachesi and guarracino 2011 and wang et al wang et al 2015 as long as the number of divided zones is large enough following a careful review we list the existing analytical models as shown in table 1 that can be dealt with using the newly developed solutions by combining one or more of the aforementioned operations 3 effects of aquitard windows on tidal wave propagation previous studies have investigated the effects of aquifer heterogeneity on the tide induced aquifer head fluctuations chuang et al 2010 trefry 1999 however this study mainly focuses on analyzing the effects of local heterogeneity in the aquitard which behaves as a window regarding the hydraulic conductivity and or specific storage here we consider a hypothetical coastal leaky aquifer system of a long but narrow island with a horizontal extent of 500 m to the best of our knowledge a horizontally heterogeneous analytical model has not been developed for such an island aquifer system assuming that the confined aquifer is homogeneous and the middle of the aquitard has a 10 m wide zone of local heterogeneity the aquifer aquitard system can be divided into three zones i e n 3 with x 1 245 m x 2 255 m and x 3 500 m based on the ranges of hydraulic parameters in the leaky confined systems summarized by li and jiao li and jiao 2001 the transmissivity and storage coefficient of the confined aquifer are set to be tn 1 5 102 m2 d and sn 1 10 4 n 1 2 or 3 respectively the aquitard thickness is set to be 5 m for the tidal wave the amplitude is a 0 an 1 m the initial phase shift is c 0 the phase difference is Œ∏ 0 the angular frequency is w 6 283 d 1 corresponding to the period of 1 day the mean sea level is h m s l 0 h m s l n 0 m and the constant hydraulic head within the upper unconfined aquifer is hu 0 m 3 1 horizontally homogeneous island leaky aquifer system firstly we consider the baseline scenario of a homogeneous aquitard for the purpose of comparison for this scenario the aquitard in zones 1 2 and 3 has the same hydraulic conductivity of k n 5 10 3 m d and the same specific storage of s s n 1 10 4 m 1 to examine if the newly developed analytical solutions could be used in a scenario when there is no aquitard storativity a constant aquitard specific storage of s s n 1 10 8 m 1 is also considered fig 2 reveals that the analytical solution of sun et al sun et al 2008 can be viewed as a special case of the newly developed solution with the tidal head inland boundary condition because both curves of normalized amplitude Œ± and phase shift œÑ versus the horizontal distance associated with s s n 1 10 8 m 1 coincide with those of sun et al sun et al 2008 where the aquitard storativity is not considered however the normalized amplitude Œ± decreases with s s n while the phase shift œÑ scalar value increases with s s n the phenomenon occurs because the storage of the aquitard can dampen the hydraulic head fluctuations in the confined aquifer and prolong the time lag i e the phase shift thus a larger s s n decreases Œ± and increases œÑ li and jiao 2001 3 2 aquitard windows of hydraulic conductivity sun et al sun et al 2008 have analysed the effects of aquitard leakage on the tidal wave propagation for an island leaky aquifer system but they did not take the spatial heterogeneity of the system into account in this study we consider the second scenario in which the aquitard has a single window of hydraulic conductivity two cases are considered in this scenario in case 1 k 2 is assumed to increase from 5 10 3 m d to 5 10 1 m d i e a high k window case 1 is representative of the hydrogeological setting in which a conduit exists in the aquitard forming a preferential flow conduit for adjacent aquifers to exchange substantial quantities of water and chemicals in case 2 k 2 is assumed to decrease from 5 10 3 m d to 5 10 5 m d i e a low k window case 2 is representative of the hydrogeological setting in which there exists an aquitard block restricting the groundwater flow through the aquitard such a block is perhaps caused by a concrete tunnel passing through the aquitard in this scenario we do not consider the aquitard storativity so a very small value of 1 10 8 m 1 is applied to s s n fig 3 shows that a low k window seems to produce negligible effects on the tidal wave propagation however a high k window can produce a remarkable bias of tidal wave propagation specifically fig 3a shows that the high k window substantially reduces the amplitude Œ± not only within zone 2 but also within the adjacent zones fig 3b indicates that the high k window also decreases the phase shift œÑ with this decrease being more apparent at positions near the window the main cause of the aforementioned phenomenon is that the high k window can enhance local groundwater leakage into the confined aquifer which can dampen the tide induced head fluctuations occurring near the window in addition since the aquitard storativity is negligible the high k window has the same effects on the time lag i e the phase shift as an increase in the aquifer transmissivity at positions near the window li and jiao 2001 which enhances the water transfer rate in the confined aquifer and thus leads to a decrease in œÑ here we validated the analytical solution corresponding to a high k window in the aquitard via numerical simulation which considered both the tidal head and zero flux inland boundary conditions figures s2 and s3 in supporting information notably the effect of a high k window in the aquitard also depends on its size considering that the high k window is associated with k 2 5 10 1 m d and the size or width i e d 2 x 2 x 1 of 0 10 20 and 30 m fig 4 indicates that a larger size of the high k window results in a smaller Œ± as well as a smaller œÑ suggesting that enhanced preferential leakage can diminish the tidal wave propagation to a great extent moreover the location of the high k window in the aquitard can influence the spatial distribution patterns of Œ± and œÑ here we consider that the locations i e x 1 to x 2 of the high k window are 245 255 m 225 235 m and 205 215 m away from the coastline fig 5 a demonstrates that the distribution of Œ± is apparently asymmetric when the high k window gets closer to the left coastline meanwhile the turning point of the Œ± x curve also gets closer to the left coastline although this asymmetric phenomenon also occurs in the horizontal distribution of œÑ we note that the turning point of the œÑ x curve tends to get closer to the right coastline fig 5b furthermore such an asymmetric phenomenon of œÑ is not as apparent as that of Œ± fig 5b 3 2 aquitard windows of specific storage as mentioned above the aquitard storativity cannot be neglected here we consider the third scenario in which the aquitard has a single window of specific storage anomaly two cases are considered in this scenario for the purpose of illustration in case 1 s s 1 s s 3 1 10 4 m 1 and s s 2 1 10 3 m 1 i e a high ss window here s s 2 may correspond to soft clay particles while s s 1 and s s 3 may correspond to silty particles in case 2 s s 1 and s s 3 are kept the same as that in case 1 while s s 2 decreases to 1 10 5 m 1 i e a low ss window which could correspond to sandy silt particles in this scenario the aquitard is homogeneous in hydraulic conductivity with k n 5 10 3 m d the homogenous case with s s n 1 10 4 m 1 is also provided for comparison fig 6 shows that a low ss window implements negligible effects on tidal wave propagation however a high ss window can slightly decrease the amplitude and visibly increases the phase shift considering the high ss window associated with different sizes which are the same to those in the second scenario fig 7 indicates that a larger size of the high ss window also results in a smaller Œ± but a larger œÑ considering the high ss window associated with different locations which are the same to those in the second scenario fig 8 indicates that the spatial distributions of Œ± and œÑ becomes slightly asymmetric when the high ss window gets closer to the left coastline meanwhile the turning point of the Œ± x curve as well as the œÑ x curve also gets closer to the left coastline based on above analysis it can be inferred that a larger size of the high ss window will enhance the asymmetric patterns of theŒ± x and œÑ x curves in the horizontal direction overall we discover that even the small scale heterogeneity of aquitard hydraulic conductivity and or specific storage can produce visible effects on the tide induced head fluctuations in the leaky confined aquifer particular attention should be paid to high k aquitard windows that behave as preferential flow conduits for adjacent aquifers to exchange water and mass high ss aquitard windows also deserve careful attention undoubtedly a larger size of the high k or high ss window will produce more remarkable effects in addition the location of aquitard windows affects the horizontal distribution patterns of the amplitude and phase shift of the aquifer head fluctuations 4 laboratory sandbox experiments 4 1 sandbox construction a synthetic coastal leaky aquifer system was constructed in a sandbox made of organic transparent glass 1 2 m in length 0 9 m in height and 0 12 m in width twenty five ports 0 01 m in diameter were cut out of the transparent organic glass wall to allow for the installation of horizontal wells these ports were evenly distributed with a horizontal interval of 0 2 m and a vertical interval of 0 12 m each well was constructed with a stainless steel tubing equipped with a valve the cuts were then covered with a nylon mesh that was bonded to the tubing with corrosion resistant epoxy extreme care was taken to avoid the epoxy covering the mesh which could impede water flow fig 9 a is a schematic drawing of the frontal view of the synthetic coastal leaky aquifer system showing the 25 ports and indicating the ports used for pore water pressure measurement the flow system for the sandbox is forced by a periodic head reservoir at the left end and by a constant head reservoir at the right end the adjoining reservoirs are capable of supplying water to the sandbox quickly and efficiently in this sandbox one perforated plate mesh combination was installed at each end of the sandbox to serve as a porous media water interface and to provide hydraulic control in addition a solid thin plate was installed at the left end of the sandbox and against the perforated plate mesh combination the bottom of this thin plate was placed slightly below the interface between the aquitard and the unconfined aquifer therefore the solid thin plate dampens the tidal effects so that the hydraulic head in the unconfined aquifer remains nearly constant fig 9b is a photograph of the sandbox showing the major devices used for laboratory experiments the periodic head in the left reservoir was generated by an ac servo motor with a speed range of 0 2000 r min the motor was connected to a funnel in the left reservoir by a steel ball screw a wave maker generated currents for the motor to automatically adjust the rotation direction and speed of the motor one can directly set the amplitude and period of prescribed periodic boundary head in the control panel of the wave maker as the motor ran the funnel rose and fell periodically meanwhile we continuously injected water into the left reservoir with a relatively large flux so that the water level in the left reservoir periodically varied with time creating a periodic boundary head for the sandbox the constant head in the right reservoir was maintained through the collaborative work of two peristaltic pumps the first pump continuously injected water into the right reservoir with a relatively small flux the second pump continuously pumped water out from the right reservoir with a relatively large flux the vertical location of the soft tubing mouth of the second pump determines the prescribed value of constant head in the right reservoir to further maintain constant hydraulic head for the unconfined aquifer throughout the experiment we placed the soft tubing mouth of the second pumping slightly above the soil surface photographs of the side and prone views of the laboratory experiment platform can be seen from figures s4 and s5 in supporting information the data acquisition system used for the laboratory experiments consisted of three major components the first component included six pressure transducers which were connected to six ports via hard rubber tubing three of which i e ports 1 3 and 5 measured piezometer head in the aquifer two in the aquitard and one in the unconfined aquifer the pressure transducer figure s6 model uld100 has a range of 0 to 100 kpa and a measurement error of 0 1 the second component was a 20 channel data acquisition board model uld485 20 the third component was a pc with dy1000 sw v01 software for automated data acquisition 4 2 construction of the synthetic coastal leaky aquifer system in total three layers were sequentially deposited to mimic a leaky aquifer system the lowest layer designated as the confined aquifer had a thickness of 0 3 m and was deposited with fine sand medium sand and coarse sand from the left to the right end each sand type was deposited across a length of 0 4 m the middle layer designated as the aquitard had a thickness of 0 18 m and was deposited with kaolin clay medium sand and kaolin clay from the left to the right end each clay type was deposited across a length of 0 51 m whereas the medium sand type was deposited across a length of 0 18 m the portion of medium sand inside the aquitard is manifested as a high k aquitard window the top layer designated as the unconfined aquifer had a thickness of 0 2 m and was deposited with fine sand prior to filling the sandbox the two reservoirs were ponded to ensure that the deposited particles maintained saturation throughout the filling process the filling was sufficiently slow to avoid the trapping air in the soil after filling the sandbox sufficient time was provided for the aquifer system to compact under self weight 4 3 experimental data analysis nine cases for testing the tidal wave propagation characteristics in the synthetic coastal leaky aquifer system were sequentially conducted these nine cases were sorted into three groups the prescribed values of the period and amplitude a 0 of the periodic boundary head for each case are summarized in table 2 the observed time series of piezometer head at six measurement ports i e 1 3 5 11 14 and 22 are shown in figure s7 extreme care was taken to ensure the stability of the periodic state generally based on figure s7 the effects of the initial condition can be eliminated after a time span of four periods furthermore figure s7 suggests that the amplitude of the periodic aquifer head decreased from the left to the right end of the sandbox as expected we have further calculated the normalized amplitude Œ± and phase shift œÑ of the periodic variations of observed piezometer head in the confined aquifer by fitting the time series data in figure s7 using a trigonometric function table s1 summarizes the observed Œ± and œÑ values of the periodic head within the confined aquifer for each synthetic case and fig 10 demonstrates the spatial distribution pattern of Œ± and œÑ versus the horizontal distance fig 10 validates that the amplitude of boundary head variations has minimal effect on the spatial distribution pattern of Œ±and œÑ the sandbox experiment also validates that a larger period consistently results in a larger Œ±and a smaller period yields a larger œÑ table s1 in accordance with previous studies e g li and jiao 2001 jiao and tang 1999 the effects of a high k aquitard window on the tidal wave propagation within the confined aquifer can also been analysed from fig 10 the synthetic confined aquifer is horizontally heterogeneous and notably the central part is deposited with medium sand while the left part is deposited with fine sand if there is no window in the aquitard a slight decay in Œ± and a nearly linear increase in œÑ scalar value within the central part should be expected to occur in contrast a faster decay in Œ± and a slower increase in œÑ was observed fig 10 therefore the aquitard window manifested as a preferential flow channel was created and this enhanced the recharge to the central part of the confined aquifer inhibiting the tidal wave propagation in the confined aquifer this is also in accordance with the analytical model based discussions mentioned above 4 4 parameter estimation the newly developed analytical model was used to fit the observed Œ± and œÑ values of the periodic aquifer head at ports 1 3 and 5 to estimate the hydraulic parameters of the horizontally heterogeneous confined aquifer and aquitard for the confined aquifer the hydraulic parameters are the transmissivity t 1 t 2 and t 3 numbered from the left to the right hereinafter and the storativity s 1 s 2 and s 3 for the aquitard the hydraulic parameters are the hydraulic conductivity k 1 k 2 and k 3 and the specific storage s s1 s s2 and s s3 the parameter estimation was completed using the matlab built in lsqnonlin function with the levenberg marquardt algorithm we constructed the following objective function as 14 œÜ Œ± œÑ p Œ± o b s Œ± p 2 œÑ o b s œÑ p 2 where p is a 12 1 vector consisting of the logarithm of hydraulic parameters the logarithm function is used to enforce the positiveness of these parameters during the estimation process Œ± obs and œÑ obs are the 27 1 vectors consisting of observed aquifer Œ± and œÑ for all synthetic cases Œ± p and œÑ p are the 27 1 vectors consisting of analytically simulated Œ± and œÑ given the parameter vector p when the parameter estimation is completed the mean square error mse was calculated to further assess the fitting performance which is expressed as 15 m s e œÜ Œ± œÑ p n where n 54 is the number of total observational data initial values as well as the lower and upper bounds for the twelve parameters are provided in table 3 the corresponding parameter estimates together with the mse values are also provided in table 3 table 3 indicates that the inverse modeling yields an excellent mse value of 1 08 10 4 in contrast when we choose to ignore the window in the aquitard and assume the aquitard to be horizontally homogeneous the inverse modeling yields an mse value of 5 06 10 4 which reveals that the aquitard is horizontally heterogeneous in reality it can be found that the estimated hydraulic conductivity of the aquitard window i e k 2 is three to four orders of magnitude larger than the other two parts i e k 1 and k 3 meanwhile the estimated specific storage of the aquitard window i e ss 2 is two orders of magnitude smaller than the other two parts i e ss 1 and ss 3 a larger hydraulic conductivity while a smaller specific storage of the aquitard window is quite reasonable because sandy particles tend to have considerably larger permeability and relatively smaller storativity than clayey particles particular attention should be paid to the transmissivity of the confined aquifer table 3 clearly shows that t 3 is one order of magnitude smaller than t 2 and is slightly smaller than t 1 generally porous media with coarser particles have greater permeability values the reason behind the significantly smaller value of t 3 can be explained based on pore spaces coarse sand has relatively large pore spaces which could be filled by the clayey particles that moved down during the filling process to form the aquitard layer in the sandbox experiment leading to lower permeability of the coarse sand this was further corroborated by the muddy water that we observed flowing from the sandbox into the right reservoir during the experiments moreover the estimated s 3 is one order of magnitude larger than s 1 and s 2 which provides further evidence to support the blocking phenomenon because a hydrogeological unit consisting of finer particles usually has a larger specific storage value after further checking of the bias in fitting the observed Œ± we find that for each experiment group the calibrated Œ± is larger than the observed value at port 5 i e x 1 0 m table s1 such a relatively large bias is probably caused by the local heterogeneity near port 5 and is mainly attributed to aforementioned blocking phenomenon characterization of the local heterogeneity of the sandbox is beyond the scope of this analytical and experimental study however scholars interested in geostatistical inverse modeling may utilize the tidal wave propagation data to image the spatial distribution of aquifer hydraulic parameters in addition potential inverse modeling research can be conducted to detect the location and size of the aquitard window given the tidal wave propagation data here the groundwater flow within the aquitard containing windows is assumed to be strictly vertical however if the window was of considerable size the effects of horizontal flow within and near the windows on the tidal wave propagation might not be ignored for these future research aspects our results offer the raw sandbox experiment data after comparing the newly developed analytical solutions with the experimental results of this study we believe that they may also be applicable for explaining the propagation bias revealed from the in situ monitoring data collected in some field cases e g the garden island on the continental shelf of western australia sun et al 2008 trefry and bekele 2004 future research may focus on interpreting such in situ propagation bias by coupling the newly developed analytical solutions with a parameter optimization code such as pest doherty 2008 and ucode poeter and hill 1999 5 summary and conclusions we developed a quasi 2d analytical model to describe the head fluctuation in a horizontally heterogeneous coastal leaky aquifer system with a finite extent considering aquitard windows with permeability and or storativity anomalies analytical solutions associated with tidal head and constant flux inland boundary conditions have been derived based on the separation of variables method without loss of generality we considered a hypothetical island leaky aquifer system as an example to analytically explore the effects of aquitard windows that manifest as local heterogeneities in hydraulic conductivity and or specific storage on the horizontal distribution of the amplitude and phase shift of the head fluctuation within the confined aquifer in addition laboratory experiments were conducted to reveal the effects of the aquitard window on tidal wave propagation the main conclusions are summarized as follows 1 low permeability aquitard windows produce negligible effects on tide induced groundwater fluctuations in the confined aquifer while high permeability aquitard windows that act as preferential flow conduits for the adjacent two aquifers to exchange water can dramatically diminish the tidal wave propagation in the confined aquifer a larger size or width of the high permeability aquitard window can diminish the tidal wave propagation to a larger extent apparent tidal wave propagation bias in the confined aquifer can also be attributed to the occurrence of high storativity aquitard windows of considerable sizes in comparison those aquitard windows with low storativity anomalies impose little effects on the tide induced groundwater fluctuations in the confined aquifer 2 locations of aquitard windows influence the spatial distribution patterns of the amplitude and phase shift of the aquifer head fluctuations theoretical analysis results revealed in this study have the potential to help interpret piezometer data thereby unraveling complicated propagation bias resulting from aquitard windows with permeability and or storativity anomalies 3 we have derived analytical solutions that do not need to assemble large size algebraic matrix systems whose dimensionality is determined by the number of divided homogeneous zones based on trefry trefry 1999 and chuang et al chuang et al 2010 the newly derived analytical solutions only involve 2 2 matrices which are determined based on the continuity requirements of hydraulic head and groundwater flux at the zone interfaces the derivation process is completed through the multiplier calculations of involved matrices resulting in concise expressions of the analytical solutions 4 the developed analytical solutions can be used to deal with several existing analytical models associated with some widely used assumptions for coastal aquifer systems from the perspectives of infinite horizontal extent homogeneity of the leaky aquifer system negligible aquitard storativity impermeable aquitard and the approximation of linearly or other complicated horizontal heterogeneity features with dense small size homogeneous zones 5 piezometer observations made in the laboratory experiments demonstrate a faster decay in the amplitude and a slower increase in the phase shift of the periodic aquifer head near the aquitard window which is in accordance with analytical discussions parameter estimation indicates substantial difference in hydraulic parameters between the aquitard window deposited with medium sand and other portions deposited with kaolin clay revealing localized high k aquitard heterogeneity the laboratory experiments also provide insights to future research topics regarding the inverse modeling for capturing the local heterogeneity within the confined aquifer and for detecting the location and size of the aquitard window data availability statement the data can be found https doi org 10 6084 m9 figshare 14069459 v2

22,low permeability aquitards are important sedimentary units that protect the underlying confined aquifers from contamination by seawater and anthropogenic sources in coastal leaky aquifer systems therefore the integrity of the aquitard is of crucial importance however the aquitard integrity may be vulnerable to horizontal heterogeneities in the form of aquitard windows in this study an innovative analytical model was developed to describe groundwater flow in a coastal leaky aquifer system with horizontal heterogeneities in hydraulic properties of either the aquitard or the confined aquifer consequently the effects of aquitard windows which manifest as horizontally local heterogeneities in hydraulic conductivity and or specific storage on the tidal wave propagation can be considered in the analysis analytical solutions were derived for tidal head or constant flux inland boundary conditions the derivation process avoided previous methodologies that involved the assembly of large size matrices the newly developed analytical model can cover multiple existing analytical models that are associated with the assumptions of homogeneity in hydraulic properties of the aquifer and the aquitard infinite horizontal extent of the coastal leaky aquifer system impermeability of the aquitard or ignorance of aquitard storativity analytical investigations revealed that high permeability aquitard windows acting as preferential flow conduits tended to dampen the tide induced head propagation within the underlying confined aquifer moreover an aquitard with a higher storativity but the same permeability and of considerable size can result in an apparent propagation bias the newly developed analytical model in this study was further corroborated through sandbox experiments both piezometer measurements and parameter estimates indicated the non negligible effects of high permeability aquitard windows on the tidal wave propagation the sandbox investigation also highlighted the importance of geostatistical inverse modeling in characterizing local heterogeneities within the confined aquifer and in detecting the location and size of aquitard windows when measurement data of tide induced aquifer head fluctuations were provided keywords coastal leaky aquifer system tidal wave propagation heterogeneities aquitard windows analytical model sandbox experiments data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction hydraulic responses of groundwater flow in coastal aquifer systems forced by ocean tides have long been interesting to hydrologists and the general public the alluvial aquifer system consists of multiple aquifers with alternating aquitards in between e g zhan and bian 2006 cihan et al 2014 thus the leakage across the aquitard may play an important role in the tidal dynamics in adjacent aquifers and disregarding the leakage effects by using perfectly confined aquifer models such as jacob jacob 1950 and monachesi and guarracino monachesi and guarracino 2011 may lead to improper or completely erroneous interpretation of flow characteristics zhao et al 2019 horizontal heterogeneity is a common feature of coastal aquifer systems the main reason is that alluvial fans formed at the base of mountains usually deposit coarser sediments at upstream and finer sediment at downstream chuang et al 2010 liang and zhang 2013 furthermore hydrogeological investigations have revealed horizontal heterogeneity within coastal aquifer systems for instances as can be seen in the phreatic aquifer located next to the river ajo in the coastal plain environment of the samboromb√≥n bay wetland argentina carol et al 2009 and the coastal aquifer in dongzhai harbor hainan province china guo et al 2010 notably such a horizontally heterogeneous feature can also be caused by reclamation asadi aghbolaghi et al 2014 or outlet capping guo et al 2007 for a leaky aquifer system a special feature associated with the horizontal heterogeneity is that the integrity of the aquitard layer is broken by high permeability windows which might be produced by faulting or paleo erosion waldron et al 2009 or even large earthquakes wang et al 2016 liao et al 2015 these high permeability aquitard windows can be at a scale of tens to hundreds of meters timms 2001 and they behave as conduits for rapid vertical movement of water and or contaminants cherry et al 2004 wiese and n√ºtzmann 2011 typical examples of leaky aquifer systems containing high permeability aquitard windows include the lower murrumbidgee fan in australia timms 2001 the waterloo moraine aquifer system in ontario canada stotler et al 2011 martin and frind 1998 and the mississippi embayment aquifer system in shelby county memphis tennessee usa waldron et al 2009 jazaei et al 2019 as pointed out by timms timms 2001 high permeability aquitard windows are probably common in many groundwater environments thus high permeability aquitard windows can also be prevalent in coastal leaky aquifer systems since the 1950s many analytical models have been developed to analyze tide induced groundwater fluctuations in coastal leaky aquifers e g zhao et al 2019 sun et al 2008 li and jiao 2001 wang et al 2015 however existing analytical models that consider the integrity or homogeneity for coastal leaky aquifer systems are unable to explain some of the propagation bias caused by aquitard windows instead a heterogeneous model that discretizes the spatial domain into a number of homogenous zones can handle the particular heterogeneity where the horizontal aquitard contains one or more windows and the zones corresponding to high permeability aquitard windows may be assigned with hydraulic conductivity values comparable to those of aquifers above or below the aquitard trefry trefry 1999 was the first to conduct an analytical study of tidal wave propagation in a coastal aquifer with discrete variation in the hydraulic properties but he did not consider the groundwater leakage through the aquitard although chuang et al chuang et al 2010 considered the leakage through the aquitard the aquitard storativity was ignored and the effects of high permeability aquitard windows on the tidal wave propagation were not examined in addition the analytical solutions provided by both trefry trefry 1999 and chuang et al chuang et al 2010 involved the assembly of complex large size matrix systems potentially distracting attention from the underlying physics if the aquitard storativity is ignored the vertical leakage across the aquitard is assumed to be linearly proportional to the head differences between the leaky confined aquifer below the aquitard and the confined or unconfined aquifer above the aquitard e g zhao et al 2019 sun et al 2008 wang et al 2015 jiao and tang 1999 however li and jiao li and jiao 2001 found that the effect of aquitard storativity on the aquifer head fluctuations can be negligible only when the aquitard storativity is comparable to or smaller than that of the confined aquifer in nature aquitards generally consist of finer and softer sediments and have higher storativity values than those of sandy aquifers providing that the aquitard thicknesses are comparable with the aquifer thicknesses e g konikow and neuzil 2007 leake 1990 thus the effects of aquitard storativity should be taken into account similar to high permeability aquitard windows windows associated with high or low storativity in the aquitard could also be prevalent in groundwater environments however the topic of high low storativity aquitard windows is deficient in literatures windows associated with small scale yet remarkable permeability or storativity anomalies in the aquitard may result in apparent propagation bias within a coastal aquifer the objective of this study is to explore the effects of local aquitard heterogeneity i e aquitard windows where the hydraulic conductivity and or specific storage differ substantially on the tide induced aquifer head fluctuations we will first develop a quasi two dimensional 2d model for a horizontally heterogeneous coastal leaky aquifer system with a finite length second the analytical solutions associated with tidal head and constant flux inland boundary conditions will be derived third some special cases of the derived analytical solutions will be provided fourth we will examine the propagation bias of aquifer head fluctuations caused by aquitard windows of hydraulic conductivity and or specific storage lastly laboratory sandbox experiments will be conducted to visualize the effects of a high permeability aquitard window on the propagation bias and to further interpret piezometric head measurements using the newly developed analytical model 2 mathematical model and analytical solutions 2 1 mathematical model in groundwater hydrology the spatial heterogeneity is regularly characterized by the varying distribution of hydraulic properties like hydraulic conductivity and or specific storage in particular most analytical and semi analytical approaches adopt the common practice of discretizing the problem domain into zones of piecewise constant hydraulic properties craig 2015 here we consider a horizontally extended coastal leaky aquifer system as shown in fig 1 the aquitard and underlying confined aquifer of interest are discontinuous in material properties and can be divided into n distinct zones each of which is assumed to be homogeneous and isotropic in hydraulic conductivity or transmissivity and or specific storage or storage coefficient the overlying unconfined aquifer is considered to have a large specific yield to effectively dampen the tidal effect causing the water table to remain nearly constant e g li and jiao 2001 jiao and tang 1999 let the x axis be positive in the landward direction and coincide with the contact interface between the aquitard and the confined aquifer and the z axis be vertical and positive upward the origin of the cartesian coordinate system is located at the coastline fig 1 the x coordinate of the interface between zones n and n 1 is referred to as xn the hydraulic conductivity of the aquitard is assumed to be at least two orders of magnitude smaller than that of the confined aquifer so that the groundwater flow is essentially vertical within the aquitard e g sep√∫lveda 2008 neuman and witherspoon 1969 in comparison groundwater flow is horizontal in the confined aquifer besides the difference in density between seawater and aquifer groundwater is neglected while deriving this analytical solution as it has been verified that this results in an error no greater than 2 5 of the tidal amplitude and the error decreases landward wang et al 2012 under the above assumptions the governing equation for groundwater flow within the confined aquifer corresponding to zone n n 1 2 3 n is chuang et al 2010 1 s n h n t t n 2 h n x 2 k n h n z z 0 where hn hn x t is the aquifer hydraulic head at location x at time t tn and sn are the transmissivity and storage coefficient of the confined aquifer respectively k n is the vertical hydraulic conductivity of the aquitard h n h n x z t is the aquitard hydraulic head at location x z at time t for zone n the governing equation for vertical groundwater flow in the aquitard is 2 k n 2 h n z 2 s s n h n t 0 z b where s s n is the aquitard specific storage and b is the uniform aquitard thickness for all zones the tidal boundary for the confined aquifer at x 0 as shown in fig 1 can be expressed in complex form as 3 h 1 0 t h m s l 0 a 0 exp i w t c where h m s l 0 is the mean sea level msl i 1 a 0 w and c are the amplitude angular frequency and initial radian phase shift of the tidal fluctuations respectively we consider two kinds of boundary conditions at the inland side i e x xn the first kind is the tidal head inland boundary condition which can be expressed in a complex form as 4 h n x n t h m s l n a n exp i Œ∏ exp i w t c where h m s l n an and Œ∏ are the mean hydraulic head amplitude and initial phase difference at the inland side boundary respectively it should be noted that eq 4 is typically representative for an island responding to dual tides sun et al 2008 huang et al 2012 trefry and bekele 2004 where h m s l n h m s l 0 and an a 0 seem to coincide with the real world situation if the hydraulic head does not tidally fluctuate i e an 0 eq 4 degenerates to a constant head inland boundary condition the prescribed boundary head turns from h m s l n to hn which could be suitable for a horizontally extensive coastal aquifer system a typical example for the constant head inland boundary is the field site located at the seine river estuary northwest france zhao et al 2019 in addition if the coastal aquifer system is assumed to be horizontally infinite h n h m s l 0 at xn is frequently considered in existing analytical models e g guo et al 2010 li and jiao 2001 the second kind is the constant flux inland boundary condition which can be expressed as 5 t n h n x t x x x n q n where qn is a prescribed constant flux in general many existing analytical models consider qn 0 at xn e g asadi aghbolaghi et al 2014 wang et al 2015 if xn is finite the second kind of inland boundary condition associated with qn 0 can apply to the particular hydrogeological setting in which the aquifer system encounters a rocky mountain at the inland side so that lateral recharge to groundwater can be neglected liang and zhang 2013 another hydrogeological setting is that the aquifer system has a subsurface cutoff wall constructed parallel to the coastline using grouted low permeability material to prevent the saline plume from moving inland and protect groundwater resources e g abdoulhalik and ahmed 2017 zheng et al 2021 the zero flux inland boundary condition for either an infinite or a finite length aquifer system is a special case to eq 5 at the interface between zones n and n 1 i e x xn the groundwater flow within the confined aquifer has to meet the continuity requirement of head and flux as a consequence one has 6 h n x n t h n 1 x n t and 7 t n h n x t x x x n t n 1 h n 1 x t x x x n in terms of the aquitard the boundary conditions for eq 2 are 8 h n x 0 t h n x n t 9 h n x b t h u where hu is the hydraulic head within the overlying unconfined aquifer that remains constant with coordinate x and time t 2 2 analytical solutions based on the separation of variables method which has been widely employed to handle analytical models of tide induced aquifer head fluctuations the analytical solutions for the aquifer hydraulic head hn x t associated with the tidal head and constant flux inland boundary conditions are given as follows see

heterogeneity effects of the confined aquifer and the aquitard considering the horizontal heterogeneity of a coastal aquifer system trefry trefry 1999 and chuang et al chuang et al 2010 managed to obtain the analytical solutions for each zone simultaneously by assembling a 2 n 2 n matrix whose complexity and massive size could make it troublesome for readers to focus on the underlying physics for the typical n values of concern instead this study carries out a group of 2 2 matrix calculations to sequentially obtain the analytical solutions for each zone using a much more concise form which is numerically efficient the derivation process is to some extent similar to liang and zhang liang and zhang 2013 in which analytical solutions for the transient groundwater flow in an unconfined aquifer with piecewise constant hydraulic properties in the horizontal direction were derived based on the distributed transfer function method proposed by yang yang 2008 in comparison our derivation process does not involve defining state equations and determining system eigenvalues as introduced in the distributed transfer function method the normalized amplitude Œ± n j i e the ratio of the amplitude of the periodic head fluctuation to that of the tide and radian phase shift œÑ n j of aquifer head fluctuations in zone n corresponding to the j th j 1 2 type inland boundary condition are computed as 12 Œ± n j x h n p j x a 0 13 œÑ n j x arctan im h n p j x re h n p j x where h n p j x contains the information of amplitude and phase shift of periodic aquifer hydraulic head fluctuations and im and re denote the imaginary and real parts of a complex function respectively for the two kinds of inland boundary conditions one has h n p 1 x œá n 1 x a 0 œá n 2 x a n exp i Œ∏ and h n p 2 x Œ¥ n x a 0 h n p j x is the modulus of h n p j x that represents the amplitude at the horizontal location x 2 3 special cases the newly developed analytical solutions can be used to deal with several existing analytical models for coastal aquifer systems as long as the following five operations are considered 1 in terms of an infinite horizontal extent one can set the x coordinate of inland boundary xn to be infinite i e xn or large enough 2 in terms of a homogeneous leaky aquifer system one can designate all the zones to have the same hydraulic properties i e k n k n 1 s s n s s n 1 tn t n 1 and sn s n 1 3 if the aquitard storativity can be neglected one can set the aquitard specific storage s s n to be very small e g s s n 1 10 8 m 1 4 if the aquitard is ideally impermeable one can set the aquitard hydraulic conductivity to be zero i e k n 0 5 the piecewise constant type heterogeneity considered in this study can be used to approximate any type of horizontal heterogeneity for instances the linearly varying situation as reported in monachesi and guarracino monachesi and guarracino 2011 and wang et al wang et al 2015 as long as the number of divided zones is large enough following a careful review we list the existing analytical models as shown in table 1 that can be dealt with using the newly developed solutions by combining one or more of the aforementioned operations 3 effects of aquitard windows on tidal wave propagation previous studies have investigated the effects of aquifer heterogeneity on the tide induced aquifer head fluctuations chuang et al 2010 trefry 1999 however this study mainly focuses on analyzing the effects of local heterogeneity in the aquitard which behaves as a window regarding the hydraulic conductivity and or specific storage here we consider a hypothetical coastal leaky aquifer system of a long but narrow island with a horizontal extent of 500 m to the best of our knowledge a horizontally heterogeneous analytical model has not been developed for such an island aquifer system assuming that the confined aquifer is homogeneous and the middle of the aquitard has a 10 m wide zone of local heterogeneity the aquifer aquitard system can be divided into three zones i e n 3 with x 1 245 m x 2 255 m and x 3 500 m based on the ranges of hydraulic parameters in the leaky confined systems summarized by li and jiao li and jiao 2001 the transmissivity and storage coefficient of the confined aquifer are set to be tn 1 5 102 m2 d and sn 1 10 4 n 1 2 or 3 respectively the aquitard thickness is set to be 5 m for the tidal wave the amplitude is a 0 an 1 m the initial phase shift is c 0 the phase difference is Œ∏ 0 the angular frequency is w 6 283 d 1 corresponding to the period of 1 day the mean sea level is h m s l 0 h m s l n 0 m and the constant hydraulic head within the upper unconfined aquifer is hu 0 m 3 1 horizontally homogeneous island leaky aquifer system firstly we consider the baseline scenario of a homogeneous aquitard for the purpose of comparison for this scenario the aquitard in zones 1 2 and 3 has the same hydraulic conductivity of k n 5 10 3 m d and the same specific storage of s s n 1 10 4 m 1 to examine if the newly developed analytical solutions could be used in a scenario when there is no aquitard storativity a constant aquitard specific storage of s s n 1 10 8 m 1 is also considered fig 2 reveals that the analytical solution of sun et al sun et al 2008 can be viewed as a special case of the newly developed solution with the tidal head inland boundary condition because both curves of normalized amplitude Œ± and phase shift œÑ versus the horizontal distance associated with s s n 1 10 8 m 1 coincide with those of sun et al sun et al 2008 where the aquitard storativity is not considered however the normalized amplitude Œ± decreases with s s n while the phase shift œÑ scalar value increases with s s n the phenomenon occurs because the storage of the aquitard can dampen the hydraulic head fluctuations in the confined aquifer and prolong the time lag i e the phase shift thus a larger s s n decreases Œ± and increases œÑ li and jiao 2001 3 2 aquitard windows of hydraulic conductivity sun et al sun et al 2008 have analysed the effects of aquitard leakage on the tidal wave propagation for an island leaky aquifer system but they did not take the spatial heterogeneity of the system into account in this study we consider the second scenario in which the aquitard has a single window of hydraulic conductivity two cases are considered in this scenario in case 1 k 2 is assumed to increase from 5 10 3 m d to 5 10 1 m d i e a high k window case 1 is representative of the hydrogeological setting in which a conduit exists in the aquitard forming a preferential flow conduit for adjacent aquifers to exchange substantial quantities of water and chemicals in case 2 k 2 is assumed to decrease from 5 10 3 m d to 5 10 5 m d i e a low k window case 2 is representative of the hydrogeological setting in which there exists an aquitard block restricting the groundwater flow through the aquitard such a block is perhaps caused by a concrete tunnel passing through the aquitard in this scenario we do not consider the aquitard storativity so a very small value of 1 10 8 m 1 is applied to s s n fig 3 shows that a low k window seems to produce negligible effects on the tidal wave propagation however a high k window can produce a remarkable bias of tidal wave propagation specifically fig 3a shows that the high k window substantially reduces the amplitude Œ± not only within zone 2 but also within the adjacent zones fig 3b indicates that the high k window also decreases the phase shift œÑ with this decrease being more apparent at positions near the window the main cause of the aforementioned phenomenon is that the high k window can enhance local groundwater leakage into the confined aquifer which can dampen the tide induced head fluctuations occurring near the window in addition since the aquitard storativity is negligible the high k window has the same effects on the time lag i e the phase shift as an increase in the aquifer transmissivity at positions near the window li and jiao 2001 which enhances the water transfer rate in the confined aquifer and thus leads to a decrease in œÑ here we validated the analytical solution corresponding to a high k window in the aquitard via numerical simulation which considered both the tidal head and zero flux inland boundary conditions figures s2 and s3 in supporting information notably the effect of a high k window in the aquitard also depends on its size considering that the high k window is associated with k 2 5 10 1 m d and the size or width i e d 2 x 2 x 1 of 0 10 20 and 30 m fig 4 indicates that a larger size of the high k window results in a smaller Œ± as well as a smaller œÑ suggesting that enhanced preferential leakage can diminish the tidal wave propagation to a great extent moreover the location of the high k window in the aquitard can influence the spatial distribution patterns of Œ± and œÑ here we consider that the locations i e x 1 to x 2 of the high k window are 245 255 m 225 235 m and 205 215 m away from the coastline fig 5 a demonstrates that the distribution of Œ± is apparently asymmetric when the high k window gets closer to the left coastline meanwhile the turning point of the Œ± x curve also gets closer to the left coastline although this asymmetric phenomenon also occurs in the horizontal distribution of œÑ we note that the turning point of the œÑ x curve tends to get closer to the right coastline fig 5b furthermore such an asymmetric phenomenon of œÑ is not as apparent as that of Œ± fig 5b 3 2 aquitard windows of specific storage as mentioned above the aquitard storativity cannot be neglected here we consider the third scenario in which the aquitard has a single window of specific storage anomaly two cases are considered in this scenario for the purpose of illustration in case 1 s s 1 s s 3 1 10 4 m 1 and s s 2 1 10 3 m 1 i e a high ss window here s s 2 may correspond to soft clay particles while s s 1 and s s 3 may correspond to silty particles in case 2 s s 1 and s s 3 are kept the same as that in case 1 while s s 2 decreases to 1 10 5 m 1 i e a low ss window which could correspond to sandy silt particles in this scenario the aquitard is homogeneous in hydraulic conductivity with k n 5 10 3 m d the homogenous case with s s n 1 10 4 m 1 is also provided for comparison fig 6 shows that a low ss window implements negligible effects on tidal wave propagation however a high ss window can slightly decrease the amplitude and visibly increases the phase shift considering the high ss window associated with different sizes which are the same to those in the second scenario fig 7 indicates that a larger size of the high ss window also results in a smaller Œ± but a larger œÑ considering the high ss window associated with different locations which are the same to those in the second scenario fig 8 indicates that the spatial distributions of Œ± and œÑ becomes slightly asymmetric when the high ss window gets closer to the left coastline meanwhile the turning point of the Œ± x curve as well as the œÑ x curve also gets closer to the left coastline based on above analysis it can be inferred that a larger size of the high ss window will enhance the asymmetric patterns of theŒ± x and œÑ x curves in the horizontal direction overall we discover that even the small scale heterogeneity of aquitard hydraulic conductivity and or specific storage can produce visible effects on the tide induced head fluctuations in the leaky confined aquifer particular attention should be paid to high k aquitard windows that behave as preferential flow conduits for adjacent aquifers to exchange water and mass high ss aquitard windows also deserve careful attention undoubtedly a larger size of the high k or high ss window will produce more remarkable effects in addition the location of aquitard windows affects the horizontal distribution patterns of the amplitude and phase shift of the aquifer head fluctuations 4 laboratory sandbox experiments 4 1 sandbox construction a synthetic coastal leaky aquifer system was constructed in a sandbox made of organic transparent glass 1 2 m in length 0 9 m in height and 0 12 m in width twenty five ports 0 01 m in diameter were cut out of the transparent organic glass wall to allow for the installation of horizontal wells these ports were evenly distributed with a horizontal interval of 0 2 m and a vertical interval of 0 12 m each well was constructed with a stainless steel tubing equipped with a valve the cuts were then covered with a nylon mesh that was bonded to the tubing with corrosion resistant epoxy extreme care was taken to avoid the epoxy covering the mesh which could impede water flow fig 9 a is a schematic drawing of the frontal view of the synthetic coastal leaky aquifer system showing the 25 ports and indicating the ports used for pore water pressure measurement the flow system for the sandbox is forced by a periodic head reservoir at the left end and by a constant head reservoir at the right end the adjoining reservoirs are capable of supplying water to the sandbox quickly and efficiently in this sandbox one perforated plate mesh combination was installed at each end of the sandbox to serve as a porous media water interface and to provide hydraulic control in addition a solid thin plate was installed at the left end of the sandbox and against the perforated plate mesh combination the bottom of this thin plate was placed slightly below the interface between the aquitard and the unconfined aquifer therefore the solid thin plate dampens the tidal effects so that the hydraulic head in the unconfined aquifer remains nearly constant fig 9b is a photograph of the sandbox showing the major devices used for laboratory experiments the periodic head in the left reservoir was generated by an ac servo motor with a speed range of 0 2000 r min the motor was connected to a funnel in the left reservoir by a steel ball screw a wave maker generated currents for the motor to automatically adjust the rotation direction and speed of the motor one can directly set the amplitude and period of prescribed periodic boundary head in the control panel of the wave maker as the motor ran the funnel rose and fell periodically meanwhile we continuously injected water into the left reservoir with a relatively large flux so that the water level in the left reservoir periodically varied with time creating a periodic boundary head for the sandbox the constant head in the right reservoir was maintained through the collaborative work of two peristaltic pumps the first pump continuously injected water into the right reservoir with a relatively small flux the second pump continuously pumped water out from the right reservoir with a relatively large flux the vertical location of the soft tubing mouth of the second pump determines the prescribed value of constant head in the right reservoir to further maintain constant hydraulic head for the unconfined aquifer throughout the experiment we placed the soft tubing mouth of the second pumping slightly above the soil surface photographs of the side and prone views of the laboratory experiment platform can be seen from figures s4 and s5 in supporting information the data acquisition system used for the laboratory experiments consisted of three major components the first component included six pressure transducers which were connected to six ports via hard rubber tubing three of which i e ports 1 3 and 5 measured piezometer head in the aquifer two in the aquitard and one in the unconfined aquifer the pressure transducer figure s6 model uld100 has a range of 0 to 100 kpa and a measurement error of 0 1 the second component was a 20 channel data acquisition board model uld485 20 the third component was a pc with dy1000 sw v01 software for automated data acquisition 4 2 construction of the synthetic coastal leaky aquifer system in total three layers were sequentially deposited to mimic a leaky aquifer system the lowest layer designated as the confined aquifer had a thickness of 0 3 m and was deposited with fine sand medium sand and coarse sand from the left to the right end each sand type was deposited across a length of 0 4 m the middle layer designated as the aquitard had a thickness of 0 18 m and was deposited with kaolin clay medium sand and kaolin clay from the left to the right end each clay type was deposited across a length of 0 51 m whereas the medium sand type was deposited across a length of 0 18 m the portion of medium sand inside the aquitard is manifested as a high k aquitard window the top layer designated as the unconfined aquifer had a thickness of 0 2 m and was deposited with fine sand prior to filling the sandbox the two reservoirs were ponded to ensure that the deposited particles maintained saturation throughout the filling process the filling was sufficiently slow to avoid the trapping air in the soil after filling the sandbox sufficient time was provided for the aquifer system to compact under self weight 4 3 experimental data analysis nine cases for testing the tidal wave propagation characteristics in the synthetic coastal leaky aquifer system were sequentially conducted these nine cases were sorted into three groups the prescribed values of the period and amplitude a 0 of the periodic boundary head for each case are summarized in table 2 the observed time series of piezometer head at six measurement ports i e 1 3 5 11 14 and 22 are shown in figure s7 extreme care was taken to ensure the stability of the periodic state generally based on figure s7 the effects of the initial condition can be eliminated after a time span of four periods furthermore figure s7 suggests that the amplitude of the periodic aquifer head decreased from the left to the right end of the sandbox as expected we have further calculated the normalized amplitude Œ± and phase shift œÑ of the periodic variations of observed piezometer head in the confined aquifer by fitting the time series data in figure s7 using a trigonometric function table s1 summarizes the observed Œ± and œÑ values of the periodic head within the confined aquifer for each synthetic case and fig 10 demonstrates the spatial distribution pattern of Œ± and œÑ versus the horizontal distance fig 10 validates that the amplitude of boundary head variations has minimal effect on the spatial distribution pattern of Œ±and œÑ the sandbox experiment also validates that a larger period consistently results in a larger Œ±and a smaller period yields a larger œÑ table s1 in accordance with previous studies e g li and jiao 2001 jiao and tang 1999 the effects of a high k aquitard window on the tidal wave propagation within the confined aquifer can also been analysed from fig 10 the synthetic confined aquifer is horizontally heterogeneous and notably the central part is deposited with medium sand while the left part is deposited with fine sand if there is no window in the aquitard a slight decay in Œ± and a nearly linear increase in œÑ scalar value within the central part should be expected to occur in contrast a faster decay in Œ± and a slower increase in œÑ was observed fig 10 therefore the aquitard window manifested as a preferential flow channel was created and this enhanced the recharge to the central part of the confined aquifer inhibiting the tidal wave propagation in the confined aquifer this is also in accordance with the analytical model based discussions mentioned above 4 4 parameter estimation the newly developed analytical model was used to fit the observed Œ± and œÑ values of the periodic aquifer head at ports 1 3 and 5 to estimate the hydraulic parameters of the horizontally heterogeneous confined aquifer and aquitard for the confined aquifer the hydraulic parameters are the transmissivity t 1 t 2 and t 3 numbered from the left to the right hereinafter and the storativity s 1 s 2 and s 3 for the aquitard the hydraulic parameters are the hydraulic conductivity k 1 k 2 and k 3 and the specific storage s s1 s s2 and s s3 the parameter estimation was completed using the matlab built in lsqnonlin function with the levenberg marquardt algorithm we constructed the following objective function as 14 œÜ Œ± œÑ p Œ± o b s Œ± p 2 œÑ o b s œÑ p 2 where p is a 12 1 vector consisting of the logarithm of hydraulic parameters the logarithm function is used to enforce the positiveness of these parameters during the estimation process Œ± obs and œÑ obs are the 27 1 vectors consisting of observed aquifer Œ± and œÑ for all synthetic cases Œ± p and œÑ p are the 27 1 vectors consisting of analytically simulated Œ± and œÑ given the parameter vector p when the parameter estimation is completed the mean square error mse was calculated to further assess the fitting performance which is expressed as 15 m s e œÜ Œ± œÑ p n where n 54 is the number of total observational data initial values as well as the lower and upper bounds for the twelve parameters are provided in table 3 the corresponding parameter estimates together with the mse values are also provided in table 3 table 3 indicates that the inverse modeling yields an excellent mse value of 1 08 10 4 in contrast when we choose to ignore the window in the aquitard and assume the aquitard to be horizontally homogeneous the inverse modeling yields an mse value of 5 06 10 4 which reveals that the aquitard is horizontally heterogeneous in reality it can be found that the estimated hydraulic conductivity of the aquitard window i e k 2 is three to four orders of magnitude larger than the other two parts i e k 1 and k 3 meanwhile the estimated specific storage of the aquitard window i e ss 2 is two orders of magnitude smaller than the other two parts i e ss 1 and ss 3 a larger hydraulic conductivity while a smaller specific storage of the aquitard window is quite reasonable because sandy particles tend to have considerably larger permeability and relatively smaller storativity than clayey particles particular attention should be paid to the transmissivity of the confined aquifer table 3 clearly shows that t 3 is one order of magnitude smaller than t 2 and is slightly smaller than t 1 generally porous media with coarser particles have greater permeability values the reason behind the significantly smaller value of t 3 can be explained based on pore spaces coarse sand has relatively large pore spaces which could be filled by the clayey particles that moved down during the filling process to form the aquitard layer in the sandbox experiment leading to lower permeability of the coarse sand this was further corroborated by the muddy water that we observed flowing from the sandbox into the right reservoir during the experiments moreover the estimated s 3 is one order of magnitude larger than s 1 and s 2 which provides further evidence to support the blocking phenomenon because a hydrogeological unit consisting of finer particles usually has a larger specific storage value after further checking of the bias in fitting the observed Œ± we find that for each experiment group the calibrated Œ± is larger than the observed value at port 5 i e x 1 0 m table s1 such a relatively large bias is probably caused by the local heterogeneity near port 5 and is mainly attributed to aforementioned blocking phenomenon characterization of the local heterogeneity of the sandbox is beyond the scope of this analytical and experimental study however scholars interested in geostatistical inverse modeling may utilize the tidal wave propagation data to image the spatial distribution of aquifer hydraulic parameters in addition potential inverse modeling research can be conducted to detect the location and size of the aquitard window given the tidal wave propagation data here the groundwater flow within the aquitard containing windows is assumed to be strictly vertical however if the window was of considerable size the effects of horizontal flow within and near the windows on the tidal wave propagation might not be ignored for these future research aspects our results offer the raw sandbox experiment data after comparing the newly developed analytical solutions with the experimental results of this study we believe that they may also be applicable for explaining the propagation bias revealed from the in situ monitoring data collected in some field cases e g the garden island on the continental shelf of western australia sun et al 2008 trefry and bekele 2004 future research may focus on interpreting such in situ propagation bias by coupling the newly developed analytical solutions with a parameter optimization code such as pest doherty 2008 and ucode poeter and hill 1999 5 summary and conclusions we developed a quasi 2d analytical model to describe the head fluctuation in a horizontally heterogeneous coastal leaky aquifer system with a finite extent considering aquitard windows with permeability and or storativity anomalies analytical solutions associated with tidal head and constant flux inland boundary conditions have been derived based on the separation of variables method without loss of generality we considered a hypothetical island leaky aquifer system as an example to analytically explore the effects of aquitard windows that manifest as local heterogeneities in hydraulic conductivity and or specific storage on the horizontal distribution of the amplitude and phase shift of the head fluctuation within the confined aquifer in addition laboratory experiments were conducted to reveal the effects of the aquitard window on tidal wave propagation the main conclusions are summarized as follows 1 low permeability aquitard windows produce negligible effects on tide induced groundwater fluctuations in the confined aquifer while high permeability aquitard windows that act as preferential flow conduits for the adjacent two aquifers to exchange water can dramatically diminish the tidal wave propagation in the confined aquifer a larger size or width of the high permeability aquitard window can diminish the tidal wave propagation to a larger extent apparent tidal wave propagation bias in the confined aquifer can also be attributed to the occurrence of high storativity aquitard windows of considerable sizes in comparison those aquitard windows with low storativity anomalies impose little effects on the tide induced groundwater fluctuations in the confined aquifer 2 locations of aquitard windows influence the spatial distribution patterns of the amplitude and phase shift of the aquifer head fluctuations theoretical analysis results revealed in this study have the potential to help interpret piezometer data thereby unraveling complicated propagation bias resulting from aquitard windows with permeability and or storativity anomalies 3 we have derived analytical solutions that do not need to assemble large size algebraic matrix systems whose dimensionality is determined by the number of divided homogeneous zones based on trefry trefry 1999 and chuang et al chuang et al 2010 the newly derived analytical solutions only involve 2 2 matrices which are determined based on the continuity requirements of hydraulic head and groundwater flux at the zone interfaces the derivation process is completed through the multiplier calculations of involved matrices resulting in concise expressions of the analytical solutions 4 the developed analytical solutions can be used to deal with several existing analytical models associated with some widely used assumptions for coastal aquifer systems from the perspectives of infinite horizontal extent homogeneity of the leaky aquifer system negligible aquitard storativity impermeable aquitard and the approximation of linearly or other complicated horizontal heterogeneity features with dense small size homogeneous zones 5 piezometer observations made in the laboratory experiments demonstrate a faster decay in the amplitude and a slower increase in the phase shift of the periodic aquifer head near the aquitard window which is in accordance with analytical discussions parameter estimation indicates substantial difference in hydraulic parameters between the aquitard window deposited with medium sand and other portions deposited with kaolin clay revealing localized high k aquitard heterogeneity the laboratory experiments also provide insights to future research topics regarding the inverse modeling for capturing the local heterogeneity within the confined aquifer and for detecting the location and size of the aquitard window data availability statement the data can be found https doi org 10 6084 m9 figshare 14069459 v2

23,matrix fracture interactions are significant in determining multiphase flow behavior in fractured porous media we investigated the impact of these interactions on dynamic displacement events and flood front patterns in a fractured micromodel with two matrix regions having different permeabilities of varying wettability states the effects of injection rate and viscosity were studied during the injection of blank brine and polymer solutions respectively under oil wet hydrophobic and water wet hydrophilic conditions the influence of reducing interfacial tension was examined by injecting a surfactant solution into the oil wet micromodel under oil wet conditions brine invaded the high permeability matrix producing a stepwise increase in water saturation during the low and intermediate rate experiments the high rate induced fluid displacements within both matrices but trapped more oil in the high permeability zone due to what we labeled as the high rate interruption effect the stepwise invasion was also observed in the two matrices during the polymer solution injection contrary to the smoother invasion of the surfactant solution in the water wet model the high permeability matrix exhibited final fluid saturations resembling those in the oil wet model after brine injection however unlike in the oil wet model brine invaded the low permeability matrix the polymer solution suppressed trapping and improved the sweep efficiency across the two matrix regions our results provide new insights into the pore scale evolution of fluid saturation during two phase flow in

fractured wells in unconventional reservoirs troy and jack 2016 in both naturally occurring and artificially induced fractured porous systems interactions between fracture networks and matrix blocks play a critical role in the multiphase flow dynamics which is one of the key factors in determining the most efficient approaches to maximize oil recovery elfeel et al 2016 sabti et al 2019 previous investigations of fluid transport physics in fractured systems utilized both natural rocks and micromodel platforms in the natural rock studies rangel german and kovscek identified the different regimes of fracture filling and matrix imbibition with respect to the injection rate in a water wet ww berea sandstone core rangel german and kovscek 2002 they observed that co current and counter current imbibition regimes occur at low and high injection rates respectively moreover fern√∏ et al and aspenes et al inspected the capillary bridging phenomenon in stacked core plugs with a transverse fracture using magnetic resonance imaging mri aspenes et al 2002 fern√∏ et al 2011 both concluded that capillary bridges preserve the wetting phase connectivity across the fracture with more and stronger bridges forming at weaker degrees of wetting mirzaei et al monitored the dynamics of water and surfactant solution injections into oil wet ow fractured cores using x ray computed tomography ct techniques and established an inverse relationship between the dimensions of the core and the extent of invasion mirzaei et al 2016 additionally arshadi et al investigated the pore scale interplays of two phase oil brine flow through a miniature ww fractured sandstone core using a high resolution micro ct scanner arshadi et al 2018 they found that water injected at a low flow rate does not completely fill the fracture but forms wetting layers on the fracture walls that aid the capillary imbibition into the neighboring matrix higher injection rates resulted in bulk water flow in the fracture although the abovementioned studies conducted on naturally fractured rocks captured the general aspects of the fluid flow within and between the fracture and the matrix they have not been able to follow the transport dynamics in real time at the pore scale due to the limitations of the imaging tools another constraint regarding natural rocks is that the pore structure properties such as porosity pore size and connectivity cannot be controlled on the other hand micromodels offer flexibility in design that can incorporate different patterns and layouts in addition to critically allowing for direct and real time visualization of the flow dynamics during displacement gogoi and borgohain 2019 jahanbakhsh et al 2020 lifton 2016 for these reasons several research groups employed micromodels to investigate the mechanisms of matrix fracture interactions ahmadi et al 2019a 2019b du et al 2020 jafari et al 2017 khorshidian et al 2018 liang et al 2020 mahdavi and james 2019 malmir et al 2021 martel et al 2019 mejia et al 2019 tangirala and sheng 2019 yun et al 2020 fractured micromodel experiments generally fall into one of two categories depending on which part of the micromodel hosts the injection site the matrix side and or the fracture side injection the former involves injection into the matrix with the fracture s in the middle of the model surrounded by the matrix from all directions these studies mainly focus on investigating the impacts of various parameters on oil recovery using different layouts typically with the goal of characterizing the fracture

al 2013 mahdavi and james 2019 malmir et al 2021 sedaghat et al 2013 shokrollahi et al 2013 injection rate farzaneh et al 2010 shokrollahi et al 2013 viscosity of the injected fluid abedi et al 2012 ahmadi et al 2019b mohajeri et al 2015 sedaghat et al 2013 interfacial tension ift ahmadi et al 2019a kianinejad et al 2013 liang et al 2020 mohajeri et al 2015 tangirala and sheng 2019 yun et al 2020 and wettability state are the most commonly studied aspects ahmadi et al 2019a malmir et al 2021 sedaghat et al 2013 tangirala and sheng 2018 2019 more recently the wettability reversal from ow to ww has also been investigated maghsoudian et al 2020 malmir et al 2021 mohajeri et al 2015 alternatively the fracture side injection category is characterized by the injection into the fracture that is connected to one or several matrix blocks ahmadi et al 2019b cui and babadagli 2017 haghighi et al 1994 hsu et al 2017 jafari et al 2017 marciales and babadagli 2016 masoudi et al 2019 mejia et al 2019 rangel german and kovscek 2006 saidian et al 2014 unlike the matrix side injection experiments the fracture side injection approach is used to examine the fluid flow mechanisms within and between the fracture and the matrix these studies are more pertinent than the matrix side injection experiments to the underground applications where fracture networks hydraulically connect matrix blocks haghighi et al considered drainage processes at different mobility ratios and capillary numbers haghighi et al 1994 they suggested a critical capillary number below which the injected non wetting fluid only flowed through the fracture without invading the matrix mejia et al studied injections of water and an ultralow ift surfactant solution into ow fractured micromodels to probe the effects of three dominant forces in the reservoir i e capillary gravity and viscous forces utilizing respectively a horizontal model subjected to spontaneous imbibition a vertical model subjected to spontaneous imbibition and a horizontal model undergoing flooding mejia et al 2019 all three scenarios resulted in little or no water invasion into the matrix while considerable invasion and oil production were observed when the surfactant solution was used furthermore fracture connectivity and fingering patterns were examined by du et al for different wettability states and over a range of capillary numbers du et al 2020 the authors concluded that the sweep efficiency is not significantly affected in the presence of a dead end fracture but it does depend on the capillary number for a connected fracture overall the main findings of fractured micromodel experiments are that reducing ift increasing injection fluid viscosity and altering wettability from oil wet to water wet positively impact oil recovery by contrast the results concerning the injection rate varied between higher rates increasing jafari et al 2017 decreasing farzaneh et al 2010 khoshkalam et al 2019 shokrollahi et al 2013 or having a variable effect on the oil recovery ahmadi et al 2019a saidian et al 2014 the previous reports considered the common enhanced oil recovery displacement mechanisms observed in unfractured porous media and applied them to interpret the flow behavior in fractured porous systems however mechanisms of fluid mobilization fluid entrapment and fluid saturation evolution during the flow of fluids between fracture and matrix were not studied the patterns by which flood fronts develop in the fracture and matrix regions at various flow rates fluid viscosities ift values and matrix permeabilities are still poorly understood moreover little attention has been paid to the analysis of the residual oil clusters in the matrix after injecting fluids into the adjacent fractures this work aims to fill these gaps by investigating the matrix fracture interactions during two phase fluid displacement processes the effects of flow rate viscosity and ift on the invasion behavior into the matrix are examined while with respect to high and low permeability matrices surrounding the fracture emphasis is given to the sequence and configuration of flood front progression in the fracture and matrix regions as well as displacement trapping mechanisms taking place during flow from fracture to matrix and vice versa it is worth mentioning that throughout this manuscript we use ww and ow interchangeably with hydrophilic and hydrophobic respectively 2 materials and methods 2 1 micromodel design and fabrication the design of the fractured micromodel used in this study is shown in fig 1 the pore network of the model was generated using an algorithm based on voronoi tessellation that enabled the incorporation of features e g tortuosity and randomness resembling those seen in natural porous media wu et al 2012 the algorithm was programmed in matlab math works inc natick ma and the fracture was introduced into the design via autocad autodesk inc mill valley ca usa the micromodel design consisted of three main regions a matrix with large pores and throats a high permeability porous medium a straight fracture and a matrix with small pores and throats a low permeability porous medium the configuration of the inlet outlet ports was designed to ensure the injected fluids entered exited the model only through the fracture such a design was implemented purposely to mimic a system in which matrix blocks are connected by a fracture network where the production from such blocks occurred only through the interconnecting fractures the micromodel was fabricated from borosilicate glass using the wet etching method nge et al 2013 by micronit micronit microtechnologies the netherlands dimensions and properties of the various components of the micromodel are listed in table 1 since the three regions of the model i e the high permeability matrix the low permeability matrix and the fracture were connected it was not possible to measure the permeability of each domain individually instead the permeability of each region was estimated based on geometrical parameters for the matrix regions the permeability was calculated using the semi empirical kozeny equation wu et al 2012 1 k c s 2 where k is the permeability œï is the porosity s is the specific surface area wetted area per unit volume and c is the kozeny constant kozeny 1927 the value of c is estimated to be 5 wu et al 2012 for the fracture the following equation was adopted based on the concept of hydraulic diameter haghighi et al 1994 2 k a f 2 2 Œ± 2 where a f is the area of the fracture conduit and Œ± is the wetted perimeter 2 2 chemicals decane anhydrous 99 sigma aldrich was used as the oil phase while a 0 1 wt sodium chloride 100 acs grade fisher scientific brine was the base of all aqueous solutions xanthan gum sigma aldrich polymer with a concentration of 700 ppm in brine was used as the viscosity buffer solution we chose xanthan gum over other synthetic polymers e g hydrolyzed polyacrylamide or hpam to avoid the complications of the latter s viscoelastic effects shakeel et al 2022 the ift reducing agent was a c12 15 ethoxylate non ionic surfactant bio soft n25 9 stepan co the surfactant concentration was 0 1 wt in brine which is above its critical micelle concentration mirchi et al 2017 because decane is transparent ecoline black dye royal talens the netherlands was added to all aqueous solutions at a 5 wt concentration to improve the contrast between the water and oil phases during the imaging process step 2 3 fluid properties and wettability the density and viscosity of the fluids were measured with an svm 3001 antonpaar densitometer viscometer mcr 502 antonpaar rotational rheometer equipped with a double gap system was used to characterize the polymer solution rheology the ift between the different aqueous solutions and the model oil was measured using the pendant drop method mirchi et al 2017 all measurements were conducted at ambient laboratory conditions table 2 lists the densities viscosities and ift values of all the fluids used in this study for the polymer solution a viscosity versus shear rate plot is presented in fig 2 the values marked by black arrows represent the viscosity of the polymer solution inside the fracture the shear rate of 166 s 1 was calculated for the flow rate of 20 ¬µl h assuming that the polymer solution was flowing only through the fracture the corresponding viscosity was 4 75 cp see fig 2 which was approximately 5 times the base brine viscosity since the borosilicate glass was initially water wet tangirala and sheng 2019 for the ow experiments the wettability of the micromodel was altered using a silanization procedure mohajeri et al 2019 sedaghat et al 2013 a 2 5 wt solution of trichloroocta decylsilane in dehydrated toluene was used as the silanization agent after the silanization steps were completed the model was left to stabilize for at least 6 h before performing the experiments static contact angle measurements on the same borosilicate glass used in manufacturing the micromodel were performed to assess the degree of oil wetness before and after silanization the measurements were conducted using the sessile drop approach giridhar et al 2017 and imagej software schneider et al 2012 was used for analysis in addition in situ contact angles were measured inside the micromodel throats after capillary equilibration to evaluate the wettability state during the experiments olympus cellsens software olympus america inc center valley pa usa was used for the in situ contact angle analysis the results of the contact angle measurements performed on the untreated hydrophilic and silanized hydrophobic borosilicate glass surfaces are summarized in fig 3 from both the droplets figs 3a and 3b and the in situ contact angles figs 3c and 3d it is evident that the silanization process efficiently altered the wettability from strongly ww to strongly ow the average equilibrium in situ contact angles measured at different locations inside the model with the injected fluids at the two wettability states are compared in fig 3e clearly neither the surfactant nor the polymer solutions significantly influenced the micromodel wettability thus any observed effects of the injected fluids on the displacement patterns are solely attributed to the fluid fluid and fluid rock interactions 2 4 fluid injection system and procedures a schematic of the micromodel fluid injection and imaging systems used in this study is shown in fig 4 a harvard pico plus elite syringe pump was used for injecting both oil and aqueous solutions at pre specified constant rates teflon tubing was used for fluid transfer a fluidic connect pro chip holder by micronit which also provided the inlet outlet connections to the micromodel held the micromodel in place the general experimental procedure was as follows first the micromodel was fully saturated with oil by continuous injection of several hundred pore volumes through the f2 port fig 1a at a high flow rate of 300 ¬µl h the presence of the fracture facilitated expelling the air out of the micromodel inlet and outlet tubing were gently and repeatedly tapped to ensure purging of trapped air in the connection locations images were taken to ensure no air remained inside the model second the dyed aqueous solution blank brine or the polymer surfactant solution was injected through the f1 port fig 1a at the desired rate to investigate the displacement physics third the micromodel was cleaned by consecutively injecting distilled water methanol toluene methanol and again distilled water finally before switching to a different set of fluids additional cleaning was performed a soap solution 20 vol solution of rbs 25 sigma aldrich in distilled water was injected along with nitrogen gas to generate foam inside the model and remove residues of the fluids that may have remained in the medium from the previous experiment the foam was then expelled by pumping distilled water through the model overnight finally for the ow experiments if needed the wettability was re established by repeating the silanization process a total of seven flow experiments were performed five under ow and two under ww conditions first three experiments with the injection rates of 2 20 and 200 ¬µl h were conducted using dyed blank brine in the hydrophobic micromodel to examine the effect of the injection rate the intermediate injection rate of 20 ¬µl h was used in all the subsequent experiments the remaining two ow experiments were carried out to evaluate the effects of the viscosity and ift using the dyed polymer and surfactant solutions respectively finally two ww experiments with dyed blank brine and polymer solutions were performed to compare the flow behavior at different wettability states all experiments were conducted at ambient laboratory conditions 2 5 image acquisition and analysis olympus ix83 microscope equipped with a high resolution monochromatic camera andor zyla and a motorized stage was used for the image acquisition a 4x magnification lens 2560 2160 pixels per frame 1 625 ¬µm pixel was used to capture the images the field of view fov included the total area of the model but excluded the inlet outlet ports and small sections obstructed by the chip holder forty frames were taken and automatically stitched within the fov to create the entire image with an approximate resolution of 108 megapixels imaging parameters e g overlapping frame fraction were carefully selected to maximize the quality of the final stitched image the imaging time during the experiments was in the range of 1 2 min per image the images were then processed and analyzed using an in house matlab code the segmentation algorithm included the following steps a a reference image of the fully oil saturated model was selected b pattern recognition within the reference image was used to obtain a pore map such that the areas enclosed between connected edges were labeled as grains while the channels and areas between the grains were identified as throats and pores respectively fig 1b c the reference image was subtracted from the image s obtained during the flow experiments d a threshold pixel value based on the gray scale histogram of the images was applied to the subtracted image from step c to distinguish between the oil and water phases further details of this approach can be found elsewhere osei bonsu et al 2020 2018 e the image was then further processed using a neighborhood window average filter to remove minor artifacts created by slight frame shifts segmented images were subsequently used to calculate oil and water saturations as well as the frequency distributions of the volumes of residual oil ganglia 3 results and discussion 3 1 effect of injection rate the ow hydrophobic micromodel fluid occupancy maps for the three blank brine injection rates i e 2 20 and 200 Œºl h at different total injected pore volumes pvinj are shown in fig 5a since this was a drainage process as the non wetting phase was displacing the wetting one the relative magnitude of viscous pressure drop within the fracture to the threshold capillary pressures of the displacements within the neighboring matrices determined the degree of invasion into each matrix system in other words the occurrence of brine to oil displacements in the matrix regions depended on whether the local viscous pressure in the fracture could overcome their threshold pressures from the snapshots in fig 5a it is evident that the low permeability matrix region was invaded only during the highest flow rate experiment this is because the high threshold entry capillary pressure in this region prohibited invasion at lower injection rates due to lower viscous pressure drops this is also reflected in the water saturation sw plots see fig 5b of the three experiments for both low and high permeability regions by contrast the high permeability region was invaded by brine at all flow rates fig 5a however the extent of the brine invasion as well as the details of the invasion process varied at the low and intermediate rates the water saturation developed in a stepwise manner whereby the brine invaded a specific portion of the matrix but did not progress any further for a certain amount of time before swiftly invading another portion to the best of our knowledge this has never been observed previously and is contrary to the monotonic invasion recovery trajectories commonly reported for oil wet fractured micromodels jafari et al 2017 mohajeri et al 2015 sedaghat et al 2013 the rationale behind such observation can be summarized as follows the brine started displacing the oil in the fracture before invading the matrix regions because of the substantially lower threshold entry pressure of the fracture during the progression of the brine front in the fracture the pressure built up and surpassed the threshold entry pressure of the high permeability matrix such that invasion started from the upstream part of the fracture the size of the invaded portion depended on the pressure of the brine that in turn corresponded to the injected flow rate this meant that a smaller portion of the medium was invaded in the case of the low rate experiment than in the case of the intermediate rate experiment after the fracture became completely filled with brine and breakthrough occurred two requirements had to be fulfilled in order for the brine progression in the matrix to continue the pressure of the water phase to build up again and exceed the threshold entry pressure of the matrix pore elements and the to be displaced oil in the matrix to connect to the exit port since the fracture was filled with brine the continuous water phase in the fracture between the inlet and outlet ports had to be disrupted by the flow of oil at the outlet for the oil to be produced the disruption of the connected water phase however required a certain amount of time so that at a specific instant the oil could link with the exit port triggering the immediate invasion of brine into the high permeability matrix during this process the invasion sequence was controlled by the order in which the pores throats were being accessed by the brine and whether the invading phase pressure was sufficient to enter each element because of this invasion the water phase pressure and consequently the oil pressure in the high permeability matrix decreased causing the water phase within the fracture to re connect to the outlet resulting in a pause in the further invasion of the pore space by brine within the matrix this cyclic process was repeated until capillary equilibrium was reached within the high permeability matrix for the 2 ¬µl h injection rate the process ceased before the complete invasion of the matrix see fig 5a this cyclic invasion phenomenon did not take place in the low permeability matrix because of the inherently higher threshold capillary pressures that the low viscous pressure drop in the fracture could not overcome furthermore there were notable differences between the invasion progression of the non wetting phase at the highest flow rate 200 ¬µl h and those of the flow tests conducted at the low and intermediate rates the water saturation during the high rate was lower than that during the intermediate rate at the final injection stages fig 5b this can be attributed to two factors the pressure of the non wetting phase and the additional residual trapping for the high flow rate the water phase pressure in the fracture was sufficiently high to invade the matrix at any position along the fracture s total length consequently the oil displaced by the brine from positions invaded earlier in the process might encounter brine invading the matrix further down the flow direction as the invading brine interfaced with the oil moving in the matrix it disconnected the defending clusters from its unswept segment resulting in poor oil connectivity and hence more entrapment fig 6 shows a schematic illustration of this process along with the actual entrapment of oil by the invading brine during the displacement process a smoother uninterrupted oil displacement occurred during the test performed at the intermediate flow rate leading to less oil trapping and hence more oil recovery from the high permeability matrix compared to that of the high rate experiment the aforementioned displacement interruptions did not occur in the low permeability matrix due to the greater capillary forces that blocked the brine from invading the matrix at multiple access points within the fracture to better understand the behavior of the trapped oil clusters within the high permeability matrix we analyzed the normalized cumulative frequency of the volumes of oil globules fig 7 at the end of the 20 ¬µl h and 200 ¬µl h experiments the clusters of sizes less than 15 pixels were excluded because they represented a negligible fraction of the total oil volume and also they could be artifacts of the image processing steps osei bonsu et al 2020 the analysis shows the effect of the displacement interruptions on residual oil clusters at the high flow rate the sizes of the residual oil globules for the high injection rate were larger almost for the entire span of their volumes except for the few largest globules this demonstrates how the interruptions by the brine from the fracture disconnected and isolated large oil globules that were not displaced even at the high rate we also observed fluctuations in the fluid saturations in the high permeability matrix region during the 200 ¬µl h experiment after the early invasion stages fig 5b this was due to the late movement of the oil clusters from other parts of the matrix into the fov followed by their production from the micromodel for example fig 8 shows the propagation entrainment of some of the oil clusters through the high permeability matrix that had been invaded by brine during the 200 ¬µl h experiment based on the above observations it can be concluded that increasing the brine s injection rate does not necessarily lead to more oil displacement in hydrophobic fractured media the result depends on key factors such as the capillary forces homogeneity in the matrix and the strength of viscous forces in the fracture network caused by the injected fluid these factors control the mechanisms by which the oil is displaced from the matrix brine flows first in the fracture then invades the matrix depending on its local pressure increasing the injection rate nominally induces larger viscous pressure drops and therefore enhances the likelihood of invasion into the hydrophobic matrix however a further increase in the injection rate above a certain limit can result in more oil entrapment due to the interruption effect discussed earlier 3 2 effect of viscosity a polymer injection experiment was performed to examine the effect of viscosity on the fluid invasion into the matrix fig 9a compares the fluid occupancy maps generated during blank brine and polymer injection tests at 20 ¬µl h injection rate the evolution of the water saturation with time in terms of pvinj for the two permeability regions is shown in fig 9b we estimated the viscosity of the polymer solution inside the fracture at the injection rate of 20 ¬µl h to be 5 times higher than that of blank brine viscosity see fig 2 stepwise changes in fluid saturations were noticeable in both high and low permeability matrix regions during the polymer solution test as well fig 9b shows that the steps in the water saturation occurred for the injected polymer solution at the same instances i e same values of pvinj in both the high and low permeability matrices this is despite the fact that the two domains had different threshold entry pressures which proved that the stepwise invasion trends were not related to the matrices themselves but rather to a common attribute which was the connectivity of oil at the outlet port because the stepwise saturation pattern was observed again during the polymer solution experiment the experiment was repeated using a different syringe pump and syringe to ensure that the observed behavior was not due to pump pulsation or any other experimental artifact the reason for selecting the polymer solution not the blank brine as the fluid used in the reproducibility test was because it showed the stepwise trend in both the high and low permeability matrices making the trend easier to be probed we used two different harvard pico plus elite syringe pumps in the initial and repeated experiments 5 ml beckton dickinson sigma aldrich and 5 ml norm ject air tite products co inc syringes were used in the initial and repeated experiments respectively both syringes had been programmed by default in the database of the pumps the utilized rate 20 Œºl h was above the minimum rate that could be accurately supported by the pumps using either syringe fig 10 validates the reproducibility of the stepwise invasion pattern during the two polymer solution injection experiments in the ow hydrophobic model the results of both experiments were in reasonable qualitative and quantitative agreement the ultimate water saturations in both the high and low permeability matrix blocks were almost identical with regard to the initial and repeated experiments however the steps of saturation jumps were shifted in time between the two experiments we believe this was because the steps were sensitive to the local pressure which slightly varied between the two experiments the overall saturation trends of the two experiments were comparable from the results of the reproducibility test it was concluded that the stepwise invasion observation was not caused by an experimental artifact but reflected an actual physical phenomenon related to the micromodel fracture matrix configuration that held the inlet and outlet ports connected only to the fracture the final oil saturation in the high permeability matrix region after the polymer injection was slightly higher than that of the blank brine injection fig 9b this is primarily because of the fact that the polymer was able to divert flow to the low permeability zone in other words the low permeability matrix region was invaded during the polymer experiment while no invasion into this domain occurred during the blank brine injection see fig 9a during the polymer injection the viscous forces created sufficient pressure in the fracture to overcome the low permeability matrix zone s threshold entry pressures 3 3 effect of ift to investigate the effect of ift on matrix fracture flow dynamics a nonionic surfactant solution was employed that reduced the ift between the oil and the brine from 49 9 to 5 76 mn m table 2 fluid occupancy maps and sw vs pvinj trends during the surfactant solution injection test are compared with those of the polymer solution and blank brine injection experiments in fig 9 the surfactant solution invaded the high and low permeability regions faster and with higher displacement efficiency relative to the other two solutions fig 9a reducing the ift of the injection fluid in an oil wet fractured medium was the most effective approach in triggering an effective drainage displacement in the hydrophobic matrix regions surrounding the fracture additionally no stepwise saturation changes were observed in contrast to the other two flow fluids this was due to the much lower ift value which lowered the threshold capillary pressures and enabled a fast fluid displacement within the low and high permeability matrix regions while the oil was still connected to the outlet port furthermore as shown in fig 11 the advancement of the displacement fronts in the three media low permeability matrix high permeability matrix and fracture was predominantly uniform throughout the experiment such that the front in the fracture was ahead of that in the high permeability matrix followed by that in the low permeability matrix this arrangement of flood fronts across the three media obeyed the order of threshold capillary pressures from low to high which was expected in a hydrophobic fractured porous medium such behavior resulted in a high displacement efficiency of the oil from the matrix regions fig 12 compares the volume distributions of the trapped oil ganglia at the end of the blank brine and surfactant injection experiments in the ow model the reduction in ift resulted in smaller residual oil clusters in the small 10 5 to 10 4 ¬µl and large 5 10 4 to 3 10 3 ¬µl globule volume ranges by contrast the middle sized oil clusters 1 10 4 to 4 10 4 ¬µl were slightly larger after the surfactant injection 3 4 effect of wettability the effect of wettability was studied using the blank brine and polymer solutions by utilizing the ww model and comparing the results with those of the ow counterpart the oil brine contact angles in the ow and ww micromodels were 160 and 21 fig 3e corresponding respectively to strongly oil wet and strongly water wet conditions the capillary pressures in the ww and ow systems were therefore positive and negative respectively fig 13 a presents the fluid occupancy maps generated during the two tests performed on the ww medium three water phase fronts were identified in the captured images during both polymer solution and blank brine injection experiments however the sequence of these fronts followed a reverse order from that in the ow medium due to the positive capillary pressures during the blank brine experiment water the wetting phase preferred to move first and fastest through the low permeability matrix where capillary forces were the strongest then through the high permeability matrix and finally through the fracture another major difference between the tests conducted on the ow and ww systems is that in the former all the oil in the fracture was rapidly displaced regardless of the injection fluid figs 5a and 9a while in the ww case some residual oil clusters remained in the fracture fig 13a since the displacement process in the ww medium was an imbibition process the oil constituting the non wetting phase moved toward the fracture during the displacement due to its lower drainage threshold capillary pressures as a result disconnected oil globules appeared inside the fracture and remained as residual oil in the form of trapped oil clusters the water saturation within the matrices in the ow and ww models are compared in fig 13b for both blank brine and polymer solutions the water to oil displacement was significantly faster in the ww model this is because the water was the wetting fluid therefore the threshold capillary pressures in addition to the viscous pressure drop favored the water phase to invade the model a noteworthy observation was that the final water saturations of the high permeability matrix at the end of the blank brine injection experiments were similar 83 under both ow and ww conditions it was expected that the ww model would exhibit greater oil recovery due to stronger water invasion nevertheless since the medium was strongly ww i e contact angle 21 the snap off events could decrease the efficiency of the displacement by trapping more oil consequently both blank brine injection experiments in ow and ww models had similar residual oil saturations this phenomenon is well documented for macroscopic displacements in natural porous media singh et al 2017 it is generally accepted that the least amount of trapping occurs under weakly ww or neutrally wet conditions and the residual oil values are similarly high under strongly ww and strongly ow conditions tawfik et al 2019 the different patterns of fluid occupancy in the ow and ww models are demonstrated in figs 14a and 14b respectively they show the same pore elements during the blank brine injection experiments at 20 ¬µl h flow rate corners of the pores filled with the wetting fluids oil in the ow model fig 14a and brine in the ww model fig 14b are recognized in the figure fig 14 also shows the locations of the trapped oil in the ow and ww micromodels trapping of the oil globules in the middle of the hydrophilic pores was due to one of two reasons 1 snap off or pore body filling events or 2 initial trapping of the oil in a throat followed by its migration to the middle of a neighboring pore because of its lower capillary pressure fig 14c fig 14d shows the volumes of the trapped oil clusters in the ww and ow high permeability matrices at the end of the blank brine injection experiments residual oil globules in the ww model were mostly larger than those in the ow model note that the smallest oil ganglion in the ww model had a much larger volume 5 10 5 Œºl than that in the ow model 8 10 7 Œºl in the experiment conducted on the ww micromodel the smallest oil globules resided in the middle of the pores or in throats fig 14b however in the test performed on the ow medium the smallest oil volumes corresponded to the oil at the corners of the pores fig 14a comparing the blank brine and polymer solution tests in the ww model fig 13a the polymer exhibited an even dynamic displacement through the three regions the flood fronts in the fracture high permeability matrix and low permeability matrix were nearly aligned throughout different stages of the experiment this confirms the ability of the polymer to enhance the injection sweep efficiency lake et al 2014 it is worth mentioning that the estimated viscosity ratio between the polymer and brine solutions is based on the rheological behavior of the shear thinning polymer solution fig 2 as the viscosity of the polymer solution is a function of the shear rate two parameters affected its viscosity during the propagation of the solution the rate at which it was permeating through the medium and the size of the channel it was flowing through both parameters contribute to the velocity of the solution and hence the shear rate and its viscosity higher propagation rate and narrow pathways led to higher shear rate high velocity and therefore lower viscosity in the matrix regions which should have allowed for faster advancement of the water fronts in the matrix blocks relative to that in the fracture however the tortuous nature of the matrix channels slowed the motion of these fluid fronts on the other hand the straight channel of the fracture was expected to facilitate the mobility of the front within but the lower propagation rate due to most of the water phase being pulled toward the matrices and higher viscosity decelerated the front progression within the fracture these two opposing effects resulted in the uniform progression of the fronts across the two matrix regions and the fracture throughout the experiment fig 13a the oil clusters in the fracture at the end of the blank brine test were larger in size than those at the end of the polymer solution experiment fig 13a which demonstrated the effectiveness of the polymer solution in displacing the oil in addition there was a greater number of oil globules present in the fracture after the blank brine injection test than after the polymer solution injection test finally the polymer solution displaced more oil than brine in both matrix regions fig 13b we believe this is due to the reduced number of snap off events in the ww medium that is in turn caused by the higher viscous pressure drop established by the polymer solution leading to less oil trapping inside the matrix in summary trapping events e g snap off arise and play a significant role during an imbibition process i e invasion of the wetting fluid in a fractured porous medium increasing the viscosity of the displacing wetting phase leads to a smoother displacement within regions with different permeabilities as well as less residual trapping of oil in both the matrix and the fracture 4 conclusions blank brine polymer solution and surfactant solution injection experiments were conducted in a micromodel with a fracture contained between two matrix blocks with considerably different permeabilities the wettability of the model was controlled to be either strongly water wet or strongly oil wet the main findings of this study are summarized below a stepwise saturation trend in the ow hydrophobic model was observed during the blank brine injection experiments at the low 2 ¬µl h and intermediate 20 ¬µl h flow rates within the high permeability matrix as well as during the polymer solution injection test at the intermediate flow rate within both matrix blocks this trend was produced by the non wetting phase pressure field within the fracture the fluid invaded the matrix when its pressure exceeded the entry pressures of matrix pore elements the invasion temporarily stopped due to the lack of connectivity of the defending oil phase at the outlet port then abruptly resumed when the pressure build up was sufficient to reconnect the oil cycle s of halt and progression of the water oil displacements in the matrix blocks recurred until capillary equilibration was established a high injection rate 200 ¬µl h in the ow model led to the trapping of a significant number of oil clusters behind the flood front in the matrix due to the interruptive effect of invasion from different locations within the fracture into the matrix using a higher viscosity aqueous solution polymer solution in the ow model diverted some of the flow to the low permeability matrix but at the expense of establishing lower water saturation in the high permeability zone reducing ift between the injected brine and oil in the ow model induced a more uniform displacement in all regions and boosted oil recovery blank brine injection tests in both ww hydrophilic and ow micromodels produced similar final water saturation values in the high permeability matrix this was attributed to the activation of snap off events in the ww medium where the non wetting oil globules got trapped in the center of pores increasing the residual oil saturation polymer solution injection established a more efficient displacement process than the blank brine injection in the ww medium the higher viscosity of the polymer solution enhanced the flow pattern during flooding by establishing coherent flood fronts across the fracture and matrix regions credit authorship contribution

23,matrix fracture interactions are significant in determining multiphase flow behavior in fractured porous media we investigated the impact of these interactions on dynamic displacement events and flood front patterns in a fractured micromodel with two matrix regions having different permeabilities of varying wettability states the effects of injection rate and viscosity were studied during the injection of blank brine and polymer solutions respectively under oil wet hydrophobic and water wet hydrophilic conditions the influence of reducing interfacial tension was examined by injecting a surfactant solution into the oil wet micromodel under oil wet conditions brine invaded the high permeability matrix producing a stepwise increase in water saturation during the low and intermediate rate experiments the high rate induced fluid displacements within both matrices but trapped more oil in the high permeability zone due to what we labeled as the high rate interruption effect the stepwise invasion was also observed in the two matrices during the polymer solution injection contrary to the smoother invasion of the surfactant solution in the water wet model the high permeability matrix exhibited final fluid saturations resembling those in the oil wet model after brine injection however unlike in the oil wet model brine invaded the low permeability matrix the polymer solution suppressed trapping and improved the sweep efficiency across the two matrix regions our results provide new insights into the pore scale evolution of fluid saturation during two phase flow in fractured porous systems under varying wettability conditions keywords fractured porous media matrix fracture interactions enhanced oil recovery residual trapping wettability micromodel data availability no data was used for the research described in the article 1 introduction understanding multiphase flow in fractured porous media is pivotal for engineering applications involving

fractured reservoirs contain approximately one fifth of the oil reserves worldwide nelson 2001 while even more importantly a rapidly growing portion of the oil production comes from the hydraulically fractured wells in unconventional reservoirs troy and jack 2016 in both naturally occurring and artificially induced fractured porous systems interactions between fracture networks and matrix blocks play a critical role in the multiphase flow dynamics which is one of the key factors in determining the most efficient approaches to maximize oil recovery elfeel et al 2016 sabti et al 2019 previous investigations of fluid transport physics in fractured systems utilized both natural rocks and micromodel platforms in the natural rock studies rangel german and kovscek identified the different regimes of fracture filling and matrix imbibition with respect to the injection rate in a water wet ww berea sandstone core rangel german and kovscek 2002 they observed that co current and counter current imbibition regimes occur at low and high injection rates respectively moreover fern√∏ et al and aspenes et al inspected the capillary bridging phenomenon in stacked core plugs with a transverse fracture using magnetic resonance imaging mri aspenes et al 2002 fern√∏ et al 2011 both concluded that capillary bridges preserve the wetting phase connectivity across the fracture with more and stronger bridges forming at weaker degrees of wetting mirzaei et al monitored the dynamics of water and surfactant solution injections into oil wet ow fractured cores using x ray computed tomography ct techniques and established an inverse relationship between the dimensions of the core and the extent of invasion mirzaei et al 2016 additionally arshadi et al investigated the pore scale interplays of two phase oil brine flow through a miniature ww fractured sandstone core using a high resolution micro ct scanner arshadi et al 2018 they found that water injected at a low flow rate does not completely fill the fracture but forms wetting layers on the fracture walls that aid the capillary imbibition into the neighboring matrix higher injection rates resulted in bulk water flow in the fracture although the abovementioned studies conducted on naturally fractured rocks captured the general aspects of the fluid flow within and between the fracture and the matrix they have not been able to follow the transport dynamics in real time at the pore scale due to the limitations of the imaging tools another constraint regarding natural rocks is that the pore structure properties such as porosity pore size and connectivity cannot be controlled on the other hand micromodels offer flexibility in design that can incorporate different patterns and layouts in addition to critically allowing for direct and real time visualization of the flow dynamics during displacement gogoi and borgohain 2019 jahanbakhsh et al 2020 lifton 2016 for these reasons several research groups employed micromodels to investigate the mechanisms of matrix fracture interactions ahmadi et al 2019a 2019b du et al 2020 jafari et al 2017 khorshidian et al 2018 liang et al 2020 mahdavi and james 2019 malmir et al 2021 martel et al 2019 mejia et al 2019 tangirala and sheng 2019 yun et al 2020 fractured micromodel experiments generally fall into one of two categories depending on which part of the micromodel hosts the injection site the matrix side and or the fracture side injection the former involves injection into the matrix with the fracture s in the middle of the model surrounded by the matrix from all directions these studies mainly focus on investigating the impacts of various parameters on oil recovery using different layouts typically with the goal of characterizing the fracture

al 2013 mahdavi and james 2019 malmir et al 2021 sedaghat et al 2013 shokrollahi et al 2013 injection rate farzaneh et al 2010 shokrollahi et al 2013 viscosity of the injected fluid abedi et al 2012

and wettability state are the most commonly studied aspects ahmadi et al 2019a malmir et al 2021 sedaghat et al 2013 tangirala and sheng 2018 2019 more recently the wettability reversal from ow to ww has also been investigated maghsoudian et al 2020 malmir et al 2021 mohajeri et al 2015 alternatively the fracture side injection category is characterized by the injection into the fracture that is connected to one or several matrix blocks ahmadi et al 2019b cui and babadagli 2017 haghighi et al 1994 hsu et al 2017 jafari et al 2017 marciales and babadagli 2016 masoudi et al 2019 mejia et al 2019 rangel german and kovscek 2006 saidian et al 2014 unlike the matrix side injection experiments the fracture side injection approach is used to examine the fluid flow mechanisms within and between the fracture and the matrix these studies are more pertinent than the matrix side injection experiments to the underground applications where fracture networks hydraulically connect matrix blocks haghighi et al considered drainage processes at different mobility ratios and capillary numbers haghighi et al 1994 they suggested a critical capillary number below which the injected non wetting fluid only flowed through the fracture without invading the matrix mejia et al studied injections of water and an ultralow ift surfactant solution into ow fractured micromodels to probe the effects of three dominant forces in the reservoir i e capillary gravity and viscous forces utilizing respectively a horizontal model subjected to spontaneous imbibition a vertical model subjected to spontaneous imbibition and a horizontal model undergoing flooding mejia et al 2019 all three scenarios resulted in little or no water invasion into the matrix while considerable invasion and oil production were observed when the surfactant solution was used furthermore fracture connectivity and fingering patterns were examined by du et al for different wettability states and over a range of capillary numbers du et al 2020 the authors concluded that the sweep efficiency is not significantly affected in the presence of a dead end fracture but it does depend on the capillary number for a connected fracture overall the main findings of fractured micromodel experiments are that reducing ift increasing injection fluid viscosity and altering wettability from oil wet to water wet positively impact oil recovery by contrast the results concerning the injection rate varied between higher rates increasing jafari et al 2017 decreasing farzaneh et al 2010 khoshkalam et al 2019 shokrollahi et al 2013 or having a variable effect on the oil recovery ahmadi et al 2019a saidian et al 2014 the previous reports considered the common enhanced oil recovery displacement mechanisms observed in unfractured porous media and applied them to interpret the flow behavior in fractured porous systems however mechanisms of fluid mobilization fluid entrapment and fluid saturation evolution during the flow of fluids between fracture and matrix were not studied the patterns by which flood fronts develop in the fracture and matrix regions at various flow rates fluid viscosities ift values and matrix permeabilities are still poorly understood moreover little attention has been paid to the analysis of the residual oil clusters in the matrix after injecting fluids into the adjacent fractures this work aims to fill these gaps by investigating the matrix fracture interactions during two phase fluid displacement processes the effects of flow rate viscosity and ift on the invasion behavior into the matrix are examined while with respect to high and low permeability matrices surrounding the fracture emphasis is given to the sequence and configuration of flood front progression in the fracture and matrix regions as well as displacement trapping mechanisms taking place during flow from fracture to matrix and vice versa it is worth mentioning that throughout this manuscript we use ww and ow interchangeably with hydrophilic and hydrophobic respectively 2 materials and methods 2 1 micromodel design and fabrication the design of the fractured micromodel used in this study is shown in fig 1 the pore network of the model was generated using an algorithm based on voronoi tessellation that enabled the incorporation of features e g tortuosity and randomness resembling those seen in natural porous media wu et al 2012 the algorithm was programmed in matlab math works inc natick ma and the fracture was introduced into the design via autocad autodesk inc mill valley ca usa the micromodel design consisted of three main regions a matrix with large pores and throats a high permeability porous medium a straight fracture and a matrix with small pores and throats a low permeability porous medium the configuration of the inlet outlet ports was designed to ensure the injected fluids entered exited the model only through the fracture such a design was implemented purposely to mimic a system in which matrix blocks are connected by a fracture network where the production from such blocks occurred only through the interconnecting fractures the micromodel was fabricated from borosilicate glass using the wet etching method nge et al 2013 by micronit micronit microtechnologies the netherlands dimensions and properties of the various components of the micromodel are listed in table 1 since the three regions of the model i e the high permeability matrix the low permeability matrix and the fracture were connected it was not possible to measure the permeability of each domain individually instead the permeability of each region was estimated based on geometrical parameters for the matrix regions the permeability was calculated using the semi empirical kozeny equation wu et al 2012 1 k c s 2 where k is the permeability œï is the porosity s is the specific surface area wetted area per unit volume and c is the kozeny constant kozeny 1927 the value of c is estimated to be 5 wu et al 2012 for the fracture the following equation was adopted based on the concept of hydraulic diameter haghighi et al 1994 2 k a f 2 2 Œ± 2 where a f is the area of the fracture conduit and Œ± is the wetted perimeter 2 2 chemicals decane anhydrous 99 sigma aldrich was used as the oil phase while a 0 1 wt sodium chloride 100 acs grade fisher scientific brine was the base of all aqueous solutions xanthan gum sigma aldrich polymer with a concentration of 700 ppm in brine was used as the viscosity buffer solution we chose xanthan gum over other synthetic polymers e g hydrolyzed polyacrylamide or hpam to avoid the complications of the latter s viscoelastic effects shakeel et al 2022 the ift reducing agent was a c12 15 ethoxylate non ionic surfactant bio soft n25 9 stepan co the surfactant concentration was 0 1 wt in brine which is above its critical micelle concentration mirchi et al 2017 because decane is transparent ecoline black dye royal talens the netherlands was added to all aqueous solutions at a 5 wt concentration to improve the contrast between the water and oil phases during the imaging process step 2 3 fluid properties and wettability the density and viscosity of the fluids were measured with an svm 3001 antonpaar densitometer viscometer mcr 502 antonpaar rotational rheometer equipped with a double gap system was used to characterize the polymer solution rheology the ift between the different aqueous solutions and the model oil was measured using the pendant drop method mirchi et al 2017 all measurements were conducted at ambient laboratory conditions table 2 lists the densities viscosities and ift values of all the fluids used in this study for the polymer solution a viscosity versus shear rate plot is presented in fig 2 the values marked by black arrows represent the viscosity of the polymer solution inside the fracture the shear rate of 166 s 1 was calculated for the flow rate of 20 ¬µl h assuming that the polymer solution was flowing only through the fracture the corresponding viscosity was 4 75 cp see fig 2 which was approximately 5 times the base brine viscosity since the borosilicate glass was initially water wet tangirala and sheng 2019 for the ow experiments the wettability of the micromodel was altered using a silanization procedure mohajeri et al 2019 sedaghat et al 2013 a 2 5 wt solution of trichloroocta decylsilane in dehydrated toluene was used as the silanization agent after the silanization steps were completed the model was left to stabilize for at least 6 h before performing the experiments static contact angle measurements on the same borosilicate glass used in manufacturing the micromodel were performed to assess the degree of oil wetness before and after silanization the measurements were conducted using the sessile drop approach giridhar et al 2017 and imagej software schneider et al 2012 was used for analysis in addition in situ contact angles were measured inside the micromodel throats after capillary equilibration to evaluate the wettability state during the experiments olympus cellsens software olympus america inc center valley pa usa was used for the in situ contact angle analysis the results of the contact angle measurements performed on the untreated hydrophilic and silanized hydrophobic borosilicate glass surfaces are summarized in fig 3 from both the droplets figs 3a and 3b and the in situ contact angles figs 3c and 3d it is evident that the silanization process efficiently altered the wettability from strongly ww to strongly ow the average equilibrium in situ contact angles measured at different locations inside the model with the injected fluids at the two wettability states are compared in fig 3e clearly neither the surfactant nor the polymer solutions significantly influenced the micromodel wettability thus any observed effects of the injected fluids on the displacement patterns are solely attributed to the fluid fluid and fluid rock interactions 2 4 fluid injection system and procedures a schematic of the micromodel fluid injection and imaging systems used in this study is shown in fig 4 a harvard pico plus elite syringe pump was used for injecting both oil and aqueous solutions at pre specified constant rates teflon tubing was used for fluid transfer a fluidic connect pro chip holder by micronit which also provided the inlet outlet connections to the micromodel held the micromodel in place the general experimental procedure was as follows first the micromodel was fully saturated with oil by continuous injection of several hundred pore volumes through the f2 port fig 1a at a high flow rate of 300 ¬µl h the presence of the fracture facilitated expelling the air out of the micromodel inlet and outlet tubing were gently and repeatedly tapped to ensure purging of trapped air in the connection locations images were taken to ensure no air remained inside the model second the dyed aqueous solution blank brine or the polymer surfactant solution was injected through the f1 port fig 1a at the desired rate to investigate the displacement physics third the micromodel was cleaned by consecutively injecting distilled water methanol toluene methanol and again distilled water finally before switching to a different set of fluids additional cleaning was performed a soap solution 20 vol solution of rbs 25 sigma aldrich in distilled water was injected along with nitrogen gas to generate foam inside the model and remove residues of the fluids that may have remained in the medium from the previous experiment the foam was then expelled by pumping distilled water through the model overnight finally for the ow experiments if needed the wettability was re established by repeating the silanization process a total of seven flow experiments were performed five under ow and two under ww conditions first three experiments with the injection rates of 2 20 and 200 ¬µl h were conducted using dyed blank brine in the hydrophobic micromodel to examine the effect of the injection rate the intermediate injection rate of 20 ¬µl h was used in all the subsequent experiments the remaining two ow experiments were carried out to evaluate the effects of the viscosity and ift using the dyed polymer and surfactant solutions respectively finally two ww experiments with dyed blank brine and polymer solutions were performed to compare the flow behavior at different wettability states all experiments were conducted at ambient laboratory conditions 2 5 image acquisition and analysis olympus ix83 microscope equipped with a high resolution monochromatic camera andor zyla and a motorized stage was used for the image acquisition a 4x magnification lens 2560 2160 pixels per frame 1 625 ¬µm pixel was used to capture the images the field of view fov included the total area of the model but excluded the inlet outlet ports and small sections obstructed by the chip holder forty frames were taken and automatically stitched within the fov to create the entire image with an approximate resolution of 108 megapixels imaging parameters e g overlapping frame fraction were carefully selected to maximize the quality of the final stitched image the imaging time during the experiments was in the range of 1 2 min per image the images were then processed and analyzed using an in house matlab code the segmentation algorithm included the following steps a a reference image of the fully oil saturated model was selected b pattern recognition within the reference image was used to obtain a pore map such that the areas enclosed between connected edges were labeled as grains while the channels and areas between the grains were identified as throats and pores respectively fig 1b c the reference image was subtracted from the image s obtained during the flow experiments d a threshold pixel value based on the gray scale histogram of the images was applied to the subtracted image from step c to distinguish between the oil and water phases further details of this approach can be found elsewhere osei bonsu et al 2020 2018 e the image was then further processed using a neighborhood window average filter to remove minor artifacts created by slight frame shifts segmented images were subsequently used to calculate oil and water saturations as well as the frequency distributions of the volumes of residual oil ganglia 3 results and discussion 3 1 effect of injection rate the ow hydrophobic micromodel fluid occupancy maps for the three blank brine injection rates i e 2 20 and 200 Œºl h at different total injected pore volumes pvinj are shown in fig 5a since this was a drainage process as the non wetting phase was displacing the wetting one the relative magnitude of viscous pressure drop within the fracture to the threshold capillary pressures of the displacements within the neighboring matrices determined the degree of invasion into each matrix system in other words the occurrence of brine to oil displacements in the matrix regions depended on whether the local viscous pressure in the fracture could overcome their threshold pressures from the snapshots in fig 5a it is evident that the low permeability matrix region was invaded only during the highest flow rate experiment this is because the high threshold entry capillary pressure in this region prohibited invasion at lower injection rates due to lower viscous pressure drops this is also reflected in the water saturation sw plots see fig 5b of the three experiments for both low and high permeability regions by contrast the high permeability region was invaded by brine at all flow rates fig 5a however the extent of the brine invasion as well as the details of the invasion process varied at the low and intermediate rates the water saturation developed in a stepwise manner whereby the brine invaded a specific portion of the matrix but did not progress any further for a certain amount of time before swiftly invading another portion to the best of our knowledge this has never been observed previously and is contrary to the monotonic invasion recovery trajectories commonly reported for oil wet fractured micromodels jafari et al 2017 mohajeri et al 2015 sedaghat et al 2013 the rationale behind such observation can be summarized as follows the brine started displacing the oil in the fracture before invading the matrix regions because of the substantially lower threshold entry pressure of the fracture during the progression of the brine front in the fracture the pressure built up and surpassed the threshold entry pressure of the high permeability matrix such that invasion started from the upstream part of the fracture the size of the invaded portion depended on the pressure of the brine that in turn corresponded to the injected flow rate this meant that a smaller portion of the medium was invaded in the case of the low rate experiment than in the case of the intermediate rate experiment after the fracture became completely filled with brine and breakthrough occurred two requirements had to be fulfilled in order for the brine progression in the matrix to continue the pressure of the water phase to build up again and exceed the threshold entry pressure of the matrix pore elements and the to be displaced oil in the matrix to connect to the exit port since the fracture was filled with brine the continuous water phase in the fracture between the inlet and outlet ports had to be disrupted by the flow of oil at the outlet for the oil to be produced the disruption of the connected water phase however required a certain amount of time so that at a specific instant the oil could link with the exit port triggering the immediate invasion of brine into the high permeability matrix during this process the invasion sequence was controlled by the order in which the pores throats were being accessed by the brine and whether the invading phase pressure was sufficient to enter each element because of this invasion the water phase pressure and consequently the oil pressure in the high permeability matrix decreased causing the water phase within the fracture to re connect to the outlet resulting in a pause in the further invasion of the pore space by brine within the matrix this cyclic process was repeated until capillary equilibrium was reached within the high permeability matrix for the 2 ¬µl h injection rate the process ceased before the complete invasion of the matrix see fig 5a this cyclic invasion phenomenon did not take place in the low permeability matrix because of the inherently higher threshold capillary pressures that the low viscous pressure drop in the fracture could not overcome furthermore there were notable differences between the invasion progression of the non wetting phase at the highest flow rate 200 ¬µl h and those of the flow tests conducted at the low and intermediate rates the water saturation during the high rate was lower than that during the intermediate rate at the final injection stages fig 5b this can be attributed to two factors the pressure of the non wetting phase and the additional residual trapping for the high flow rate the water phase pressure in the fracture was sufficiently high to invade the matrix at any position along the fracture s total length consequently the oil displaced by the brine from positions invaded earlier in the process might encounter brine invading the matrix further down the flow direction as the invading brine interfaced with the oil moving in the matrix it disconnected the defending clusters from its unswept segment resulting in poor oil connectivity and hence more entrapment fig 6 shows a schematic illustration of this process along with the actual entrapment of oil by the invading brine during the displacement process a smoother uninterrupted oil displacement occurred during the test performed at the intermediate flow rate leading to less oil trapping and hence more oil recovery from the high permeability matrix compared to that of the high rate experiment the aforementioned displacement interruptions did not occur in the low permeability matrix due to the greater capillary forces that blocked the brine from invading the matrix at multiple access points within the fracture to better understand the behavior of the trapped oil clusters within the high permeability matrix we analyzed the normalized cumulative frequency of the volumes of oil globules fig 7 at the end of the 20 ¬µl h and 200 ¬µl h experiments the clusters of sizes less than 15 pixels were excluded because they represented a negligible fraction of the total oil volume and also they could be artifacts of the image processing steps osei bonsu et al 2020 the analysis shows the effect of the displacement interruptions on residual oil clusters at the high flow rate the sizes of the residual oil globules for the high injection rate were larger almost for the entire span of their volumes except for the few largest globules this demonstrates how the interruptions by the brine from the fracture disconnected and isolated large oil globules that were not displaced even at the high rate we also observed fluctuations in the fluid saturations in the high permeability matrix region during the 200 ¬µl h experiment after the early invasion stages fig 5b this was due to the late movement of the oil clusters from other parts of the matrix into the fov followed by their production from the micromodel for example fig 8 shows the propagation entrainment of some of the oil clusters through the high permeability matrix that had been invaded by brine during the 200 ¬µl h experiment based on the above observations it can be concluded that increasing the brine s injection rate does not necessarily lead to more oil displacement in hydrophobic fractured media the result depends on key factors such as the capillary forces homogeneity in the matrix and the strength of viscous forces in the fracture network caused by the injected fluid these factors control the mechanisms by which the oil is displaced from the matrix brine flows first in the fracture then invades the matrix depending on its local pressure increasing the injection rate nominally induces larger viscous pressure drops and therefore enhances the likelihood of invasion into the hydrophobic matrix however a further increase in the injection rate above a certain limit can result in more oil entrapment due to the interruption effect discussed earlier 3 2 effect of viscosity a polymer injection experiment was performed to examine the effect of viscosity on the fluid invasion into the matrix fig 9a compares the fluid occupancy maps generated during blank brine and polymer injection tests at 20 ¬µl h injection rate the evolution of the water saturation with time in terms of pvinj for the two permeability regions is shown in fig 9b we estimated the viscosity of the polymer solution inside the fracture at the injection rate of 20 ¬µl h to be 5 times higher than that of blank brine viscosity see fig 2 stepwise changes in fluid saturations were noticeable in both high and low permeability matrix regions during the polymer solution test as well fig 9b shows that the steps in the water saturation occurred for the injected polymer solution at the same instances i e same values of pvinj in both the high and low permeability matrices this is despite the fact that the two domains had different threshold entry pressures which proved that the stepwise invasion trends were not related to the matrices themselves but rather to a common attribute which was the connectivity of oil at the outlet port because the stepwise saturation pattern was observed again during the polymer solution experiment the experiment was repeated using a different syringe pump and syringe to ensure that the observed behavior was not due to pump pulsation or any other experimental artifact the reason for selecting the polymer solution not the blank brine as the fluid used in the reproducibility test was because it showed the stepwise trend in both the high and low permeability matrices making the trend easier to be probed we used two different harvard pico plus elite syringe pumps in the initial and repeated experiments 5 ml beckton dickinson sigma aldrich and 5 ml norm ject air tite products co inc syringes were used in the initial and repeated experiments respectively both syringes had been programmed by default in the database of the pumps the utilized rate 20 Œºl h was above the minimum rate that could be accurately supported by the pumps using either syringe fig 10 validates the reproducibility of the stepwise invasion pattern during the two polymer solution injection experiments in the ow hydrophobic model the results of both experiments were in reasonable qualitative and quantitative agreement the ultimate water saturations in both the high and low permeability matrix blocks were almost identical with regard to the initial and repeated experiments however the steps of saturation jumps were shifted in time between the two experiments we believe this was because the steps were sensitive to the local pressure which slightly varied between the two experiments the overall saturation trends of the two experiments were comparable from the results of the reproducibility test it was concluded that the stepwise invasion observation was not caused by an experimental artifact but reflected an actual physical phenomenon related to the micromodel fracture matrix configuration that held the inlet and outlet ports connected only to the fracture the final oil saturation in the high permeability matrix region after the polymer injection was slightly higher than that of the blank brine injection fig 9b this is primarily because of the fact that the polymer was able to divert flow to the low permeability zone in other words the low permeability matrix region was invaded during the polymer experiment while no invasion into this domain occurred during the blank brine injection see fig 9a during the polymer injection the viscous forces created sufficient pressure in the fracture to overcome the low permeability matrix zone s threshold entry pressures 3 3 effect of ift to investigate the effect of ift on matrix fracture flow dynamics a nonionic surfactant solution was employed that reduced the ift between the oil and the brine from 49 9 to 5 76 mn m table 2 fluid occupancy maps and sw vs pvinj trends during the surfactant solution injection test are compared with those of the polymer solution and blank brine injection experiments in fig 9 the surfactant solution invaded the high and low permeability regions faster and with higher displacement efficiency relative to the other two solutions fig 9a reducing the ift of the injection fluid in an oil wet fractured medium was the most effective approach in triggering an effective drainage displacement in the hydrophobic matrix regions surrounding the fracture additionally no stepwise saturation changes were observed in contrast to the other two flow fluids this was due to the much lower ift value which lowered the threshold capillary pressures and enabled a fast fluid displacement within the low and high permeability matrix regions while the oil was still connected to the outlet port furthermore as shown in fig 11 the advancement of the displacement fronts in the three media low permeability matrix high permeability matrix and fracture was predominantly uniform throughout the experiment such that the front in the fracture was ahead of that in the high permeability matrix followed by that in the low permeability matrix this arrangement of flood fronts across the three media obeyed the order of threshold capillary pressures from low to high which was expected in a hydrophobic fractured porous medium such behavior resulted in a high displacement efficiency of the oil from the matrix regions fig 12 compares the volume distributions of the trapped oil ganglia at the end of the blank brine and surfactant injection experiments in the ow model the reduction in ift resulted in smaller residual oil clusters in the small 10 5 to 10 4 ¬µl and large 5 10 4 to 3 10 3 ¬µl globule volume ranges by contrast the middle sized oil clusters 1 10 4 to 4 10 4 ¬µl were slightly larger after the surfactant injection 3 4 effect of wettability the effect of wettability was studied using the blank brine and polymer solutions by utilizing the ww model and comparing the results with those of the ow counterpart the oil brine contact angles in the ow and ww micromodels were 160 and 21 fig 3e corresponding respectively to strongly oil wet and strongly water wet conditions the capillary pressures in the ww and ow systems were therefore positive and negative respectively fig 13 a presents the fluid occupancy maps generated during the two tests performed on the ww medium three water phase fronts were identified in the captured images during both polymer solution and blank brine injection experiments however the sequence of these fronts followed a reverse order from that in the ow medium due to the positive capillary pressures during the blank brine experiment water the wetting phase preferred to move first and fastest through the low permeability matrix where capillary forces were the strongest then through the high permeability matrix and finally through the fracture another major difference between the tests conducted on the ow and ww systems is that in the former all the oil in the fracture was rapidly displaced regardless of the injection fluid figs 5a and 9a while in the ww case some residual oil clusters remained in the fracture fig 13a since the displacement process in the ww medium was an imbibition process the oil constituting the non wetting phase moved toward the fracture during the displacement due to its lower drainage threshold capillary pressures as a result disconnected oil globules appeared inside the fracture and remained as residual oil in the form of trapped oil clusters the water saturation within the matrices in the ow and ww models are compared in fig 13b for both blank brine and polymer solutions the water to oil displacement was significantly faster in the ww model this is because the water was the wetting fluid therefore the threshold capillary pressures in addition to the viscous pressure drop favored the water phase to invade the model a noteworthy observation was that the final water saturations of the high permeability matrix at the end of the blank brine injection experiments were similar 83 under both ow and ww conditions it was expected that the ww model would exhibit greater oil recovery due to stronger water invasion nevertheless since the medium was strongly ww i e contact angle 21 the snap off events could decrease the efficiency of the displacement by trapping more oil consequently both blank brine injection experiments in ow and ww models had similar residual oil saturations this phenomenon is well documented for macroscopic displacements in natural porous media singh et al 2017 it is generally accepted that the least amount of trapping occurs under weakly ww or neutrally wet conditions and the residual oil values are similarly high under strongly ww and strongly ow conditions tawfik et al 2019 the different patterns of fluid occupancy in the ow and ww models are demonstrated in figs 14a and 14b respectively they show the same pore elements during the blank brine injection experiments at 20 ¬µl h flow rate corners of the pores filled with the wetting fluids oil in the ow model fig 14a and brine in the ww model fig 14b are recognized in the figure fig 14 also shows the locations of the trapped oil in the ow and ww micromodels trapping of the oil globules in the middle of the hydrophilic pores was due to one of two reasons 1 snap off or pore body filling events or 2 initial trapping of the oil in a throat followed by its migration to the middle of a neighboring pore because of its lower capillary pressure fig 14c fig 14d shows the volumes of the trapped oil clusters in the ww and ow high permeability matrices at the end of the blank brine injection experiments residual oil globules in the ww model were mostly larger than those in the ow model note that the smallest oil ganglion in the ww model had a much larger volume 5 10 5 Œºl than that in the ow model 8 10 7 Œºl in the experiment conducted on the ww micromodel the smallest oil globules resided in the middle of the pores or in throats fig 14b however in the test performed on the ow medium the smallest oil volumes corresponded to the oil at the corners of the pores fig 14a comparing the blank brine and polymer solution tests in the ww model fig 13a the polymer exhibited an even dynamic displacement through the three regions the flood fronts in the fracture high permeability matrix and low permeability matrix were nearly aligned throughout different stages of the experiment this confirms the ability of the polymer to enhance the injection sweep efficiency lake et al 2014 it is worth mentioning that the estimated viscosity ratio between the polymer and brine solutions is based on the rheological behavior of the shear thinning polymer solution fig 2 as the viscosity of the polymer solution is a function of the shear rate two parameters affected its viscosity during the propagation of the solution the rate at which it was permeating through the medium and the size of the channel it was flowing through both parameters contribute to the velocity of the solution and hence the shear rate and its viscosity higher propagation rate and narrow pathways led to higher shear rate high velocity and therefore lower viscosity in the matrix regions which should have allowed for faster advancement of the water fronts in the matrix blocks relative to that in the fracture however the tortuous nature of the matrix channels slowed the motion of these fluid fronts on the other hand the straight channel of the fracture was expected to facilitate the mobility of the front within but the lower propagation rate due to most of the water phase being pulled toward the matrices and higher viscosity decelerated the front progression within the fracture these two opposing effects resulted in the uniform progression of the fronts across the two matrix regions and the fracture throughout the experiment fig 13a the oil clusters in the fracture at the end of the blank brine test were larger in size than those at the end of the polymer solution experiment fig 13a which demonstrated the effectiveness of the polymer solution in displacing the oil in addition there was a greater number of oil globules present in the fracture after the blank brine injection test than after the polymer solution injection test finally the polymer solution displaced more oil than brine in both matrix regions fig 13b we believe this is due to the reduced number of snap off events in the ww medium that is in turn caused by the higher viscous pressure drop established by the polymer solution leading to less oil trapping inside the matrix in summary trapping events e g snap off arise and play a significant role during an imbibition process i e invasion of the wetting fluid in a fractured porous medium increasing the viscosity of the displacing wetting phase leads to a smoother displacement within regions with different permeabilities as well as less residual trapping of oil in both the matrix and the fracture 4 conclusions blank brine polymer solution and surfactant solution injection experiments were conducted in a micromodel with a fracture contained between two matrix blocks with considerably different permeabilities the wettability of the model was controlled to be either strongly water wet or strongly oil wet the main findings of this study are summarized below a stepwise saturation trend in the ow hydrophobic model was observed during the blank brine injection experiments at the low 2 ¬µl h and intermediate 20 ¬µl h flow rates within the high permeability matrix as well as during the polymer solution injection test at the intermediate flow rate within both matrix blocks this trend was produced by the non wetting phase pressure field within the fracture the fluid invaded the matrix when its pressure exceeded the entry pressures of matrix pore elements the invasion temporarily stopped due to the lack of connectivity of the defending oil phase at the outlet port then abruptly resumed when the pressure build up was sufficient to reconnect the oil cycle s of halt and progression of the water oil displacements in the matrix blocks recurred until capillary equilibration was established a high injection rate 200 ¬µl h in the ow model led to the trapping of a significant number of oil clusters behind the flood front in the matrix due to the interruptive effect of invasion from different locations within the fracture into the matrix using a higher viscosity aqueous solution polymer solution in the ow model diverted some of the flow to the low permeability matrix but at the expense of establishing lower water saturation in the high permeability zone reducing ift between the injected brine and oil in the ow model induced a more uniform displacement in all regions and boosted oil recovery blank brine injection tests in both ww hydrophilic and ow micromodels produced similar final water saturation values in the high permeability matrix this was attributed to the activation of snap off events in the ww medium where the non wetting oil globules got trapped in the center of pores increasing the residual oil saturation polymer solution injection established a more efficient displacement process than the blank brine injection in the ww medium the higher viscosity of the polymer solution enhanced the flow pattern during flooding by establishing coherent flood fronts across the fracture and matrix regions credit authorship contribution

24,multiphase fluid flow within porous media is of great importance in a wide range of environmental and industrial fields such as co2 sequestration geothermal systems fuel cells enhanced oil recovery

1 introduction multiphase flow in porous media describes the underlying physics in many problems with a wide range of environmental and industrial applications such as co2 storage in saline aquifers hydrocarbon production geothermal systems fuel cells and groundwater remediation blunt 2017 zhao et al 2019 blunt et al 2013 at the continuum scale two macroscopic properties relative permeability and capillary pressure are used to model multiphase flow cruichshank et al 2002 alhammadi et al 2020 although experimental analysis is the most accurate method for determining macroscopic fluid flow properties they are extremely time consuming and costly additionally relative permeability and capillary pressure are fundamentally influenced by microscopic scale i e pore scale properties of fluid flow in porous media such as pore geometry wettability and interfacial tensions andrew et al 2014 an alternative method for estimating these properties is by modeling fluid flow physics at the pore scale bakhshian et al 2019 pore scale simulation is a novel technique that can reduce the time required for experiments and lower expenses and manpower substantially it connects and upscales the pore scale properties such as pore geometry and wettability to continuum scale multiphase flow in porous media zhao et al 2019 this technique requires x ray tomography imaging of porous materials image processing and numerical simulations of fluid flow at the pore scale x ray computed tomography is a non destructive method that has been widely accepted for acquiring extremely detailed 3d images of porous media at the pore scale during the image acquisition the sample is illuminated with x rays while being rotated after passing through the sample the x rays are then imaged with a 2d detector with enough projections collected at different angles a 3d image of the sample can be constructed blunt et al 2013 baker et al 2012 andr√§ et al 2013 however because of the influence of the environment hardware and other factors the image is contaminated by noise during acquisition image denoising methods such as non local means buades et al 2005 can be applied to remove noise from the image while preserving the main features of the image e g boundary between pore and matrix diwakar and kumar 2018 fan et al 2019 the next step is segmentation this process partitions the image into groups of voxels belonging to a specified class e g phase or minerals purswani et al 2020 binary segmentation is a common type of segmentation that is used to partition the rock image into void space pores and matrix after image acquisition and processing the image is now prepared for simulation of two phase flow the primary techniques for simulating multiphase flow in porous media are either direct numerical simulation which mostly utilizes the lattice boltzmann method lbm or pore network modeling pnm which is composed of simplified spherical pore cells and tubular throats golparvar et al 2018 blunt et al 2013 gostick et al 2016 huang et al 2020 lbm is more resource intensive hence it can only be applied to small scale images of porous material pnm offers a more lightweight approach but at the expense of accuracy there are two types of pnms quasi static and dynamic quasi static models assume that the flow is driven by capillary forces but dynamic models also consider viscous forces dong and blunt 2009 joekar niasar and hassanizadeh 2012 regaieg and moncorg√© 2017 chen et al 2020 overall rapid estimation of macroscopic two phase flow properties for a digital rock requires imaging the rock sample performing image processing and simulating pore network two phase modeling image processing is a series of user biased recurrent operations which involves a lot of time and requires basic knowledge of the image processing domain o mahony et al 2020 subsequently a simplified pore network model has to be extracted from the segmented image and finally we can simulate two phase fluid flow within the extracted network model the whole procedure is extremely time consuming and requires considerable computational power deep learning can be utilized to accelerate this process deep learning with applications to pore scale imaging and modeling have received a lot of research attention in recent years wang et al 2021a deep learning is a subfield of machine learning that uses a series of multiple layers of processing units to extract high level abstract features from raw data it is suited for analyzing and extracting useful knowledge from both large amounts of data and data collected from different sources goodfellow et al 2016 applications of deep learning in pore scale modeling include image enhancement and de noising wang et al 2019 image segmentation varfolomeev et al 2019 karimpouli and tahmasebi 2019 anon 2020 and prediction of petrophysical properties e g permeability porosity conductivity etc rabbani et al 2020 kamrava et al 2020 rabbani and babaei 2019 tian et al 2021 tembely et al 2020 convolutional neural networks cnns is a subclass of artificial neural networks anns they have been a dominant method in computer vision tasks and hence have been applied to a wide range of problems including object detection face recognition image classification image segmentation and so on zhiqiang and jun 2017 kortli et al 2020 rawat and wang 2017 guo et al 2018 alzubaidi et al 2021 cnn is a mathematical construct that is typically composed of three types of layers or building blocks convolution pooling and often fully connected fc layers the initial two layers namely convolution and pooling layers are responsible for extracting features on the other hand the third layer which is a fully connected layer maps the features extracted from the previous layers to generate the final output yamashita et al 2018 the outstanding advantage of cnn over other classes of deep learning models is the ability to detect important spatial features without any human supervision and bias which allows for the extraction of complex features of the porous medium instead of relying on a human user for feature extraction alzubaidi et al 2021 petrophysical properties prediction using deep learning methods are either feature based or image based models feature based models are lightweight artificial neural networks anns that usually take extracted geometric features from the image such as porosity or surface area image based models are convolutional neural networks cnns that take the image itself as input both feature based and image based models could also be implemented into simulators for acceleration or upscaling flow properties rabbani and babaei 2019 wang et al 2021b najafi et al 2021 sayyafzadeh and gu√©rillot 2022 siavashi et al 2022 the vast majority of the work in this area has focused on single phase flow prediction of absolute permeability feature based models are basically non linear multi variate regression problems linking the geometric properties of porous media to its permeability an early application of deep learning for predicting permeability involved feeding seven geometric features into a densely connected layer with six nodes i e ann which was then used to make the permeability predictions the trained ann was used in conjunction with pnm serving as a surrogate to lbm pnm models used for 2d images of digital rocks rabbani and babaei 2019 zhao et al 2020 this method significantly increases simulation speed with little loss of accuracy however it requires pre processing furthermore later implementations of deep learning techniques on 3d real porous mediums have not been able to achieve high accuracy for prediction of permeability from 3d porous mediums studies have been done on both real and synthetic images tian et al 2021 developed a genetic algorithm ga ann model with nine dense layers which was optimized to predict permeability from 16 geometric features of 3d synthetic rock samples an r2 score of 0 999 was achieved mostly because of the simple geometry and relatively uniform distribution of samples tembely et al 2020 used 3d sub samples extracted from a carbonate rock and used ann cnn and machine learning algorithms to predict permeability they extracted 3 features i e formation factor porosity and permeability obtained from pnm and trained machine learning regression models and ann to map these features to their permeability the cnn however was trained using raw 3d images as its input eliminating pre processing steps to predict permeability results demonstrated that deep learning techniques ann and cnn with an r2 score of 0 91 showed moderately better accuracy than machine learning methods image based models use convolutional layers to extract complex and hidden features of porous media geometry and pass them to dense fc layers to analyze and link these features to their petrophysical properties this method offers a more direct and flexible approach which does not rely on user biased extraction of geometric features wang et al 2021a wu et al 2018 used the voronoi tessellation algorithm to create synthetic 2d images of porous mediums and removed some cells to generate pores the permeability of generated images was then calculated using lbm a cnn with two convolutional layers and three dense layers was then developed to predict permeability furthermore two physical parameters porosity and surface area were given to the last dense layer resulting in higher r2 scores this demonstrated that implementing physical parameters that are related to the output into the network could improve accuracy alqahtani et al 2020 performed a study on predicting porosity mean pore size and surface area from 2d images of sandstones for porosity and surface area they achieved an r2 score of more than 0 9 for binary segmented images and an r2 score of more than 0 75 for grayscale ones estimating mean pore size however was more difficult to predict reaching r2 0 71 for both binary and grayscale images studies have also been done with 3d images as input to the network kamrava et al 2020 was able to achieve an r2 of 0 91 for 500 stochastically generated synthetic samples in a similar study hong and liu 2020 extracted 3158 sandstone sub samples of 1003 from a larger 6503 sample and was able to achieve an r2 score of 0 91 but for real porous media images and wider permeability range extrapolation of model for a different unseen sandstone however returned a lower r2 score of 0 69 alqahtani et al 2021 utilized a more advanced architecture resnet and resnext to predict properties of a broader range of carbonate and sandstone samples with a size of 643 and achieved an r2 of 0 87 moreover due to the broad range of rock types it was able to achieve high accuracy r2 0 86 for a completely unseen sandstone wang et al 2021a zhang et al 2022 used autoencoder based convolutional neural networks ae cnns to predict permeability of low resolution porous mediums the model achieved an r2 score of 0 896 while results from lbm simulations were significantly lower r2 0 42 primarily attributed to the massive numerical errors occurring due to the blurred boundaries of low resolution images rabbani et al 2020 performed a study to predict various petrophysical properties of 3d images by capturing the central axis cross sections in x y and z directions and feeding them into the network as a colored rgb image with three channels this approach reduces computational cost of training directly on 3d images at the expense of higher accuracy and pre processing a total of 30 petrophysical properties 1515 values including relative permeability were predicted achieving an r2 of 0 9385 for all values on the testing dataset in our study on the other hand we focus on prediction of two phase flow properties i e relative permeability and capillary pressure directly from unprocessed real 3d rock images with respect to two physical parameters i e contact angle and ift that affect these properties in the study by siavashi et al 2022 a cnn based framework was presented to upscale multiphase properties for low and high resolution 3d images of rock samples a cnn model was developed to predict multiphase flow properties from sub samples of fontainebleau sandstone however the presented model had the following limitations i image dataset consisted of only one type of sandstone ii multiphase flow simulation settings were constant hence the network was not sensitive to other influencing parameters such as contact angle and interfacial tension and iii four separate models had to be developed to obtain the maximum accuracy in the study to address these limitations we initiated this research to test the feasibility of multiphase flow properties prediction from 3d images of rock samples along with the other influencing parameters contact angle and interfacial tensions using one convolutional neural network model specifically we prepared two datasets of 500 sub samples in grayscale raw and binary segmented formats which are extracted from 12 larger sandstone samples pore network models were extracted from the binary sub samples and eight quasi static waterflooding simulations with different contact angles and interfacial tensions were performed the resulting relative permeability and capillary pressure data were given to the convolutional neural network as output as the raw grayscale images along with their corresponding contact angle and interfacial tension parameters were given to the network as input the designed network architecture allows separate predictions of different outputs within the same network assessment of the trained model demonstrates promising results for predicting macroscopic two phase flow properties from the 3d rock tomographies despite the poor accuracy of the simulation method furthermore it reduced the computation time considerably 2 materials and methods 2 1 overview the main goal of this study is to design and train a convolutional neural network that predicts relative permeability and capillary pressure from 3d images of real porous media and contact angle and interfacial tension data in this section we present the dataset generation which includes the preparation of the 3d Œº ct images dataset and the simulation of two phase flow and then the architecture of the convolutional neural network the general workflow is illustrated in fig 1 2 2 materials 2 2 1 image dataset training deep neural networks requires large datasets therefore hundreds of 3d images are needed for training convolutional neural networks the computational power for simulation increases with the size of the input i e 3d image using smaller sub samples accelerates the simulation substantially however the pore network simulation results will be unreliable and unrealistic not following the established rules of two phase flow if the sub samples are too small the appropriate size depends on rock type pore geometry and the scale at which the image was taken after evaluating and testing different sizes sub samples with 400 3 were created the sandstone rock images were taken from the digital rock portal website images of 12 different sandstones were used in both raw and segmented formats neumann et al 2020 kohanpur et al 2019 all image processing procedures were performed by the publishers of the datasets and we used the results of their work as the images would be more reliable the size of all 12 rock samples is 1000 3 voxels 3d pixels except for mt simon which is 1200 3 raw images are taken from the samples without any image processing image segmentation details for mt simon sample is not mentioned in the website or related papers for the first 11 sandstones after filtering and de noising by the non local means algorithm images were segmented into different regions i e pores and matrix at a threshold calculated using isodata algorithm see table 1 iterative selforganizing data analysis techniques algorithm isodata is an unsupervised classification algorithm originally proposed by ridler and calvard 1978 the algorithm initially estimates a threshold usually set to the image s average intensity value which partitions the histogram into two categories the average intensity values of each class are computed and the resulting threshold is determined as the average of those values the process is repeated iteratively with the new average intensity values until the convergence point is reached between 39 42 sub samples were extracted from each segmented image resulting in a total of 500 sub samples the same procedure was done for raw images creating identical sub samples to segmented ones with their only difference being image processing segmented sub samples were used for pore network extraction and later two phase simulation as raw grayscale ones were fed to the cnn as input further details are summarized in table 1 moreover fig 2 includes sampled 2d cross sections from all rock types 2 2 2 two phase flow simulation to simulate two phase fluid flow through the micro scale porous media pore network modeling pnm method was selected as it is resource efficient and relatively simple to perform compared to lbm the software utilized for this study is developed and published by valvatne and blunt 2004 and written in c we used the waterflooding module for this study the simulation type is quasi static hence the flow regime is capillary dominated the model initializes by increasing invading phase pressure and keeping the defending phase pressure constant resulting in a reduced capillary pressure the three main processes are piston like displacement pore body filling and snap off piston like displacement occurs at pores or throats that has an adjacent element containing invading phase pore body filling is a mechanism that happens only at pores that have at least two invaded neighbor throats snap off occurs when the pore or throat is filled with the non wetting fluid and the wetting fluid in the corner layers swells so much that the fluid fluid interface becomes unstable hence the pore or throat is filled with the wetting phase moreover it utilizes class iii of the morrow model to find the relationship between receding and advancing contact angles morrow 1975 a more detailed description is available in valvatne and blunt 2004 first step in simulating two phase pore network modeling is to extract the pore network model from all sub samples we used software developed and published by raeini et al 2017 which is also written in c this method which is a re write of the maximal ball algorithm by dong and blunt 2009 involves a technique of discretizing the void space into pores and then into half throat corners which are later used to extract network features during this transformation each voxel of the void space is assigned to a distinct pore half throat and corner the corner s properties are extracted from the original image by utilizing a medial axis transformation of the void space and direct single phase flow simulations at varying levels of discretization dong and blunt 2009 raeini et al 2017 eight different simulation scenarios with different contact angles and interfacial tension were performed for all of the 500 sub samples resulting in a total of 4000 simulations details are presented in table 2 for each combination two relative permeability kri and krd and one capillary pressure pc dataset with their corresponding saturation points in the forms of 1d arrays are obtained each simulation models relative permeability and capillary pressure data corresponding to two phase flow with incompressible fluids these datasets were extracted from output files and stored the number of data entries of relative permeability and capillary pressure arrays is not fixed for every simulation and varies between 40 56 data points additionally the saturation range of each simulation is also not fixed because of different residual saturations given a constant dimension should be used for the neural network as it does not allow inconsistent output dimensions a fixed number of saturation points were defined in the range of 0 1 and the values of relative permeability and capillary pressure curves were determined for those points using linear interpolation for the saturation points beyond the residual saturation the remaining elements were equated with the last value of each curve 2 3 methods 2 3 1 cnn architecture the convolutional neural network model presented in this paper is implemented by keras chollet et al 2015 which is a python library for artificial neural networks with tensorflow abadi et al 2015 as the backend overall the cnn architecture consists of four 3d convolutional layers one max pooling layer four single branch fully connected layers and three specific branch fully connected layers for each output the details of this network are shown in table 3 the single branch fc layers learn from the extracted features and after the second layer contact angle and interfacial tension are imported into the network which assists the network in recognizing and understanding the change in output with respect to physical parameters then the results are given to 4 separate branches of fc layers each of these branches leads to a different class of outputs invading fluid relative permeability defending fluid relative permeability capillary pressure and residual saturation this network structure allows neurons to learn specifically for each output and simplify the analysis of training and predictions this types of machine learning models are known as multi task learning in which multiple tasks are simultaneously learned by a shared model see fig 3 the activation function for all dense layers is relu except for output layers and residual saturation branch which is tanh the dataset is split into three parts for training validation and testing sets with the split ratio being 80 10 10 respectively both test and validation dataset are used to evaluate the model validation data is used to evaluate the model while training after every epoch and the test dataset is used after the model is trained for further verification all convolutional layers have a kernel size of 4 and stride of 2 with relu as their activation function the first convolutional layer has 4 filters which doubles in every layer after batch normalization is done on the outputs of second to fourth layers for outputs mean squared error mse equation was used as the loss function and the minimizations were performed by adam algorithm kingma and ba 2014 with a learning rate of 5e 4 it was trained with a batch size of 8 40 epochs on an nvidia quadro gv100 volta graphical processing unit with 16 gb of memory training time per epoch was approximately 30 minutes several callback functions were added to the model to store the model with the lowest validation error monitor and calculate r2 and rmse in every epoch and end the training if the model was not improving after ten rounds the input image and outputs are constrained to 0 1 except for capillary pressure data which is scaled to 1 1 range for model evaluation the coefficient of determinant r2 is calculated for all the datasets as it is considered a standard evaluation metric for regression in addition to evaluating the test dataset randomly picked from the total dataset evaluation was also done for several contact angle and ift values that were not included in the training or testing dataset furthermore the model was trained after removing one of the 12 rock samples out of the training dataset in order to evaluate its performance on an unseen rock sample 2 3 2 post processing moving window averaging is a simple statistics technique for smoothing data trends relative permeability and capillary pressure curves are always ascending or descending given that the model predicts data points independently and is unaware of their relationship the monotonic trend of predictions might be violated at some parts of the curve line to address this problem after performing window averaging data points that violate this rule are equated to the point before after that r2 is calculated for each curve line up to the predicted residual saturation point and not for the whole range these processes slightly improved evaluation parameters i e r2 the original r2 scores for test dataset were kri 0 925 krd 0 986 and pc 0 946 post processing affected invading phase relative permeability the most by increasing its r2 score to 0 983 3 results and discussion in this section cnn development and training the trained model sensitivity to physical parameters contact angle and interfacial tension and pore structure and the selection of sub sample size and its effect on the model will be discussed finally the overall evaluation of the results is presented 3 1 cnn training at first cnn consisted of four main dense layers each containing between 80 to 200 neurons the last layer was connected to 4 separate output layers this architecture was relatively simple and was unable to capture the relationship between input and output properly hence the number of neurons in the main branch increased and more layers were added to each branch until no further improvement was observed the details of the final structure are shown in table 3 tanh was used as an output layer activation function instead of relu to reduce training time since the data values range from minus one to one and so does tanh all other layers use relu except for the dense layers of the residual saturation branch which uses tanh it was observed that if relu were utilized in this branch the model would be unable to learn this parameter we have not yet reached a definitive explanation for this seeing that training a network with larger sub samples requires more gpu memory batch size was reduced to 8 from the initial 64 furthermore training on a model with a customized error function as its loss calculation metric proved to have no superiority over mean squared error this was since simulation accuracy improved with larger sub samples the lowest validation error mean squared error occurred after the 34th of 40 epochs hence it was determined as the best version of the model the final loss values are shown in table 4 as the learning trend for all epochs is illustrated in fig 4 3 2 model sensitivity to contact angle and ift eight simulation scenarios 4 contact angles and 2 ifts are performed on each sub sample since the simulation type is quasi static ift has little to no effect on relative permeability capillary pressure however is affected by both contact angle and interfacial tension in general the dataset can be divided into two sections based on their simulation settings imbibition and drainage relatively speaking the difference between imbibition and drainage simulation results is more significant than the difference between simulations of each section due to the different displacement mechanisms predictions for a selected sub sample are illustrated in fig 5 the model performance was tested for unseen contact angle and interfacial tension parameters with values other than the ones the model trained on for 50 sub samples the effect of 3 contact angles and 3 ifts was investigated a summary of r2 results for different contact angles is in table 5 results demonstrate that the model can both interpolate contact angle between 130 140 and extrapolate contact angle between 20 30 however it is dependent on dataset accuracy it is worth mentioning that poor model performance and accuracy were observed for simulations near the neutral wetting conditions e g contact angle between 100 110 in which the simulations are less accurate 3 3 model sensitivity to pore structure as discussed before 500 sub samples of 12 different sandstones were prepared for this study although the dataset consists of only sandstones the pore geometry of sub samples is fairly diverse as shown in fig 2 minimum maximum and mean value of all predicted relative permeability and capillary pressures at every saturation point illustrated in fig 6 demonstrates that the dataset covers a wide range of values and the model can successfully predict these parameters to further evaluate the performance of the model and investigate possible overfitting we removed all data rows which belong to the berea sister gray bsg rock sample out of the training dataset and added them to the test dataset subsequently we ran the same network architecture on the new training dataset containing 11 out of the 12 sandstones the new results for test dataset are as followed for invading phase relative permeability r2 0 945 for defending phase relative permeability r2 0 971 and for capillary pressure r2 0 906 r2 scores just for unseen samples removed from the training dataset are kri 0 915 krd 0 955 pc 0 899 the results demonstrate that the model was able to achieve high accuracy for an unseen sandstone and is far from overfitting furthermore the pre trained model utilized in this study has been made publicly available for transfer learning purposes 1 1 github repository https github com saeedtelvari 3dcnn 2phaseflow 3 4 sub sample size selection first we tried sub samples with a size of 2003 for creating the dataset however the performance was not satisfactory for invading phase relative permeability and achieved an r2 score of 0 84 for the test dataset the first approach was to define a custom loss function that would increase error whenever there was a violation of the monotonic trend of curves this solution improved the results significantly and increased r2 score to 0 93 furthermore by analyzing invading fluid relative permeability obtained from simulations we found out the software fails to accurately and realistically simulate two phase flow in sub samples that are too small it was expected that by increasing the contact angle the maximum invading fluid relative permeability value increases however this was not the case with smaller sub samples such as 2003 as a result model generalization was not happening and the model failed to predict with better accuracy for sub samples with different simulation settings according to the publisher the software is not guaranteed to produce accurate results for rock samples such as bentheimer that are smaller than 10003 for other rock types the software might even require larger images we analyzed sub samples for sizes 2003 3003 4003 5003 and 10003 and performed two phase simulations for all contact angles from 10 to 170 degrees after analyzing the results it was confirmed that for increasing sub sample size the simulations resulted in more accurate and realistic trends preparing and gathering a large dataset of rock samples with a minimum size of 10003 is extremely challenging therefore after performing sensitivity analysis it was decided to use sub samples with a size of 4003 as they show more logical and realistic trends compared to smaller sub samples and have distinct two phase flow properties consequently model r2 scores for invading phase relative permeability improved by about 0 048 for the test dataset and about 0 02 on average r2 scores for defending phase relative permeability curves were also increased by about 0 02 on average a minor decrease in r2 scores for capillary pressure was observed probably as a consequence of reducing array length from 400 to 100 elements which was done to resolve fluctuating trend of capillary pressure curves 3 5 overall evaluation image processing is a user biased repetitive operations and can take tens of minutes to hours to apply to the image pore network extraction takes 14 s and two phase flow simulation takes about 2 7 s in contrast the proposed model in this study performs the whole procedure for one sub sample in 0 8 s with acceptable accuracy by branching out the last three dense layers of the network for each output dense layers can learn specifically for that output making the model capable of predicting all four outputs in one execution at the expense of the required number of epochs generally for evaluating a deep learning model performance the time it takes for predictions is compared to the time taken by the actual process image processing pore network extraction and modeling training time should be compared to the time taken to develop the algorithm and or the software although the training time cannot be neglected the proposed method does not require manual image processing and once the model is trained predictions will be made in less than a second a possible incident for such complex deep learning networks is overfitting however as discussed in sections 3 2 and 3 3 the results do not indicate signs of overfitting there are two possible factors helping the model to generalize implicit regularization and multi tasking nature of the model regularization is any supplementary technique that aims at making the model generalize better i e produce better results on the test set kukaƒçka et al 2017 implicit regularization is generally described as the preference of optimization algorithms such as adam and sgd to converge to certain minima while avoiding others batch normalization is another example of regularization which helps to reduce the chances of overfitting in deep learning models neyshabur 2017 kukaƒçka et al 2017 multi task learning is typically done using hard or soft parameter sharing of hidden layers in soft parameter sharing each task has its own model with its own parameters the distance between the parameters of the model is then regularized in order to encourage the parameters to be similar hard parameter sharing which is the type of network we utilized in this study is generally applied by sharing the hidden layers between all tasks while keeping several task specific output layers this architecture greatly reduces the risk of overfitting caruna 1993 baxter 1997 a simplified explanation for this is that the model is trying to generalize to a point where it is able to capture all of the tasks which in return lessens the possibility of overfitting measured r2 for the testing dataset is 0 983 for invading phase relative permeability 0 990 for defending phase relative permeability 0 945 for capillary pressure and 0 973 on average for all data values see figs 7 9 and 10 the lowest accuracy belongs to capillary pressure most probably because of the majority of data values being very close to zero residual saturation is primarily used to identify the endpoint of each curve and calculate r2 until that endpoint drainage simulations have residual saturation close to 0 so it did not affect the results much for imbibition situations however this parameter covers a relatively wide range of values overall it showed acceptable accuracy as the r2 score for all data points is 0 991 fig 8 4 conclusion we trained a deep convolutional neural network to predict macroscopic two phase fluid flow characteristics relative permeability and capillary pressure from raw 3d images of rock samples with the ability to differentiate outputs based on their contact angle and interfacial tension during simulation the outputs rely not only on pore geometry but also on physical parameters contact angle and interfacial tension in general the results of the proposed network were promising and it could capture the highly nonlinear relationship between 3d images of real porous rocks and their macroscopic two phase flow parameters the trained network provides reliable estimates for these macroscopic properties in less than a second directly from unprocessed data furthermore the model is capable of predicting four different classes of outputs i e kri krd pc and residual saturation separately which reduces the computation and maintenance cost of running and developing four separate models it is worth mentioning the proposed method is not a replacement for pnm however it is a step towards a general network that can be trained directly on a large dataset from lab evaluation of predictions with physical parameters other than the ones used for training suggests that the model can both interpolate contact angle between 130 140 and extrapolate contact angle between 20 30 however it is dependent on dataset accuracy potentially the same framework could be applied to the data obtained from lab experiments which will require considerable computational power through utilizing multiple gpus for training furthermore a more diverse dataset consisting of carbonates and synthetic porous materials could be used to train a more generalized model credit authorship contribution statement saeed telvari conceptualization

24,multiphase fluid flow within porous media is of great importance in a wide range of environmental and industrial fields such as co2 sequestration geothermal systems fuel cells enhanced oil recovery

1 introduction multiphase flow in porous media describes the underlying physics in many problems with a wide range of environmental and industrial applications such as co2 storage in saline aquifers hydrocarbon production geothermal systems fuel cells and groundwater remediation blunt 2017 zhao et al 2019 blunt et al 2013 at the continuum scale two macroscopic properties relative permeability and capillary pressure are used to model multiphase flow cruichshank et al 2002 alhammadi et al 2020 although experimental analysis is the most accurate method for determining macroscopic fluid flow properties they are extremely time consuming and costly additionally relative permeability and capillary pressure are fundamentally influenced by microscopic scale i e pore scale properties of fluid flow in porous media such as pore geometry wettability and interfacial tensions andrew et al 2014 an alternative method for estimating these properties is by modeling fluid flow physics at the pore scale bakhshian et al 2019 pore scale simulation is a novel technique that can reduce the time required for experiments and lower expenses and manpower substantially it connects and upscales the pore scale properties such as pore geometry and wettability to continuum scale multiphase flow in porous media zhao et al 2019 this technique requires x ray tomography imaging of porous materials image processing and numerical simulations of fluid flow at the pore scale x ray computed tomography is a non destructive method that has been widely accepted for acquiring extremely detailed 3d images of porous media at the pore scale during the image acquisition the sample is illuminated with x rays while being rotated after passing through the sample the x rays are then imaged with a 2d detector with enough projections collected at different angles a 3d image of the sample can be constructed blunt et al 2013 baker et al 2012 andr√§ et al 2013 however because of the influence of the environment hardware and other factors the image is contaminated by noise during acquisition image denoising methods such as non local means buades et al 2005 can be applied to remove noise from the image while preserving the main features of the image e g boundary between pore and matrix diwakar and kumar 2018 fan et al 2019 the next step is segmentation this process partitions the image into groups of voxels belonging to a specified class e g phase or minerals purswani et al 2020 binary segmentation is a common type of segmentation that is used to partition the rock image into void space pores and matrix after image acquisition and processing the image is now prepared for simulation of two phase flow the primary techniques for simulating multiphase flow in porous media are either direct numerical simulation which mostly utilizes the lattice boltzmann method lbm or pore network modeling pnm which is composed of simplified spherical pore cells and tubular throats golparvar et al 2018 blunt et al 2013 gostick et al 2016 huang et al 2020 lbm is more resource intensive hence it can only be applied to small scale images of porous material pnm offers a more lightweight approach but at the expense of accuracy there are two types of pnms quasi static and dynamic quasi static models assume that the flow is driven by capillary forces but dynamic models also consider viscous forces dong and blunt 2009 joekar niasar and hassanizadeh 2012 regaieg and moncorg√© 2017 chen et al 2020 overall rapid estimation of macroscopic two phase flow properties for a digital rock requires imaging the rock sample performing image processing and simulating pore network two phase modeling image processing is a series of user biased recurrent operations which involves a lot of time and requires basic knowledge of the image processing domain o mahony et al 2020 subsequently a simplified pore network model has to be extracted from the segmented image and finally we can simulate two phase fluid flow within the extracted network model the whole procedure is extremely time consuming and requires considerable computational power deep learning can be utilized to accelerate this process deep learning with applications to pore scale imaging and modeling have received a lot of research attention in recent years wang et al 2021a deep learning is a subfield of machine learning that uses a series of multiple layers of processing units to extract high level abstract features from raw data it is suited for analyzing and extracting useful knowledge from both large amounts of data and data collected from different sources goodfellow et al 2016 applications of deep learning in pore scale modeling include image enhancement and de noising wang et al 2019 image segmentation varfolomeev et al 2019 karimpouli and tahmasebi 2019 anon 2020 and prediction of petrophysical properties e g permeability porosity conductivity etc rabbani et al 2020 kamrava et al 2020 rabbani and babaei 2019 tian et al 2021 tembely et al 2020 convolutional neural networks cnns is a subclass of artificial neural networks anns they have been a dominant method in computer vision tasks and hence have been applied to a wide range of problems including object detection face recognition image classification image segmentation and so on zhiqiang and jun 2017 kortli et al 2020 rawat and wang 2017 guo et al 2018 alzubaidi et al 2021 cnn is a mathematical construct that is typically composed of three types of layers or building blocks convolution pooling and often fully connected fc layers the initial two layers namely convolution and pooling layers are responsible for extracting features on the other hand the third layer which is a fully connected layer maps the features extracted from the previous layers to generate the final output yamashita et al 2018 the outstanding advantage of cnn over other classes of deep learning models is the ability to detect important spatial features without any human supervision and bias which allows for the extraction of complex features of the porous medium instead of relying on a human user for feature extraction alzubaidi et al 2021 petrophysical properties prediction using deep learning methods are either feature based or image based models feature based models are lightweight artificial neural networks anns that usually take extracted geometric features from the image such as porosity or surface area image based models are convolutional neural networks cnns that take the image itself as input both feature based and image based models could also be implemented into simulators for acceleration or upscaling flow properties rabbani and babaei 2019 wang et al 2021b najafi et al 2021 sayyafzadeh and gu√©rillot 2022 siavashi et al 2022 the vast majority of the work in this area has focused on single phase flow prediction of absolute permeability feature based models are basically non linear multi variate regression problems linking the geometric properties of porous media to its permeability an early application of deep learning for predicting permeability involved feeding seven geometric features into a densely connected layer with six nodes i e ann which was then used to make the permeability predictions the trained ann was used in conjunction with pnm serving as a surrogate to lbm pnm models used for 2d images of digital rocks rabbani and babaei 2019 zhao et al 2020 this method significantly increases simulation speed with little loss of accuracy however it requires pre processing furthermore later implementations of deep learning techniques on 3d real porous mediums have not been able to achieve high accuracy for prediction of permeability from 3d porous mediums studies have been done on both real and synthetic images tian et al 2021 developed a genetic algorithm ga ann model with nine dense layers which was optimized to predict permeability from 16 geometric features of 3d synthetic rock samples an r2 score of 0 999 was achieved mostly because of the simple geometry and relatively uniform distribution of samples tembely et al 2020 used 3d sub samples extracted from a carbonate rock and used ann cnn and machine learning algorithms to predict permeability they extracted 3 features i e formation factor porosity and permeability obtained from pnm and trained machine learning regression models and ann to map these features to their permeability the cnn however was trained using raw 3d images as its input eliminating pre processing steps to predict permeability results demonstrated that deep learning techniques ann and cnn with an r2 score of 0 91 showed moderately better accuracy than machine learning methods image based models use convolutional layers to extract complex and hidden features of porous media geometry and pass them to dense fc layers to analyze and link these features to their petrophysical properties this method offers a more direct and flexible approach which does not rely on user biased extraction of geometric features wang et al 2021a wu et al 2018 used the voronoi tessellation algorithm to create synthetic 2d images of porous mediums and removed some cells to generate pores the permeability of generated images was then calculated using lbm a cnn with two convolutional layers and three dense layers was then developed to predict permeability furthermore two physical parameters porosity and surface area were given to the last dense layer resulting in higher r2 scores this demonstrated that implementing physical parameters that are related to the output into the network could improve accuracy alqahtani et al 2020 performed a study on predicting porosity mean pore size and surface area from 2d images of sandstones for porosity and surface area they achieved an r2 score of more than 0 9 for binary segmented images and an r2 score of more than 0 75 for grayscale ones estimating mean pore size however was more difficult to predict reaching r2 0 71 for both binary and grayscale images studies have also been done with 3d images as input to the network kamrava et al 2020 was able to achieve an r2 of 0 91 for 500 stochastically generated synthetic samples in a similar study hong and liu 2020 extracted 3158 sandstone sub samples of 1003 from a larger 6503 sample and was able to achieve an r2 score of 0 91 but for real porous media images and wider permeability range extrapolation of model for a different unseen sandstone however returned a lower r2 score of 0 69 alqahtani et al 2021 utilized a more advanced architecture resnet and resnext to predict properties of a broader range of carbonate and sandstone samples with a size of 643 and achieved an r2 of 0 87 moreover due to the broad range of rock types it was able to achieve high accuracy r2 0 86 for a completely unseen sandstone wang et al 2021a zhang et al 2022 used autoencoder based convolutional neural networks ae cnns to predict permeability of low resolution porous mediums the model achieved an r2 score of 0 896 while results from lbm simulations were significantly lower r2 0 42 primarily attributed to the massive numerical errors occurring due to the blurred boundaries of low resolution images rabbani et al 2020 performed a study to predict various petrophysical properties of 3d images by capturing the central axis cross sections in x y and z directions and feeding them into the network as a colored rgb image with three channels this approach reduces computational cost of training directly on 3d images at the expense of higher accuracy and pre processing a total of 30 petrophysical properties 1515 values including relative permeability were predicted achieving an r2 of 0 9385 for all values on the testing dataset in our study on the other hand we focus on prediction of two phase flow properties i e relative permeability and capillary pressure directly from unprocessed real 3d rock images with respect to two physical parameters i e contact angle and ift that affect these properties in the study by siavashi et al 2022 a cnn based framework was presented to upscale multiphase properties for low and high resolution 3d images of rock samples a cnn model was developed to predict multiphase flow properties from sub samples of fontainebleau sandstone however the presented model had the following limitations i image dataset consisted of only one type of sandstone ii multiphase flow simulation settings were constant hence the network was not sensitive to other influencing parameters such as contact angle and interfacial tension and iii four separate models had to be developed to obtain the maximum accuracy in the study to address these limitations we initiated this research to test the feasibility of multiphase flow properties prediction from 3d images of rock samples along with the other influencing parameters contact angle and interfacial tensions using one convolutional neural network model specifically we prepared two datasets of 500 sub samples in grayscale raw and binary segmented formats which are extracted from 12 larger sandstone samples pore network models were extracted from the binary sub samples and eight quasi static waterflooding simulations with different contact angles and interfacial tensions were performed the resulting relative permeability and capillary pressure data were given to the convolutional neural network as output as the raw grayscale images along with their corresponding contact angle and interfacial tension parameters were given to the network as input the designed network architecture allows separate predictions of different outputs within the same network assessment of the trained model demonstrates promising results for predicting macroscopic two phase flow properties from the 3d rock tomographies despite the poor accuracy of the simulation method furthermore it reduced the computation time considerably 2 materials and methods 2 1 overview the main goal of this study is to design and train a convolutional neural network that predicts relative permeability and capillary pressure from 3d images of real porous media and contact angle and interfacial tension data in this section we present the dataset generation which includes the preparation of the 3d Œº ct images dataset and the simulation of two phase flow and then the architecture of the convolutional neural network the general workflow is illustrated in fig 1 2 2 materials 2 2 1 image dataset training deep neural networks requires large datasets therefore hundreds of 3d images are needed for training convolutional neural networks the computational power for simulation increases with the size of the input i e 3d image using smaller sub samples accelerates the simulation substantially however the pore network simulation results will be unreliable and unrealistic not following the established rules of two phase flow if the sub samples are too small the appropriate size depends on rock type pore geometry and the scale at which the image was taken after evaluating and testing different sizes sub samples with 400 3 were created the sandstone rock images were taken from the digital rock portal website images of 12 different sandstones were used in both raw and segmented formats neumann et al 2020 kohanpur et al 2019 all image processing procedures were performed by the publishers of the datasets and we used the results of their work as the images would be more reliable the size of all 12 rock samples is 1000 3 voxels 3d pixels except for mt simon which is 1200 3 raw images are taken from the samples without any image processing image segmentation details for mt simon sample is not mentioned in the website or related papers for the first 11 sandstones after filtering and de noising by the non local means algorithm images were segmented into different regions i e pores and matrix at a threshold calculated using isodata algorithm see table 1 iterative selforganizing data analysis techniques algorithm isodata is an unsupervised classification algorithm originally proposed by ridler and calvard 1978 the algorithm initially estimates a threshold usually set to the image s average intensity value which partitions the histogram into two categories the average intensity values of each class are computed and the resulting threshold is determined as the average of those values the process is repeated iteratively with the new average intensity values until the convergence point is reached between 39 42 sub samples were extracted from each segmented image resulting in a total of 500 sub samples the same procedure was done for raw images creating identical sub samples to segmented ones with their only difference being image processing segmented sub samples were used for pore network extraction and later two phase simulation as raw grayscale ones were fed to the cnn as input further details are summarized in table 1 moreover fig 2 includes sampled 2d cross sections from all rock types 2 2 2 two phase flow simulation to simulate two phase fluid flow through the micro scale porous media pore network modeling pnm method was selected as it is resource efficient and relatively simple to perform compared to lbm the software utilized for this study is developed and published by valvatne and blunt 2004 and written in c we used the waterflooding module for this study the simulation type is quasi static hence the flow regime is capillary dominated the model initializes by increasing invading phase pressure and keeping the defending phase pressure constant resulting in a reduced capillary pressure the three main processes are piston like displacement pore body filling and snap off piston like displacement occurs at pores or throats that has an adjacent element containing invading phase pore body filling is a mechanism that happens only at pores that have at least two invaded neighbor throats snap off occurs when the pore or throat is filled with the non wetting fluid and the wetting fluid in the corner layers swells so much that the fluid fluid interface becomes unstable hence the pore or throat is filled with the wetting phase moreover it utilizes class iii of the morrow model to find the relationship between receding and advancing contact angles morrow 1975 a more detailed description is available in valvatne and blunt 2004 first step in simulating two phase pore network modeling is to extract the pore network model from all sub samples we used software developed and published by raeini et al 2017 which is also written in c this method which is a re write of the maximal ball algorithm by dong and blunt 2009 involves a technique of discretizing the void space into pores and then into half throat corners which are later used to extract network features during this transformation each voxel of the void space is assigned to a distinct pore half throat and corner the corner s properties are extracted from the original image by utilizing a medial axis transformation of the void space and direct single phase flow simulations at varying levels of discretization dong and blunt 2009 raeini et al 2017 eight different simulation scenarios with different contact angles and interfacial tension were performed for all of the 500 sub samples resulting in a total of 4000 simulations details are presented in table 2 for each combination two relative permeability kri and krd and one capillary pressure pc dataset with their corresponding saturation points in the forms of 1d arrays are obtained each simulation models relative permeability and capillary pressure data corresponding to two phase flow with incompressible fluids these datasets were extracted from output files and stored the number of data entries of relative permeability and capillary pressure arrays is not fixed for every simulation and varies between 40 56 data points additionally the saturation range of each simulation is also not fixed because of different residual saturations given a constant dimension should be used for the neural network as it does not allow inconsistent output dimensions a fixed number of saturation points were defined in the range of 0 1 and the values of relative permeability and capillary pressure curves were determined for those points using linear interpolation for the saturation points beyond the residual saturation the remaining elements were equated with the last value of each curve 2 3 methods 2 3 1 cnn architecture the convolutional neural network model presented in this paper is implemented by keras chollet et al 2015 which is a python library for artificial neural networks with tensorflow abadi et al 2015 as the backend overall the cnn architecture consists of four 3d convolutional layers one max pooling layer four single branch fully connected layers and three specific branch fully connected layers for each output the details of this network are shown in table 3 the single branch fc layers learn from the extracted features and after the second layer contact angle and interfacial tension are imported into the network which assists the network in recognizing and understanding the change in output with respect to physical parameters then the results are given to 4 separate branches of fc layers each of these branches leads to a different class of outputs invading fluid relative permeability defending fluid relative permeability capillary pressure and residual saturation this network structure allows neurons to learn specifically for each output and simplify the analysis of training and predictions this types of machine learning models are known as multi task learning in which multiple tasks are simultaneously learned by a shared model see fig 3 the activation function for all dense layers is relu except for output layers and residual saturation branch which is tanh the dataset is split into three parts for training validation and testing sets with the split ratio being 80 10 10 respectively both test and validation dataset are used to evaluate the model validation data is used to evaluate the model while training after every epoch and the test dataset is used after the model is trained for further verification all convolutional layers have a kernel size of 4 and stride of 2 with relu as their activation function the first convolutional layer has 4 filters which doubles in every layer after batch normalization is done on the outputs of second to fourth layers for outputs mean squared error mse equation was used as the loss function and the minimizations were performed by adam algorithm kingma and ba 2014 with a learning rate of 5e 4 it was trained with a batch size of 8 40 epochs on an nvidia quadro gv100 volta graphical processing unit with 16 gb of memory training time per epoch was approximately 30 minutes several callback functions were added to the model to store the model with the lowest validation error monitor and calculate r2 and rmse in every epoch and end the training if the model was not improving after ten rounds the input image and outputs are constrained to 0 1 except for capillary pressure data which is scaled to 1 1 range for model evaluation the coefficient of determinant r2 is calculated for all the datasets as it is considered a standard evaluation metric for regression in addition to evaluating the test dataset randomly picked from the total dataset evaluation was also done for several contact angle and ift values that were not included in the training or testing dataset furthermore the model was trained after removing one of the 12 rock samples out of the training dataset in order to evaluate its performance on an unseen rock sample 2 3 2 post processing moving window averaging is a simple statistics technique for smoothing data trends relative permeability and capillary pressure curves are always ascending or descending given that the model predicts data points independently and is unaware of their relationship the monotonic trend of predictions might be violated at some parts of the curve line to address this problem after performing window averaging data points that violate this rule are equated to the point before after that r2 is calculated for each curve line up to the predicted residual saturation point and not for the whole range these processes slightly improved evaluation parameters i e r2 the original r2 scores for test dataset were kri 0 925 krd 0 986 and pc 0 946 post processing affected invading phase relative permeability the most by increasing its r2 score to 0 983 3 results and discussion in this section cnn development and training the trained model sensitivity to physical parameters contact angle and interfacial tension and pore structure and the selection of sub sample size and its effect on the model will be discussed finally the overall evaluation of the results is presented 3 1 cnn training at first cnn consisted of four main dense layers each containing between 80 to 200 neurons the last layer was connected to 4 separate output layers this architecture was relatively simple and was unable to capture the relationship between input and output properly hence the number of neurons in the main branch increased and more layers were added to each branch until no further improvement was observed the details of the final structure are shown in table 3 tanh was used as an output layer activation function instead of relu to reduce training time since the data values range from minus one to one and so does tanh all other layers use relu except for the dense layers of the residual saturation branch which uses tanh it was observed that if relu were utilized in this branch the model would be unable to learn this parameter we have not yet reached a definitive explanation for this seeing that training a network with larger sub samples requires more gpu memory batch size was reduced to 8 from the initial 64 furthermore training on a model with a customized error function as its loss calculation metric proved to have no superiority over mean squared error this was since simulation accuracy improved with larger sub samples the lowest validation error mean squared error occurred after the 34th of 40 epochs hence it was determined as the best version of the model the final loss values are shown in table 4 as the learning trend for all epochs is illustrated in fig 4 3 2 model sensitivity to contact angle and ift eight simulation scenarios 4 contact angles and 2 ifts are performed on each sub sample since the simulation type is quasi static ift has little to no effect on relative permeability capillary pressure however is affected by both contact angle and interfacial tension in general the dataset can be divided into two sections based on their simulation settings imbibition and drainage relatively speaking the difference between imbibition and drainage simulation results is more significant than the difference between simulations of each section due to the different displacement mechanisms predictions for a selected sub sample are illustrated in fig 5 the model performance was tested for unseen contact angle and interfacial tension parameters with values other than the ones the model trained on for 50 sub samples the effect of 3 contact angles and 3 ifts was investigated a summary of r2 results for different contact angles is in table 5 results demonstrate that the model can both interpolate contact angle between 130 140 and extrapolate contact angle between 20 30 however it is dependent on dataset accuracy it is worth mentioning that poor model performance and accuracy were observed for simulations near the neutral wetting conditions e g contact angle between 100 110 in which the simulations are less accurate 3 3 model sensitivity to pore structure as discussed before 500 sub samples of 12 different sandstones were prepared for this study although the dataset consists of only sandstones the pore geometry of sub samples is fairly diverse as shown in fig 2 minimum maximum and mean value of all predicted relative permeability and capillary pressures at every saturation point illustrated in fig 6 demonstrates that the dataset covers a wide range of values and the model can successfully predict these parameters to further evaluate the performance of the model and investigate possible overfitting we removed all data rows which belong to the berea sister gray bsg rock sample out of the training dataset and added them to the test dataset subsequently we ran the same network architecture on the new training dataset containing 11 out of the 12 sandstones the new results for test dataset are as followed for invading phase relative permeability r2 0 945 for defending phase relative permeability r2 0 971 and for capillary pressure r2 0 906 r2 scores just for unseen samples removed from the training dataset are kri 0 915 krd 0 955 pc 0 899 the results demonstrate that the model was able to achieve high accuracy for an unseen sandstone and is far from overfitting furthermore the pre trained model utilized in this study has been made publicly available for transfer learning purposes 1 1 github repository https github com saeedtelvari 3dcnn 2phaseflow 3 4 sub sample size selection first we tried sub samples with a size of 2003 for creating the dataset however the performance was not satisfactory for invading phase relative permeability and achieved an r2 score of 0 84 for the test dataset the first approach was to define a custom loss function that would increase error whenever there was a violation of the monotonic trend of curves this solution improved the results significantly and increased r2 score to 0 93 furthermore by analyzing invading fluid relative permeability obtained from simulations we found out the software fails to accurately and realistically simulate two phase flow in sub samples that are too small it was expected that by increasing the contact angle the maximum invading fluid relative permeability value increases however this was not the case with smaller sub samples such as 2003 as a result model generalization was not happening and the model failed to predict with better accuracy for sub samples with different simulation settings according to the publisher the software is not guaranteed to produce accurate results for rock samples such as bentheimer that are smaller than 10003 for other rock types the software might even require larger images we analyzed sub samples for sizes 2003 3003 4003 5003 and 10003 and performed two phase simulations for all contact angles from 10 to 170 degrees after analyzing the results it was confirmed that for increasing sub sample size the simulations resulted in more accurate and realistic trends preparing and gathering a large dataset of rock samples with a minimum size of 10003 is extremely challenging therefore after performing sensitivity analysis it was decided to use sub samples with a size of 4003 as they show more logical and realistic trends compared to smaller sub samples and have distinct two phase flow properties consequently model r2 scores for invading phase relative permeability improved by about 0 048 for the test dataset and about 0 02 on average r2 scores for defending phase relative permeability curves were also increased by about 0 02 on average a minor decrease in r2 scores for capillary pressure was observed probably as a consequence of reducing array length from 400 to 100 elements which was done to resolve fluctuating trend of capillary pressure curves 3 5 overall evaluation image processing is a user biased repetitive operations and can take tens of minutes to hours to apply to the image pore network extraction takes 14 s and two phase flow simulation takes about 2 7 s in contrast the proposed model in this study performs the whole procedure for one sub sample in 0 8 s with acceptable accuracy by branching out the last three dense layers of the network for each output dense layers can learn specifically for that output making the model capable of predicting all four outputs in one execution at the expense of the required number of epochs generally for evaluating a deep learning model performance the time it takes for predictions is compared to the time taken by the actual process image processing pore network extraction and modeling training time should be compared to the time taken to develop the algorithm and or the software although the training time cannot be neglected the proposed method does not require manual image processing and once the model is trained predictions will be made in less than a second a possible incident for such complex deep learning networks is overfitting however as discussed in sections 3 2 and 3 3 the results do not indicate signs of overfitting there are two possible factors helping the model to generalize implicit regularization and multi tasking nature of the model regularization is any supplementary technique that aims at making the model generalize better i e produce better results on the test set kukaƒçka et al 2017 implicit regularization is generally described as the preference of optimization algorithms such as adam and sgd to converge to certain minima while avoiding others batch normalization is another example of regularization which helps to reduce the chances of overfitting in deep learning models neyshabur 2017 kukaƒçka et al 2017 multi task learning is typically done using hard or soft parameter sharing of hidden layers in soft parameter sharing each task has its own model with its own parameters the distance between the parameters of the model is then regularized in order to encourage the parameters to be similar hard parameter sharing which is the type of network we utilized in this study is generally applied by sharing the hidden layers between all tasks while keeping several task specific output layers this architecture greatly reduces the risk of overfitting caruna 1993 baxter 1997 a simplified explanation for this is that the model is trying to generalize to a point where it is able to capture all of the tasks which in return lessens the possibility of overfitting measured r2 for the testing dataset is 0 983 for invading phase relative permeability 0 990 for defending phase relative permeability 0 945 for capillary pressure and 0 973 on average for all data values see figs 7 9 and 10 the lowest accuracy belongs to capillary pressure most probably because of the majority of data values being very close to zero residual saturation is primarily used to identify the endpoint of each curve and calculate r2 until that endpoint drainage simulations have residual saturation close to 0 so it did not affect the results much for imbibition situations however this parameter covers a relatively wide range of values overall it showed acceptable accuracy as the r2 score for all data points is 0 991 fig 8 4 conclusion we trained a deep convolutional neural network to predict macroscopic two phase fluid flow characteristics relative permeability and capillary pressure from raw 3d images of rock samples with the ability to differentiate outputs based on their contact angle and interfacial tension during simulation the outputs rely not only on pore geometry but also on physical parameters contact angle and interfacial tension in general the results of the proposed network were promising and it could capture the highly nonlinear relationship between 3d images of real porous rocks and their macroscopic two phase flow parameters the trained network provides reliable estimates for these macroscopic properties in less than a second directly from unprocessed data furthermore the model is capable of predicting four different classes of outputs i e kri krd pc and residual saturation separately which reduces the computation and maintenance cost of running and developing four separate models it is worth mentioning the proposed method is not a replacement for pnm however it is a step towards a general network that can be trained directly on a large dataset from lab evaluation of predictions with physical parameters other than the ones used for training suggests that the model can both interpolate contact angle between 130 140 and extrapolate contact angle between 20 30 however it is dependent on dataset accuracy potentially the same framework could be applied to the data obtained from lab experiments which will require considerable computational power through utilizing multiple gpus for training furthermore a more diverse dataset consisting of carbonates and synthetic porous materials could be used to train a more generalized model credit authorship contribution statement saeed telvari conceptualization
