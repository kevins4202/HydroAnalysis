9965,since freshwater shortage is common in most regions of the world saline water has been used to irrigate a wide range of crop species however continuous saline water irrigation can easily lead to soil degradation and reductions in crop yields in this study we measured the effects of various carbon rich amendments cras on soil quality plant nutrient uptake crop yields and tomato quality under continuous saline water irrigation the treatments considered were i untreated soils irrigated with freshwater control ii untreated soils irrigated with saline water sw iii soils treated with straw c and irrigated with saline water sw sc iv soils treated with biochar c and irrigated with saline water sw bc v soils treated with nano c and irrigated with saline water sw nc and vi soils treated with composted straw c and irrigated with saline water sw cc soil quality was comprehensively evaluated using a soil quality index sqi covering a wide range of physicochemical and microbial properties in general continuous saline water irrigation resulted in adverse effects on soil quality e g enhanced sodium adsorption ratio reduced nutrient availability and decreased microbial activities functions and tomato growth e g the reduction of plant biomass and fruit yield however these adverse effects were efficiently alleviated by the application of cras specifically all four cras increased sqi under continuous saline water irrigation there were significantly p 0 001 and positively relationships between sqi and crop productivity e g fruit yield and plant biomass the application of straw c or nano c mainly increased crop yields while the application of biochar c or composted straw c primarily improved fruit quality overall the application of straw c resulted in not only the highest sqi but also the highest fruit yield while the application of biochar c strongly enhanced overall fruit quality under continuous saline water irrigation keywords saline water irrigation soil degradation carbon rich amendments soil quality tomato growth fruit quality 1 introduction irrigation water is one of the most critical resources for agricultural production generally to maintain high crop yields it is necessary to provide enough irrigation water for plants to meet their water requirement during the growing period uddameri et al 2020 it is estimated that approximately 70 of the total global freshwater withdrawals are driven by irrigated agriculture representing the largest contributor to human water consumption chen et al 2019 however freshwater shortage is a common problem in most regions of the world because of the uneven spatial distribution of water resources across the globe the abuse of water usage the expansion of industries and agriculture environmental pollution and the rapidly increasing population mekonnen and hoekstra 2016 dalin et al 2017 ma et al 2020 consequently the conflict between freshwater shortage and agricultural water demand has become an important factor threatening human food security therefore it is essential to look for alternatives to freshwater resources which can be used for irrigation to meet agricultural water requirement although regional freshwater scarcity is a significant and growing problem saline water is widely distributed around the world and represents one of the major stocks of water on earth van weert et al 2009 gleick and palaniappan 2010 because of the freshwater shortage saline water has been used to irrigate a wide range of crop species e g barely cotton sugar beet sorghum alfalfa spinach potato and maize hussain et al 2020 generally irrigation with saline water can not only provide a direct source of water for plants but also improve fruit quality through decreasing water content and increasing nutritional components in fruits ben ahmed et al 2009 li et al 2019 despite that saline water is a double edged sword for crop production because it may also lead to decrease in crop yields by inducing salinization in soils and thereby salt stress in plants beltr√°n 1999 de pascale et al 2015 thus preventing soil salinization occurring during saline water irrigation is critical for the sustainable usage of saline water for crop production one efficient method for prevention and mitigation of soil salinization is to treat soils with carbon c rich amendments cras e g biochar and straw farhangi abriz and torabian 2018 xie et al 2020 since soil salinization can easily lead to the loss of soil organic c setia et al 2013 an important measure of soil quality that directly affects plant growth and health wong et al 2010 lal 2015 the addition of cras to soils offers six main advantages in terms of soil salinization mitigation i increasing salt leaching by improving soil porosity and hydraulic conductivity yue et al 2016 ii decreasing salt concentration in soil solution by inhibiting soil water evaporation and adsorbing salts on the surface of cras saifullah et al 2018 iii enhancing the replacement of na by ca2 at the exchange sites by increasing ca2 adsorbed on the soil colloids because ca2 can interact strongly with the oxygen containing functional groups on the cra surface luo et al 2017 zheng et al 2018 iv enhancing soil ph buffering capacity by increasing cation exchange capacity and surface area of soil particles hinsinger et al 2003 saifullah et al 2018 v stabilizing soil structure by improving structure building processes such as aggregation fletcher et al 2014 and vi stimulating the growth of soil microorganisms that are capable of alleviating soil salinity and plant salt stress through providing these microorganisms with labile c sources zheng et al 2018 to date several cras such as biochar straw and straw compost have been used to improve salt affected soils and alleviate plant salt stress saifullah et al 2018 xie et al 2020 meena et al 2016 for instance saifullah et al 2018 reviewed that biochar can alleviate salt stress in plants through decreasing na concentration in soil solutions due to the sorption of na salts by biochar xie et al 2020 observed that straw application reduced soil degradation due to salinization by enhancing soil aggregate formation and stability meena et al 2016 demonstrated that straw compost could inhibit soil salinization by promoting biological e g microbial biomass carbon and enzyme activities and chemical e g electrical conductivity and nutrient availability properties of saline soils despite these advances most of the reported studies fletcher et al 2014 meena et al 2016 saifullah et al 2018 focused on only one type of cra without comprehensively comparing the advantages and disadvantages of various cras and were conducted under short term a few weeks or months and small scale small size pots laboratory or greenhouse conditions without investigating the effects of cra on soil properties and plant growth under continuous saline water irrigation moreover nanocarbon a novel cra capable of improving soil and water quality yarima et al 2020 has not yet been reported in studies regarding saline water irrigation although cras have been increasingly used to mitigate soil salinization zheng et al 2018 saifullah et al 2018 xie et al 2020 it is still needed to comprehensively evaluate and compare the differences in soil salinity mitigating efficiency among various cras e g straw c biochar c nano c and composted straw c by simultaneously investigating soil quality plant growth crop yields and fruit quality furthermore little information is available regarding the efficiency and effectiveness of various cras under long term being longer than a few months continuous saline water irrigation fletcher et al 2014 meena et al 2016 saifullah et al 2018 tomato solanum lycopersicum l an economically important crop grown in most regions of the world including freshwater scarce regions is generally characterized by a long growing season with high water requirements yet comprehensive evaluation of effects of various cras on tomato production under continuous saline water irrigation can be meaningful to water saving agriculture therefore in this study an experimental trial under greenhouse conditions was carried out over three years with four successive tomato cropping seasons to investigate the effects of various cras i e straw biochar nanocarbon and straw compost on tomato production under continuous saline water irrigation the efficiencies of various cras were comprehensively evaluated by simultaneously measuring overall soil quality plant nutrient uptake crop yields and fruit quality the main objectives of this study were 1 to compare the different efficiencies of straw biochar nanocarbon and straw compost if used as soil amendments under continuous saline water irrigation and 2 to reveal the potential mechanisms underlying cra induced alleviation of adverse effects of saline water irrigation on soil quality and crop productivity 2 materials and methods 2 1

jingfan t1602 seedlings with four true leaves were transplanted into the field by hand with the planting density of 4 0 plants m 2 before transplanting the tomato seedlings each plot was irrigated with freshwater 350 m3 ha 1 in order to leach the salt accumulated in the soil profile from the previous crop and thereby to benefit seedling survival and the growth of the next crop during the growing season tomato plants were fertilized using one third strength yamazaki nutrient solution ns yamazaki 1982 and were irrigated with a drip irrigation system consisting of a water flow meter a

from 0 34 to 1 52 l day 1 depending on the plant growth stage and environmental conditions the irrigation amount was 4620 4447 5058 and 5594 m3 ha 1 in the first second third and fourth css respectively 2 2 soil properties and overall soil quality assessment soils were sampled in late october 2018 mid may 2019 late october 2019 and mid may 2020 following the harvest of the first second third and fourth css respectively six soil cores 0 30 cm depth were randomly collected near crop roots in each replicate plot soil ph 1 2 5 soil to water ratio and electrical conductivity ec 1 5 soil to water ratio were analyzed using a ph meter fe28 mettler toledo shanghai china and an ec meter fe30 mettler toledo shanghai china respectively soil organic matter was measured by the dichromate oxidation and titration method kalembasa and jenkinson 1973 soil available n ammonium n and nitrate n was analyzed using a continuous flowing analyzer traacs2000 usa houba et al 2000 while available p and k were determined by the molybdenum blue colorimetry olsen et al 1954 and the flame photometry carson 1980 respectively soluble cations k na ca2 and mg2 and anions so4 2 cl hco3 and co3 2 were analyzed using the methods described by rowell 1994 sodium adsorption ratio sar was calculated using the equation sar cna cca cmg 2 1 2 murtaza et al 2006 where cna cca and cmg present the concentrations of the water soluble na ca2 and mg2 in mmol kg 1 respectively the exchangeable cations were extracted from soils with 1 m nh4oac ph 7 and measured using an inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectrometry icp aes then the exchangeable sodium percentage esp was calculated according to the following equation esp c na c na c k c ca c mg 100 where c na c k c ca and c mg present the concentrations of the exchangeable na k ca2 and mg2 in cmol kg 1 respectively soil total n was determined using the micro kjeldahl method bremner 1965 and total p k ca mg s b cu fe mn zn and mo were determined after nitric acid digestion followed by analysis by icp aes jones et al 1991 soil microbial activities and functions were assessed by two approaches including the enzyme activity assessment and the microbial c catabolic profile assay for the enzyme activity assessment soil phosphatase urease sucrase and catalase were determined by the phosphomonoester hydrolysis substrate phenylphosphate urea hydrolysis substrate urea carbohydrate hydrolysis substrate sucrose and coupled oxidation substrate hydrogen peroxide tabatabai 1994 respectively the microbial c catabolic profile assay was carried out by using a biolog system containing 31 sole carbon sources and a water blank biolog inc hayward ca usa choi and dobbs 1999a 1999b the average well color development awcd was calculated based on plate readings at 96 h of incubation the shortest incubation time that allowed the best treatment resolution the carbon sources were subdivided into six substrate guilds including carbohydrates ch miscellaneous mi carboxylic acids ca amino acids aa amides amines am and polymers pl the shannon weaver diversity index h was calculated by the equation as described in tian et al 2013 in addition a non metric multidimensional scaling nmds was performed to visualize data associated with the microbial c catabolic profile assay mccune and grace 2002 to evaluate the overall quality of the soil a soil quality index sqi was calculated by integrating key soil quality indicators ksqis using the method described by zhang et al 2020 briefly soil quality related parameters i e ph ec ions and their rations sar esp nutrients enzymes and microbial metabolic functions were used to establish a minimum dataset mds of ksqis based on principal component analysis pca the sqi was calculated using the equation sqi œÉ i 1 n s i w i where w i and s i present the pc weighting factor and the indicator score for variable i respectively it was assumed that higher sqi meant better overall soil quality 2 3 plant parameters plants were sampled randomly from 12 plants in each replicate plot plant samples were washed with deionized water separated into roots stems and leaves and then dried at 85 for 2 days until a constant weight was reached the dried plant tissue samples were grinded and passed through a 0 5 mm sieve to determine nutrient element contents plant total n was determined by the dumas method horneck and miller 1998 and total p k ca mg s b cu fe mn zn and mo were measured after nitric acid digestion followed by analysis by inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectrometry icp aes jones et al 1991 moreover soluble cations k na and ca2 in the plant tissues were measured by the methods described in walker and bernal 2008 since the interactions among ions in the plant tissues influence plant adaptability to salt stress the ratios of k na and ca2 na two important plant salt tolerance related parameters were also calculated ashraf 2004 2 4 fruit yield fruit quality and overall fruit quality assessment tomato fruits were picked and weighed following conventional harvest practice to obtain fruit yield when daily fruit production was very high nine fresh fruits were randomly sampled from each replication to measure fruit quality total soluble solid ss was measured using an atago n1 refractometer atago co ltd japan and vitamin c vc was determined by the 2 6 dichloroindophenol titrimetric method aoac 1984 total soluble sugar su was measured by the anthrone colorimetry spiro 1966 and organic acid oa was determined using the potentiometric titration method as described in rouphael et al 2008 in addition fructose ft sucrose sr and glucose gc were measured by the amperometric flow injection analysis with immobilized enzyme reactors matsumoto et al 1988 to evaluate the overall quality of the tomato fruit a fruit quality index fqi was calculated by integrating key fruit quality indicators within each fruit quality indicator every observation was transformed to a 0 1 scale to obtain the indicator score y according to the equation y x s t s whereas x is the raw value of the fruit quality indicator and s and t present the lowest and highest values respectively the fqi was calculated using the equation fqi œÉ i 1 n y i where y i presents the indicator score for variable i it was assumed that higher fqi meant better overall fruit quality 2 5 statistical analysis statistical analysis was carried out with spss 19 0 spss inc chicago usa both soil properties and plant parameters were analyzed by two way anova analysis of variance with the factors treatment t cropping season cs and the interaction of t cs when the anova indicated a significant f value p 0 05 for treatments multiple comparisons using the tukey s test were done correlation analysis and the pca for sqi development were performed using spss 19 0 pearson s correlation coefficients r were derived based on pearson correlations to reflect the relationships between soil properties and crop productivity related parameters fruit yields and plant biomass and between sqi and plant salt tolerance related parameters plant cations and their ratios a linear regression analysis was conducted to test the relationship between the sqi and plant productivity related parameters in addition plant nutrient uptake and fruit quality related parameters were visualized as radar charts all parameters were normalized using the corresponding values under the control 3 results 3 1 soil ph salinity and nutrients soil ph and ec a measure of soil salinity were significantly affected by t cs and the t cs interaction all p 0 001 table 1 in general soil ph was significantly p 0 05 increased by sw compared to the control in all four css fig 1a inferring that saline water had the potential to stimulate soil alkalization however it was significantly p 0 05 decreased by sw sc and sw cc in the first cs by sw bc in the first three css and by sw nc in the first two css as compared to sw fig 1a it was noted that sw sc and sw nc showed higher soil ph in the fourth and third css respectively when compared to sw these results indicate that biochar c was more effective than other cras in alleviating soil alkalization induced by saline water irrigation similar to soil ph soil ec was also generally increased by sw compared to the control fig 1a indicating that saline water irrigation enhanced the occurrence of soil salinization despite that when compared to sw soil ec was significantly p 0 05 reduced by sw sc in the first second and fourth css and by sw nc and sw cc in the first cs fig 1a this suggests that straw c had a greater capacity than other cras in the prevention of soil salinization under saline water irrigation interestingly although biochar had lower ec than other cras table s1 soil ec was significantly p 0 05 higher in sw bc compared to sw in the first three css fig 1a all tested soil nutrients organic matter available nutrients and macro and micro nutrients were significantly affected by t all p 0 001 table 1 specifically soil organic matter was significantly p 0 05 decreased by sw compared to the control in the first cs in spite of this it was increased by sw sc in the fourth cs by sw bc in the first and fourth css by sw nc in all four css and by sw cc in the third and fourth css as compared to sw table 2 indicating the promoting effect of cras on the restoration of soil organic matter under saline water irrigation similar to soil organic matter available nutrients were generally increased by the application of cras under sw conditions table 2 for instance available n was significantly p 0 05 higher under sw nc in the first cs and under sw bc and sw cc in the third cs while available p was higher under sw sc in the first third and fourth css under sw bc in the first second and fourth css and under sw cc in the second and third css when compared to sw moreover available k was significantly p 0 05 increased by the application of all cras under saline water irrigation in the fourth cs compare sw sc sw bc sw nc and sw cc vs sw table 2 soil macro and micro nutrients under different treatments are presented in fig s1 overall contents of total k ca b fe mn and zn generally showed descending trends under saline water irrigation but these adverse effects could be alleviated by the application of all cras 3 2 soil ions ion ratios and sodium adsorption ratio soil ions except mg2 ion ratios sodium adsorption ratio sar and exchangeable sodium percentage esp were significantly affected by t cs and the t cs interaction all p 0 01 table 1 generally significant effects of saline water irrigation on soil ions were reflected mainly in soil na which was statistically p 0 05 higher under sw than under the control in all four css table 2 this leads to significantly lower k na and ca2 na ratios fig 1b but higher sar and esp fig 1a for sw compared to the control unexpectedly however cras generally had a limited capacity to reduce sw induced na accumulation in soils specifically a significant decrease in soil na was observed only for sw sc and sw nc compared to sw in the first cs table 2 furthermore sw nc even increased soil na in the second and third css when compared to sw despite that in most situations soil k ca2 and mg2 increased for sw sc sw bc and sw nc compared to sw table 2 resulting in a significant decrease in both sar and esp in all four css compare sw sc sw bc and sw nc vs sw fig 1a 3 3 soil microbial activities and functions soil enzymes under different treatments are presented in fig s2 overall all tested soil enzymes i e phosphatase urease sucrase and catalase were reduced by saline water irrigation compare sw vs control however these adverse effects were generally alleviated by the application of cras compare cra related treatments vs sw the response of microbial c catabolic profiles to saline water irrigation and cra application was complex and various in different css fig 2a in spite of this saline water irrigation generally decreased the microbial utilization of 31 sole carbon sources fig 2a resulting in a reduction in the utilization of carbohydrates ch miscellaneous mi carboxylic acids ca amino acids aa amides amines am and polymers pl fig 2b and the microbial richness awcd and diversity h of carbon utilization fig 2c particularly in the fourth cs compare sw vs control however these negative impacts were reduced in varying degrees by the application of cras compare cra related treatments vs sw fig 2b c indicating that cras enhanced the utilization patterns of c sources by microbes under saline water irrigation moreover the nmds plots based on microbial c catabolic profiles showed a clear separation among cra related treatments in each cs fig 2d suggesting that various cras regulated microbial c catabolic profiles in different ways 3 4 plant cations cation ratios and nutrient uptake exchangeable cations na k and ca2 and their ratios in both shoots and roots were significantly influenced by t cs and the t cs interaction all p 0 01 table 1 in general the na concentrations except for shoot na in the fourth cs in shoot and roots were increased while the k concentrations except for shoot k in the first cs were decreased by sw compared to control fig 3a similar to plant na the ca2 concentrations except for shoot k in the first cs in roots were also higher under sw than under the control however the increasing rate of ca2 was obviously lower than that of na these results lead to a significant decrease in the k na and ca2 na ratios in plant tissues under the sw treatment fig 3a however the negative effects of sw on plant k na and ca2 na ratios could be reduced though not always by the application of cras in particular when compared to sw sw sc and sw bc showed higher k na ratio in both shoots and roots in the second and third css and higher ca2 na ratio in roots in the second third and fourth css fig 3a this suggests that straw c and biochar c might be more efficient than nano c and composted straw c in mitigating na toxicity in plants under saline water irrigation similar to exchangeable cations nutrient uptake in plants was significantly influenced by t cs and the t cs interaction all p 0 05 table 1 overall saline water irrigation and cra application had both positive and negative effects on nutrient uptake in plants and these effects were also strongly influenced by cs fig 3b as a result it was hard to find a general trend for plant nutrient uptake among treatments notably however in most situations nutrient uptake in plants was reduced by saline water irrigation compare sw vs control fig 3b for instance the uptake of most macro nutrients e g n p k mg and s and micro nutrients e g b cu mn and mo in both shoots and roots was obviously lower under sw than under the control in the first second and fourth css despite that nutrient uptake in plants was enhanced by the application of cras under saline water irrigation compare cra related treatments vs sw fig 3b particularly the uptake of almost all nutrients e g n p k ca mg s b cu fe mn zn and mo in shoots was generally higher in sw sc sw bc sw nc and sw cc treatments than sw treatment especially in the second third and fourth css moreover it was noted that the sw sc treatment generally exhibited the highest efficiency in terms of nutrient uptake especially in the first three css 3 5 crop productivity and overall soil quality assessment crop productivity related parameters i e fruit yield and plant biomass were significantly influenced by t cs and the t cs interaction all p 0 05 table 1 generally the fruit yield was significantly p 0 05 decreased by sw compared to the control in the third and fourth css fig 4a resulting in a significant reduction in the total fruit yield of four css under the sw treatment fig 4b however when compared to sw the fruit yield was significantly p 0 05 increased by sw sc in the first third and fourth css by sw nc in the first and fourth css and by sw cc in the first cs fig 4a on average the total fruit yield of four css was increased by 21 1 5 1 11 4 and 9 2 for sw sc sw bc sw nc and sw cc respectively when compared to sw fig 4b similarly the average biomass of four css was significantly p 0 05 higher in sw sc sw bc sw nc and sw cc treatments than sw treatment with average increases of 24 4 16 3 17 4 and 12 9 respectively fig 4b it is worth noting that no significant p 0 05 differences in both the total fruit yield and average biomass of four css were found between sw sc and the control fig 4b to further evaluate the response of crop productivity to overall soil quality the sqi was assessed by integrating key soil quality indicators that were significantly correlated with fruit yield or plant biomass fig 4c for which 26 soil quality parameters were used for pca analysis table 3 key indicators included in the mds were sar esp ca2 na and urease for pc1 ca aa pl and awcd for pc2 ec available k and k for pc3 fe for pc4 cl for pc5 and s for pc6 table 3 similar to crop productivity related parameters the sqi was significantly decreased by sw compared to the control but was increased by all cra related treatments compared to sw fig 4d notably no significant p 0 05 difference in sqi was found between sw sc and the control fig 4d these results indicate that the application of cras straw c in particular enhanced overall soil quality and thereby crop productivity under saline water irrigation indeed the sqi was significantly and positively correlated with fruit yield fig 4e plant biomass fig 4f and most plant salt tolerance related parameters k na and ca2 na ratios in both shoots and roots fig 4g all p 0 001 3 6 fruit quality and overall fruit quality assessment the effects of t cs and their interaction on fruit quality related parameters were generally significant all p 0 01 table 1 overall in most situations the sw related treatments showed higher contents of soluble solid ss vitamin c vc soluble sugar su organic acid oa fructose ft sucrose sr and glucose gc when compared to the control fig 5a it is noteworthy that the fqi a measure of overall fruit quality was significantly p 0 05 increased by all sw related treatments compared to the control fig 5b particularly the highest fqi was generally observed under sw bc suggesting that biochar c had a greater capacity than other cras in the promotion of overall fruit quality under saline water irrigation 4 discussion in regions characterized by freshwater shortage irrigation with saline water is inevitable for crop production saline water has the potential to meet most water requirements of crops but it can lead to soil salinization and thereby crop yield reduction after continuous irrigation ahmed et al 2009 de pascale et al 2015 li et al 2019 our present study clearly showed that various cras had different efficiencies in alleviating soil salinization and plant salt stress under continuous saline water irrigation figs 1 3 and 4 specifically straw c was the best cra to enhance overall soil quality under continuous saline water irrigation fig 4d in addition straw c and nano c mainly increased crop yields fig 4a b while biochar c and composted straw c primarily improved fruit quality fig 5a b continuous saline water irrigation led to obvious adverse effects on soil quality fig 4d such as the enhancement of salinity expressed by ec and exchangeable sodium expressed by esp fig 1a and the reduction of microbial activities and functions figs 2 and s2 since exchangeable sodium in the soil solution and at the exchange sites contribute to repulsive charges that disperse clay particles lakhdar et al 2009 elevated levels of exchangeable sodium have detrimental impacts on soil structure and cause an increase in dispersed clay levy and torrento 1995 however under continuous saline water irrigation exchangeable sodium was significantly decreased by the application of cras especially straw c biochar c and nano c fig 1a this could be because i additions of cras to sodic soils enhanced the stability of soil aggregates in water and reduced the tendency of clay to disperse barzegar et al 1997 or ii cras can aid the dispersion of sodic soils while suppressing exchangeable sodium induced swelling of aluminosilicate clay minerals in soil solutions churchman et al 1993 it was noted that biochar application resulted in an overall increase in soil ec under saline water irrigation compare sw bc vs sw fig 1a this could be explained by the biochar induced increase of water soluble ions e g k na ca2 and mg2 in soils igalavithana et al 2017 notably various types of cras exhibited different efficiency and effectiveness in terms of reducing exchangeable sodium fig 1a clearly biochar c and nano c belong to recalcitrant c that is less palatable to microbes while straw c and composted straw c can be regarded as labile c that can be easily utilized by microbes pan et al 2016 ndzelu et al 2020 thus although the benefits of cras in terms of saline soil restoration are closely associated with physical and chemical effects e g promotion of clay mineral flocculation formation of larger water stable aggregates reduction of bulk density enhancement of soil porosity and aeration and thereby acceleration of na leaching lakhdar et al 2009 dahlawi et al 2018 microbial effects are non negligible factors leading to the difference in salinity mitigating efficiency among various cras our results clearly showed that the application of cras reduced the adverse effects of saline water irrigation on microbial activities and functions figs 2 and s2 and that various cras regulated microbial functions in different ways fig 2d for instance in the fourth cs biochar c mainly enhanced the microbial utilization of miscellaneous mi while composted straw c primarily promoted the microbial utilization of polymers pl under saline water irrigation fig 2d the enhancement of microbial utilization of mi was coupled to the stimulation of bacteria capable of degrading miscellaneous compounds kolton et al 2017 here there are important consequences for the mitigation of salinity induced soil degradation because most miscellaneous compounds have detrimental effects on plant growth and its defense systems calabrese and blain 2009 with respect to pl it has been widely used as salt absorbents to decrease na and cl levels in salt soils and as soil amendments to benefit plants in terms of salt stress tolerance chen et al 2014 in addition to cations soil anions were also significantly affected by cra application under saline water irrigation table 1 clearly soil so4 2 was generally increased by biochar c and nano c rather than straw c and composted straw c table 1 since biochar c and nano c belong to recalcitrant c that is less palatable to microbes as compared to straw c and composted straw c pan et al 2016 ndzelu et al 2020 the biochar c and nano c induced enhancements in soil so4 2 concentration could be attributed to the high salt adsorbing capacity of these two cras saifullah et al 2018 this could be partly supported by the results reported by igalavithana et al 2017 who found that the application of recalcitrant c e g biochar could lead to an increase in the concentration of water soluble ions in soils in contrast to so4 2 hco3 and co3 2 were decreased by biochar c and nano c but not straw c and composted straw c under saline water irrigation in the second and third css table 2 this explains why biochar c and nano c generally reduced soil ph under saline waster irrigation fig 1a because hco3 and co3 2 are the most important ions that determine soil alkalinity grant 2006 although all soil anions were significantly influenced by the application of cras tables 1 and 2 only cl which was significantly negatively correlated with fruit yields fig 4c had an obvious effect on soil quality table 3 however cras generally had limited capacity to alleviate saline water induced increase in soil cl table 2 this could be due to the limited capacity of cras to adsorb cl on their surfaces saifullah et al 2018 zheng et al 2018 overall the application of cras reduced the adverse effects of saline water irrigation on soil nutrients e g organic matter available nutrients and total k ca b fe mn and zn table 2 and fig s1 this can be explained by the fact that i cras can serve as additional sources of nutrients e g organic matte n p and k table s1 which can directly improve soil nutrient levels table 2 and ii cras can increase soil cation exchange capacity and surface area which are closely related to soil nutrient level hinsinger et al 2003 saifullah et al 2018 zhang et al 2020 furthermore the elevated soil nutrient level could be partly explained by the cra induced enhancements in soil enzymes e g phosphatase urease sucrase and catalase fig s2 it has been demonstrated that soil phosphatase urease sucrase and catalase have a specific role in the p n and c cycles of saline soils frankenberger and bingham 1982 clearly both soil nutrients especially available k and enzymes especially urease were closely associated with soil quality table 3 as well as fruit yields fig 4c thus the cra induced improvements in soil nutrients and enzymes made profound contributions to soil quality related to crop yields although most previous studies regarding saline water irrigation focused mainly on the mitigation of soil salinization which can lead to salt stress in plants ben ahmed et al 2009 de pascale et al 2015 hussain et al 2020 our present study emphasized the importance of overall soil quality in regulating plant growth under saline water irrigation fig 4e g clearly sqi a valuable index that can reflect the overall soil quality covering a wide range of physicochemical and microbial properties table 3 was strongly associated with both crop productivity and plant salt tolerance under saline water irrigation fig 4e g indeed salinity can induce various types of soil degradations such as compaction inhibited aeration depletion of nutrient and soil organic carbon pool and reduction of microbial activities and functions in addition to salinization lakhdar et al 2009 dahlawi et al 2018 based on the sqi straw c was the best cra to mitigate the adverse effects of saline water irrigation on soil quality followed by nano c biochar c and composted straw c fig 4d the saline water irrigation induced reduction in overall soil quality exhibited obvious adverse effects on tomato growth such as the reduction of plant biomass and fruit yield compared sw vs control fig 4b however the application of cras significantly improved overall soil quality fig 4d resulting in the enhancement of plant growth under continuous saline water irrigation fig 4e f generally plant response to improved soil quality is mainly reflected in the increase of k na and ca2 na ratios in plant tissues because high k na and ca2 na ratios in plants are two important physiological selection criteria for plant salt tolerance ashraf 2004 chinnusamy et al 2005 zhu 2016 in the present study cra application resulted in increases in both k na and ca2 na ratios in plant tissues under continuous saline water irrigation fig 3a this fact comes as no surprise since the efficiency of cras in enhancing plant k and ca2 absorption has been sufficiently proven walker and bernal 2008 lakhdar et al 2009 reasonable amounts of both k and ca2 are required to maintain the structural and functional integrity of plant membranes under salt stress ashraf 2004 chinnusamy et al 2005 zhu 2016 moreover ca2 plays a crucial role in cell wall stabilization and regulation of ion transport ashraf 2004 zhu et al 2016 it was noted that straw c and biochar c were more efficient than nano c and composted straw c in increasing k na and ca2 na ratios in plant tissues under saline water irrigation fig 3a thus straw c and biochar c had higher na toxicity alleviating efficiency than nano c and composted straw c since straw c and biochar c were more efficient than nano c and composted straw c in reducing na concentration in shoots the sw sc and sw bc treatments generally had higher k na ratio in shoots than the sw nc and sw cc treatments especially in the last three css fig 3a it has been widely demonstrated that plant response to salt is closely associated with shoot k na ratio and a relatively high level of shoot k na ratio is critical for plants to adopt salinity zhu et al 2016 van zelm et al 2020 it was noted that under continuous saline water irrigation straw c and nano c mainly increased crop yields fig 4b while biochar c and composted straw c primarily improved fruit quality fig 5b this could be explained by the trade off between crop yield and fruit quality waltz 2015 li et al 2019 the improvement of fruit quality could be attributed to the decreases in water content or increases in nutritional components in fruits ben ahmed et al 2009 li et al 2019 notably under continuous saline water irrigation although biochar c and composted straw c improved overall fruit quality fig 5b they did not significantly reduce total fruit yields compare sw bc and sw cc vs sw fig 4b thus the combination of saline water irrigation and biochar c composted straw c application can be used to produce high quality tomato 5 conclusions all four cras could efficiently improve the overall soil quality under continuous saline water irrigation the improvement of overall soil quality could result in the enhancement of crop productivity e g fruit yield and plant biomass as well as plant salt tolerance e g k na and ca2 na ratios in plant tissues under saline water irrigation the application of straw c or nano c mainly increased crop yields while the application of biochar c or composted straw c primarily improved fruit

9965,since freshwater shortage is common in most regions of the world saline water has been used to irrigate a wide range of crop species however continuous saline water irrigation can easily lead to soil degradation and reductions in crop yields in this study we measured the effects of various carbon rich amendments cras on soil quality plant nutrient uptake crop yields and tomato quality under continuous saline water irrigation the treatments considered were i untreated soils irrigated with freshwater control ii untreated soils irrigated with saline water sw iii soils treated with straw c

rich amendments soil quality tomato growth fruit quality 1 introduction irrigation water is one of the most critical resources for agricultural production generally to maintain high crop yields it is necessary to provide enough irrigation water for plants to meet their water requirement during the growing period uddameri et al 2020 it is estimated that approximately 70 of the total global freshwater withdrawals are driven by irrigated agriculture representing the largest contributor to human water consumption chen et al 2019 however freshwater shortage is a common problem in most regions of the world because of the uneven spatial distribution of water resources across the globe the abuse of water usage the expansion of industries and agriculture environmental pollution and the rapidly increasing population mekonnen and hoekstra 2016 dalin et al 2017 ma et al 2020 consequently the conflict between freshwater shortage and agricultural water demand has become an important factor threatening human food security therefore it is essential to look for alternatives to freshwater resources which can be used for irrigation to meet agricultural water requirement although regional freshwater scarcity is a significant and growing problem saline water is widely distributed around the world and represents one of the major stocks of water on earth van weert et al 2009 gleick and palaniappan 2010 because of the freshwater shortage saline water has been used to irrigate a wide range of crop species e g barely cotton sugar beet sorghum alfalfa spinach potato and maize hussain et al 2020 generally irrigation with saline water can not only provide a direct source of water for plants but also improve fruit quality through decreasing water content and increasing nutritional components in fruits ben ahmed et al 2009 li et al 2019 despite that saline water is a double edged sword for crop production because it may also lead to decrease in crop yields by inducing salinization in soils and thereby salt stress in plants beltr√°n 1999 de pascale et al 2015 thus preventing soil salinization occurring during saline water irrigation is critical for the sustainable usage of saline water for crop production one efficient method for prevention and mitigation of soil salinization is to treat soils with carbon c rich amendments cras e g biochar and straw farhangi abriz and torabian 2018 xie et al 2020 since soil salinization can easily lead to the loss of soil organic c setia et al 2013 an important measure of soil quality that directly affects plant growth and health wong et al 2010 lal 2015 the addition of cras to soils offers six main advantages in terms of soil salinization mitigation i increasing salt leaching by improving soil porosity and hydraulic conductivity yue et al 2016 ii decreasing salt concentration in soil solution by inhibiting soil water evaporation and adsorbing salts on the surface of cras saifullah et al 2018 iii enhancing the replacement of na by ca2 at the exchange sites by increasing ca2 adsorbed on the soil colloids because ca2 can interact strongly with the oxygen containing functional groups on the cra surface luo et al 2017 zheng et al 2018 iv enhancing soil ph buffering capacity by increasing cation exchange capacity and surface area of soil particles hinsinger et al 2003 saifullah et al 2018 v stabilizing soil structure by improving structure building processes such as aggregation fletcher et al 2014 and vi stimulating the growth of soil microorganisms that are capable of alleviating soil salinity and plant salt stress through providing these microorganisms with labile c sources zheng et al 2018 to date several cras such as biochar straw and straw compost have been used to improve salt affected soils and alleviate plant salt stress saifullah et al 2018 xie et al 2020 meena et al 2016 for instance saifullah et al 2018 reviewed that biochar can alleviate salt stress in plants through decreasing na concentration in soil solutions due to the sorption of na salts by biochar xie et al 2020 observed that straw application reduced soil degradation due to salinization by enhancing soil aggregate formation and stability meena et al 2016 demonstrated that straw compost could inhibit soil salinization by promoting biological e g microbial biomass carbon and enzyme activities and chemical e g electrical conductivity and nutrient availability properties of saline soils despite these advances most of the reported studies fletcher et al 2014 meena et al 2016 saifullah et al 2018 focused on only one type of cra without comprehensively comparing the advantages and disadvantages of various cras and were conducted under short term a few weeks or months and small scale small size pots laboratory or greenhouse conditions without investigating the effects of cra on soil properties and plant growth under continuous saline water irrigation moreover nanocarbon a novel cra capable of improving soil and water quality yarima et al 2020 has not yet been reported in studies regarding saline water irrigation although cras have been increasingly used to mitigate soil salinization zheng et al 2018 saifullah et al 2018 xie et al 2020 it is still needed to comprehensively evaluate and compare the differences in soil salinity mitigating efficiency among various cras e g straw c biochar c nano c and composted straw c by simultaneously investigating soil quality plant growth crop yields and fruit quality furthermore little information is available regarding the efficiency and effectiveness of various cras under long term being longer than a few months continuous saline water irrigation fletcher et al 2014 meena et al 2016 saifullah et al 2018 tomato solanum lycopersicum l an economically important crop grown in most regions of the world including freshwater scarce regions is generally characterized by a long growing season with high water requirements yet comprehensive evaluation of effects of various cras on tomato production under continuous saline water irrigation can be meaningful to water saving agriculture therefore in this study an experimental trial under greenhouse conditions was carried out over three years with four successive tomato cropping seasons to investigate the effects of various cras i e straw biochar nanocarbon and straw compost on tomato production under continuous saline water irrigation the efficiencies of various cras were comprehensively evaluated by simultaneously measuring overall soil quality plant nutrient uptake crop yields and fruit quality the main objectives of this study were 1 to compare the different efficiencies of straw biochar nanocarbon and straw compost if used as soil amendments under continuous saline water irrigation and 2 to reveal the potential mechanisms underlying cra induced alleviation of adverse effects of saline water irrigation on soil quality and crop productivity 2 materials and methods 2 1

between the replicate plots was 1 0 m each replicate plot was separated from the adjacent replicate plots by plastic films buried vertically in soils to a depth of 80 cm tomato solanum lycopersicum l jingfan t1602 seedlings with four true leaves were transplanted into the field by hand with the planting density of 4 0 plants m 2 before transplanting the tomato seedlings each plot was irrigated with freshwater 350 m3 ha 1 in order to leach the salt accumulated in the soil profile from the previous crop and thereby to benefit seedling survival and the growth of the next crop during the growing season tomato plants were fertilized using one third strength yamazaki nutrient solution ns yamazaki 1982 and were irrigated with a drip irrigation system consisting of a water flow meter a

from 0 34 to 1 52 l day 1 depending on the plant growth stage and environmental conditions the irrigation amount was 4620 4447 5058 and 5594 m3 ha 1 in the first second third and fourth css respectively 2 2 soil properties and overall soil quality assessment soils were sampled in late october 2018 mid may 2019 late october 2019 and mid may 2020 following the harvest of the first second third and fourth css respectively six soil cores 0 30 cm depth were randomly collected near crop roots in each replicate plot soil ph 1 2 5 soil to water ratio and electrical conductivity ec 1 5 soil to water ratio were analyzed using a ph meter fe28 mettler toledo shanghai china and an ec meter fe30 mettler toledo shanghai china respectively soil organic matter was measured by the dichromate oxidation and titration method kalembasa and jenkinson 1973 soil available n ammonium n and nitrate n was analyzed using a continuous flowing analyzer traacs2000 usa houba et al 2000 while available p and k were determined by the molybdenum blue colorimetry olsen et al 1954 and the flame photometry carson 1980 respectively soluble cations k na ca2 and mg2 and anions so4 2 cl hco3 and co3 2 were analyzed using the methods described by rowell 1994 sodium adsorption ratio sar was calculated using the equation sar cna cca cmg 2 1 2 murtaza et al 2006 where cna cca and cmg present the concentrations of the water soluble na ca2 and mg2 in mmol kg 1 respectively the exchangeable cations were extracted from soils with 1 m nh4oac ph 7 and measured using an inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectrometry icp aes then the exchangeable sodium percentage esp was calculated according to the following equation esp c na c na c k c ca c mg 100 where c na c k c ca and c mg present the concentrations of the exchangeable na k ca2 and mg2 in cmol kg 1 respectively soil total n was determined using the micro kjeldahl method bremner 1965 and total p k ca mg s b cu fe mn zn and mo were determined after nitric acid digestion followed by analysis by icp aes jones et al 1991 soil microbial activities and functions were assessed by two approaches including the enzyme activity assessment and the microbial c catabolic profile assay for the enzyme activity assessment soil phosphatase urease sucrase and catalase were determined by the phosphomonoester hydrolysis substrate phenylphosphate urea hydrolysis substrate urea carbohydrate hydrolysis substrate sucrose and coupled oxidation substrate hydrogen peroxide tabatabai 1994 respectively the microbial c catabolic profile assay was carried out by using a biolog system containing 31 sole carbon sources and a water blank biolog inc hayward ca usa choi and dobbs 1999a 1999b the average well color development awcd was calculated based on plate readings at 96 h of incubation the shortest incubation time that allowed the best treatment resolution the carbon sources were subdivided into six substrate guilds including carbohydrates ch miscellaneous mi carboxylic acids ca amino acids aa amides amines am and polymers pl the shannon weaver diversity index h was calculated by the equation as described in tian et al 2013 in addition a non metric multidimensional scaling nmds was performed to visualize data associated with the microbial c catabolic profile assay mccune and grace 2002 to evaluate the overall quality of the soil a soil quality index sqi was calculated by integrating key soil quality indicators ksqis using the method described by zhang et al 2020 briefly soil quality related parameters i e ph ec ions and their rations sar esp nutrients enzymes and microbial metabolic functions were used to establish a minimum dataset mds of ksqis based on principal component analysis pca the sqi was calculated using the equation sqi œÉ i 1 n s i w i where w i and s i present the pc weighting factor and the indicator score for variable i respectively it was assumed that higher sqi meant better overall soil quality 2 3 plant parameters plants were sampled randomly from 12 plants in each replicate plot plant samples were washed with deionized water separated into roots stems and leaves and then dried at 85 for 2 days until a constant weight was reached the dried plant tissue samples were grinded and passed through a 0 5 mm sieve to determine nutrient element contents plant total n was determined by the dumas method horneck and miller 1998 and total p k ca mg s b cu fe mn zn and mo were measured after nitric acid digestion followed by analysis by inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectrometry icp aes jones et al 1991 moreover soluble cations k na and ca2 in the plant tissues were measured by the methods described in walker and bernal 2008 since the interactions among ions in the plant tissues influence plant adaptability to salt stress the ratios of k na and ca2 na two important plant salt tolerance related parameters were also calculated ashraf 2004 2 4 fruit yield fruit quality and overall fruit quality assessment tomato fruits were picked and weighed following conventional harvest practice to obtain fruit yield when daily fruit production was very high nine fresh fruits were randomly sampled from each replication to measure fruit quality total soluble solid ss was measured using an atago n1 refractometer atago co ltd japan and vitamin c vc was determined by the 2 6 dichloroindophenol titrimetric method aoac 1984 total soluble sugar su was measured by the anthrone colorimetry spiro 1966 and organic acid oa was determined using the potentiometric titration method as described in rouphael et al 2008 in addition fructose ft sucrose sr and glucose gc were measured by the amperometric flow injection analysis with immobilized enzyme reactors matsumoto et al 1988 to evaluate the overall quality of the tomato fruit a fruit quality index fqi was calculated by integrating key fruit quality indicators within each fruit quality indicator every observation was transformed to a 0 1 scale to obtain the indicator score y according to the equation y x s t s whereas x is the raw value of the fruit quality indicator and s and t present the lowest and highest values respectively the fqi was calculated using the equation fqi œÉ i 1 n y i where y i presents the indicator score for variable i it was assumed that higher fqi meant better overall fruit quality 2 5 statistical analysis statistical analysis was carried out with spss 19 0 spss inc chicago usa both soil properties and plant parameters were analyzed by two way anova analysis of variance with the factors treatment t cropping season cs and the interaction of t cs when the anova indicated a significant f value p 0 05 for treatments multiple comparisons using the tukey s test were done correlation analysis and the pca for sqi development were performed using spss 19 0 pearson s correlation coefficients r were derived based on pearson correlations to reflect the relationships between soil properties and crop productivity related parameters fruit yields and plant biomass and between sqi and plant salt tolerance related parameters plant cations and their ratios a linear regression analysis was conducted to test the relationship between the sqi and plant productivity related parameters in addition plant nutrient uptake and fruit quality related parameters were visualized as radar charts all parameters were normalized using the corresponding values under the control 3 results 3 1 soil ph salinity and nutrients soil ph and ec a measure of soil salinity were significantly affected by t cs and the t cs interaction all p 0 001 table 1 in general soil ph was significantly p 0 05 increased by sw compared to the control in all four css fig 1a inferring that saline water had the potential to stimulate soil alkalization however it was significantly p 0 05 decreased by sw sc and sw cc in the first cs by sw bc in the first three css and by sw nc in the first two css as compared to sw fig 1a it was noted that sw sc and sw nc showed higher soil ph in the fourth and third css respectively when compared to sw these results indicate that biochar c was more effective than other cras in alleviating soil alkalization induced by saline water irrigation similar to soil ph soil ec was also generally increased by sw compared to the control fig 1a indicating that saline water irrigation enhanced the occurrence of soil salinization despite that when compared to sw soil ec was significantly p 0 05 reduced by sw sc in the first second and fourth css and by sw nc and sw cc in the first cs fig 1a this suggests that straw c had a greater capacity than other cras in the prevention of soil salinization under saline water irrigation interestingly although biochar had lower ec than other cras table s1 soil ec was significantly p 0 05 higher in sw bc compared to sw in the first three css fig 1a all tested soil nutrients organic matter available nutrients and macro and micro nutrients were significantly affected by t all p 0 001 table 1 specifically soil organic matter was significantly p 0 05 decreased by sw compared to the control in the first cs in spite of this it was increased by sw sc in the fourth cs by sw bc in the first and fourth css by sw nc in all four css and by sw cc in the third and fourth css as compared to sw table 2 indicating the promoting effect of cras on the restoration of soil organic matter under saline water irrigation similar to soil organic matter available nutrients were generally increased by the application of cras under sw conditions table 2 for instance available n was significantly p 0 05 higher under sw nc in the first cs and under sw bc and sw cc in the third cs while available p was higher under sw sc in the first third and fourth css under sw bc in the first second and fourth css and under sw cc in the second and third css when compared to sw moreover available k was significantly p 0 05 increased by the application of all cras under saline water irrigation in the fourth cs compare sw sc sw bc sw nc and sw cc vs sw table 2 soil macro and micro nutrients under different treatments are presented in fig s1 overall contents of total k ca b fe mn and zn generally showed descending trends under saline water irrigation but these adverse effects could be alleviated by the application of all cras 3 2 soil ions ion ratios and sodium adsorption ratio soil ions except mg2 ion ratios sodium adsorption ratio sar and exchangeable sodium percentage esp were significantly affected by t cs and the t cs interaction all p 0 01 table 1 generally significant effects of saline water irrigation on soil ions were reflected mainly in soil na which was statistically p 0 05 higher under sw than under the control in all four css table 2 this leads to significantly lower k na and ca2 na ratios fig 1b but higher sar and esp fig 1a for sw compared to the control unexpectedly however cras generally had a limited capacity to reduce sw induced na accumulation in soils specifically a significant decrease in soil na was observed only for sw sc and sw nc compared to sw in the first cs table 2 furthermore sw nc even increased soil na in the second and third css when compared to sw despite that in most situations soil k ca2 and mg2 increased for sw sc sw bc and sw nc compared to sw table 2 resulting in a significant decrease in both sar and esp in all four css compare sw sc sw bc and sw nc vs sw fig 1a 3 3 soil microbial activities and functions soil enzymes under different treatments are presented in fig s2 overall all tested soil enzymes i e phosphatase urease sucrase and catalase were reduced by saline water irrigation compare sw vs control however these adverse effects were generally alleviated by the application of cras compare cra related treatments vs sw the response of microbial c catabolic profiles to saline water irrigation and cra application was complex and various in different css fig 2a in spite of this saline water irrigation generally decreased the microbial utilization of 31 sole carbon sources fig 2a resulting in a reduction in the utilization of carbohydrates ch miscellaneous mi carboxylic acids ca amino acids aa amides amines am and polymers pl fig 2b and the microbial richness awcd and diversity h of carbon utilization fig 2c particularly in the fourth cs compare sw vs control however these negative impacts were reduced in varying degrees by the application of cras compare cra related treatments vs sw fig 2b c indicating that cras enhanced the utilization patterns of c sources by microbes under saline water irrigation moreover the nmds plots based on microbial c catabolic profiles showed a clear separation among cra related treatments in each cs fig 2d suggesting that various cras regulated microbial c catabolic profiles in different ways 3 4 plant cations cation ratios and nutrient uptake exchangeable cations na k and ca2 and their ratios in both shoots and roots were significantly influenced by t cs and the t cs interaction all p 0 01 table 1 in general the na concentrations except for shoot na in the fourth cs in shoot and roots were increased while the k concentrations except for shoot k in the first cs were decreased by sw compared to control fig 3a similar to plant na the ca2 concentrations except for shoot k in the first cs in roots were also higher under sw than under the control however the increasing rate of ca2 was obviously lower than that of na these results lead to a significant decrease in the k na and ca2 na ratios in plant tissues under the sw treatment fig 3a however the negative effects of sw on plant k na and ca2 na ratios could be reduced though not always by the application of cras in particular when compared to sw sw sc and sw bc showed higher k na ratio in both shoots and roots in the second and third css and higher ca2 na ratio in roots in the second third and fourth css fig 3a this suggests that straw c and biochar c might be more efficient than nano c and composted straw c in mitigating na toxicity in plants under saline water irrigation similar to exchangeable cations nutrient uptake in plants was significantly influenced by t cs and the t cs interaction all p 0 05 table 1 overall saline water irrigation and cra application had both positive and negative effects on nutrient uptake in plants and these effects were also strongly influenced by cs fig 3b as a result it was hard to find a general trend for plant nutrient uptake among treatments notably however in most situations nutrient uptake in plants was reduced by saline water irrigation compare sw vs control fig 3b for instance the uptake of most macro nutrients e g n p k mg and s and micro nutrients e g b cu mn and mo in both shoots and roots was obviously lower under sw than under the control in the first second and fourth css despite that nutrient uptake in plants was enhanced by the application of cras under saline water irrigation compare cra related treatments vs sw fig 3b particularly the uptake of almost all nutrients e g n p k ca mg s b cu fe mn zn and mo in shoots was generally higher in sw sc sw bc sw nc and sw cc treatments than sw treatment especially in the second third and fourth css moreover it was noted that the sw sc treatment generally exhibited the highest efficiency in terms of nutrient uptake especially in the first three css 3 5 crop productivity and overall soil quality assessment crop productivity related parameters i e fruit yield and plant biomass were significantly influenced by t cs and the t cs interaction all p 0 05 table 1 generally the fruit yield was significantly p 0 05 decreased by sw compared to the control in the third and fourth css fig 4a resulting in a significant reduction in the total fruit yield of four css under the sw treatment fig 4b however when compared to sw the fruit yield was significantly p 0 05 increased by sw sc in the first third and fourth css by sw nc in the first and fourth css and by sw cc in the first cs fig 4a on average the total fruit yield of four css was increased by 21 1 5 1 11 4 and 9 2 for sw sc sw bc sw nc and sw cc respectively when compared to sw fig 4b similarly the average biomass of four css was significantly p 0 05 higher in sw sc sw bc sw nc and sw cc treatments than sw treatment with average increases of 24 4 16 3 17 4 and 12 9 respectively fig 4b it is worth noting that no significant p 0 05 differences in both the total fruit yield and average biomass of four css were found between sw sc and the control fig 4b to further evaluate the response of crop productivity to overall soil quality the sqi was assessed by integrating key soil quality indicators that were significantly correlated with fruit yield or plant biomass fig 4c for which 26 soil quality parameters were used for pca analysis table 3 key indicators included in the mds were sar esp ca2 na and urease for pc1 ca aa pl and awcd for pc2 ec available k and k for pc3 fe for pc4 cl for pc5 and s for pc6 table 3 similar to crop productivity related parameters the sqi was significantly decreased by sw compared to the control but was increased by all cra related treatments compared to sw fig 4d notably no significant p 0 05 difference in sqi was found between sw sc and the control fig 4d these results indicate that the application of cras straw c in particular enhanced overall soil quality and thereby crop productivity under saline water irrigation indeed the sqi was significantly and positively correlated with fruit yield fig 4e plant biomass fig 4f and most plant salt tolerance related parameters k na and ca2 na ratios in both shoots and roots fig 4g all p 0 001 3 6 fruit quality and overall fruit quality assessment the effects of t cs and their interaction on fruit quality related parameters were generally significant all p 0 01 table 1 overall in most situations the sw related treatments showed higher contents of soluble solid ss vitamin c vc soluble sugar su organic acid oa fructose ft sucrose sr and glucose gc when compared to the control fig 5a it is noteworthy that the fqi a measure of overall fruit quality was significantly p 0 05 increased by all sw related treatments compared to the control fig 5b particularly the highest fqi was generally observed under sw bc suggesting that biochar c had a greater capacity than other cras in the promotion of overall fruit quality under saline water irrigation 4 discussion in regions characterized by freshwater shortage irrigation with saline water is inevitable for crop production saline water has the potential to meet most water requirements of crops but it can lead to soil salinization and thereby crop yield reduction after continuous irrigation ahmed et al 2009 de pascale et al 2015 li et al 2019 our present study clearly showed that various cras had different efficiencies in alleviating soil salinization and plant salt stress under continuous saline water irrigation figs 1 3 and 4 specifically straw c was the best cra to enhance overall soil quality under continuous saline water irrigation fig 4d in addition straw c and nano c mainly increased crop yields fig 4a b while biochar c and composted straw c primarily improved fruit quality fig 5a b continuous saline water irrigation led to obvious adverse effects on soil quality fig 4d such as the enhancement of salinity expressed by ec and exchangeable sodium expressed by esp fig 1a and the reduction of microbial activities and functions figs 2 and s2 since exchangeable sodium in the soil solution and at the exchange sites contribute to repulsive charges that disperse clay particles lakhdar et al 2009 elevated levels of exchangeable sodium have detrimental impacts on soil structure and cause an increase in dispersed clay levy and torrento 1995 however under continuous saline water irrigation exchangeable sodium was significantly decreased by the application of cras especially straw c biochar c and nano c fig 1a this could be because i additions of cras to sodic soils enhanced the stability of soil aggregates in water and reduced the tendency of clay to disperse barzegar et al 1997 or ii cras can aid the dispersion of sodic soils while suppressing exchangeable sodium induced swelling of aluminosilicate clay minerals in soil solutions churchman et al 1993 it was noted that biochar application resulted in an overall increase in soil ec under saline water irrigation compare sw bc vs sw fig 1a this could be explained by the biochar induced increase of water soluble ions e g k na ca2 and mg2 in soils igalavithana et al 2017 notably various types of cras exhibited different efficiency and effectiveness in terms of reducing exchangeable sodium fig 1a clearly biochar c and nano c belong to recalcitrant c that is less palatable to microbes while straw c and composted straw c can be regarded as labile c that can be easily utilized by microbes pan et al 2016 ndzelu et al 2020 thus although the benefits of cras in terms of saline soil restoration are closely associated with physical and chemical effects e g promotion of clay mineral flocculation formation of larger water stable aggregates reduction of bulk density enhancement of soil porosity and aeration and thereby acceleration of na leaching lakhdar et al 2009 dahlawi et al 2018 microbial effects are non negligible factors leading to the difference in salinity mitigating efficiency among various cras our results clearly showed that the application of cras reduced the adverse effects of saline water irrigation on microbial activities and functions figs 2 and s2 and that various cras regulated microbial functions in different ways fig 2d for instance in the fourth cs biochar c mainly enhanced the microbial utilization of miscellaneous mi while composted straw c primarily promoted the microbial utilization of polymers pl under saline water irrigation fig 2d the enhancement of microbial utilization of mi was coupled to the stimulation of bacteria capable of degrading miscellaneous compounds kolton et al 2017 here there are important consequences for the mitigation of salinity induced soil degradation because most miscellaneous compounds have detrimental effects on plant growth and its defense systems calabrese and blain 2009 with respect to pl it has been widely used as salt absorbents to decrease na and cl levels in salt soils and as soil amendments to benefit plants in terms of salt stress tolerance chen et al 2014 in addition to cations soil anions were also significantly affected by cra application under saline water irrigation table 1 clearly soil so4 2 was generally increased by biochar c and nano c rather than straw c and composted straw c table 1 since biochar c and nano c belong to recalcitrant c that is less palatable to microbes as compared to straw c and composted straw c pan et al 2016 ndzelu et al 2020 the biochar c and nano c induced enhancements in soil so4 2 concentration could be attributed to the high salt adsorbing capacity of these two cras saifullah et al 2018 this could be partly supported by the results reported by igalavithana et al 2017 who found that the application of recalcitrant c e g biochar could lead to an increase in the concentration of water soluble ions in soils in contrast to so4 2 hco3 and co3 2 were decreased by biochar c and nano c but not straw c and composted straw c under saline water irrigation in the second and third css table 2 this explains why biochar c and nano c generally reduced soil ph under saline waster irrigation fig 1a because hco3 and co3 2 are the most important ions that determine soil alkalinity grant 2006 although all soil anions were significantly influenced by the application of cras tables 1 and 2 only cl which was significantly negatively correlated with fruit yields fig 4c had an obvious effect on soil quality table 3 however cras generally had limited capacity to alleviate saline water induced increase in soil cl table 2 this could be due to the limited capacity of cras to adsorb cl on their surfaces saifullah et al 2018 zheng et al 2018 overall the application of cras reduced the adverse effects of saline water irrigation on soil nutrients e g organic matter available nutrients and total k ca b fe mn and zn table 2 and fig s1 this can be explained by the fact that i cras can serve as additional sources of nutrients e g organic matte n p and k table s1 which can directly improve soil nutrient levels table 2 and ii cras can increase soil cation exchange capacity and surface area which are closely related to soil nutrient level hinsinger et al 2003 saifullah et al 2018 zhang et al 2020 furthermore the elevated soil nutrient level could be partly explained by the cra induced enhancements in soil enzymes e g phosphatase urease sucrase and catalase fig s2 it has been demonstrated that soil phosphatase urease sucrase and catalase have a specific role in the p n and c cycles of saline soils frankenberger and bingham 1982 clearly both soil nutrients especially available k and enzymes especially urease were closely associated with soil quality table 3 as well as fruit yields fig 4c thus the cra induced improvements in soil nutrients and enzymes made profound contributions to soil quality related to crop yields although most previous studies regarding saline water irrigation focused mainly on the mitigation of soil salinization which can lead to salt stress in plants ben ahmed et al 2009 de pascale et al 2015 hussain et al 2020 our present study emphasized the importance of overall soil quality in regulating plant growth under saline water irrigation fig 4e g clearly sqi a valuable index that can reflect the overall soil quality covering a wide range of physicochemical and microbial properties table 3 was strongly associated with both crop productivity and plant salt tolerance under saline water irrigation fig 4e g indeed salinity can induce various types of soil degradations such as compaction inhibited aeration depletion of nutrient and soil organic carbon pool and reduction of microbial activities and functions in addition to salinization lakhdar et al 2009 dahlawi et al 2018 based on the sqi straw c was the best cra to mitigate the adverse effects of saline water irrigation on soil quality followed by nano c biochar c and composted straw c fig 4d the saline water irrigation induced reduction in overall soil quality exhibited obvious adverse effects on tomato growth such as the reduction of plant biomass and fruit yield compared sw vs control fig 4b however the application of cras significantly improved overall soil quality fig 4d resulting in the enhancement of plant growth under continuous saline water irrigation fig 4e f generally plant response to improved soil quality is mainly reflected in the increase of k na and ca2 na ratios in plant tissues because high k na and ca2 na ratios in plants are two important physiological selection criteria for plant salt tolerance ashraf 2004 chinnusamy et al 2005 zhu 2016 in the present study cra application resulted in increases in both k na and ca2 na ratios in plant tissues under continuous saline water irrigation fig 3a this fact comes as no surprise since the efficiency of cras in enhancing plant k and ca2 absorption has been sufficiently proven walker and bernal 2008 lakhdar et al 2009 reasonable amounts of both k and ca2 are required to maintain the structural and functional integrity of plant membranes under salt stress ashraf 2004 chinnusamy et al 2005 zhu 2016 moreover ca2 plays a crucial role in cell wall stabilization and regulation of ion transport ashraf 2004 zhu et al 2016 it was noted that straw c and biochar c were more efficient than nano c and composted straw c in increasing k na and ca2 na ratios in plant tissues under saline water irrigation fig 3a thus straw c and biochar c had higher na toxicity alleviating efficiency than nano c and composted straw c since straw c and biochar c were more efficient than nano c and composted straw c in reducing na concentration in shoots the sw sc and sw bc treatments generally had higher k na ratio in shoots than the sw nc and sw cc treatments especially in the last three css fig 3a it has been widely demonstrated that plant response to salt is closely associated with shoot k na ratio and a relatively high level of shoot k na ratio is critical for plants to adopt salinity zhu et al 2016 van zelm et al 2020 it was noted that under continuous saline water irrigation straw c and nano c mainly increased crop yields fig 4b while biochar c and composted straw c primarily improved fruit quality fig 5b this could be explained by the trade off between crop yield and fruit quality waltz 2015 li et al 2019 the improvement of fruit quality could be attributed to the decreases in water content or increases in nutritional components in fruits ben ahmed et al 2009 li et al 2019 notably under continuous saline water irrigation although biochar c and composted straw c improved overall fruit quality fig 5b they did not significantly reduce total fruit yields compare sw bc and sw cc vs sw fig 4b thus the combination of saline water irrigation and biochar c composted straw c application can be used to produce high quality tomato 5 conclusions all four cras could efficiently improve the overall soil quality under continuous saline water irrigation the improvement of overall soil quality could result in the enhancement of crop productivity e g fruit yield and plant biomass as well as plant salt tolerance e g k na and ca2 na ratios in plant tissues under saline water irrigation the application of straw c or nano c mainly increased crop yields while the application of biochar c or composted straw c primarily improved fruit quality overall straw c was the best cra used to enhance not only the overall soil quality but also tomato fruit yields while biochar c was the best cra used to enhance overall fruit quality under

9966,the study of water flow and root uptake under the soil is especially important in subsurface drip irrigation the main objective of this study was to measure water flow and root uptake under the soil in subsurface drip irrigation and simulation based on different scenarios in hydrus 2d the field experiment was carried out in a land around a 30 year old apple tree with a 2 m 2 m plot in 2018 the emitters were installed at a depth of 30 cm and a distance of 1 m from the tree trunk the soil water content was measured using a tdr device it was measured daily for 4 months at the depths of 25 50 75 and 100 cm in order to calibrate the root equation parameters the samples of root with soil were collected from different parts of the root development zone the results showed that the highest and lowest root water uptake occurred in the coordinates radial deep 60 cm 50 cm and 150 cm 75 cm from the tree trunk respectively approximately 81 of the root uptake was at a depth of 0 50 cm and only 19 was at a depth below 50 cm the calculated rmse 0 0141 0 0193 cm3cm 3 showed that hydrus 2d had a good estimate from of the soil water content in subsurface drip irrigation comparison of different simulated scenarios by hydrus 2d with the results of the field measurements showed that by decreasing the emitter discharge to 2 lit h 1 and increasing the irrigation duration in the constant amount of water used the root water uptake was raised by 5 08 and while deep penetration was decreased by 2 18 as compared to the real condition keywords subsurface drip irrigation root water uptake hydrus 2d 1 introduction subsurface irrigation is one of the irrigation methods mainly used in arid regions due to its low manufacturing cost and high water use efficiency bainbridge 2001 in this irrigation system which has been commonly practiced by buried pots pitchers and porous pipes stein 1997 abu zreig and atoum 2004 siyal et al 2013 due to the diffusion of water under the soil seasonal evapotranspiration of the crop etc can be reduced by 39 in comparison with the sprinkler irrigation system valent√≠n et al 2019 also enhancing the delivery of water and nutrients directly entering into the root zone mohammad et al 2014 is another advantage of subsurface drip irrigation sdi as compared to surface drip irrigation this could enhance irrigation water savings while maintaining a satisfactory production level costa et al 2007 al omran et al 2010 2012 the proper design of sdi requires knowledge of water distribution patterns around those emitters matching the root extraction patterns minimizing the wetting of the soil subsurface and deep percolation cote et al 2003 kandelous et al 2011 subbaiah 2013 field experiments are useful for determining the proper management of irrigation however because of the high cost and time consuming nature of the field experiments the use of simulation models of water movement in the soil is recommended honari et al 2017 in order to efficiently design and manage sdi systems several models have been developed to describe water flow from a point or line source in the soil khalifa et al 2004 singh et al 2006 one of these models is the hydrus software package simunek et al 2008 this model if well calibrated with the measured data can have an appropriate simulation of the water content and root water uptake under the soil skaggs et al 2004 lazarovitch et al 2005 provenzano 2007 zhou et al 2007 kandelous and simunek 2010a 2010b ramos et al 2012 azad et al 2018 there are however few studies on the measurement and simulation of the soil water content and the root water uptake in subsurface irrigation different studies have shown that the initial soil water content and the dimensions of the wetted pattern are increased with extending the irrigation time besharat et al 2010 zhijuan et al 2018 provenzano 2007 for instance evaluated the wetted soil volume in subsurface drip irrigation using hydrus 2d the investigation carried out in a sandy loam soil showed that the model could well simulate the infiltration processes around an emitter during irrigation elmaloglou and diamantopoulos 2009 also found that in the subsurface drip irrigation at a time equal to the total simulation time the discharge rate had no effect on the actual transpiration and soil evaporation with a small effect on deep percolation in this research the numerical results obtained by hydrus showed that when the soil evaporation was neglected the soil water was more easily taken up by the plant roots cai et al 2017 also studied the soil water movement under subsurface irrigation using a porous ceramic emitter the field results indicated that hydrus 2d could be used to investigate the suitable parameters for the ceramic emitter in subsurface irrigation systems and to determine the suitable arrangement and operation mode of the ceramic emitter further autovino et al 2018 studied the wetting pattern of the soil under surface and subsurface drip irrigation in some silty loam soil they introduced the volume of the wetting pattern as a function of irrigation time soil initial condition and emitter discharge comparison of the measured and predicted potential means showed that the hydrus model could be used as a powerful tool for designing and managing subsurface drip irrigation systems saefuddin et al 2019 also conducted field experiments on tomatoes and strawberries using a subsurface irrigation system and simulated the results using the field data in the hydrus model simulation results demonstrated that hydrus could serve as a useful tool to analyze soil water dynamics around the buried ring shaped emitter when using the subsurface water arbat et al 2020 also performed a field experiment using sdi for rice production and simulated it by applying hydrus 2d the results showed that the drip line depth of 0 15 m combined with one or two daily irrigations maximized the water extraction and reduced percolation also hydrus 2d could be useful for the proper management of the rice drip irrigation system the results of various studies have therefore shown that the most field experiments and simulations have been conducted in surface drip irrigation and less attention has been given to the subsurface drip irrigation a review of previous studies also reveals that the effect of the simultaneous management of the emitter discharge and irrigation duration on the root water uptake and volumetric water balance focusing on the root shape and equations in the subsurface drip irrigation has not yet been considered also correction and calibration coefficient of the equations of root water uptake for the subsurface drip irrigation have not been investigated the main objective of this study was therefore to measure the water flow and root uptake under the soil to calibrate the root equation parameters and to simulate with different scenarios by hydrus 2d the goal was to find the most suitable emitter placement and discharge and irrigation duration in order to minimize the evaporation losses and deep penetration 2 materials and methods 2 1 the study area this study was carried out on an apple tree under subsurface drip irrigation in miandoab region in the northwest of iran with geographical coordinates 37 01 42 1 e 46 03 30 8 n in 2018 this area had a height of 1314 m above sea level and an average annual rainfall of 270 1 mm based on 41 year statistics the maximum and minimum recorded temperatures were 41 5 c and 23 5 c in august and january respectively the average annual pan evaporation and relative humidity in this area were 1205 mm and 60 respectively physical and chemical characteristics of the soil were determined by standard methods soil texture by the hydrometric method bulk density by a core sampler electrical conductivity by an ec meter device ph by a ph meter device water content in saturation Œ∏s field capacity Œ∏fc and permanent wilting point Œ∏pwp by pressure plate in the laboratory as shown in table 1 2 2 field experiments the field experiment was carried out in a 2 16 hectares garden around a 30 year old apple tree in a 2 m 2 m plot under drip subsurface irrigation with a two row linear arrangement the spacing of the trees was 2 m 7 m the emitters were installed at a depth of 30 cm and a distance of 1 m from the tree trunk fig 1 the number of emitters for each tree was 4 and the distance and discharge of the emitters were 1 m and 4 lit h 1 respectively irrigation planning was designed according to the climate of the studied area and the standard criteria the interval between the irrigation in july august october and september was 7 5 7 and 10 days respectively the irrigation duration was 7 12 h the soil water content was measured using a tdr device trime pico t3 iph type the tdr tubes were installed at 5 points on one side of the tree at the distances of 30 60 90 120 and 150 cm from the tree trunk fig 1 the soil water content readings were carried out at the depths of 25 50 75 and 100 cm soil water content was measured daily for 4 months june to october between the beginning and end of an irrigation season totally 4800 points were measured for a period of 4 months in 2018 tdr calibration was performed by comparing the reading values with the measured soil water content at the depths of 25 50 75 and 100 cm during the field experiments to measure evapotranspiration the data obtained from the meteorological station located near the studied area was used the root growth changes in the longitudinal and deep direction were measured at the beginning and end of the 4 month period by direct drilling to measure the root length density cm cm 3 the soil samples with the roots were taken by direct drilling from different depths around the tree besharat et al 2010 soil samples were extracted from the soil with roots in a cake like square grid the root samples in the two specified times june 1 and october 30 at different depths up to 100 cm and the radial distances of 30 60 90 120 and 150 cm from the tree trunk were taken the samples were placed in the water they were washed to remove the roots from the soil then the dry and wet weight of the root was measured and the root density distribution in different parts was determined to calculate the root water uptake after removing the gravity water from the soil profile it was considered as the starting point for the root water uptake so the difference between the moisture content of each day and the days after that was determined as the root water uptake in that period see mohammadi et al 2019 the reasons for reducing soil the moisture content over time is related to three factors evaporation root water uptake and gravity water after removing the gravity water from the soil in the top layer of the soil 0 25 cm two factors of evaporation and root water uptake and at lower depths only root water uptake could be effective on the outflow of water from the soil therefore to calculate the root water uptake in the top layer the evaporation was subtracted from the difference of the soil moisture content the difference between soil water content was measured by tdr in two consecutive days in this study a weight method was used to measure the soil water content in the surface layer of the soil in this method the collected soil samples were immediately transferred to the laboratory and dried in the oven at 105 c by multiplying the bulk density by the weight difference between the dry and wet samples the soil moisture content was obtained 2 3 hydrus 2d model in subsurface drip irrigation soil water moving from the emitter into the soil could be simulated using the hydrus 2d model simunek et al 2006 2016 the governing flow equation is given by the following modified form of the richards equation 1 Œ∏ t x i k k ij a h x j k ij a s in this equation Œ∏ is the volumetric water content h is the pressure head l s is a sink term t 1 xi and xj are the spatial coordinates l t is time t k ij a are the components of a dimensionless anisotropy tensor ka and k is the unsaturated hydraulic conductivity function l t 1 in this model the soil water retention curve Œ∏ h by van genuchten 1980 and the unsaturated hydraulic conductivity function k h by mualem 1976 were obtained from eqs 2 and 3 respectively 2 Œ∏ h Œ∏ r Œ∏ s Œ∏ r 1 Œ± h n m h 0 Œ∏ s h 0 3 k h k s s e l 1 1 s e 1 m m 2 m 1 1 n s e Œ∏ Œ∏ r Œ∏ s Œ∏ r n 1 where Œ∏ r and Œ∏ s denote the residual and saturated water content respectively l3l 3 Œ± is the inverse of the air entry value l 1 ks is the saturated hydraulic conductivity l t 1 n is the pore size distribution index se is the effective water content l3l 3 and l is the pore connectivity parameter with an estimated value of 0 5 resulting from averaging conditions in a range of soils mualem 1976 Œ∏ h and k h in eqs 2 and 3 using the measured data and soil retention curve parameters Œ∏r Œ∏s Œ± n as obtained by the inverse solution given by the rosetta model were calculated the soil hydraulic parameters are shown in table 2 2 3 1 evapotranspiration in the hydrus model evaporation and transpiration are the most important input factors in simulating the water flow under soil in this study we used the class a evaporation pan to measure the actual evapotranspiration reference and crop evapotranspiration were obtained from eqs 4 and 5 4 eto kp epan 5 etc kc eto eto is the reference crop evapotranspiration mm day kp is the pan coefficient epan is the evaporation rate measured from the evaporation pan mm day etc is crop evapotranspiration mm day and kc is the crop coefficient the pan coefficient kp in this study was calculated according to the type of pan and weather conditions 0 65 following the fao56 approach the crop coefficient kc for the apple tree at the initial middle and final stages of growth was considered to be 0 5 1 2 and 0 95 allen et al 1998 in this study for measuring evaporation e micro lysimeter was placed around the tree in this study the use was made of a cubic micro lysimeter with the dimensions of 10 cm 150 cm 25 cm width length depth it had porous walls and floor for the easy water flow into it the micro lysimeter was placed on the farm soil which was exactly like the texture around the tree and slightly away from the tree rootless area on the top of the emitters and leveled to the ground core soil sampling between two irrigations showed that evaporation up to a depth of 10 cm from the soil surface was effective up to this depth the soil moisture did not reach saturation therefore by measuring the weight difference of the micro lysimeter on consecutive days the evaporation rate in that time period was calculated by measuring evaporation transpiration t could be obtained from eq 6 6 t etc e 2 3 2 root water uptake in hydrus root water uptake is modeled as a sink term in the richards equation using the stress response function proposed by feddes et al 1978 7 s h Œ± h b x z st tp in eq 7 s is the root water uptake rate t 1 Œ± h is a water stress response function b x z is a normalized function describing the spatial distribution of root density l 2 st is the width l of the soil surface associated with the transpiration process st 150 cm and tp is the potential transpiration rate lt 1 the following parameters of the stress response function typical for many crops were used in this study h1 10 cm h2 25 cm h3 200 cm and h4 8000 cm here h1 and h4 are the anaerobiosis point and wilting point pressure head respectively further h2 and h3 are the pressure heads between which water uptake is considered maximal whereas for pressure heads between h3 and h4 or h1 and h2 water uptake is decreased or increased linearly with h when h2 is below h3 but larger than h4 it is assumed that the water uptake is decreased linearly with h to zero feddes et al 1978 the two dimensional root distribution function b x z of vrugt et al 2001 2002 was then used to describe the spatial distribution of the roots 8 b x z 1 z z m 1 x x m e p z z m z z p x x m x x where xm and zm are the maximum root lengths in the x and z directions l respectively x and z are the distances from the origin of the plant in the x and z directions l respectively further px pz x l and z l are the empirical parameters in order to obtain the empirical parameters of eq 5 the root samples with soil were collected from different parts of the root zone after washing the roots and obtaining the equation of the root density distribution in different parts the equations were solved in the matlab software and the parameters of px pz x and z were optimized in order to determine the maximum root extension in the vertical and horizontal directions direct drilling in the soil profile was done in one side of the tree trunk therefore the amounts of xm and zm were obtained to be 150 and 120 cm respectively the root density distribution parameters in eq 5 are presented in table 3 for root analysis smart root and autocad software were used 2 3 3 initial and boundary condition the simulation was carried out on one side of the tree by applying the hydrus 2d software on a soil profile with a radial and deep distance of 150 and 100 cm respectively soil water content before irrigation was measured and set as the initial condition the left and right boundary was set as a zero flux condition the bottom boundary was set as a free drainage boundary condition and the surface boundary was set as an atmospheric condition simulated geometric and boundary condition is shown in fig 2 evaporation and transpiration as the output factors from the soil surface measured according to section 2 3 1 and rainfall as the input factor were set as the atmospheric condition 2 3 4 calibration and validation of hydrus 2d in this study the calibration of hydrus 2d was performed in two steps at first 30 of the measured soil water content data after irrigation was used to estimate the soil hydraulic parameters also the inverse solution procedure was applied by implementing the evenberg marquardt optimization through the built in hydrus 2d module the inverse method is based on the minimization of a suitable objective function which expresses the discrepancy between the observed and model predicted values in this step by entering some measured data including soil texture components bulk density field capacity and wilting point in the rosetta model built in hydrus soil hydraulic parameters including ks Œ∏r Œ∏s and n and Œ± coefficients were estimated according to rocha et al 2006 the parameters n and Œ± have high and low sensitivity in the van genuchten s equation eq 2 respectively so in the second step the inverse solution was performed by changing the two parameters n and Œ± for the validation of hydrus 2d 70 the remaining measured soil water content data were used comparisons were then made between the field measured data and the simulated output to assess the predictive capacity of the hydrus model the objective function in hydrus was defined as the sum of the squared residuals ssq ≈°im≈Ønek et al 1999a 9 s s q j 1 m v j i 1 n w i j q j x z t i q j x z t i b 2 where n is the number of measurements for the jth measurement set e g water contents concentrations q i x z ti is the measurement at the time ti location x and depth z q j x z ti b is the corresponding model prediction obtained with the vector of the optimized parameters b Œ∏s ks dl and vj and wij are the weights associated with a particular measurement set or point respectively weighting coefficients were assumed to be equal to 1 in all cases to evaluate the model performance in simulating the soil water content the coefficient of determination r2 the root mean square error rmse and nash sutcliffe efficiency nse were computed the mathematical equations of the mentioned statistics were as follows 10 r 2 i 1 j o i o ave p i p ave 2 i 1 j o i o ave 2 i 1 j p i p ave 2 11 rmse i 1 j o i p i 2 n 12 n s e 1 i 1 j o i p i 2 i 1 j o i o ave 2 where oi and pi are the observed and simulated values respectively and n is the number of measurements also oave and pave are the average observed and simulated values respectively r2 is a measure of the correlation or association khodaverdiloo et al 2011 the rmse measures the estimations of absolute errors whereas nse is used to assess the predictive power of the hydrological models nse ranges from to 1 0 perfect fit dom√≠nguez ni√±o et al 2020 the obtained values were in a range close to the rmse of zero indicating the better performance of the model the data were compared by the duncan s multiple range test in the sas software with 95 confidence level the results were then analyzed 2 4 description of the study scenarios in order to achieve the most suitable emitter placement and find the appropriate emitter discharge and irrigation duration to minimize the evaporation losses and deep penetration we simulated three scenarios using the hydrus model as explained below scenario 1 was the baseline control scenario with the collected data in the real field condition the two others were simulated by changing the emitter discharge and irrigation duration in hydrus scenario 1 measuring and comparing data in the real field condition with the emitter discharge of 4 lit h 1 and designed irrigation duration this was a control scenario to compare the results of the other two scenarios simulated by hydrus scenario 2 simulation assuming that the emitter discharge is halved 2 lit h 1 and the irrigation duration is twice the real condition in this scenario we reduced the emitter discharge and the irrigation duration was increased as compared to scenario 1 simulation was done and simulated by hydrus we compared the results with those obtained in scenarios 1 and 3 in terms of the root water uptake evaporation and deep drainage scenario 3 simulation assuming that the emitter discharge is doubled 8 lit h 1 and the irrigation duration is half of that in the real condition in this scenario we increased the emitter discharge and reduced the irrigation duration as compared to scenario 1 and simulation was done by hydrus we compared the obtained results in terms of the root water uptake evaporation and deep drainage with those in scenarios 1 and 2 it is important to note that in all scenarios only the emitter discharge and irrigation duration with the same applied water volume were different in the hydrus simulation and the other conditions were equally applied in the three scenarios table 4 shows summarizes the scenarios considered in this study it should be noted that in all scenarios the amount of water used was constant after performing experiments and simulation using hydrus software the results were compared with each other 3 results and discussion 3 1 soil water content in order to study the water flow in the soil profile we used data obtained from the first four irrigations in july fig 3 shows the measured soil water content in four irrigations at the depth of 25 100 cm with the distances of 30 60 90 120 and 150 cm from the tree trunk as can be seen the highest difference in the soil water content occurred at the distances of 90 and 120 cm from the tree trunk this was due to the installation of the emitter at a distance of 100 cm and the proximity of these points to the emitter position the highest and lowest soil water content difference was observed at the depths of 25 and 100 cm respectively as shown in fig 3 the soil water content was saturated at a depth of 25 cm due to its proximity to the emitter position after about 24 h it reached the field capacity point and so it absorbed by the tree roots 3 2 root water uptake fig 4 shows the measured root water uptake in four irrigations during a 7 day period at a depth of 25 100 cm with the distances of 30 60 90 120 and 150 cm from the tree trunk tables 5 and 6 show the comparison of the root water uptake at different depths and distances from the trunk tree in the first 4 irrigations as can be seen fig 4 and tables 5 and 6 despite the high water content difference at the radial distances of 90 and 120 cm in all four irrigations the highest root uptake occurred at the radial distance of 60 cm and depth of 50 cm this was due to the high roots density near the trunk in fact the two factors of soil water content and root density could affect the root water absorption despite the high water content at the distance of 90 150 cm because of the low root density at such distances as compared to 60 cm the root water uptake was less than 60 cm on the other hand despite the high root density at a radial distance of 30 cm the root water uptake was less than that at the 60 cm distance this was due to the distance of 30 cm from the emitter position and the low soil water content at this point as compared to a distance of 60 cm in fact it could be concluded that the root density and soil water content are two important factors in determining the root water uptake which could have a mutually interactive effect in other words in the presence of the same water content throughout the root development zone at the points with high root density the absorption of root water could be increased this is in agreement with the result of many studies such as costa et al 2007 and tang et al 2005 showing that the lack of moisture dryness in part of the plant root causes the production of abscisic acid and reduce the stomatal conductivity thus decreasing the root water uptake as shown in fig 4 at the radial distances of 0 60 and 60 150 cm from the tree trunk the highest root water uptake occurred at the depths of 25 and 50 cm respectively table 5 shows that in all 4 irrigations the highest root water uptake was at the depth of 50 cm while the lowest one occurred at the depths of 75 and 100 cm due to the low soil moisture and root density in all 4 irrigation 28 days the root uptake difference in all depths was significant at 5 level according to the results in all four irrigations the highest root water uptake occurred at a depth of 50 cm which was 41 5 this was followed by a depth of 25 cm which was 39 2 in fact about 81 of the root water uptake was at a depth of 0 50 cm and only 19 was at a depth below 50 cm besharat et al 2010 in the study of apple tree also found that the highest root water uptake occurred at a depth of 10 30 cm from the soil surface also as shown in table 6 in all 4 irrigations 28 days the root water uptake at the distances of 30 60 90 120 and 150 cm from the tree trunk was significant at 5 level tables 5 and 6 show that in the 4 irrigations 28 days the highest and lowest root water uptake occurred in the coordinates radial deep 60 cm 50 cm and 150 cm 75 cm from the tree trunk respectively therefore in order to ensure the maximum use of the available water by the plant roots it is better to install emitters in coordinates radial deep 60 cm 50 cm of the tree trunk as shown in fig 4 and tables 5 and 6 at a distance of 90 120 cm from the tree the root water uptake at a depth of 100 cm is was slightly more than that at a depth of 75 cm this is was due to the proximity of the depth of 75 cm to the emitter position where the which downstream water increased the soil water content between the saturated moisture and field capacity see table 1 and fig 3 at this depth in the first days following after irrigation due to the fact that the starting point of the root water uptake occurred occurs at a soil water content equal to or less than the field capacity and the moisture at a depth of 100 cm in most days was less than the field capacity so the soil water content at this depth was suitable for absorption as compared to the depth of 75 cm therefore despite the higher roots density at a depth of 75 as compared to the depth of 100 cm water absorption was greater at a depth of 100 cm 3 3 evaluation of hydrus 2d to simulate the soil water content fig 5 shows the coefficient of determination r2 between the simulated and measured soil water content at the distances of 30 60 90 120 and 150 cm from the tree trunk table 7 shows the statistical indicators considered to evaluate the accuracy of the hydrus model in the estimation of the soil water content at different distances from the trunk the calculated rmse 0 0141 0 0193 cm3 cm 3 showed that hydrus 2d had a good estimation of the soil water content in the subsurface drip irrigation in similar studies conducted by yao et al 2011 honari et al 2017 and saefuddin et al 2019 to evaluate the accuracy of the hydrus 2d model in estimating the soil water content based on the subsurface drip irrigation the amount of rmse was obtained to be 0 011 0 024 0 0174 0 019 and 0 015 0 061 respectively compared with the above researches the calculated rmse in this study indicated the proper calibration and good accuracy of hydrus 2d in estimating the soil water content the calculated nse 0 75 as shown in table 7 indicated that the model had a good estimate of the soil water content as shown in fig 5 the amounts of the r2 obtained coefficient was more than 0 8 thus showing a good correlation between the measured and simulated soil water content 3 4 simulation of different scenarios in hydrus 2d in this study water content behavior under the soil was simulated based on the scenarios 2 and 3 in the hydrus 2d software the results were compared with the actual conditions scenario 1 fig 6 shows the soil water content as simulated after the end of the first irrigation for the scenarios 2 the emitter discharge if 2 lit h 1 and the irrigation duration of 26 h and 3 the emitter discharge of 8 lit h 1 and the irrigation duration of 6 5 h in the soil profile of 150 cm 100 cm in july as shown after the end of irrigation in the scenario 3 condition due to less irrigation duration as compared to the scenario 2 water distribution under the soil was quick and the emitter wetted the surrounding area on the other hand due to the dominance of the water flow in the vertical direction as compared to the lateral direction due to the gravity force in the high flow rate 8 lit h 1 and the shorter irrigation duration the deep drainage in this scenario was more than that in the scenario 2 meanwhile in the discharge 2 lit h 1 scenarios 2 due to the long irrigation duration moisture was distributed well in all directions around the emitter also the wetting pattern in this case was greater than that in the scenario 3 the abrupt change in the soil water content just below the emitter depth 30 cm could be observed in fig 5 was due to the change in the soil texture from loam to sandy loam and the improvement of the water flow to depth below the emitter which could be attributed to the simultaneous effect of gravity and soil texture change fig 7 shows the root water uptake and deep drainage as simulated for the scenarios 2 half and 3 double in july 2018 can be seen the root water uptake in all irrigations for the scenario 2 condition was higher than that for the scenario 3 the deep drainage in the scenario 3 was greater table 8 shows the components of the soil water content mass balance including irrigation root water uptake deep drainage evaporation and change in storage over 4 months for scenarios 1 real 2 double and 3 half in different months as shown in table 8 in the scenarios 1 real 2 half and 3 double the root water uptake was 67 7 65 75 72 78 and the deep drainage was 5 63 7 88 3 45 respectively these results thus showed that by decreasing the emitter discharge to 2 lit h 1 and increasing the irrigation duration with the constant amount of water used the root water uptake was increased by 5 08 as compared to the real condition this was also raised to 7 33 in comparison to the scenario 3 conditions also in this condition the deep percolation was decreased by 2 18 as compared to real condition it was also raised to 4 43 relative to the scenario 3 conditions the reason for the rice of the root water uptake in the scenario 2 can be the appropriate distribution of the soil water content in the lateral and vertical directions by decreasing the discharge and increasing the irrigation duration in fact because of the proper distribution of moisture in this scenario roots could optimally use the soil water content in all locations as a result the root water uptake in this scenario was more than that in the other scenarios in scenario 3 due to the high emitter drainage and low irrigation duration a large amount of the soil water content due to the gravity force moved in the deep direction with less root density and water uptake secondly the deep percolation in this scenario was more than that in the other two scenarios studying the amount of evaporation from the soil surface in the three scenarios showed that there was no major difference in evaporation by changing discharge and irrigation duration table 8 mohammadi et al 2019 also concluded that by decreasing the flow rate and extending the irrigation duration in surface irrigation the root water uptake was increased and water losses were decreased the results of this study thus confirmed the above conclusion in the case of subsurface drip irrigation further cai et al 2017 found that by decreasing irrigation duration in subsurface irrigation the deep penetration could be decreased the results of this study therefore showed that the simultaneous management of discharge and irrigation duration in subsurface drip irrigation could be a suitable method for decreasing deep percolation and increasing the proper distribution of the soil water content in the root development zone 4 conclusions in this study the water flow and root uptake under the soil in subsurface drip irrigation were measured and simulated by hydrus 2d based on different scenarios then the obtained results were compared and the best scenario was selected the results showed that the highest and lowest water content difference was observed at the depths of 25 and 100 cm respectively approximately 81 of the root uptake was at a depth of 0 50 cm and only 19 was at a depth below 50 cm the highest and lowest root water uptake occurred in the coordinates radial deep 60 cm 50 cm and 150 cm 75 cm from the tree trunk respectively therefore in order to ensure the maximum use of the available water by the plant roots it is better to install emitters in coordinates radial deep 60 cm 50 cm of the tree trunk the obtained r2 and rmse showed that hydrus 2d had a good estimate of the soil water content in subsurface drip irrigation in this research we optimized the empirical coefficients of the root distribution density equation as offered by vrugt et al 2001 2002 for apple tree under subsurface drip irrigation which was less was that obtained in the same researches simulated results showed that by decreasing the emitter discharge to 2 lit h 1 and increasing the irrigation duration in the constant amount of water used the root water uptake was raised by 5 08 as compared to the real condition and 7 33 relative to the scenario 3 conditions it is therefore suggested that in the future studies simulated scenarios

9966,the study of water flow and root uptake under the soil is especially important in subsurface drip irrigation the main objective of this study was to measure water flow and root uptake under the soil in subsurface drip irrigation and simulation based on different scenarios in hydrus 2d the field experiment was carried out in a land around a 30 year old apple tree with a 2 m 2 m plot in 2018 the emitters were installed at a depth of 30 cm and a distance of 1 m from the tree trunk the soil water content was measured using a tdr device it was measured daily for 4 months at the depths of 25 50 75 and 100 cm in order to calibrate the root equation parameters the samples of root with soil were collected from different parts of the root development zone the results showed that the highest and lowest root water uptake occurred in the coordinates radial deep 60 cm 50 cm and 150 cm 75 cm from the tree trunk respectively approximately 81 of the root uptake was at a depth of 0 50 cm and only 19 was at a depth below 50 cm the calculated rmse 0 0141 0 0193 cm3cm 3 showed that hydrus 2d had a good estimate from of the soil water content in subsurface drip irrigation comparison of different simulated scenarios by hydrus 2d with the results of the field measurements showed that by decreasing the emitter discharge to 2 lit h 1 and increasing the irrigation duration in the constant amount of water used the root water uptake was raised by 5 08 and while deep penetration was decreased by 2 18 as compared to the real condition keywords subsurface drip irrigation root water uptake hydrus 2d 1 introduction subsurface irrigation is one of the irrigation methods mainly used in arid regions due to its low manufacturing cost and high water use efficiency bainbridge 2001 in this irrigation system which has been commonly practiced by buried pots pitchers and porous pipes stein 1997 abu zreig and atoum 2004 siyal et al 2013 due to the diffusion of water under the soil seasonal evapotranspiration of the crop etc can be reduced by 39 in comparison with the sprinkler irrigation system valent√≠n et al 2019 also enhancing the delivery of water and nutrients directly entering into the root zone mohammad et al 2014 is another advantage of subsurface drip irrigation sdi as compared to surface drip irrigation this could enhance irrigation water savings while maintaining a satisfactory production level costa et al 2007 al omran et al 2010 2012 the proper design of sdi requires knowledge of water distribution patterns around those emitters matching the root extraction patterns minimizing the wetting of the soil subsurface and deep percolation cote et al 2003 kandelous et al 2011 subbaiah 2013 field experiments are useful for determining the proper management of irrigation however because of the high cost and time consuming nature of the field experiments the use of simulation models of water movement in the soil is recommended honari et al 2017 in order to efficiently design and manage sdi systems several models have been developed to describe water flow from a point or line source in the soil khalifa et al 2004 singh et al 2006 one of these models is the hydrus software package simunek et al 2008 this model if well calibrated with the measured data can have an appropriate simulation of the water content and root water uptake under the soil skaggs et al 2004 lazarovitch et al 2005 provenzano 2007 zhou et al 2007 kandelous and simunek 2010a 2010b ramos et al 2012 azad et al 2018 there are however few studies on the measurement and simulation of the soil water content and the root water uptake in subsurface irrigation different studies have shown that the initial soil water content and the dimensions of the wetted pattern are increased with extending the irrigation time besharat et al 2010 zhijuan et al 2018 provenzano 2007 for instance evaluated the wetted soil volume in subsurface drip irrigation using hydrus 2d the investigation carried out in a sandy loam soil showed that the model could well simulate the infiltration processes around an emitter during irrigation elmaloglou and diamantopoulos 2009 also found that in the subsurface drip irrigation at a time equal to the total simulation time the discharge rate had no effect on the actual transpiration and soil evaporation with a small effect on deep percolation in this research the numerical results obtained by hydrus showed that when the soil evaporation was neglected the soil water was more easily taken up by the plant roots cai et al 2017 also studied the soil water movement under subsurface irrigation using a porous ceramic emitter the field results indicated that hydrus 2d could be used to investigate the suitable parameters for the ceramic emitter in subsurface irrigation systems and to determine the suitable arrangement and operation mode of the ceramic emitter further autovino et al 2018 studied the wetting pattern of the soil under surface and subsurface drip irrigation in some silty loam soil they introduced the volume of the wetting pattern as a function of irrigation time soil initial condition and emitter discharge comparison of the measured and predicted potential means showed that the hydrus model could be used as a powerful tool for designing and managing subsurface drip irrigation systems saefuddin et al 2019 also conducted field experiments on tomatoes and strawberries using a subsurface irrigation system and simulated the results using the field data in the hydrus model simulation results demonstrated that hydrus could serve as a useful tool to analyze soil water dynamics around the buried ring shaped emitter when using the subsurface water arbat et al 2020 also performed a field experiment using sdi for rice production and simulated it by applying hydrus 2d the results showed that the drip line depth of 0 15 m combined with one or two daily irrigations maximized the water extraction and reduced percolation also hydrus 2d could be useful for the proper management of the rice drip irrigation system the results of various studies have therefore shown that the most field experiments and simulations have been conducted in surface drip irrigation and less attention has been given to the subsurface drip irrigation a review of previous studies also reveals that the effect of the simultaneous management of the emitter discharge and irrigation duration on the root water uptake and volumetric water balance focusing on the root shape and equations in the subsurface drip irrigation has not yet been considered also correction and calibration coefficient of the equations of root water uptake for the subsurface drip irrigation have not been investigated the main objective of this study was therefore to measure the water flow and root uptake under the soil to calibrate the root equation parameters and to simulate with different scenarios by hydrus 2d the goal was to find the most suitable emitter placement and discharge and irrigation duration in order to minimize the evaporation losses and deep penetration 2 materials and methods 2 1 the study area this study was carried out on an apple tree under subsurface drip irrigation in miandoab region in the northwest of iran with geographical coordinates 37 01 42 1 e 46 03 30 8 n in 2018 this area had a height of 1314 m above sea level and an average annual rainfall of 270 1 mm based on 41 year statistics the maximum and minimum recorded temperatures were 41 5 c and 23 5 c in august and january respectively the average annual pan evaporation and relative humidity in this area were 1205 mm and 60 respectively physical and chemical characteristics of the soil were determined by standard methods soil texture by the hydrometric method bulk density by a core sampler electrical conductivity by an ec meter device ph by a ph meter device water content in saturation Œ∏s field capacity Œ∏fc and permanent wilting point Œ∏pwp by pressure plate in the laboratory as shown in table 1 2 2 field experiments the field experiment was carried out in a 2 16 hectares garden around a 30 year old apple tree in a 2 m 2 m plot under drip subsurface irrigation with a two row linear arrangement the spacing of the trees was 2 m 7 m the emitters were installed at a depth of 30 cm and a distance of 1 m from the tree trunk fig 1 the number of emitters for each tree was 4 and the distance and discharge of the emitters were 1 m and 4 lit h 1 respectively irrigation planning was designed according to the climate of the studied area and the standard criteria the interval between the irrigation in july august october and september was 7 5 7 and 10 days respectively the irrigation duration was 7 12 h the soil water content was measured using a tdr device trime pico t3 iph type the tdr tubes were installed at 5 points on one side of the tree at the distances of 30 60 90 120 and 150 cm from the tree trunk fig 1 the soil water content readings were carried out at the depths of 25 50 75 and 100 cm soil water content was measured daily for 4 months june to october between the beginning and end of an irrigation season totally 4800 points were measured for a period of 4 months in 2018 tdr calibration was performed by comparing the reading values with the measured soil water content at the depths of 25 50 75 and 100 cm during the field experiments to measure evapotranspiration the data obtained from the meteorological station located near the studied area was used the root growth changes in the longitudinal and deep direction were measured at the beginning and end of the 4 month period by direct drilling to measure the root length density cm cm 3 the soil samples with the roots were taken by direct drilling from different depths around the tree besharat et al 2010 soil samples were extracted from the soil with roots in a cake like square grid the root samples in the two specified times june 1 and october 30 at different depths up to 100 cm and the radial distances of 30 60 90 120 and 150 cm from the tree trunk were taken the samples were placed in the water they were washed to remove the roots from the soil then the dry and wet weight of the root was measured and the root density distribution in different parts was determined to calculate the root water uptake after removing the gravity water from the soil profile it was considered as the starting point for the root water uptake so the difference between the moisture content of each day and the days after that was determined as the root water uptake in that period see mohammadi et al 2019 the reasons for reducing soil the moisture content over time is related to three factors evaporation root water uptake and gravity water after removing the gravity water from the soil in the top layer of the soil 0 25 cm two factors of evaporation and root water uptake and at lower depths only root water uptake could be effective on the outflow of water from the soil therefore to calculate the root water uptake in the top layer the evaporation was subtracted from the difference of the soil moisture content the difference between soil water content was measured by tdr in two consecutive days in this study a weight method was used to measure the soil water content in the surface layer of the soil in this method the collected soil samples were immediately transferred to the laboratory and dried in the oven at 105 c by multiplying the bulk density by the weight difference between the dry and wet samples the soil moisture content was obtained 2 3 hydrus 2d model in subsurface drip irrigation soil water moving from the emitter into the soil could be simulated using the hydrus 2d model simunek et al 2006 2016 the governing flow equation is given by the following modified form of the richards equation 1 Œ∏ t x i k k ij a h x j k ij a s in this equation Œ∏ is the volumetric water content h is the pressure head l s is a sink term t 1 xi and xj are the spatial coordinates l t is time t k ij a are the components of a dimensionless anisotropy tensor ka and k is the unsaturated hydraulic conductivity function l t 1 in this model the soil water retention curve Œ∏ h by van genuchten 1980 and the unsaturated hydraulic conductivity function k h by mualem 1976 were obtained from eqs 2 and 3 respectively 2 Œ∏ h Œ∏ r Œ∏ s Œ∏ r 1 Œ± h n m h 0 Œ∏ s h 0 3 k h k s s e l 1 1 s e 1 m m 2 m 1 1 n s e Œ∏ Œ∏ r Œ∏ s Œ∏ r n 1 where Œ∏ r and Œ∏ s denote the residual and saturated water content respectively l3l 3 Œ± is the inverse of the air entry value l 1 ks is the saturated hydraulic conductivity l t 1 n is the pore size distribution index se is the effective water content l3l 3 and l is the pore connectivity parameter with an estimated value of 0 5 resulting from averaging conditions in a range of soils mualem 1976 Œ∏ h and k h in eqs 2 and 3 using the measured data and soil retention curve parameters Œ∏r Œ∏s Œ± n as obtained by the inverse solution given by the rosetta model were calculated the soil hydraulic parameters are shown in table 2 2 3 1 evapotranspiration in the hydrus model evaporation and transpiration are the most important input factors in simulating the water flow under soil in this study we used the class a evaporation pan to measure the actual evapotranspiration reference and crop evapotranspiration were obtained from eqs 4 and 5 4 eto kp epan 5 etc kc eto eto is the reference crop evapotranspiration mm day kp is the pan coefficient epan is the evaporation rate measured from the evaporation pan mm day etc is crop evapotranspiration mm day and kc is the crop coefficient the pan coefficient kp in this study was calculated according to the type of pan and weather conditions 0 65 following the fao56 approach the crop coefficient kc for the apple tree at the initial middle and final stages of growth was considered to be 0 5 1 2 and 0 95 allen et al 1998 in this study for measuring evaporation e micro lysimeter was placed around the tree in this study the use was made of a cubic micro lysimeter with the dimensions of 10 cm 150 cm 25 cm width length depth it had porous walls and floor for the easy water flow into it the micro lysimeter was placed on the farm soil which was exactly like the texture around the tree and slightly away from the tree rootless area on the top of the emitters and leveled to the ground core soil sampling between two irrigations showed that evaporation up to a depth of 10 cm from the soil surface was effective up to this depth the soil moisture did not reach saturation therefore by measuring the weight difference of the micro lysimeter on consecutive days the evaporation rate in that time period was calculated by measuring evaporation transpiration t could be obtained from eq 6 6 t etc e 2 3 2 root water uptake in hydrus root water uptake is modeled as a sink term in the richards equation using the stress response function proposed by feddes et al 1978 7 s h Œ± h b x z st tp in eq 7 s is the root water uptake rate t 1 Œ± h is a water stress response function b x z is a normalized function describing the spatial distribution of root density l 2 st is the width l of the soil surface associated with the transpiration process st 150 cm and tp is the potential transpiration rate lt 1 the following parameters of the stress response function typical for many crops were used in this study h1 10 cm h2 25 cm h3 200 cm and h4 8000 cm here h1 and h4 are the anaerobiosis point and wilting point pressure head respectively further h2 and h3 are the pressure heads between which water uptake is considered maximal whereas for pressure heads between h3 and h4 or h1 and h2 water uptake is decreased or increased linearly with h when h2 is below h3 but larger than h4 it is assumed that the water uptake is decreased linearly with h to zero feddes et al 1978 the two dimensional root distribution function b x z of vrugt et al 2001 2002 was then used to describe the spatial distribution of the roots 8 b x z 1 z z m 1 x x m e p z z m z z p x x m x x where xm and zm are the maximum root lengths in the x and z directions l respectively x and z are the distances from the origin of the plant in the x and z directions l respectively further px pz x l and z l are the empirical parameters in order to obtain the empirical parameters of eq 5 the root samples with soil were collected from different parts of the root zone after washing the roots and obtaining the equation of the root density distribution in different parts the equations were solved in the matlab software and the parameters of px pz x and z were optimized in order to determine the maximum root extension in the vertical and horizontal directions direct drilling in the soil profile was done in one side of the tree trunk therefore the amounts of xm and zm were obtained to be 150 and 120 cm respectively the root density distribution parameters in eq 5 are presented in table 3 for root analysis smart root and autocad software were used 2 3 3 initial and boundary condition the simulation was carried out on one side of the tree by applying the hydrus 2d software on a soil profile with a radial and deep distance of 150 and 100 cm respectively soil water content before irrigation was measured and set as the initial condition the left and right boundary was set as a zero flux condition the bottom boundary was set as a free drainage boundary condition and the surface boundary was set as an atmospheric condition simulated geometric and boundary condition is shown in fig 2 evaporation and transpiration as the output factors from the soil surface measured according to section 2 3 1 and rainfall as the input factor were set as the atmospheric condition 2 3 4 calibration and validation of hydrus 2d in this study the calibration of hydrus 2d was performed in two steps at first 30 of the measured soil water content data after irrigation was used to estimate the soil hydraulic parameters also the inverse solution procedure was applied by implementing the evenberg marquardt optimization through the built in hydrus 2d module the inverse method is based on the minimization of a suitable objective function which expresses the discrepancy between the observed and model predicted values in this step by entering some measured data including soil texture components bulk density field capacity and wilting point in the rosetta model built in hydrus soil hydraulic parameters including ks Œ∏r Œ∏s and n and Œ± coefficients were estimated according to rocha et al 2006 the parameters n and Œ± have high and low sensitivity in the van genuchten s equation eq 2 respectively so in the second step the inverse solution was performed by changing the two parameters n and Œ± for the validation of hydrus 2d 70 the remaining measured soil water content data were used comparisons were then made between the field measured data and the simulated output to assess the predictive capacity of the hydrus model the objective function in hydrus was defined as the sum of the squared residuals ssq ≈°im≈Ønek et al 1999a 9 s s q j 1 m v j i 1 n w i j q j x z t i q j x z t i b 2 where n is the number of measurements for the jth measurement set e g water contents

and vj and wij are the weights associated with a particular measurement set or point respectively weighting coefficients were assumed to be equal to 1 in all cases to evaluate the model performance in simulating the soil water content the coefficient of determination r2 the root mean square error rmse and nash sutcliffe efficiency nse were computed the mathematical equations of the mentioned statistics were as follows 10 r 2 i 1 j o i o ave p i p ave 2 i 1 j o i o ave 2 i 1 j p i p ave 2 11 rmse i 1 j o i p i 2 n 12 n s e 1 i 1 j o i p i 2 i 1 j o i o ave 2 where oi and pi are the observed and simulated values respectively and n is the number of measurements also oave and pave are the average observed and simulated values respectively r2 is a measure of the correlation or association khodaverdiloo et al 2011 the rmse measures the estimations of absolute errors whereas nse is used to assess the predictive power of the hydrological models nse ranges from to 1 0 perfect fit dom√≠nguez ni√±o et al 2020 the obtained values were in a range close to the rmse of zero indicating the better performance of the model the data were compared by the duncan s multiple range test in the sas software with 95 confidence level the results were then analyzed 2 4 description of the study scenarios in order to achieve the most suitable emitter placement and find the appropriate emitter discharge and irrigation duration to minimize the evaporation losses and deep penetration we simulated three scenarios using the hydrus model as explained below scenario 1 was the baseline control scenario with the collected data in the real field condition the two others were simulated by changing the emitter discharge and irrigation duration in hydrus scenario 1 measuring and comparing data in the real field condition with the emitter discharge of 4 lit h 1 and designed irrigation duration this was a control scenario to compare the results of the other two scenarios simulated by hydrus scenario 2 simulation assuming that the emitter discharge is halved 2 lit h 1 and the irrigation duration is twice the real condition in this scenario we reduced the emitter discharge and the irrigation duration was increased as compared to scenario 1 simulation was done and simulated by hydrus we compared the results with those obtained in scenarios 1 and 3 in terms of the root water uptake evaporation and deep drainage scenario 3 simulation assuming that the emitter discharge is doubled 8 lit h 1 and the irrigation duration is half of that in the real condition in this scenario we increased the emitter discharge and reduced the irrigation duration as compared to scenario 1 and simulation was done by hydrus we compared the obtained results in terms of the root water uptake evaporation and deep drainage with those in scenarios 1 and 2 it is important to note that in all scenarios only the emitter discharge and irrigation duration with the same applied water volume were different in the hydrus simulation and the other conditions were equally applied in the three scenarios table 4 shows summarizes the scenarios considered in this study it should be noted that in all scenarios the amount of water used was constant after performing experiments and simulation using hydrus software the results were compared with each other 3 results and discussion 3 1 soil water content in order to study the water flow in the soil profile we used data obtained from the first four irrigations in july fig 3 shows the measured soil water content in four irrigations at the depth of 25 100 cm with the distances of 30 60 90 120 and 150 cm from the tree trunk as can be seen the highest difference in the soil water content occurred at the distances of 90 and 120 cm from the tree trunk this was due to the installation of the emitter at a distance of 100 cm and the proximity of these points to the emitter position the highest and lowest soil water content difference was observed at the depths of 25 and 100 cm respectively as shown in fig 3 the soil water content was saturated at a depth of 25 cm due to its proximity to the emitter position after about 24 h it reached the field capacity point and so it absorbed by the tree roots 3 2 root water uptake fig 4 shows the measured root water uptake in four irrigations during a 7 day period at a depth of 25 100 cm with the distances of 30 60 90 120 and 150 cm from the tree trunk tables 5 and 6 show the comparison of the root water uptake at different depths and distances from the trunk tree in the first 4 irrigations as can be seen fig 4 and tables 5 and 6 despite the high water content difference at the radial distances of 90 and 120 cm in all four irrigations the highest root uptake occurred at the radial distance of 60 cm and depth of 50 cm this was due to the high roots density near the trunk in fact the two factors of soil water content and root density could affect the root water absorption despite the high water content at the distance of 90 150 cm because of the low root density at such distances as compared to 60 cm the root water uptake was less than 60 cm on the other hand despite the high root density at a radial distance of 30 cm the root water uptake was less than that at the 60 cm distance this was due to the distance of 30 cm from the emitter position and the low soil water content at this point as compared to a distance of 60 cm in fact it could be concluded that the root density and soil water content are two important factors in determining the root water uptake which could have a mutually interactive effect in other words in the presence of the same water content throughout the root development zone at the points with high root density the absorption of root water could be increased this is in agreement with the result of many studies such as costa et al 2007 and tang et al 2005 showing that the lack of moisture dryness in part of the plant root causes the production of abscisic acid and reduce the stomatal conductivity thus decreasing the root water uptake as shown in fig 4 at the radial distances of 0 60 and 60 150 cm from the tree trunk the highest root water uptake occurred at the depths of 25 and 50 cm respectively table 5 shows that in all 4 irrigations the highest root water uptake was at the depth of 50 cm while the lowest one occurred at the depths of 75 and 100 cm due to the low soil moisture and root density in all 4 irrigation 28 days the root uptake difference in all depths was significant at 5 level according to the results in all four irrigations the highest root water uptake occurred at a depth of 50 cm which was 41 5 this was followed by a depth of 25 cm which was 39 2 in fact about 81 of the root water uptake was at a depth of 0 50 cm and only 19 was at a depth below 50 cm besharat et al 2010 in the study of apple tree also found that the highest root water uptake occurred at a depth of 10 30 cm from the soil surface also as shown in table 6 in all 4 irrigations 28 days the root water uptake at the distances of 30 60 90 120 and 150 cm from the tree trunk was significant at 5 level tables 5 and 6 show that in the 4 irrigations 28 days the highest and lowest root water uptake occurred in the coordinates radial deep 60 cm 50 cm and 150 cm 75 cm from the tree trunk respectively therefore in order to ensure the maximum use of the available water by the plant roots it is better to install emitters in coordinates radial deep 60 cm 50 cm of the tree trunk as shown in fig 4 and tables 5 and 6 at a distance of 90 120 cm from the tree the root water uptake at a depth of 100 cm is was slightly more than that at a depth of 75 cm this is was due to the proximity of the depth of 75 cm to the emitter position where the which downstream water increased the soil water content between the saturated moisture and field capacity see table 1 and fig 3 at this depth in the first days following after irrigation due to the fact that the starting point of the root water uptake occurred occurs at a soil water content equal to or less than the field capacity and the moisture at a depth of 100 cm in most days was less than the field capacity so the soil water content at this depth was suitable for absorption as compared to the depth of 75 cm therefore despite the higher roots density at a depth of 75 as compared to the depth of 100 cm water absorption was greater at a depth of 100 cm 3 3 evaluation of hydrus 2d to simulate the soil water content fig 5 shows the coefficient of determination r2 between the simulated and measured soil water content at the distances of 30 60 90 120 and 150 cm from the tree trunk table 7 shows the statistical indicators considered to evaluate the accuracy of the hydrus model in the estimation of the soil water content at different distances from the trunk the calculated rmse 0 0141 0 0193 cm3 cm 3 showed that hydrus 2d had a good estimation of the soil water content in the subsurface drip irrigation in similar studies conducted by yao et al 2011 honari et al 2017 and saefuddin et al 2019 to evaluate the accuracy of the hydrus 2d model in estimating the soil water content based on the subsurface drip irrigation the amount of rmse was obtained to be 0 011 0 024 0 0174 0 019 and 0 015 0 061 respectively compared with the above researches the calculated rmse in this study indicated the proper calibration and good accuracy of hydrus 2d in estimating the soil water content the calculated nse 0 75 as shown in table 7 indicated that the model had a good estimate of the soil water content as shown in fig 5 the amounts of the r2 obtained coefficient was more than 0 8 thus showing a good correlation between the measured and simulated soil water content 3 4 simulation of different scenarios in hydrus 2d in this study water content behavior under the soil was simulated based on the scenarios 2 and 3 in the hydrus 2d software the results were compared with the actual conditions scenario 1 fig 6 shows the soil water content as simulated after the end of the first irrigation for the scenarios 2 the emitter discharge if 2 lit h 1 and the irrigation duration of 26 h and 3 the emitter discharge of 8 lit h 1 and the irrigation duration of 6 5 h in the soil profile of 150 cm 100 cm in july as shown after the end of irrigation in the scenario 3 condition due to less irrigation duration as compared to the scenario 2 water distribution under the soil was quick and the emitter wetted the surrounding area on the other hand due to the dominance of the water flow in the vertical direction as compared to the lateral direction due to the gravity force in the high flow rate 8 lit h 1 and the shorter irrigation duration the deep drainage in this scenario was more than that in the scenario 2 meanwhile in the discharge 2 lit h 1 scenarios 2 due to the long irrigation duration moisture was distributed well in all directions around the emitter also the wetting pattern in this case was greater than that in the scenario 3 the abrupt change in the soil water content just below the emitter depth 30 cm could be observed in fig 5 was due to the change in the soil texture from loam to sandy loam and the improvement of the water flow to depth below the emitter which could be attributed to the simultaneous effect of gravity and soil texture change fig 7 shows the root water uptake and deep drainage as simulated for the scenarios 2 half and 3 double in july 2018 can be seen the root water uptake in all irrigations for the scenario 2 condition was higher than that for the scenario 3 the deep drainage in the scenario 3 was greater table 8 shows the components of the soil water content mass balance including irrigation root water uptake deep drainage evaporation and change in storage over 4 months for scenarios 1 real 2 double and 3 half in different months as shown in table 8 in the scenarios 1 real 2 half and 3 double the root water uptake was 67 7 65 75 72 78 and the deep drainage was 5 63 7 88 3 45 respectively these results thus showed that by decreasing the emitter discharge to 2 lit h 1 and increasing the irrigation duration with the constant amount of water used the root water uptake was increased by 5 08 as compared to the real condition this was also raised to 7 33 in comparison to the scenario 3 conditions also in this condition the deep percolation was decreased by 2 18 as compared to real condition it was also raised to 4 43 relative to the scenario 3 conditions the reason for the rice of the root water uptake in the scenario 2 can be the appropriate distribution of the soil water content in the lateral and vertical directions by decreasing the discharge and increasing the irrigation duration in fact because of the proper distribution of moisture in this scenario roots could optimally use the soil water content in all locations as a result the root water uptake in this scenario was more than that in the other scenarios in scenario 3 due to the high emitter drainage and low irrigation duration a large amount of the soil water content due to the gravity force moved in the deep direction with less root density and water uptake secondly the deep percolation in this scenario was more than that in the other two scenarios studying the amount of evaporation from the soil surface in the three scenarios showed that there was no major difference in evaporation by changing discharge and irrigation duration table 8 mohammadi et al 2019 also concluded that by decreasing the flow rate and extending the irrigation duration in surface irrigation the root water uptake was increased and water losses were decreased the results of this study thus confirmed the above conclusion in the case of subsurface drip irrigation further cai et al 2017 found that by decreasing irrigation duration in subsurface irrigation the deep penetration could be decreased the results of this study therefore showed that the simultaneous management of discharge and irrigation duration in subsurface drip irrigation could be a suitable method for decreasing deep percolation and increasing the proper distribution of the soil water content in the root development zone 4 conclusions in this study the water flow and root uptake under the soil in subsurface drip irrigation were measured and simulated by hydrus 2d based on different scenarios then the obtained results were compared and the best scenario was selected the results showed that the highest and lowest water content difference was observed at the depths of 25 and 100 cm respectively approximately 81 of the root uptake was at a depth of 0 50 cm and only 19 was at a depth below 50 cm the highest and lowest root water uptake occurred in the coordinates radial deep 60 cm 50 cm and 150 cm 75 cm from the tree trunk respectively therefore in order to ensure the maximum use of the available water by the plant roots it is better to install emitters in coordinates radial deep 60 cm 50 cm of the tree trunk the obtained r2 and rmse showed that hydrus 2d had a good estimate of the soil water content in subsurface drip irrigation in this research we optimized the empirical coefficients of the root distribution density equation as offered by vrugt et al 2001 2002 for apple tree under subsurface drip irrigation which was less was that obtained in the same researches simulated results showed that by decreasing the emitter discharge to 2 lit h 1 and increasing the irrigation duration in the constant amount of water used the root water uptake was raised by 5 08 as compared to the real condition and 7 33 relative to the scenario 3 conditions it is therefore suggested that in the future studies simulated scenarios

9967,foliar water uptake fwu is the main mechanism used by herbaceous plants in arid areas to absorb small amounts of precipitation it has an important ecological and hydrological effect for alleviating plant drought stress however it is unknown whether woody plants can absorb water through the leaves when water absorption via roots is insufficient this study explored whether fwu exists and the fwu conditions in semi humid rock mountainous areas isotopes were labeled to detect fwu under different soil water content swc gradients 3 9 6 5 6 5 9 1 9 1 15 6 15 6 20 8 and 20 8 26 0 and different precipitation gradients 1 mm h 5 mm h 10 mm h and 15 mm h in simulated precipitation experiments with indoor potted plants the results showed that fwu occurred in each treatment if the swc 21 9 no matter the precipitation amount water absorption via fwu increased with the increase of precipitation intensity but decreased with the increase of swc the greatest ratios of fwu were 2 77 and 9 52 of precipitation intensity of 1 mm h and 15 mm h respectively in the 3 9 6 5 treatment the precipitation absorbed by the leaves can be transported to the xylem or root system along the water potential gradient of leaves branches roots the precipitation with reverse migration in branches and roots increased with the increase of the water potential gradient of leaves branches roots these findings suggest that platycladus orientalis can uptake water through roots and leaves effectively alleviating drought stress this study provides new insights into water use patterns and water migration in trees keywords foliar water uptake stable isotope precipitation soil water plantation 1 introduction precipitation is a key factor affecting the water source and growth of plants liu et al 2019 voytek et al 2019 in dry drought prone climates the frequency of light precipitation may be high but it only infiltrates the surface soil and cannot be directly absorbed by the plant root system although the frequency of heavy precipitation is low it can infiltrate the deep soil of the rhizosphere and be absorbed by plant roots schlaepfer et al 2017 historically there is a consensus that plants only rely on their roots for water uptake david et al 2013 lee et al 2018 liu et al 2019 serret et al 2020 therefore plants cannot utilize run off water the majority of previous studies on the water source used by plants often did not consider light precipitation and condensation zhou et al 2013 stocker et al 2018 liu et al 2020 nevertheless several studies in several extremely arid areas have found that plants utilize condensation or light precipitation to maintain normal growth carter and smith 2014 cassana et al 2016 eller et al 2016 garc√≠a et al 2016 cammarano et al 2020 however foliar water uptake fwu cannot be ignored pariyar et al 2017 to date fwu has been reported in more than 40 plant species in arid desert grassland ecosystems fwu is an essential mechanism that plants use to collect water in an arid desert cassana et al 2016 eller et al 2016 found that the contribution of fwu by drimys brasiliensis reached 42 of the total water in the plant which can effectively alleviate the soil water deficit however different plant species have varying levels of fwu capacity buckley et al 2015 gotsch et al 2015 aparecido et al 2017 munn√© bosch 2010 demonstrated that lavandula angustifolia mill absorbed 72 condensed water through the leaves which increased the leaf water potential by 0 5 kpa while the leaves of rosmarinus officinalis could not absorb water in the same ecosystem fwu primarily occurs through the cuticle pores or stomata wang et al 2016 and its capacity is significantly affected by drought and climate change eller et al 2016 however plants can absorb water through their leaves without being affected by the root system providing an adaptive strategy for growth in adverse environments stanton et al 2014 pariyar et al 2017 binks et al 2019 besides improving the water content and water potential of leaves water absorption through leaves also promotes plant growth increasing survival chances and biomass the amount of water absorbed by leaves increases with increasing air humidity garc√≠a et al 2016 kerhoulas et al 2020 most previous studies have confirmed the existence of fwu in herbaceous plants in arid areas benasher et al 2010 cassana et al 2016 pariyar et al 2017 cavallaro et al 2020 few studies have described the phenomenon of fwu in woody plants in humid areas or semi humid areas however there is no evidence showing that the fwu phenomenon is universal plant leaves are usually wet for about 120 days per year in semi humid areas promoting fwu dawson and goldsmith 2018 therefore it is necessary to clarify further the conditions and influencing factors of fwu in semi humid areas although a typical plantation tree species in northern china platycladus orientalis is a key ecological barrier in the capital of china the spatial heterogeneity of precipitation has increased in semi humid mountainous areas in china due to global climate change ipcc 2013 wang et al 2021 furthermore soil moisture availability to trees is highly variable in semi humid mountainous areas depending on the timing and amount of precipitation jiang et al 2017 this leads to prolonged drought in p orientalis plantation however it is unknown whether plants can absorb water through leaves when the absorption via roots is insufficient this study used labeled isotopes to i explore whether fwu occurs in p orientalis plantation in semi humid rock mountainous area ii clarify the amount of water absorbed by plant leaves and the fwu occurrence conditions the results provide a significant theoretical and practical basis for understanding the mechanism and process of plant water use 2 materials and methods 2 1 site description the experiment was conducted in a greenhouse with artificially simulated precipitation of a forest ecosystem positioning research station in the capital circle the effective precipitation height was 12 m and the precipitation was 85 0 the precipitation system was equipped with a highly sensitive rain gauge and multi parameter data collector and had four different specifications of raindrop simulation nozzles for effective simulations of natural precipitation conditions fig 1 statistical analysis was conducted on years of data of the frequency of local precipitation the frequency of local precipitation primarily occurs as follows 2 4 6 8 12 and 12 18 mm h therefore in this study we set up rainfall intensity as 1 5 10 and 15 mm h to observe the fwu of a coniferous species 2 2 experimental design a total of 135 healthy platycladus orientalis individuals 100 120 cm height were watered once a week for three months to maintain normal growth all p orientalis individuals were completely randomly divided into five treatments with 27 individuals in each treatment the five treatments had different water stress gradients as shown in table 1 an em50 r data collector decagon usa was used to monitor swc in real time and water Œ¥2h of 67 00 was added daily at regular intervals to maintain the swc in each treatment within the set range after establishing the five swc treatments simulated precipitation experiments of the unlabeled Œ¥2h of 67 00 and labeled Œ¥2h of 600 00 were conducted successively fig 1 the treatments with unlabeled precipitation were set as the control ck while the labeled experimental groups eg before the precipitation experiment the potted soils were waterproofed by sealing the pot edge and tree trunk with a plastic cloth to prevent precipitation from entering the soil samples of leaves branches and roots of p orientalis were collected and leaf water content lmc and leaf water potential lwp were measured before and after precipitation 2 3 sampling of leaves branches and roots in the ck 15 p orientalis individuals were randomly selected for each treatment each artificially simulated precipitation experiment was completed before 8 am to reduce the error of experimental before every unlabeled precipitation event three samples of leaves and branches were collected from each tree samples of leaves and branches were divided into three fractions for analysis one fraction was encapsulated in an aluminum box and dried at 105 c to calculate lmc another fraction was encapsulated in clean 50 ml polyethylene bottles to determine lwp by pms water potential instrument 1505d exp pms inc usa the final fraction was placed into clean 50 ml polyethylene bottles sealed with parafilm m and frozen at 4 c for isotope analysis the incisions were sealed with a thermosetting resin binder to avoid water from entering the soil in the precipitation experiment subsequently three p orientalis individuals were randomly selected in each treatment for simulated precipitation experiments at rainfall intensity of 1 mm h and no simulated precipitation experiments respectively the precipitation with unlabeled experiment lasted for 30 min three branches three leaves and three roots in each p orientalis individual in the five treatments were collected immediately after 0 min 15 min 30 min 1 h 2 h 4 h 6 h 8 h and 24 h of precipitation the leaf and branch samples were divided into three fractions for later analysis of lmc lwp and isotopes the no precipitation and precipitation experiments had similar sampling times when the 1 mm h precipitation experiment was completed the p orientalis individuals were replaced with another three randomly selected p orientalis individuals for subsequent artificially simulated precipitation similarly the three other p orientalis individuals were randomly selected for simulated precipitation experiments at 5 10 and 15 mm h which were conducted successively after the last precipitation experiment upon completion of the ck simulated precipitation experiment the labeled precipitation an isotope ratio of approximately 600 replaced the unlabeled precipitation an isotope ratio of approximately 67 00 in the simulation experiment the same precipitation gradient set in each treatment was used following the methods described above this is considered the eg table 2 2 4 stable isotope analysis the stable isotope analysis was conducted in the laboratory of eco hydrological processes and mechanisms beijing forestry university beijing china the bark and green parts of the branches and roots were removed subsequently the water in leaves branches and roots was extracted using the cryogenic vacuum distillation approach west et al 2006 the extracted water sample was filtered through a 0 22 ¬µm filter to prevent impurities from affecting the determination of the stable isotopes then the isotope ratio of hydrogen and oxygen in the water samples was measured using a liquid water isotope analyzer lgr dli 100 usa at an accuracy of 0 32 and 0 17 for Œ¥2h and Œ¥18o respectively the measured isotope ratio of hydrogen and oxygen in the water sample is the thousandth difference between the normalized to vienna standard mean ocean water vsmow expressed as 1 Œ¥ x r s a m p l e r s t a n d a r d 1 1000 where x was the 2h or 18o in the water sample from leaves branches or roots rsample and rstandard were the isotope ratio of the samples and vsmow respectively 2 5 data analysis stable isotope technology is an accurate and effective tool that can be used to explore the fwu of plants the presence of the labeled isotope in the leaves branches or roots of p orientalis indicated that p orientalis has fwu or water migrated down to the roots if the fractionation isotope value of water was ignored while migrated down from the leaves based on the principle of isotopic mass conservation a simple binary linear mixed model phillips and gregg 2003 was used to estimate the proportion of fwu and the contribution of reverse transport to the supply of branch and rhizosphere soil expressed as 2 Œ¥ m x 1 Œ¥ s 1 x 2 Œ¥ s 2 3 x 1 x 2 1 where s1 and s2 are the isotope ratio of the precipitation and leaves branches or roots of p orientalis before precipitation m is the mixed isotopic values of leaves branches or roots of p orientalis after precipitation statistical analyses were performed using statistical product and service solutions spss 16 0 a two way analysis of variance anova was used to identify differences in lmc and lmp using the precipitation and treatment factors the partial correlation analysis was used to investigate the effects of precipitation and swc on lmc and lmp a three way anova was used to test the difference in the isotopic values with precipitation treatments and time as factors a three way anova was also used to analyze the difference in water use absorptivity using precipitation treatments and time as the independent factors the least significant difference was used to compare water use absorption when necessary at p 0 05 all data were subjected to normal distribution and homogeneity of variance analyses all of which met the requirements 3 results 3 1 variation of lmc and lwp the lmc and lwp of p orientalis generally increased after precipitation but the degree of increase varied fig 2 before the precipitation event the average lmc of p orientalis in treatments a b c d and e was 14 49 18 35 20 08 23 33 and 26 82 mg cm2 respectively similarly the average lwp of p orientalis in treatments a b c d and e was 3 02 1 93 1 68 1 23 and 0 83mpa respectively the lmc and lwp increased with the increase of swc indicating that the higher the swc the lower the drought stress faced by the plant after precipitation the changes of lmc and lwp of p orientalis increased with the increase of rainfall intensity in treatment a lmc and lwp of p orientalis increased than the other treatments after precipitation the lmc and lwp of p orientalis in treatment a under the rainfall intensity of 15 mm h were 55 36 and 30 87 higher than that of the rainfall intensity of 1 mm h respectively the change in lmc and lwp decreased with the increase of soil water content but increased with the increase of rainfall intensity r 2 0 75 p 0 01 r 2 0 75 p 0 01 fig 3 the results of the multiple regression analysis showed that fwu was only possible when the swc 21 9 the variation of lmc and lwp of p orientalis in treatment a was 3 3 times and 2 63 times greater than treatment d respectively there were no significant differences in lmc and lwp of p orientalis before and after precipitation p 0 05 since the swc in treatment e was 100 of the field water capacity 3 2 variation of the hydrogen isotope ratio in leaves after precipitation in the no precipitation treatment the diurnal Œ¥2h in p orientalis leaf Œ¥2h l peaked 4 h after the start of sampling and then gradually decreased fig 4 the average value of Œ¥2h l was 43 40 and the average range was 18 51 the average Œ¥2h l of treatments a b c d and e were 24 78 36 74 49 24 53 37 and 52 92 respectively before the precipitation the Œ¥2h l in treatments a b c and d of the eg were significantly greater than that of the ck after the precipitation event p 0 05 after the precipitation the Œ¥2h l was significantly higher in eg than in the ck p 0 05 Œ¥2h l enrichment increased with rainfall intensity Œ¥2h l increased to 63 53 at the 15 mm h rainfall intensity treatment significantly higher than at other rainfall intensity treatments p 0 05 the enrichment degree of the isotope values of Œ¥2h l in treatments a b c and d gradually decreased at the same rainfall intensity treatment e did not significantly change the daily variation between eg and ck indicating the lack of fwu in treatment e therefore the lower the swc the greater the rainfall intensity and the apparent isotopic enrichment of leaves 3 3 variation of the hydrogen isotope ratio in branches and roots after precipitation similar to Œ¥2h l the variation range of Œ¥2h in branches of p orientalis Œ¥2h b was less than 3 25 and showed no significant diurnal variation in the ck p 0 05 fig 5 the Œ¥2h b increased significantly at 30 min to 1 h after precipitation and this increase was maintained for 6 8 h the enrichment degree of Œ¥2h b increased with the increase in rainfall intensity and decrease in swc for example the average maximum increase of Œ¥2h b was 26 53 in treatment a which was significantly higher than in treatment b 9 78 p 0 05 the Œ¥2h b of treatments a and b were significantly higher in the eg than in the ck p 0 05 however the Œ¥2h b of treatments c d and e showed no significant difference between eg and ck p 0 05 these results indicated that the branches of p orientalis in treatments a and b underwent fwu while individuals in treatments c d and e did not an indication that some precipitation absorbed by leaves was stored in branches the Œ¥2h in roots of p orientalis Œ¥2h r in treatments a and b was significantly enriched under the rainfall intensity of 10 mm h and 15 mm h respectively in eg fig 6 than in the ck p 0 05 no significant increase of Œ¥2h r was found in other treatments indicating that the precipitation was transported to rhizosphere soil through branches in treatments a and b 3 4 water absorption by plant leaves there was no significant difference in lmc lwp and Œ¥2h l between the eg and ck in treatment e suggesting that fwu of p orientalis does not occur in treatment e therefore this paragraph will focus on the other four treatments i e treatments a b c and d the ratio of fwu of the four treatments to precipitation peaked at 1 2 h after the cessation of precipitation followed by a decrease in fwu ratio fig 7 after 24 h the fwu ratio decreased to approximately 0 the ratio of fwu to precipitation increased with the increase of rainfall intensity and a decrease in swc in the four treatments in treatment a the maximum ratio of fwu to precipitation was 2 77 and 9 52 at the rainfall intensity of 1 and 15 mm h respectively in treatments a and b the average ratio of fwu to precipitation was 4 03 and 2 22 respectively twice that of treatments c 1 95 and d 1 14 4 discussion 4 1 fwu in p orientalis generally soil water is transferred from roots to leaves along the water potential gradient lee et al 2018 therefore the lmc and lwp were directly related to the swc and directly affected by precipitation fang et al 2020 before precipitation there was a good correlation between swc and lmc lwp among the five treatments r2 0 97 indicating that the lower the swc the more serious the water deficit of leaves after precipitation the lmc and lwp increased to different degrees which was especially evident in treatment a which showed an up to 30 increase in lmc and lwp fig 2 similarly a previous study in other areas reported that the lmc and lwp of plants significantly increase after precipitation dawson and goldsmith 2018 berry et al 2019 therefore the more serious the leaf water deficit the more significant the response of fwu to precipitation thus precipitation can alleviate drought effects observed in leaves limm et al 2009 also demonstrated that lmc of sequoia sempervirens could be increased to about 2 11 by fwu in north america this study demonstrated that fwu was dependent on humidity and the response of leaves to precipitation increased with the increase of precipitation fig 3 this may be an adaptive strategy for plants to cope with drought fwu can occur during leaf wetting events such as fog rain snow and morning dew and can occur in plants growing in dryland ecosystems to redwood forests steppe et al 2018 generally vapor pressure deficit humidity and precipitation can be used as indicators to identify the occurrence of fwu vesala et al 2017 however darby et al 2016 found that precipitation more accurately predicted fwu than vapor pressure deficit when determining the water potential difference our study only compared and analyzed the effect of precipitation and swc on fwu and observed fwu in each treatment when swc was 21 9 fig 3 in addition the correlation between swc and lmc lmp was higher than that between precipitation and lmc lmp indicating that the range of swc may be a precondition of fwu moreover the use of swc may be more accurate than using precipitation and vapor pressure deficit to determine fwu 4 2 precipitation absorption ratio by leaves water is an important factor for plant growth and survival barbeito et al 2012 most plants rely on the root system to absorb water to allow for normal growth whereas other plants can rely on their leaves to absorb precipitation to maintain growth and improve water use efficiency mcculloh et al 2014 liu et al 2020 precipitation absorption ratio was not only related to swc but also related to precipitation in this study the proportion of precipitation absorbed by p orientalis leaves was different in treatments a b c and d the precipitation absorption ratio increased with the increase in precipitation and a decrease in swc this was likely due to the difference in the water potential inside and outside the leaves of p orientalis although both the cuticle and stomata allow water exchange between leaves and the atmosphere studies have shown that stomata allow more water in and out than the cuticle villar et al 2010 stomata have high water conductivity and were also the main channel for fwu burgess and dawson 2004 pariyar et al 2017 schreel et al 2019 in addition the water potential gradient was the main driving factor of water exchange in the stomata therefore the water potential difference inside and outside of the leaves was the major factor affecting the fwu the water potential between the leaf and rhizosphere was larger in the treatment with lower swc and greater rainfall intensity the difference in the water potential of leaves was the largest directly after the precipitation event ended therefore the proportion of absorption of water by p orientalis leaves peaked at 1 2 h then the fwu decreased with water potential difference in four treatments fig 2 the evidence presented by the labeled isotope analysis suggests that the water absorbed by the leaves of p orientalis can transport the to xylem fig 4 or the root system fig 5 this may be because there was a large water potential gradient between leaves branches and roots goldsmith 2013 reported a complete reversal of the soil plant atmosphere continuum with a sufficient water potential gradient this has also been observed by david et al 2013 who demonstrated that the reverse migration of water from the leaf to the xylem and root occurs in several forest species in europe cassana et al 2016 also found that the water absorbed by leaves can be transported to roots and released into the soil recent research has demonstrated the possibility of bidirectional exchange of water isotopes between leaves and the atmosphere lehmann et al 2018 the water absorbed by the leaves of p orientalis may also diffuse from stomata for transpiration during reverse transport which leads to a lower isotopic signal in branches and roots compared to that in leaves fwu could be a mechanism for p orientalis to absorb water in dry environments the majority of plant species rely on both the root system to absorb water and can absorb atmospheric water in environments with high humidity goldsmith et al 2013 carter et al 2018 dawson and goldsmith 2018 these findings suggest that p orientalis can uptake water through roots and leaves to alleviate drought stress effectively 5 conclusions in this study labeled isotopes were used to explore whether fwu occurs in p orientalis our overall aims were to distinguish the conditions of fwu and to determine the proportion of leaf to precipitation absorption fwu was observed in each treatment when the swc was 21 9 regardless of the precipitation amount the absorption ratio of precipitation by leaves increased with the increase in rainfall intensity but decreased with the increase in swc the stomata likely controlled by the difference of water potential inside and outside the leaves could be the main channel of water absorption the swc may be a precondition of fwu and it is more accurate to use swc than precipitation to determine fwu the water absorbed by the leaves of p orientalis can be transported to the xylem or root system along the water potential gradient of leaves branches and roots these findings suggest that p orientalis can rapidly uptake moisture from the air under low soil

9967,foliar water uptake fwu is the main mechanism used by herbaceous plants in arid areas to absorb small amounts of precipitation it has an important ecological and hydrological effect for alleviating plant drought stress however it is unknown whether woody plants can absorb water through the leaves when water absorption via roots is insufficient this study explored whether fwu exists and the fwu conditions in semi humid rock mountainous areas isotopes were labeled to detect fwu under different soil water content swc gradients 3 9 6 5 6 5 9 1 9 1 15 6 15 6 20 8 and 20 8 26 0 and different precipitation gradients 1 mm h 5 mm h 10 mm h and 15 mm h in simulated precipitation experiments with indoor potted plants the results showed that fwu occurred in each treatment if the swc 21 9 no matter the precipitation amount water absorption via fwu increased with the increase of precipitation intensity but decreased with the increase of swc the greatest ratios of fwu were 2 77 and 9 52 of precipitation intensity of 1 mm h and 15 mm h respectively in the 3 9 6 5 treatment the precipitation absorbed by the leaves can be transported to the xylem or root system along the water potential gradient of leaves branches roots the precipitation with reverse migration in branches and roots increased with the increase of the water potential gradient of leaves branches roots these findings suggest that platycladus orientalis can uptake water through roots and leaves effectively alleviating drought stress this study provides new insights into water use patterns and water migration in trees keywords foliar water uptake stable isotope precipitation soil water plantation 1 introduction precipitation is a key factor affecting the water source and growth of plants liu et al 2019 voytek et al 2019 in dry drought prone climates the frequency of light precipitation may be high but it only infiltrates the surface soil and cannot be directly absorbed by the plant root system although the frequency of heavy precipitation is low it can infiltrate the deep soil of the rhizosphere and be absorbed by plant roots schlaepfer et al 2017 historically there is a consensus that plants only rely on their roots for water uptake david et al 2013 lee et al 2018 liu et al 2019 serret et al 2020 therefore plants cannot utilize run off water the majority of previous studies on the water source used by plants often did not consider light precipitation and condensation zhou et al 2013 stocker et al 2018 liu et al 2020 nevertheless several studies in several extremely arid areas have found that plants utilize condensation or light precipitation to maintain normal growth carter and smith 2014 cassana et al 2016 eller et al 2016 garc√≠a et al 2016 cammarano et al 2020 however foliar water uptake fwu cannot be ignored pariyar et al 2017 to date fwu has been reported in more than 40 plant species in arid desert grassland ecosystems fwu is an essential mechanism that plants use to collect water in an arid desert cassana et al 2016 eller et al 2016 found that the contribution of fwu by drimys brasiliensis reached 42 of the total water in the plant which can effectively alleviate the soil water deficit however different plant species have varying levels of fwu capacity buckley et al 2015 gotsch et al 2015 aparecido et al 2017 munn√© bosch 2010 demonstrated that lavandula angustifolia mill absorbed 72 condensed water through the leaves which increased the leaf water potential by 0 5 kpa while the leaves of rosmarinus officinalis could not absorb water in the same ecosystem fwu primarily occurs through the cuticle pores or stomata wang et al 2016 and its capacity is significantly affected by drought and climate change eller et al 2016 however plants can absorb water through their leaves without being affected by the root system providing an adaptive strategy for growth in adverse environments stanton et al 2014 pariyar et al 2017 binks et al 2019 besides improving the water content and water potential of leaves water absorption through leaves also promotes plant growth increasing survival chances and biomass the amount of water absorbed by leaves increases with increasing air humidity garc√≠a et al 2016 kerhoulas et al 2020 most previous studies have confirmed the existence of fwu in herbaceous plants in arid areas benasher et al 2010 cassana et al 2016 pariyar et al 2017 cavallaro et al 2020 few studies have described the phenomenon of fwu in woody plants in humid areas or semi humid areas however there is no evidence showing that the fwu phenomenon is universal plant leaves are usually wet for about 120 days per year in semi humid areas promoting fwu dawson and goldsmith 2018 therefore it is necessary to clarify further the conditions and influencing factors of fwu in semi humid areas although a typical plantation tree species in northern china platycladus orientalis is a key ecological barrier in the capital of china the spatial heterogeneity of precipitation has increased in semi humid mountainous areas in china due to global climate change ipcc 2013 wang et al 2021 furthermore soil moisture availability to trees is highly variable in semi humid mountainous areas depending on the timing and amount of precipitation jiang et al 2017 this leads to prolonged drought in p orientalis plantation however it is unknown whether plants can absorb water through leaves when the absorption via roots is insufficient this study used labeled isotopes to i explore whether fwu occurs in p orientalis plantation in semi humid rock mountainous area ii clarify the amount of water absorbed by plant leaves and the fwu occurrence conditions the results provide a significant theoretical and practical basis for understanding the mechanism and process of plant water use 2 materials and methods 2 1 site description the experiment was conducted in a greenhouse with artificially simulated precipitation of a forest ecosystem positioning research station in the capital circle the effective precipitation height was 12 m and the precipitation was 85 0 the precipitation system was equipped with a highly sensitive rain gauge and multi parameter data collector and had four different specifications of raindrop simulation nozzles for effective simulations of natural precipitation conditions fig 1 statistical analysis was conducted on years of data of the frequency of local precipitation the frequency of local precipitation primarily occurs as follows 2 4 6 8 12 and 12 18 mm h therefore in this study we set up rainfall intensity as 1 5 10 and 15 mm h to observe the fwu of a coniferous species 2 2 experimental design a total of 135 healthy platycladus orientalis individuals 100 120 cm height were watered once a week for three months to maintain normal growth all p orientalis individuals were completely randomly divided into five treatments with 27 individuals in each treatment the five treatments had different water stress gradients as shown in table 1 an em50 r data collector decagon usa was used to monitor swc in real time and water Œ¥2h of 67 00 was added daily at regular intervals to maintain the swc in each treatment within the set range after establishing the five swc treatments simulated precipitation experiments of the unlabeled Œ¥2h of 67 00 and labeled Œ¥2h of 600 00 were conducted successively fig 1 the treatments with unlabeled precipitation were set as the control ck while the labeled experimental groups eg before the precipitation experiment the potted soils were waterproofed by sealing the pot edge and tree trunk with a plastic cloth to prevent precipitation from entering the soil samples of leaves branches and roots of p orientalis were collected and leaf water content lmc and leaf water potential lwp were measured before and after precipitation 2 3 sampling of leaves branches and roots in the ck 15 p orientalis individuals were randomly selected for each treatment each artificially simulated precipitation experiment was completed before 8 am to reduce the error of experimental before every unlabeled precipitation event three samples of leaves and branches were collected from each tree samples of leaves and branches were divided into three fractions for analysis one fraction was encapsulated in an aluminum box and dried at 105 c to calculate lmc another fraction was encapsulated in clean 50 ml polyethylene bottles to determine lwp by pms water potential instrument 1505d exp pms inc usa the final fraction was placed into clean 50 ml polyethylene bottles sealed with parafilm m and frozen at 4 c for isotope analysis the incisions were sealed with a thermosetting resin binder to avoid water from entering the soil in the precipitation experiment subsequently three p orientalis individuals were randomly selected in each treatment for simulated precipitation experiments at rainfall intensity of 1 mm h and no simulated precipitation experiments respectively the precipitation with unlabeled experiment lasted for 30 min three branches three leaves and three roots in each p orientalis individual in the five treatments were collected immediately after 0 min 15 min 30 min 1 h 2 h 4 h 6 h 8 h and 24 h of precipitation the leaf and branch samples were divided into three fractions for later analysis of lmc lwp and isotopes the no precipitation and precipitation experiments had similar sampling times when the 1 mm h precipitation experiment was completed the p orientalis individuals were replaced with another three randomly selected p orientalis individuals for subsequent artificially simulated precipitation similarly the three other p orientalis individuals were randomly selected for simulated precipitation experiments at 5 10 and 15 mm h which were conducted successively after the last precipitation experiment upon completion of the ck simulated precipitation experiment the labeled precipitation an isotope ratio of approximately 600 replaced the unlabeled precipitation an isotope ratio of approximately 67 00 in the simulation experiment the same precipitation gradient set in each treatment was used following the methods described above this is considered the eg table 2 2 4 stable isotope analysis the stable isotope analysis was conducted in the laboratory of eco hydrological processes and mechanisms beijing forestry university beijing china the bark and green parts of the branches and roots were removed subsequently the water in leaves branches and roots was extracted using the cryogenic vacuum distillation approach west et al 2006 the extracted water sample was filtered through a 0 22 ¬µm filter to prevent impurities from affecting the determination of the stable isotopes then the isotope ratio of hydrogen and oxygen in the water samples was measured using a liquid water isotope analyzer lgr dli 100 usa at an accuracy of 0 32 and 0 17 for Œ¥2h and Œ¥18o respectively the measured isotope ratio of hydrogen and oxygen in the water sample is the thousandth difference between the normalized to vienna standard mean ocean water vsmow expressed as 1 Œ¥ x r s a m p l e r s t a n d a r d 1 1000 where x was the 2h or 18o in the water sample from leaves branches or roots rsample and rstandard were the isotope ratio of the samples and vsmow respectively 2 5 data analysis stable isotope technology is an accurate and effective tool that can be used to explore the fwu of plants the presence of the labeled isotope in the leaves branches or roots of p orientalis indicated that p orientalis has fwu or water migrated down to the roots if the fractionation isotope value of water was ignored while migrated down from the leaves based on the principle of isotopic mass conservation a simple binary linear mixed model phillips and gregg 2003 was used to estimate the proportion of fwu and the contribution of reverse transport to the supply of branch and rhizosphere soil expressed as 2 Œ¥ m x 1 Œ¥ s 1 x 2 Œ¥ s 2 3 x 1 x 2 1 where s1 and s2 are the isotope ratio of the precipitation and leaves branches or roots of p orientalis before precipitation m is the mixed isotopic values of leaves branches or roots of p orientalis after precipitation statistical analyses were performed using statistical product and service solutions spss 16 0 a two way analysis of variance anova was used to identify differences in lmc and lmp using the precipitation and treatment factors the partial correlation analysis was used to investigate the effects of precipitation and swc on lmc and lmp a three way anova was used to test the difference in the isotopic values with precipitation treatments and time as factors a three way anova was also used to analyze the difference in water use absorptivity using precipitation treatments and time as the independent factors the least significant difference was used to compare water use absorption when necessary at p 0 05 all data were subjected to normal distribution and homogeneity of variance analyses all of which met the requirements 3 results 3 1 variation of lmc and lwp the lmc and lwp of p orientalis generally increased after precipitation but the degree of increase varied fig 2 before the precipitation event the average lmc of p orientalis in treatments a b c d and e was 14 49 18 35 20 08 23 33 and 26 82 mg cm2 respectively similarly the average lwp of p orientalis in treatments a b c d and e was 3 02 1 93 1 68 1 23 and 0 83mpa respectively the lmc and lwp increased with the increase of swc indicating that the higher the swc the lower the drought stress faced by the plant after precipitation the changes of lmc and lwp of p orientalis increased with the increase of rainfall intensity in treatment a lmc and lwp of p orientalis increased than the other treatments after precipitation the lmc and lwp of p orientalis in treatment a under the rainfall intensity of 15 mm h were 55 36 and 30 87 higher than that of the rainfall intensity of 1 mm h respectively the change in lmc and lwp decreased with the increase of soil water content but increased with the increase of rainfall intensity r 2 0 75 p 0 01 r 2 0 75 p 0 01 fig 3 the results of the multiple regression analysis showed that fwu was only possible when the swc 21 9 the variation of lmc and lwp of p orientalis in treatment a was 3 3 times and 2 63 times greater than treatment d respectively there were no significant differences in lmc and lwp of p orientalis before and after precipitation p 0 05 since the swc in treatment e was 100 of the field water capacity 3 2 variation of the hydrogen isotope ratio in leaves after precipitation in the no precipitation treatment the diurnal Œ¥2h in p orientalis leaf Œ¥2h l peaked 4 h after the start of sampling and then gradually decreased fig 4 the average value of Œ¥2h l was 43 40 and the average range was 18 51 the average Œ¥2h l of treatments a b c d and e were 24 78 36 74 49 24 53 37 and 52 92 respectively before the precipitation the Œ¥2h l in treatments a b c and d of the eg were significantly greater than that of the ck after the precipitation event p 0 05 after the precipitation the Œ¥2h l was significantly higher in eg than in the ck p 0 05 Œ¥2h l enrichment increased with rainfall intensity Œ¥2h l increased to 63 53 at the 15 mm h rainfall intensity treatment significantly higher than at other rainfall intensity treatments p 0 05 the enrichment degree of the isotope values of Œ¥2h l in treatments a b c and d gradually decreased at the same rainfall intensity treatment e did not significantly change the daily variation between eg and ck indicating the lack of fwu in treatment e therefore the lower the swc the greater the rainfall intensity and the apparent isotopic enrichment of leaves 3 3 variation of the hydrogen isotope ratio in branches and roots after precipitation similar to Œ¥2h l the variation range of Œ¥2h in branches of p orientalis Œ¥2h b was less than 3 25 and showed no significant diurnal variation in the ck p 0 05 fig 5 the Œ¥2h b increased significantly at 30 min to 1 h after precipitation and this increase was maintained for 6 8 h the enrichment degree of Œ¥2h b increased with the increase in rainfall intensity and decrease in swc for example the average maximum increase of Œ¥2h b was 26 53 in treatment a which was significantly higher than in treatment b 9 78 p 0 05 the Œ¥2h b of treatments a and b were significantly higher in the eg than in the ck p 0 05 however the Œ¥2h b of treatments c d and e showed no significant difference between eg and ck p 0 05 these results indicated that the branches of p orientalis in treatments a and b underwent fwu while individuals in treatments c d and e did not an indication that some precipitation absorbed by leaves was stored in branches the Œ¥2h in roots of p orientalis Œ¥2h r in treatments a and b was significantly enriched under the rainfall intensity of 10 mm h and 15 mm h respectively in eg fig 6 than in the ck p 0 05 no significant increase of Œ¥2h r was found in other treatments indicating that the precipitation was transported to rhizosphere soil through branches in treatments a and b 3 4 water absorption by plant leaves there was no significant difference in lmc lwp and Œ¥2h l between the eg and ck in treatment e suggesting that fwu of p orientalis does not occur in treatment e therefore this paragraph will focus on the other four treatments i e treatments a b c and d the ratio of fwu of the four treatments to precipitation peaked at 1 2 h after the cessation of precipitation followed by a decrease in fwu ratio fig 7 after 24 h the fwu ratio decreased to approximately 0 the ratio of fwu to precipitation increased with the increase of rainfall intensity and a decrease in swc in the four treatments in treatment a the maximum ratio of fwu to precipitation was 2 77 and 9 52 at the rainfall intensity of 1 and 15 mm h respectively in treatments a and b the average ratio of fwu to precipitation was 4 03 and 2 22 respectively twice that of treatments c 1 95 and d 1 14 4 discussion 4 1 fwu in p orientalis generally soil water is transferred from roots to leaves along the water potential gradient lee et al 2018 therefore the lmc and lwp were directly related to the swc and directly affected by precipitation fang et al 2020 before precipitation there was a good correlation between swc and lmc lwp among the five treatments r2 0 97 indicating that the lower the swc the more serious the water deficit of leaves after precipitation the lmc and lwp increased to different degrees which was especially evident in treatment a which showed an up to 30 increase in lmc and lwp fig 2 similarly a previous study in other areas reported that the lmc and lwp of plants significantly increase after precipitation dawson and goldsmith 2018 berry et al 2019 therefore the more serious the leaf water deficit the more significant the response of fwu to precipitation thus precipitation can alleviate drought effects observed in leaves limm et al 2009 also demonstrated that lmc of sequoia sempervirens could be increased to about 2 11 by fwu in north america this study demonstrated that fwu was dependent on humidity and the response of leaves to precipitation increased with the increase of precipitation fig 3 this may be an adaptive strategy for plants to cope with drought fwu can occur during leaf wetting events such as fog rain snow and morning dew and can occur in plants growing in dryland ecosystems to redwood forests steppe et al 2018 generally vapor pressure deficit humidity and precipitation can be used as indicators to identify the occurrence of fwu vesala et al 2017 however darby et al 2016 found that precipitation more accurately predicted fwu than vapor pressure deficit when determining the water potential difference our study only compared and analyzed the effect of precipitation and swc on fwu and observed fwu in each treatment when swc was 21 9 fig 3 in addition the correlation between swc and lmc lmp was higher than that between precipitation and lmc lmp indicating that the range of swc may be a precondition of fwu moreover the use of swc may be more accurate than using precipitation and vapor pressure deficit to determine fwu 4 2 precipitation absorption ratio by leaves water is an important factor for plant growth and survival barbeito et al 2012 most plants rely on the root system to absorb water to allow for normal growth whereas other plants can rely on their leaves to absorb precipitation to maintain growth and improve water use efficiency mcculloh et al 2014 liu et al 2020 precipitation absorption ratio was not only related to swc but also related to precipitation in this study the proportion of precipitation absorbed by p orientalis leaves was different in treatments a b c and d the precipitation absorption ratio increased with the increase in precipitation and a decrease in swc this was likely due to the difference in the water potential inside and outside the leaves of p orientalis although both the cuticle and stomata allow water exchange between leaves and the atmosphere studies have shown that stomata allow more water in and out than the cuticle villar et al 2010 stomata have high water conductivity and were also the main channel for fwu burgess and dawson 2004 pariyar et al 2017 schreel et al 2019 in addition the water potential gradient was the main driving factor of water exchange in the stomata therefore the water potential difference inside and outside of the leaves was the major factor affecting the fwu the water potential between the leaf and rhizosphere was larger in the treatment with lower swc and greater rainfall intensity the difference in the water potential of leaves was the largest directly after the precipitation event ended therefore the proportion of absorption of water by p orientalis leaves peaked at 1 2 h then the fwu decreased with water potential difference in four treatments fig 2 the evidence presented by the labeled isotope analysis suggests that the water absorbed by the leaves of p orientalis can transport the to xylem fig 4 or the root system fig 5 this may be because there was a large water potential gradient between leaves branches and roots goldsmith 2013 reported a complete reversal of the soil plant atmosphere continuum with a sufficient water potential gradient this has also been observed by david et al 2013 who demonstrated that the reverse migration of water from the leaf to the xylem and root occurs in several forest species in europe cassana et al 2016 also found that the water absorbed by leaves can be transported to roots and released into the soil recent research has demonstrated the possibility of bidirectional exchange of water isotopes between leaves and the atmosphere lehmann et al 2018 the water absorbed by the leaves of p orientalis may also diffuse from stomata for transpiration during reverse transport which leads to a lower isotopic signal in branches and roots compared to that in leaves fwu could be a mechanism for p orientalis to absorb water in dry environments the majority of plant species rely on both the root system to absorb water and can absorb atmospheric water in environments with high humidity goldsmith et al 2013 carter et al 2018 dawson and goldsmith 2018 these findings suggest that p orientalis can uptake water through roots and leaves to alleviate drought stress effectively 5 conclusions in this study labeled isotopes were used to explore whether fwu occurs in p orientalis our overall aims were to distinguish the conditions of fwu and to determine the proportion of leaf to precipitation absorption fwu was observed in each treatment when the swc was 21 9 regardless of the precipitation amount the absorption ratio of precipitation by leaves increased with the increase in rainfall intensity but decreased with the increase in swc the stomata likely controlled by the difference of water potential inside and outside the leaves could be the main

moisture conditions this water use strategy of p orientalis likely contributes to its survival in an arid environment with a lack of water however further studies should be conducted using labeled isotopes to explore the conditions of fwu and the proportion of precipitation absorption in the leaves of plants growing in situ declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no

9968,to meet rising global food demands existing agricultural management strategies will need to be transformed to mitigate the negative impacts of climate change on crop yields climate change which includes elevated co2 temperature increase and change in precipitation variability give rise to uncertainties for predicting crop yields we used a multilayer canopy root soil model mlcan to i explore the adverse impacts of climate change on corn yields and ii investigate three irrigation scheduling methods to improve the yield to estimate crop yields we implemented crop growth processes in mlcan this model was applied to an experimental farm located in urbana illinois usa and was validated using aboveground carbon and leaf area index measurements a weather generator was used to develop forcings corresponding to future climate scenarios climate change scenarios were considered with ambient and elevated co2 concentration 1oc to 3oc temperature increases and precipitation changes the 2oc and 3oc temperature change reduces the crop yields up to 38 the simulation results showed that a 30 decrease in precipitation could reduce the mean yields of up to 10 the three irrigation scheduling methods were applied on dry years as adaptation strategies which were decided based on water balance and two plant attributes of canopy temperature based crop water stress index and leaf water potential the water balance approach was designed to reflect an existing irrigation scheduling method which was found to be not efficient and required more irrigation to improve crop yields under future climate conditions we found that the leaf water potential method was more effective and efficient to improve crop yields under climate change among the three irrigation methods considered in this study keywords climate change crop yield increase irrigation scheduling leaf water potential crop water stress index crop simulation modelling 1 introduction it is necessary to at least double plant based food productivity by 2050s to meet food demands ainsworth et al 2012 climate change has led to increases in atmospheric carbon dioxide co2 concentration and global mean temperature and changes in precipitation patterns pall et al 2011 sch√§r et al 2004 stott et al 2005 the meta analysis of free air co2 enrichment face experiments showed that as co2 concentrations increased plants could maintain high photosynthetic rates by an average of 40 in c3 plants ainsworth rogers 2007 face experiments in c4 plants showed that photosynthesis increased under drought but was not affected under well watered conditions leakey et al 2006 manderscheid et al 2014 markelz et al 2011 on the other hand increased temperature affected crop developments due to increased requirements for water and shortened pre anthesis development stages which overall reduced crop yields woo et al 2020 zhao et al 2017 reported that for each degree celsius increase in the global mean temperature corn yields were reduced by 7 4 however this study only focused on the effects of temperature rise and did not examine other simultaneous influences related to climate change such as elevated co2 concentration and precipitation variability changes in precipitation variability could also accelerate water stress conditions and frequency of extreme events which result in negative consequences for crop yields porter and semenov 2005 increases in temperature co2 concentration and precipitation variability would greatly influence crop growth and yield in this study we examined the simultaneous effects of all these three major factors of climate change on corn yields to ensure food security the rate of improvement in crop yield of cereal crops has fallen rapidly in the last 20 years brisson et al 2010 lobell et al 2009 ray et al 2012 which could be due to the negative effects of climate change on cereal crops one of the possible approaches to mitigate the negative impact of climate change is optimal irrigation management the amount and frequency of irrigation are the main factors of irrigation management irmak et al 2016 irrigation scheduling can be regarded as an important research field and essential for precision irrigation adeyemi et al 2017 jones 2008 in general irrigation scheduling methods are based on parameters which can be measured in the fields the water balance in soil is commonly used method of irrigation scheduling jones 1990 however this approach neglects water requirements and water status in plants when plants are under water stress stomatal closure and leaf canopy temperature tend to increase tanner 1963 was the first to use leaf or canopy temperature as an indicator of plant water stress in the early 1980s idso et al 1981 and jackson et al 1981 developed crop water stress index cwsi idso et al 1981 performed a range of studies to empirically calculate the upper and lower limits of canopy and air temperature differences based on vapour pressure deficit vpd for the computation of cwsi these empirical values of constraints varied by crop species and different agro climatic zones hence jackson et al 1988 developed a theoretical basis to compute these constraints for cwsi the cswi has been effectively used for irrigation scheduling using infrared temperature measurements of fields irmak et al 2000 yuan et al 2004 differences in water potential in different parts of the soil plant atmosphere continuum drive water movement from soil to the atmosphere the water status in the plant can be quantified by measuring or estimating the leaf water potential œàl several studies have related plant water status to œàl deloire et al 2004 jackson 1991 o toole et al 1984 wang et al 2005 and used it for irrigation scheduling baeza et al 2007 girona et al 2006 œàl is generally at its maximum during pre dawn periods turner et al 1986 after which it is highly variable chastain et al 2016 pettigrew 2004 pre dawn œàl has the advantage of being less sensitive than mid day values to environmental fluctuations such as vpd and or cloud cover grimes et al 1987 therefore we used pre dawn œàl as an indicator for irrigation scheduling in this study there are limited studies on cwsi and œàl based irrigation scheduling under climate change we used the model estimated values of evapotranspiration canopy temperature and œàl as indicators of plant water status to determine key properties for irrigation scheduling the objectives of this study are to i explore the effects of climate change elevated co2 temperature rise and precipitation change and variability on corn yields and ii investigate the ability of three alternate irrigation scheduling methods to mitigate the adverse impacts of climate change on corn yields these methods for irrigation scheduling are based on water balance wb cwsi and œàl to account for photosynthetic acclimation under elevated co2 ainsworth and long 2005 we used a validated multilayer canopy soil root system model mlcan drewry et al 2010a 2010b in this study we augmented mlcan with crop growth processes to allow us to capture the impact of climate acclimation on crop yields and used it to develop irrigation scheduling by incorporating wb cwsi and œàl methods the study was carried out in three stages first the model was simulated for the years 2008 2011 when field observations of aboveground carbon mass acm and leaf area index lai were available for model validations second we used a stochastic weather generator to simulate input forcings with precipitation change and variability these weather inputs were used to examine the responses of corn to precipitation change and variability the model was forced using climate change scenarios associated with increases in co2 concentration temperature and change in precipitation variability we then analysed crop yields corresponding to dry years identified from each of the scenarios third three irrigation scheduling methods were used during dry years and we examined these impacts on the crop yield improvements 2 models and methods 2 1 study site we use the data from field experiments conducted from 2008 to 2011 at the experimental farm of energy biosciences institute ebi at the university of illinois at urbana champaign urbana il 40 3 46 209 n 88 11 46 021 w 220 m above sea level the detailed description of the experiment can

may 2011 and harvested on 16 october 2011 we used the published data such as acm and lai from zeri et al 2011 for model validation we utilized hourly observation of atmospheric variables from 2002 to 2011 recorded at the experimental site and nearby willard airport these data included different variables such as incoming shortwave radiation air temperature wind speed relative humidity and precipitation first the numerical model was run for spin up period with corn soybean rotation prior to 2008 to estimate initial soil moisture conditions for the validation period 2008 2011 this was based on the methodology presented in woo et al 2014 weather forcing for spin up period of 30 years was stochastically generated using a weather generator fatichi et al 2011 trained on the data prior to 2008 the simulated acm and lai during the validation period were compared against those of observed data 2 2 ecohydrological model with crop growth process we used mlcan model which has been extensively validated in present and a range of future climate conditions for various ecohydrological systems drewry et al 2010a 2010b le et al 2011 2012 le and kumar 2017 srinivasan et al 2017 roque malo et al 2020 it incorporated the coupled processes of the corn canopy leaf root and soil which are resolved vertically using multi layer discretization of canopy and soil in this study we coupled an allometric crop growth model into mlcan based on liu et al 2016 the outputs of mlcan were photosynthesis rate co2 uptake and respiration rates the latent and sensible heat fluxes that were vertically distributed through the canopy the gross leaf photosynthesis rate was integrated by weighting with the vertical leaf area density to get canopy level estimates the canopy level photosynthesis rate was converted to carbohydrate assimilation the growing degree days gdd were calculated from air temperature and used to decide the growth stages of the crop the crop coefficients which were dependent on growth stages were used to calculate the respiration turnover and death rates in turn these were used to estimate carbon mass using allometric relations in different parts of the plants such as leaf stem root and grain using equations documented in liu et al 2016 moreover the carbon fractions for corn and soybean were utilized from the field experiment of johnson et al 2007 to convert carbon mass to dry weight biomass see eq s1 in supporting information the leaf biomass was multiplied with specific leaf area sla to estimate the lai eq s2 in supporting information sla is leaf area per living leaf biomass in m2 gm 1 which varies from crop to crop cultivar to cultivar and through the growth stages of a crop liu et al 2016 however in this study due to insufficient observations and for simplicity sake we assumed that the sla would be constant throughout the crop growth duration the lai estimated from crop growth process was used as input in each time step simulation of mlcan the grain biomass at harvest date was multiplied by harvest index to calculate crop yields eq s3 in supporting information the framework of mlcan crop growth model is illustrated in fig 1 additional equations and coefficients used in the crop growth processes are presented in supporting information 2 3 simulation scenarios the cmip5 projection under rcp8 5 scenario of years 2050 for midwest usa indicated a decrease in mean seasonal precipitation by 20 30 an increase in precipitation variability coefficient of variation by 10 550 ppm co2 concentration and temperature increase from 1 to 3 http climexp knmi nl compared to the period of 1981 2010 generally climate change studies involve statistically significant variations in the mean states of climate for typically 30 years or more stocker et al 2013 however climate variability also expresses variations that occur within smaller timeframes such as a month a season a year or a decade the precipitation variability is perceived as a change in magnitude duration intensity frequency and shift in timing of the precipitation we conducted studies for changes in precipitation patterns to assess the role of precipitation change and variability on crop yields the observed meteorological variables from 2002 to 2011 were used to train a weather generator fatichi et al 2011 the parameters estimated in the weather generator were modified to generate ten years of meteorological forcings with focus on changes in the mean and coefficient of variations of seasonal precipitation of growing seasons from april to october the 30 reduction in the mean precipitation and no change and 10 increase in the precipitation variability were considered to evaluate the role of temperature increase we also conducted an air temperature sensitivity analysis on crop yields by increasing air temperature at three levels corresponding to 1 2 and 3 increases ten scenarios s1 to s10 used for driving mlcan crop growth model corresponding to climate projections are presented in table 1 to evaluate the role of climate change the mlcan crop growth model was simulated for ambient co2 concentration with no change in temperature and precipitation for ten years 2002 2011 these simulation results serve as control and are referred to as the present climate or baseline period to compare with the results of climate change scenarios the mean percentage differences were computed which correspond to differences between crop yields under future climate scenarios and baseline the dryness index di was computed to separate dry years from each of the scenarios for all conditions the di is the ratio of seasonal actual evapotranspiration aet and potential evapotranspiration pet the aet was simulated from mlcan and pet was estimated using penman monteith equation allen 1998 first di was calculated for the observed years 2002 2011 the mean dimean and standard deviation disd of di was calculated then the di was calculated for each years of the scenarios disce dry years were determined when disce dimean disd subsequently we incorporated various irrigation scheduling methods in mlcan crop growth and only applied irrigations in these dry years 2 4 irrigation scheduling methods 2 4 1 water balance wb based irrigation scheduling the study of andales et al 2011 was a basis for water balance based irrigation scheduling actual evapotranspiration aet expresses water use which is water transferred to the atmosphere from the stored water in the soil precipitation and irrigation the water balance method requires initial soil moisture aet simulated using mlcan crop growth precipitation and available water capacity awc of the soil and the difference between field capacity fc and permanent wilting point pwp awc fc pwp we used the awc value for specific soil from county soil surveys natural resources conservation service 2019 the soil water deficit ds was computed using eq 1 1 d s i d s i 1 aet i p i iw i 1 where i is time step hourly p is precipitation mm and iw is irrigation water mm when ds is more than 50 of awc iw equivalent to 50 of awc would be applied as given below 2 iw i 0 0 5 awc d s i 0 5 awc d s i 0 5 awc the management allowable depletion was set at 50 he et al 2012 2 4 2 crop water stress index cwsi based irrigation scheduling cwsi is the canopy temperature based indicator for crop water stress cwsi is computed as idso et al 1981 3 cwsi t c t a t c t a ll t c t a ul t c t a ll where t c t a is the difference between the average canopy temperature and air temperature t c t a ul and t c t a ll are upper and lower limits of canopy air temperature difference respectively which represents well watered and water stress conditions the leaf temperature t l was determined using a leaf energy balance drewry et al 2010a and vertically averaged over the canopy using vertical leaf area density as weight to compute t c we used simulated average canopy temperature t c and method from jackson et al 1988 to compute the upper and lower limits for upper limit a high water stress condition stomatal conductance g s is 0 and for lower limit no water stress or wet condition g s jackson et al 1988 the irrigation water iw was computed using equation 4 when the cwsi during the daytime exceeds 0 6 the plant becomes under water stress conditions and the irrigation equivalent to 80 of aetcum pcum was applied where aetcum is cumulative actual evapotranspiration and pcum is cumulative precipitation from previous irrigation period 4 iw 0 0 8 aet cum p cum cwsi 0 6 cwsi 0 6 we analysed various simulation results with plausible values of cwsi and fraction of aetcum pcum the maximum yield was found when the threshold cwsi was taken 0 6 and iw was considered 80 of aetcum pcum the same strategy was applied to select the threshold for œàl method described below 2 4 3 leaf water potential œàl based irrigation scheduling leaf water potential œàl captures the plant stress to water under water stress conditions the water movement from root to leaf is low for a long period of time resulting in a low value of œàl we used the simulated œàl of the whole canopy to decide the timing of irrigation since œàl varies considerably during daytime the predawn œàl at 04 00 am was used when its value dropped below a threshold specified as 0 6 mpa the iw equivalent to 80 of aetcum pcum was applied equation 5 5 iw 0 0 8 aet cum p cum œà l 0 6 mpa œà l 0 6 mpa after applying the irrigation we calculated intensified crop yield icy between irrigated and non irrigated years for all conditions the intensified crop yield is the improvement of yield due to irrigation and represents the effectiveness of irrigation methods irrigation water use efficiency iwue was computed to examine the efficiency of irrigation scheduling methods gm grain yield m2 mm which was the ratio between crop yield improvements due to irrigation they were estimated as 6 icy cy wi th irrigation cy without irrigation cy without irrigation 100 7 iwue cy with irrigation cy without irrigation iw where cy is crop yield gm grain yield m2 and iw is total irrigation water applied mm 3 results 3 1 model validation we investigated the accuracy of the mlcan crop growth in terms of the correlation between simulated and observed aboveground carbon mass and lai fig 2 the acm was compared with observations for 2008 2009 and 2011 and the lai was compared with observations for 2009 the mean and standard deviation of simulated acm and lai for the period of 2002 2011 were also presented the simulated acm showed a similar trend to those observed for all 3 years the r2 between simulated and observed acm for years 2008 2009 and 2011 were 0 93 0 93 and 0 91 respectively the simulated acm in the reproductive stage in 2008 and 2011 were underestimated compared to the observation this could be due to the cultivation of legume soybean crop in the previous year that stored nitrogen in the soil which was not incorporated in this study due to model simplicity the simulated and observed lai were well correlated for the year 2009 with r2 of 0 93 most of observed acm and lai were within the standard deviation of the modelled variables for the period of 2002 2011 these results provide confidence in using the model to explore the impacts of climate change on corn yields and the effectiveness of three irrigation methods to mitigate these impacts 3 2 climate change impact assessment the effect of elevated co2 on corn yields showed that the present climate and scenario s1 represented adequate water availability under ambient and elevated co2 concentrations average corn yield slightly increased from 718 18 to 748 33 gm m2 4 2 change the same for water limited condition comparing scenarios s2 and s3 increased mean yield from 603 14 to 677 85 gm m2 12 4 increase under ambient co2 concentration without temperature changes scenario s2 a 30 reduction in mean precipitation reduced mean yields from 718 18 to 603 14 gm m2 16 these same condition under elevated co2 concentration comparison between scenarios s1 and s3 was from 748 33 to 677 85 gm m2 9 4 a 10 increase in inter seasonal precipitation variability pv comparisons between scenarios s3 and s6 and scenarios s7 and s10 was not substantial 1 4 however increases in precipitation variability led to an increase in the number of dry years that resulted in yield variability these results indicate that the use of conventional management practices may not be applicable under pv conditions the 1 increase in temperature offsets the benefits from co2 fertilization effects scenarios s2 and s4 fig 3 the 2 increase in temperature reduced the mean yield from 718 18 present climate to 535 33 gm m2 scenario s5 and to 516 67 gm m2 scenario s9 these differences are 25 46 and 28 06 respectively the 3 increase in temperature compared to present climate reduced the mean yield by 34 65 scenario s6 and 38 42 scenario s10 the mean yield loss of corn was 15 7 each degree change in temperature reduces the mean yield by 10 68 under elevated co2 condition scenario s4 with respect to s3 table 2 the consideration of precipitation variability further intensified the effect of temperature rise on corn yields under elevated co2 without temperature and pv changes scenarios s1 and s3 there were no dry years found the elevated co2 decreased the stomatal conductance that resulted in less water use and fewer dry years changes in temperature and pv increased the number of dry years and yield differences between wet and dry years the rising temperature under elevated co2 condition increased crop water use and consequently the number of dry years these results indicate that for rainfed crops the amount and timing of precipitation and irrigation should be appropriate to maintain stable yields to improve corn yields under climate change for food security we explored irrigation methods in dry years as described next 3 3 irrigation scheduling methods relationships between seasonal precipitation and intensified crop yield resulting from irrigation revealed a negative correlation fig 4 it was modelled scenarios s1 to s10 that the dry years were associated with fewer clouds and hence high solar radiation during the growing seasons the high solar radiation increased photosynthesis when the plant water requirements were maintained using irrigation therefore water stress condition caused by low precipitation increased an opportunity to achieve higher crop yields through water availability achieved by optimal irrigation strategies as mentioned earlier number of dry years were affected by pv and temperature the irrigation scheduling methods specifically œàl effectively increased corn yields in most of dry years year wise results were not shown it is puzzling to decide what the best method is for a particular year in the ambient co2 condition scenario s2 mean yield was intensified by 37 85 using œàl irrigation scheduling the improvement was reached to that amount under elevated co2 conditions when pv and temperature increased under elevated co2 conditions with pm and temperature increases scenarios s4 to s6 the mean yield increased up to 22 using œàl and 18 4 using wb irrigation scheduling methods the effectiveness of œàl was not influenced by temperature changes except for scenario s10 fig 5a scenarios s4 to s6 however in cwsi method the mean icy increased as temperature increased because the cwsi was canopy temperature based index thus it captured the temperature increase in the atmosphere the iwue also showed a similar trend for s4 to s10 the œàl method had the maximum iwue among the irrigation methods considered in this study in contrast the iwue was not changed with increases in pv and temperature scenarios s7 to s10 while using wb and cwsi methods higher temperature increases water uses which could be a reason why low iwue was observed during that condition thus these methods may not be efficient under high temperature and water limiting conditions wb is an et based approach that assumes the amount of water losses is the plant water requirement the plant water requirement varied with growth stages dependant on air temperature when irrigation was applied based on soil water loss and not plant water status irrigation efficiency was reduced the mean iwue in cwsi method was affected by temperature increase which increased water requirements thus low efficiency in this method was obtained iwue was better in œàl method compared to others which showed high water use efficiency for all scenarios considered in this study the leaf water potential drives the water movement in the plant and represents the plant water status this straight representation of water dynamics could be the reason of not being affected by high temperatures therefore the œàl method provided a more robust approach across all the conditions 4 discussion and conclusions this research investigated the potential impacts of climate change on corn yields and compared three irrigation scheduling methods that might be useful in addressing these impacts to achieve these goals crop growth processes were incorporated in the mlcan ecohydrological model by evaluating the model with field observations we found that mlcan crop growth captured variations in corn acm and lai a weather generator was used to generate climate scenarios associated with ambient and elevated co2 concentration three levels of temperature increases and precipitation change and variability the mlcan crop growth model was simulated for corn using these scenarios to evaluate the impacts of climate change on corn furthermore dry years were identified and applied with three types of potential irrigation scheduling methods the simulated outcomes from irrigation scheduling methods were studied to identify that œàl method was the most optimal method under climate change corn a c4 plant does not respond to elevated co2 with increased grain yields provided water supply is sufficient because the photosynthesis of c4 plants is saturated under ambient co2 conditions leakey et al 2006 markelz et al 2011 however elevated co2 and reduced water supply have distinct effects on the c4 plants manderscheid et al 2014 showed increases in c4 crop yields under water limited conditions while consistent with their finding our result revealed that the elevated co2 increases corn yields 12 only under water limited conditions this improved corn yields were less than the study from manderscheid et al 2014 because well watered years were also accounted for in the percentage change in well watered condition the elevated co2 did not improve corn yields which were consistent with the results of several previous studies leakey et al 2006 manderscheid et al 2014 leakey 2009 markelz et al 2011 our simulated result confirmed the applicability of mlcan crop growth model under elevated co2 and water limited conditions temperature increase negatively affected the corn yields we found 10 reduction in corn yields for each degree of temperature increase which was 6 as reported in xu et al 2016 and 7 4 in zhao et al 2017 while using historical data in each oc temperature increase lobell and field 2007 reported 8 3 decrease in a global study lobell and asner 2003 found 17 decline in corn belt usa and kucharik and serbin 2008 found 13 reduction over wisconsin these findings were close to our results except for lobell and asner 2003 who used a statistical relation that neglects the response of temperature on complex soil plant water interactions we considered change in multiple variables increase in temperature under elevated co2 and precipitation change condition and there could be some amount of combination impact on yields climate change was not accounted for in other historical data analysis studies lobell and field 2007 lobell and asner 2003 kucharik serbin 2008 precipitation change and variability induces the water stress condition and reduces corn yields the 30 decline in mean seasonal precipitation showed 16 reduction of corn yields lobell et al 2013 found a 5 6 reduction in crop yields when precipitation decreased by 20 jin et al 2016 analysed the historical data 1980 2013 and found that losses from water stress were more than 10 in several years and peaked at 30 in 2012 wang et al 2016 found total yield reduction due to drought stress up to 17 5 the results of their analysis are consistent to our findings along with the precipitation change we also observed precipitation variability which increased the number of dry years considering the change in all the variables elevated co2 temperature increase and precipitation change and variability the mean corn yield was reduced by 38 cai et al 2009 estimated that corn yield in 2055 is likely to decline by 23 34 xu et al 2016 estimated 30 decrease under rcp8 5 for iowa state tubiello et al 2002 also reported 30 reduction in corn yield under elevated co2 temperature and precipitation change condition in the united states southworth et al 2000 studied two scenarios of climate change in different regions of midwestern united states and concluded that the corn yield declined ranging from 15 1 to 40 under climate variability condition in those regions jeong et al 2019 also estimated 40 decline in corn production under rcp8 5 in the field scale analysis in central illinois of the united states in addition to the overall climate change impact assessment we also identified the number of dry years the key focus was to study the irrigation scheduling methods under climate change we implemented three types of irrigation scheduling methods based on water balance wb crop water stress index cwsi and leaf water potential œàl the change in co2 and temperature affected the effectiveness and efficiency of the irrigation scheduling methods precipitation variability did not considerably affect the applicability of the irrigation methods the wb et based method is an existing irrigation approach used by many agriculturists and researchers colaizzi et al 2017 davis and dukes 2010 ko and piccinni 2009 the major question here is will the existing method be applicable in the future climatic conditions this study attempted to answer this important question we found that wb method increased the crop yield under high temperature and precipitation variability scenario however the irrigation water use was relatively high thus it may not be feasible under water limiting conditions the cwsi method also proved to be effective and efficient the œàl method can improve iwue by 1 02 gm m2 mm and average yield by 36 respectively under climate change scenario s10 overall average intensified crop yield in future condition was approximately similar for all the methods iwue estimates were maximized when using the œàl method it was found that the œàl method was the optimal method and it would be still applicable in limited water situation these irrigation scheduling methods have not been studied before considering future climate condition the studies under present or historical data on wb djaman et al 2018 colaizzi et al 2017 davis and dukes 2010 payero et al 2006 cwsi o shaughnessy et al 2017 khorsand et al 2019 carroll et al 2017 irmak et al 2000 and œàl katerji et al 2004 were conducted in different regions and used different strategies to apply irrigation while consistent from previous findings our study also concludes that the existing method of irrigation scheduling wb would not be efficient in the future the œàl method was the most efficient and effective method under climate change it is challenging to decide which irrigation method would be optimal before planting to resolve this and further improve the robustness of the irrigation scheduling method the ensemble of irrigation scheduling methods should be developed with multiple ecohydrological properties such as canopy temperature leaf water potential stomatal conductance and evapotranspiration nitrogen management strategy has potential to further improve crop yields however these considerations were beyond the scope of this study in this study we demonstrated that 1 corn yield was negatively affected by temperature and precipitation change and variability 2 the existing irrigation scheduling method wb based was not efficient under water limited condition and 3 œàl method was found most effective and efficient compare to other methods to mitigate the impacts of

9968,to meet rising global food demands existing agricultural management strategies will need to be transformed to mitigate the negative impacts of climate change on crop yields climate change which includes elevated co2 temperature increase and change in precipitation variability give rise to uncertainties for predicting crop yields we used a multilayer canopy root soil model mlcan to i explore the adverse impacts of climate change on corn yields and ii investigate three irrigation scheduling methods to improve the yield to estimate crop yields we implemented crop growth processes in mlcan this model was applied to an experimental farm located in urbana illinois usa and was validated using aboveground carbon and leaf area index measurements a weather generator was used to develop forcings corresponding to future climate scenarios climate change scenarios were considered with ambient and elevated co2 concentration 1oc to 3oc temperature increases and precipitation changes the 2oc and 3oc temperature change reduces the crop yields up to 38 the simulation results showed that a 30 decrease in precipitation could reduce the mean yields of up to 10 the three irrigation scheduling methods were applied on dry years as adaptation strategies which were decided based on water balance and two plant attributes of canopy temperature based crop water stress index and leaf water potential the water balance approach was designed to reflect an existing irrigation scheduling method which was found to be not efficient and required more irrigation to improve crop yields under future climate conditions we found that the leaf water potential method was more effective and efficient to improve crop yields under climate change among the three irrigation methods considered in this study keywords climate change crop yield increase irrigation scheduling leaf water potential crop water stress index crop simulation modelling 1 introduction it is necessary to at least double plant based food productivity by 2050s to meet food demands ainsworth et al 2012 climate change has led to increases in atmospheric carbon dioxide co2 concentration and global mean temperature and changes in precipitation patterns pall et al 2011 sch√§r et al 2004 stott et al 2005 the meta analysis of free air co2 enrichment face experiments showed that as co2 concentrations increased plants could maintain high photosynthetic rates by an average of 40 in c3 plants ainsworth rogers 2007 face experiments in c4 plants showed that photosynthesis increased under drought but was not affected under well watered conditions leakey et al 2006 manderscheid et al 2014 markelz et al 2011 on the other hand increased temperature affected crop developments due to increased requirements for water and shortened pre anthesis development stages which overall reduced crop yields woo et al 2020 zhao et al 2017 reported that for each degree celsius increase in the global mean temperature corn yields were reduced by 7 4 however this study only focused on the effects of temperature rise and did not examine other simultaneous influences related to climate change such as elevated co2 concentration and precipitation variability changes in precipitation variability could also accelerate water stress conditions and frequency of extreme events which result in negative consequences for crop yields porter and semenov 2005 increases in temperature co2 concentration and precipitation variability would greatly influence crop growth and yield in this study we examined the simultaneous effects of all these three major factors of climate change on corn yields to ensure food security the rate of improvement in crop yield of cereal crops has fallen rapidly in the last 20 years brisson et al 2010 lobell et al 2009 ray et al 2012 which could be due to the negative effects of climate change on cereal crops one of the possible approaches to mitigate the negative impact of climate change is optimal irrigation management the amount and frequency of irrigation are the main factors of irrigation management irmak et al 2016 irrigation scheduling can be regarded as an important research field and essential for precision irrigation adeyemi et al 2017 jones 2008 in general irrigation scheduling methods are based on parameters which can be measured in the fields the water balance in soil is commonly used method of irrigation scheduling jones 1990 however this approach neglects water requirements and water status in plants when plants are under water stress stomatal closure and leaf canopy temperature tend to increase tanner 1963 was the first to use leaf or canopy temperature as an indicator of plant water stress in the early 1980s idso et al 1981 and jackson et al 1981 developed crop water stress index cwsi idso et al 1981 performed a range of studies to empirically calculate the upper and lower limits of canopy and air temperature differences based on vapour pressure deficit vpd for the computation of cwsi these empirical values of constraints varied by crop species and different agro climatic zones hence jackson et al 1988 developed a theoretical basis to compute these constraints for cwsi the cswi has been effectively used for irrigation scheduling using infrared temperature measurements of fields irmak et al 2000 yuan et al 2004 differences in water potential in different parts of the soil plant atmosphere continuum drive water movement from soil to the atmosphere the water status in the plant can be quantified by measuring or estimating the leaf water potential œàl several studies have related plant water status to œàl deloire et al 2004 jackson 1991 o toole et al 1984 wang et al 2005 and used it for irrigation scheduling baeza et al 2007 girona et al 2006 œàl is generally at its maximum during pre dawn periods turner et al 1986 after which it is highly variable chastain et al 2016 pettigrew 2004 pre dawn œàl has the advantage of being less sensitive than mid day values to environmental fluctuations such as vpd and or cloud cover grimes et al 1987 therefore we used pre dawn œàl as an indicator for irrigation scheduling in this study there are limited studies on cwsi and œàl based irrigation scheduling under climate change we used the model estimated values of evapotranspiration canopy temperature and œàl as indicators of plant water status to determine key properties for irrigation scheduling the objectives of this study are to i explore the effects of climate change elevated co2 temperature rise and precipitation change and variability on corn yields and ii investigate the ability of three alternate irrigation scheduling methods to mitigate the adverse impacts of climate change on corn yields these methods for irrigation scheduling are based on water balance wb cwsi and œàl to account for photosynthetic acclimation under elevated co2 ainsworth and long 2005 we used a validated multilayer canopy soil root system model mlcan drewry et al 2010a 2010b in this study we augmented mlcan with crop growth processes to allow us to capture the impact of climate acclimation on crop yields and used it to develop irrigation scheduling by incorporating wb cwsi and œàl methods the study was carried out in three stages first the model was simulated for the years 2008 2011 when field observations of aboveground carbon mass acm and leaf area index lai were available for model validations second we used a stochastic weather generator to simulate input forcings with precipitation change and variability these weather inputs were used to examine the responses of corn to precipitation change and variability the model was forced using climate change scenarios associated with increases in co2 concentration temperature and change in precipitation variability we then analysed crop yields corresponding to dry years identified from each of the scenarios third three irrigation scheduling methods were used during dry years and we examined these impacts on the crop yield improvements 2 models and methods 2 1 study site we use the data from field experiments conducted from 2008 to 2011 at the experimental farm of energy biosciences institute ebi at the university of illinois at urbana champaign urbana il 40 3 46 209 n 88 11 46 021 w 220 m above sea level the detailed description of the experiment can be found in anderson teixeira et al 2013 smith et al 2013 woo et al 2014 zeri et al 2011 in the first year of the experiment the corn was planted on 6 may 2008 and harvested on 28 october 2008 corn was replanted on 12 may 2009 and harvested on 3 november 2009 the same field was used to plant soybean on 25 may 2010 and it was harvested on 12 october 2010 that was followed by corn planted on 14 may 2011 and harvested on 16 october 2011 we used the published data such as acm and lai from zeri et al 2011 for model validation we utilized hourly observation of atmospheric variables from 2002 to 2011 recorded at the experimental site and nearby willard airport these data included different variables such as incoming shortwave radiation air temperature wind speed relative humidity and precipitation first the numerical model was run for spin up period with corn soybean rotation prior to 2008 to estimate initial soil moisture conditions for the validation period 2008 2011 this was based on the methodology presented in woo et al 2014 weather forcing for spin up period of 30 years was stochastically generated using a weather generator fatichi et al 2011 trained on the data prior to 2008 the simulated acm and lai during the validation period were compared against those of observed data 2 2 ecohydrological model with crop growth process we used mlcan model which has been extensively validated in present and a range of future climate conditions for various ecohydrological systems drewry et al 2010a 2010b le et al 2011 2012 le and kumar 2017 srinivasan et al 2017 roque malo et al 2020 it incorporated the coupled processes of the corn canopy leaf root and soil which are resolved vertically using multi layer discretization of canopy and soil in this study we coupled an allometric crop growth model into mlcan based on liu et al 2016 the outputs of mlcan were photosynthesis rate co2 uptake and respiration rates the latent and sensible heat fluxes that were vertically distributed through the canopy the gross leaf photosynthesis rate was integrated by weighting with the vertical leaf area density to get canopy level estimates the canopy level photosynthesis rate was converted to carbohydrate assimilation the growing degree days gdd were calculated from air temperature and used to decide the growth stages of the crop the crop coefficients which were dependent on growth stages were used to calculate the respiration turnover and death rates in turn these were used to estimate carbon mass using allometric relations in different parts of the plants such as leaf stem root and grain using equations documented in liu et al 2016 moreover the carbon fractions for corn and soybean were utilized from the field experiment of johnson et al 2007 to convert carbon mass to dry weight biomass see eq s1 in supporting information the leaf biomass was multiplied with specific leaf area sla to estimate the lai eq s2 in supporting information sla is leaf area per living leaf biomass in m2 gm 1 which varies from crop to crop cultivar to cultivar and through the growth stages of a crop liu et al 2016 however in this study due to insufficient observations and for simplicity sake we assumed that the sla would be constant throughout the crop growth duration the lai estimated from crop growth process was used as input in each time step simulation of mlcan the grain biomass at harvest date was multiplied by harvest index to calculate crop yields eq s3 in supporting information the framework of mlcan crop growth model is illustrated in fig 1 additional equations and coefficients used in the crop growth processes are presented in supporting information 2 3 simulation scenarios the cmip5 projection under rcp8 5 scenario of years 2050 for midwest usa indicated a decrease in mean seasonal precipitation by 20 30 an increase in precipitation variability coefficient of variation by 10 550 ppm co2 concentration and temperature increase from 1 to 3 http climexp knmi nl compared to the period of 1981 2010 generally climate change studies involve statistically significant variations in the mean states of climate for typically 30 years or more stocker et al 2013 however climate variability also expresses variations that occur within smaller timeframes such as a month a season a year or a decade the precipitation variability is perceived as a change in magnitude duration intensity frequency and shift in timing of the precipitation we conducted studies for changes in precipitation patterns to assess the role of precipitation change and variability on crop yields the observed meteorological variables from 2002 to 2011 were used to train a weather generator fatichi et al 2011 the parameters estimated in the weather generator were modified to generate ten years of meteorological forcings with focus on changes in the mean and coefficient of variations of seasonal precipitation of growing seasons from april to october the 30 reduction in the mean precipitation and no change and 10 increase in the precipitation variability were considered to evaluate the role of temperature increase we also conducted an air temperature sensitivity analysis on crop yields by increasing air temperature at three levels corresponding to 1 2 and 3 increases ten scenarios s1 to s10 used for driving mlcan crop growth model corresponding to climate projections are presented in table 1 to evaluate the role of climate change the mlcan crop growth model was simulated for ambient co2 concentration with no change in temperature and precipitation for ten years 2002 2011 these simulation results serve as control and are referred to as the present climate or baseline period to compare with the results of climate change scenarios the mean percentage differences were computed which correspond to differences between crop yields under future climate scenarios and baseline the dryness index di was computed to separate dry years from each of the scenarios for all conditions the di is the ratio of seasonal actual evapotranspiration aet and potential evapotranspiration pet the aet was simulated from mlcan and pet was estimated using penman monteith equation allen 1998 first di was calculated for the observed years 2002 2011 the mean dimean and standard deviation disd of di was calculated then the di was calculated for each years of the scenarios disce dry years were determined when disce dimean disd subsequently we incorporated various irrigation scheduling methods in mlcan crop growth and only applied irrigations in these dry years 2 4 irrigation scheduling methods 2 4 1 water balance wb based irrigation scheduling the study of andales et al 2011 was a basis for water balance based irrigation scheduling actual evapotranspiration aet expresses water use which is water transferred to the atmosphere from the stored water in the soil precipitation and irrigation the water balance method requires initial soil moisture aet simulated using mlcan crop growth precipitation and available water capacity awc of the soil and the difference between field capacity fc and permanent wilting point pwp awc fc pwp we used the awc value for specific soil from county soil surveys natural resources conservation service 2019 the soil water deficit ds was computed using eq 1 1 d s i d s i 1 aet i p i iw i 1 where i is time step hourly p is precipitation mm and iw is irrigation water mm when ds is more than 50 of awc iw equivalent to 50 of awc would be applied as given below 2 iw i 0

indicator for crop water stress cwsi is computed as idso et al 1981 3 cwsi t c t a t c t a ll t c t a ul t c t a ll where t c t a is the difference between the average canopy temperature and air temperature t c t a ul and t c t a ll are upper and lower limits of canopy air temperature difference respectively which represents well watered and water stress conditions the leaf temperature t l was determined using a leaf energy balance drewry et al 2010a and vertically averaged over the canopy using vertical leaf area density as weight to compute t c we used simulated average canopy temperature t c and method from jackson et al 1988 to compute the upper and lower limits for upper limit a high water stress condition stomatal conductance g s is 0 and for lower limit no water stress or wet condition g s jackson et al 1988 the irrigation water iw was computed using equation 4 when the cwsi during the daytime exceeds 0 6 the plant becomes under water stress conditions and the irrigation equivalent to 80 of aetcum pcum was applied where aetcum is cumulative actual evapotranspiration and pcum is cumulative precipitation from previous irrigation period 4 iw 0 0 8 aet cum p cum cwsi 0 6 cwsi 0 6 we analysed various simulation results with plausible values of cwsi and fraction of aetcum pcum the maximum yield was found when the threshold cwsi was taken 0 6 and iw was considered 80 of aetcum pcum the same strategy was applied to select the threshold for œàl method described below 2 4 3 leaf water potential œàl based irrigation scheduling leaf water potential œàl captures the plant stress to water under water stress conditions the water movement from root to leaf is low for a long period of time resulting in a low value of œàl we used the simulated œàl of the whole canopy to decide the timing of irrigation since œàl varies considerably during daytime the predawn œàl at 04 00 am was used when its value dropped below a threshold specified as 0 6 mpa the iw equivalent to 80 of aetcum pcum was applied equation 5 5 iw 0 0 8 aet cum p cum œà l 0 6 mpa œà l 0 6 mpa after applying the irrigation we calculated intensified crop yield icy between irrigated and non irrigated years for all conditions the intensified crop yield is the improvement of yield due to irrigation and represents the effectiveness of irrigation methods irrigation water use efficiency iwue was computed to examine the efficiency of irrigation scheduling methods gm grain yield m2 mm which was the ratio between crop yield improvements due to irrigation they were estimated as 6 icy cy wi th irrigation cy without irrigation cy without irrigation 100 7 iwue cy with irrigation cy without irrigation iw where cy is crop yield gm grain yield m2 and iw is total irrigation water applied mm 3 results 3 1 model validation we investigated the accuracy of the mlcan crop growth in terms of the correlation between simulated and observed aboveground carbon mass and lai fig 2 the acm was compared with observations for 2008 2009 and 2011 and the lai was compared with observations for 2009 the mean and standard deviation of simulated acm and lai for the period of 2002 2011 were also presented the simulated acm showed a similar trend to those observed for all 3 years the r2 between simulated and observed acm for years 2008 2009 and 2011 were 0 93 0 93 and 0 91 respectively the simulated acm in the reproductive stage in 2008 and 2011 were underestimated compared to the observation this could be due to the cultivation of legume soybean crop in the previous year that stored nitrogen in the soil which was not incorporated in this study due to model simplicity the simulated and observed lai were well correlated for the year 2009 with r2 of 0 93 most of observed acm and lai were within the standard deviation of the modelled variables for the period of 2002 2011 these results provide confidence in using the model to explore the impacts of climate change on corn yields and the effectiveness of three irrigation methods to mitigate these impacts 3 2 climate change impact assessment the effect of elevated co2 on corn yields showed that the present climate and scenario s1 represented adequate water availability under ambient and elevated co2 concentrations average corn yield slightly increased from 718 18 to 748 33 gm m2 4 2 change the same for water limited condition comparing scenarios s2 and s3 increased mean yield from 603 14 to 677 85 gm m2 12 4 increase under ambient co2 concentration without temperature changes scenario s2 a 30 reduction in mean precipitation reduced mean yields from 718 18 to 603 14 gm m2 16 these same condition under elevated co2 concentration comparison between scenarios s1 and s3 was from 748 33 to 677 85 gm m2 9 4 a 10 increase in inter seasonal precipitation variability pv comparisons between scenarios s3 and s6 and scenarios s7 and s10 was not substantial 1 4 however increases in precipitation variability led to an increase in the number of dry years that resulted in yield variability these results indicate that the use of conventional management practices may not be applicable under pv conditions the 1 increase in temperature offsets the benefits from co2 fertilization effects scenarios s2 and s4 fig 3 the 2 increase in temperature reduced the mean yield from 718 18 present climate to 535 33 gm m2 scenario s5 and to 516 67 gm m2 scenario s9 these differences are 25 46 and 28 06 respectively the 3 increase in temperature compared to present climate reduced the mean yield by 34 65 scenario s6 and 38 42 scenario s10 the mean yield loss of corn was 15 7 each degree change in temperature reduces the mean yield by 10 68 under elevated co2 condition scenario s4 with respect to s3 table 2 the consideration of precipitation variability further intensified the effect of temperature rise on corn yields under elevated co2 without temperature and pv changes scenarios s1 and s3 there were no dry years found the elevated co2 decreased the stomatal conductance that resulted in less water use and fewer dry years changes in temperature and pv increased the number of dry years and yield differences between wet and dry years the rising temperature under elevated co2 condition increased crop water use and consequently the number of dry years these results indicate that for rainfed crops the amount and timing of precipitation and irrigation should be appropriate to maintain stable yields to improve corn yields under climate change for food security we explored irrigation methods in dry years as described next 3 3 irrigation scheduling methods relationships between seasonal precipitation and intensified crop yield resulting from irrigation revealed a negative correlation fig 4 it was modelled scenarios s1 to s10 that the dry years were associated with fewer clouds and hence high solar radiation during the growing seasons the high solar radiation increased photosynthesis when the plant water requirements were maintained using irrigation therefore water stress condition caused by low precipitation increased an opportunity to achieve higher crop yields through water availability achieved by optimal irrigation strategies as mentioned earlier number of dry years were affected by pv and temperature the irrigation scheduling methods specifically œàl effectively increased corn yields in most of dry years year wise results were not shown it is puzzling to decide what the best method is for a particular year in the ambient co2 condition scenario s2 mean yield was intensified by 37 85 using œàl irrigation scheduling the improvement was reached to that amount under elevated co2 conditions when pv and temperature increased under elevated co2 conditions with pm and temperature increases scenarios s4 to s6 the mean yield increased up to 22 using œàl and 18 4 using wb irrigation scheduling methods the effectiveness of œàl was not influenced by temperature changes except for scenario s10 fig 5a scenarios s4 to s6 however in cwsi method the mean icy increased as temperature increased because the cwsi was canopy temperature based index thus it captured the temperature increase in the atmosphere the iwue also showed a similar trend for s4 to s10 the œàl method had the maximum iwue among the irrigation methods considered in this study in contrast the iwue was not changed with increases in pv and temperature scenarios s7 to s10 while using wb and cwsi methods higher temperature increases water uses which could be a reason why low iwue was observed during that condition thus these methods may not be efficient under high temperature and water limiting conditions wb is an et based approach that assumes the amount of water losses is the plant water requirement the plant water requirement varied with growth stages dependant on air temperature when irrigation was applied based on soil water loss and not plant water status irrigation efficiency was reduced the mean iwue in cwsi method was affected by temperature increase which increased water requirements thus low efficiency in this method was obtained iwue was better in œàl method compared to others which showed high water use efficiency for all scenarios considered in this study the leaf water potential drives the water movement in the plant and represents the plant water status this straight representation of water dynamics could be the reason of not being affected by high temperatures therefore the œàl method provided a more robust approach across all the conditions 4 discussion and conclusions this research investigated the potential impacts of climate change on corn yields and compared three irrigation scheduling methods that might be useful in addressing these impacts to achieve these goals crop growth processes were incorporated in the mlcan ecohydrological model by evaluating the model with field observations we found that mlcan crop growth captured variations in corn acm and lai a weather generator was used to generate climate scenarios associated with ambient and elevated co2 concentration three levels of temperature increases and precipitation change and variability the mlcan crop growth model was simulated for corn using these scenarios to evaluate the impacts of climate change on corn furthermore dry years were identified and applied with three types of potential irrigation scheduling methods the simulated outcomes from irrigation scheduling methods were studied to identify that œàl method was the most optimal method under climate change corn a c4 plant does not respond to elevated co2 with increased grain yields provided water supply is sufficient because the photosynthesis of c4 plants is saturated under ambient co2 conditions leakey et al 2006 markelz et al 2011 however elevated co2 and reduced water supply have distinct effects on the c4 plants manderscheid et al 2014 showed increases in c4 crop yields under water limited conditions while consistent with their finding our result revealed that the elevated co2 increases corn yields 12 only under water limited conditions this improved corn yields were less than the study from manderscheid et al 2014 because well watered years were also accounted for in the percentage change in well watered condition the elevated co2 did not improve corn yields which were consistent with the results of several previous studies leakey et al 2006 manderscheid et al 2014 leakey 2009 markelz et al 2011 our simulated result confirmed the applicability of mlcan crop growth model under elevated co2 and water limited conditions temperature increase negatively affected the corn yields we found 10 reduction in corn yields for each degree of temperature increase which was 6 as reported in xu et al 2016 and 7 4 in zhao et al 2017 while using historical data in each oc temperature increase lobell and field 2007 reported 8 3 decrease in a global study lobell and asner 2003 found 17 decline in corn belt usa and kucharik and serbin 2008 found 13 reduction over wisconsin these findings were close to our results except for lobell and asner 2003 who used a statistical relation that neglects the response of temperature on complex soil plant water interactions we considered change in multiple variables increase in temperature under elevated co2 and precipitation change condition and there could be some amount of combination impact on yields climate change was not accounted for in other historical data analysis studies lobell and field 2007 lobell and asner 2003 kucharik serbin 2008 precipitation change and variability induces the water stress condition and reduces corn yields the 30 decline in mean seasonal precipitation showed 16 reduction of corn yields lobell et al 2013 found a 5 6 reduction in crop yields when precipitation decreased by 20 jin et al 2016 analysed the historical data 1980 2013 and found that losses from water stress were more than 10 in several years and peaked at 30 in 2012 wang et al 2016 found total yield reduction due to drought stress up to 17 5 the results of their analysis are consistent to our findings along with the precipitation change we also observed precipitation variability which increased the number of dry years considering the change in all the variables elevated co2 temperature increase and precipitation change and variability the mean corn yield was reduced by 38 cai et al 2009 estimated that corn yield in 2055 is likely to decline by 23 34 xu et al 2016 estimated 30 decrease under rcp8 5 for iowa state tubiello et al 2002 also reported 30 reduction in corn yield under elevated co2 temperature and precipitation change condition in the united states southworth et al 2000 studied two scenarios of climate change in different regions of midwestern united states and concluded that the corn yield declined ranging from 15 1 to 40 under climate variability condition in those regions jeong et al 2019 also estimated 40 decline in corn production under rcp8 5 in the field scale analysis in central illinois of the united states in addition to the overall climate change impact assessment we also identified the number of dry years the key focus was to study the irrigation scheduling methods under climate change we implemented three types of irrigation scheduling methods based on water balance wb crop water stress index cwsi and leaf water potential œàl the change in co2 and temperature affected the effectiveness and efficiency of the irrigation scheduling methods precipitation variability did not considerably affect the applicability of the irrigation methods the wb et based method is an existing irrigation approach used by many agriculturists and researchers colaizzi et al 2017 davis and dukes 2010 ko and piccinni 2009 the major question here is will the existing method be applicable in the future climatic conditions this study attempted to answer this important question we found that wb method increased the crop yield under high temperature and precipitation variability scenario however the irrigation water use was relatively high thus it may not be feasible under water limiting conditions the cwsi method also proved to be effective and efficient the œàl method can improve iwue by 1 02 gm m2 mm and average yield by 36 respectively under climate change scenario s10 overall average intensified crop yield in future condition was approximately similar for all the methods iwue estimates were maximized when using the œàl method it was found that the œàl method was the optimal method and it would be still applicable in limited water situation these irrigation scheduling methods have not been studied before considering future climate condition the studies under present or historical data on wb djaman et al 2018 colaizzi et al 2017 davis and dukes 2010 payero et al 2006 cwsi o shaughnessy et al 2017 khorsand et al 2019 carroll et al 2017 irmak et al 2000 and œàl katerji et al 2004 were conducted in different regions and used different strategies to apply irrigation while consistent from previous findings our study also concludes that the existing method of irrigation scheduling wb would not be efficient in the future the œàl method was the most efficient and effective method under climate change it is challenging to decide which irrigation method would be optimal before planting to resolve this and further improve the robustness of the irrigation scheduling method the ensemble of irrigation scheduling methods should be developed with multiple ecohydrological properties such as canopy temperature leaf water potential stomatal conductance and evapotranspiration nitrogen management strategy has potential to further improve crop yields however these considerations were beyond the scope of this study in this study we demonstrated that 1 corn yield was negatively affected by temperature and precipitation change and variability 2 the existing irrigation scheduling method wb based was not efficient under water limited condition and 3 œàl method was found most effective and efficient compare to other methods to mitigate the impacts of

9969,dew is a frequently observed meteorological phenomenon and its importance to the water balance in arid and semi arid regions has been recognized the focus of our study was to evaluate the potential significance of leaf wetting by dew on semi arid crop production in terms of its effects on plant physiological functions we conducted a field experiment in a maizefield in northwest china leaf wetting by dew occurred on 45 of days during cultivation periods and leaf water potential was higher for leaves wetted by dew than for those not wetted during the morning in addition we conducted a potted maize control experiment consisting of four treatments two different soil water treatments water stressed and well watered and two different leaf wetting treatments with and without leaf wetting the water stressed treatment strongly inhibited plant physiological functions decrease in leaf water potential stomatal closure decrease in photosynthetic rate therefore growth rate decreased however in the water stressed with leaf wetting plot the maize leaves absorbed water from their surfaces during nighttime which significantly increased pre dawn leaf water potential consequently this plot showed a higher photosynthetic rate than did the water stressed without leaf wetting plot during daytime the positive effects of leaf wetting on plant physiological functions were not explicit in the well watered plots we assumed that the positive effects of leaf wetting were mainly manifest as effects on plant water relations such effects may be limited when plants have sufficient water as a result water stressed plants with leaf wetting showed greater water use efficiency our results indicate the importance of leaf wetting by dew as a water resource in semi arid crop production owing its effects on plant physiological functions keywords zea mays cornfield water use efficiency irrigation water stress plant water relations 1 introduction water is an essential resource for agricultural production however recent studies have predicted that the risk of water shortage will further increase in the near future ipcc 2013 the risk of water shortage is high in arid and semi arid regions which are home to approximately 38 of the global population huang et al 2016 therefore a more efficient use of water in agricultural production is required to sustain the food supply especially in arid and semi arid regions where crop yields are strongly dependent on the availability of water resources fischer et al 2007 it was previously considered that precipitation and irrigation were the only means of water input to agricultural production however it has more recently been recognized that non metric water inputs such as dew and fog serve as essential water sources for plants in many ecosystems zhuang and ratcliffe 2012 baguskas et al 2017 eller et al 2017 dew is a widely observed meteorological phenomenon and its potential significance as a water resource in arid and semi arid ecosystems has been reported vuollekoski et al 2015 zhang et al 2015 zhang et al 2019a 2019b aguirre guti√©rrez et al 2019 reported that dew accounted for up to 10 2 of the annual water input and 33 6 of the total dry season precipitation in a continental semi arid grassland dew harvesting using a dew condenser has been reported as a means of utilizing dew as a water resource maestre valero et al 2015 tomaszkiewicz et al 2017a 2017b showed that irrigation with harvested dew could significantly increase soil water content and could be utilized in reforestation and the growing of crops in arid and semi arid environments although the importance of dew has been recognized its significance as a water resource is often evaluated based on amount which might underestimate its relevance since the amount of dew water is much smaller than that of conventional water resources i e irrigation water and precipitation zhang et al 2015 zhang et al 2019a 2019b nevertheless dew can have significant effects on crop production through leaf wetting and subsequent effects on plant physiological functions direct water absorption from the leaf surface known as foliar water uptake is one of the important effects of leaf wetting on plant physiological functions martin and von willert 2000 simonin et al 2009 eller et al 2013 subsidiary to root water uptake foliar water uptake can be a significant water acquisition pathway that contributes to improvements in plant water relations and consequently mitigates decrease in photosynthetic rate increasing a plant s chances of survival under drought conditions martin and von willert 2000 simonin et al 2009 eller et al 2013 leaf wetting can also improve plant water relations by mitigating excessive transpirational water loss leaf wetting increases humidity near the leaf surface and suppresses increases in leaf temperature which leads to a decrease in evaporative demand and can contribute to limiting a midday depression in photosynthesis yasutake et al 2015 yokoyama et al 2019 overall these studies suggest that leaf wetting by dew would have significant effects on agricultural production through its effects on plant physiological functions even though the amount of dew present is small therefore the potential of dew as a water resource should also be evaluated in terms of its effects on plant physiological functions although recent studies have reported the positive effects of leaf wetting it has also been considered to negatively affect photosynthesis this is because the presence of water droplets or a water film on a leaf surface occludes the stomata causing a physical barrier to co2 uptake since co2 diffusion in water is much slower than that in air ishibashi and terashima 1995 hanba et al 2004 in contrast berry and goldsmith 2020 reported that leaf wetting decreases photosynthetic rate only for leaf surfaces without stomata indicating that the blockage of co2 uptake by leaf surface water is not the only factor involved in the short term photosynthetic response to leaf wetting how leaf wetting affects gas exchange is still not well understood however it is likely that the photosynthetic rate tends to decrease when the leaf surface is covered with water aparecido et al 2017 berry and goldsmith 2020 based on recent studies leaf wetting affects plant physiological functions both positively and negatively depending on environmental and plant physiological conditions leaf wetting may temporarily decrease the photosynthetic rate when a leaf is wet however at the same time transpiration rate can also decrease with leaf wetting a reduction in transpiration rate would be beneficial to plants in terms of mitigating water stress at times of high evaporative demand yokoyama et al 2019 consequently leaf wetting would increase the photosynthetic rate in the long term by mitigating water stress in addition leaf wetting by dew at nighttime contributes to improving plant water relations owing to foliar water uptake which indirectly affects daytime gas exchange overall to assess the effects of dew on plant physiological functions a comprehensive investigation with consideration of the tradeoff between carbon and water relations is needed dawson and goldsmith 2018 northwest china is an appropriate location for studying the effects of dew on agricultural production as it is an important agricultural region of china moreover the region has a mostly arid and semi arid climate and the imbalance between the supply and demand of water resources is a serious problem agricultural production accounts for about 90 of the total water consumption therefore measures to address water resource issues in agricultural production are needed shen et al 2013 it has been reported that dew frequently occurs in this region and its importance to the water balance in the region has been reported in several studies zhuang and zhao 2014 zhang et al 2015 meng and wen 2016 jia et al 2019 however there are few studies investigating the effects of leaf wetting by dew on plant physiological functions in this region zhang et al 2012 in particular there is a lack of information on how leaf wetting by dew affects plant physiological functions in crops and its potential significance for agricultural production the overall aim of this study was to investigate the impact of leaf wetting by dew on crop production in a semi arid environment in terms of its effects on plant physiological functions the specific aims are 1 to investigate the frequency and duration of leaf wetting by dew through the maize cultivation periods and to evaluate its effects on leaf water potential in a semi arid maizefield of northwest china and 2 to evaluate the effects of leaf wetting by dew on plant physiological functions such as plant water relations and gas exchange by greenhouse experiments and 3 to investigate the effects of leaf wetting by dew on plant water used efficiency by greenhouse experiments 2 materials and methods 2 1 field experiment 2 1 1 study site field observation was conducted on a maizefield in pingbu village baiyin city gansu province n 36 25

porosity were 1 60 g cm 3 2 71 g cm 3 and 0 40 cm3 cm 3 respectively yoshikoshi et al 2009 maize zea mays l cv kenyu90 is mainly cultivated in the field from late april to early october with several times of surface irrigation 2 1 2 leaf wetting by dew and leaf water potential measurements the occurrence and disappearance of dew during the cultivation periods were observed using leaf wetness sensors phytos 31 meter group inc pullman wa usa the sensors were installed in a weather station in the field at a height of 0 5 m the position of the sensor was determined so that the heat balance conditions of the sensor and the plant were mostly the same data were recorded using a data logger em50 meter group inc pullman wa usa at 10 minute intervals the measurements were conducted during the cultivation periods april to september in 2018 and 2019 the data obtained in 2019 is shown in the supporting information to evaluate the significance of leaf wetting by dew on plant water relations in the field we measured the leaf water potential œà l of maize using a pressure chamber model600 pms instruments albany or usa the measurements were conducted in the early morning 06 00 09 00 cst on june 4 2018 june 5 2018 and june 21 2019 on these days dew condensation was not uniform which allowed us to sample both wet and dry leaves to compare difference of leaf water potential between wet leaf and dry leaf we combined all the collected data of three days and calculated average values sample size of the measurements are 6 a m n 13 wet leaves n 13 dry leaves 7 a m n 8 wet leaves n 15 dry

plant material for the greenhouse experiments the seeds were sown in plastic pots 9 cm diameter filled with vermiculite the seeds were germinated and grown in a phytotron glass room air temperature of 25 c relative humidity of 70 located at the faculty of agriculture kyushu university japan the plants were grown using a standard nutrient solution otsuka agritechno co ltd japan with an electrical conductivity of 2 0 ds m 1 the nutrient solution contained 17 1 mmol no3 l 1 1 1 mmol po4 3 l 1 1 6 mmol so4 2 l 1 8 4 mmol k l 1 1 5 mmol mg2 l 1 and 3 9 mmol ca2 l 1 at the third to fourth leaf

ito plant experiment fields facilities faculty of agriculture kyushu university a ventilation fan was operated when t a exceeded 20 c and the side windows of the greenhouse were kept open during the cultivation period environmental conditions in the greenhouse i e solar radiation r s photosynthetic photon flux density ppfd air temperature relative humidity and co2 concentration were measured using a pyranometer cap sp 110 apogee instruments logan ut usa quantum sensor cap sq 110 apogee instruments logan ut usa and a datalogger integrated temperature humidity co2 sensor tr 76ui t d corporation matsumoto japan respectively the data from each instrument were recorded by a datalogger gl820 graphtec corporation yokohama japan at 10 min intervals 2 2 2 plant water relations and gas exchange measurements the control experiment was conducted using a completely randomized design consisting of the cross of two factors two different soil water conditions well watered ww and water stressed ws and two types of leaf wetting condition no wetting nowet and wetting wet for this experiment maize plants at the 10th leaf stage were used the plants were divided into two groups and the water stress treatment was imposed on one group by gradually reducing the water supply approximately 10 days before the measurements volumetric soil water content swc was monitored daily using a moisture sensor ec 5 meter group inc pullman wa usa with a sensor read out device procheck meter group inc pullman wa usa the water potential of the soil was estimated from the soil water characteristic curve fig s1 soil water potential œà soil in the water stressed plants was set to approximately 0 35 mpa which was around the temporary wilting point of the soil each of the well watered and water stressed plants was further separated into two groups with one group subjected to leaf wetting and the other maintained under normal conditions no leaf wetting leaf wetting was conducted manually using a mist sprayer maista 726 maruhachi industrials tokyo japan both sides of the leaves were fully wetted resulting in coverage of approximately 99 9 g m 2 leaf wetness duration was set according to the measured dew duration in july in the field table 1 since the growth stage of the plant materials used in this experiment approximately corresponded to the growth stage of plants in july in the field leaf wetting was performed only on the day of measurement to evaluate how leaf wetting affects plant water relations we measured leaf water potential after sunset œà as and pre dawn œà pd using a pressure chamber mdel600 pms instruments albany or usa the measurements were conducted on april 25 and 26 2018 on five plants in each treatment plot in addition to investigate the relationship between œà pd and swc measurements were conducted on plants across various ranges of swc with and without leaf wetting the measurements were performed on september 13 and november 2 5 and 6 2018 gas exchange measurements were carried out in fully expanded recently matured leaves a few hours after the œà pd measurement from 9 00 15 00 on plants that had been subjected to the same treatments as the plants used for the leaf water potential measurements during the night note that plants used in the gas exchange measurement were not used for leaf water potential measurements in order to avoid influencing gas exchange with the destructive methods used to measure leaf water potential added water on the leaves was allowed to completely evaporate before the gas exchange measurements were performed photosynthetic rate p n and stomatal conductance g s were measured with a portable leaf chamber system li 6400xt li cor biosciences lincoln ne us under constant conditions of ppfd 1500 Œºmol m 2 s 1 and co2 concentration 400 Œºmol mol 1 air temperature and relative humidity were allowed to follow natural conditions the gas exchange measurements were performed on april 26 2018 2 2 3 growth and water consumption measurements to investigate how leaf wetting affects the growth and water consumption of maize we conducted a follow up greenhouse experiment for 12 days june 4 16 2019 that had a similar experimental design to the plant water relations and gas exchange studies the experimental plots consisted of the cross of two factors two different soil water conditions well watered ww and water stressed ws and two types of leaf wetting treatment no wetting nowet and wetting wet each plot consisted of five plants with the swc of each plot monitored using a moisture sensor ec 5 meter group inc pullman wa usa and recorded by a datalogger em50 meter group inc pullman wa usa all treatments were initiated on jun 4 when the plants were at the seventh leaf stage water stress was imposed by gradually decreasing water supply when the swc decreased to close to the primary wilting point the water supply was adjusted to keep the swc at this level in order to replicate nighttime leaf wetting by dew leaf wetting was performed using a misting system ms028m a maruyama mfg co inc tokyo japan the operation of the misting system was controlled by a timer and was switched on every 30 min for 3 min each time leaf wetness duration was set according to the measured dew duration in july in the field table 1 to prevent water from the leaf surface dripping onto the soil and affecting swc the soil surface of all pots was covered with plastic film plant height and whole plant leaf area were measured every three days jun 4 7 10 13 and 16 2019 the measurements were conducted in five plants per treatment leaf area was estimated as follows nomiyama et al 2012 1 la 0 807 l w 10 684 where la is the leaf area of a single leaf cm2 l is the length of the leaf and w is the width of the leaf in order to estimate an increase in above ground dry weight in a non destructive manner regression equations were estimated based on a preliminary experiment the dry weights of the leaves and stem were estimated as a function of leaf area and plant height respectively fig s2 at the end of the experiment all plants were separated into leaves and stems and oven dried at 80 c for 72 h to determine the final dry weight of the leaves and stems above ground dw final to evaluate the effects of leaf wetting on plant water consumption transpiration rate tr was evaluated by changes in pot weight the weight of each pot was measured every day after sunset prior to watering m i then plants were watered according to their treatments and the weight of the water supplied to the plants was also recorded m water tr was calculated as follows 2 tr m i m water m i 1 where m i 1 is the weight of the pot measured the day after m i note that we assumed pot weight changed only due to transpiration since the pot surface was covered with plastic film to prevent soil evaporation tr was normalized by leaf area with leaf area between the measurement days measured only every three days estimated by linear interpolation plant water use efficiency during the experimental periods was calculated using the ratio between changes in above ground dry weight and the total amount of transpired water tr total during the experimental periods 2 3 foliar water uptake measurement in order to investigate the relationship between foliar water uptake fwu and plant water status fwu was measured in leaves with different leaf water potentials œà l a range of œà l was established by setting up various soil water conditions initially œà l was measured with the scholander type pressure chamber model600 pms instruments albany or usa then the capacity for fwu by the maize leaves was measured based on changes in mass before and after leaf submergence as proposed by limm et al 2009 the cut section was immediately sealed after œà l measurement and the initial mass of the leaf m 1 was recorded the leaf was submerged in distilled water for 10 h after submergence moisture was removed with a paper towel and the leaf was reweighed m 2 to minimize errors resulting from residual water on the leaf surface the leaf was dried naturally for 5 min before the mass was measured again m 3 the leaf was then momentarily submerged again after which the moisture was removed with a paper towel before a final weighing m 4 this instantaneous rewetting did not allow sufficient time for fwu and thus any increase in mass related to rewetting represented the residual water on the leaf surface fwu normalized by leaf area was calculated as follows 3 fwu m 2 m 1 m 4 m 3 la 2 4 statistical analysis data normality was checked by the shapiro wilk s test the effects of soil treatment well watered and water stressed leaf wetting treatment with and without leaf wetting and their interaction on soil water potential leaf water potential above ground dry weight at the end of the experiment cumulative transpiration rate during the experiment and water use efficiency were tested using two way analysis of variance anova we used the tukey kramer test p 0 05 to detect any significant differences among plots all statistical analyses were conducted using the statistical program r ver 3 2 4 3 results 3 1 field observations on a total of 82 days leaf wetting by dew occurred which corresponds to 45 of the days during the cultivation periods table 1 leaf wetting by dew occurred more frequently in july august and september the start time of leaf wetting by dew was around 01 00 04 00 from april to june and around 20 00 23 00 from july to september there was relatively little difference in the time of dew disappearance via evaporation around 08 00 09 30 therefore the average dew duration from april to june was around 5 8 h and around 10 12 5 h in july august and september fig 1 shows temporal changes in œà l measured in the field non wet leaves and wet leaves showed almost the same œà l values before sunrise 06 00 however œà l of wet leaves decreased more slowly than that of non wet leaves from 06 00 08 00 decreasing to close to that of non wet leaves at 09 00 table 2 3 2 effects of leaf wetting on plant water relations maize leaves showed a capacity for fwu fig 2 fwu and œà l showed a linear relationship p 0 001 and fwu was greater when the œà l value taken before the fwu measurement was lower results of anova showed that there were significant differences in œà soil œà as œà pd and œà as œà pd between the two soil treatments well watered and water stressed moreover significant differences in œà pd and œà as œà pd were observed between the two leaf wetting treatments without leaf wetting and with leaf wetting since i leaf wetting was commenced after the measurement of œà as and ii we tried to avoid added water dripping onto the soil the effects of leaf wetting on both œà soil and œà as were not significant however the interactive effect of soil and leaf wetting on œà pd was significant for the ws nowet and ws wet treatments œà soil was significantly lower than that for the ww nowet and ww wet treatments fig 3a owing to lower water availability œà as values for the ws nowet and ws ww treatments were significantly lower than those for the ww nowet and ww wet treatments fig 3b after the leaf wetting treatment through the night from 22 00 08 30 œà pd in the ws nowet treatment was significantly lower than that in the other three plots ww nowet ww wet and ws wet and no significant differences were found between these three plots fig 3c œà as œà pd values for the ws nowet and ws wet treatments were much larger than those for the ww nowet and ww wet treatments fig 3d no significant difference in this parameter was found between the two well watered plots ww nowet and ww wet also there was no significant difference in œà as œà pd between the two water stressed plots ws nowet and ws wet 3 3 effects of leaf wetting on daytime gas exchange fig 4 shows the diurnal variations in photosynthetic rate p n and stomatal conductance g s in each plot in the morning soon after nighttime leaf water had evaporated both p n and g s in all the plots showed almost the same values this trend continued until 10 00 at 11 00 p n and g s in the ws nowet treatment decreased while the other plots ww nowet ww wet ws wet maintained relatively high p n and g s values p n and g s for the ws wet treatment decreased to the same value as that for the ws nowet treatment in the well watered plots ww nowet and ww wet p n and g s were maintained at higher values than in the water stressed plots ws nowet and ws wet through the afternoon 3 4 effects of leaf wetting on plant growth and water use efficiency to assess how leaf wetting affects plant growth and water consumption we conducted a follow up greenhouse experiment for 12 days fig 5 shows changes in daily integrated solar radiation r s volumetric swc and daily transpiration rate tr during the experimental periods tr in the well watered plots ww nowet and ww wet followed changes in r s fig 5 a c on the other hand tr in the water stressed plots ws nowet and ws wet followed the daily changes in r s until around jun 7 although tr was suppressed as swc decreased fig 6 shows the percent increase in plant growth characteristics leaf area plant height above ground dw from the beginning of the experiment no clear difference was seen in the percent increase in leaf area although leaf area in the ws nowet treatment showed a slightly lower percent increase compared with the other treatments in the late periods of the experiment fig 6a the percent increase in plant height showed a more distinct difference among the treatments toward the end of the experiment fig 6b plant height in the two well watered plots ww nowet and ww wet showed a higher percent increase compared with the two water stressed plots ws nowet and ws wet also the percent increase in plant height in the ww nowet treatment tended to be higher than that in the ww wet treatment and the percent increase in plant height in ws wet was higher than that in ws nowet in the late periods of the experiment the percent increase in above ground dw in the ww nowet and ww wet treatments showed a higher percent increase compared with those of ws nowet and ws wet there was no clear difference between the percent increase in above ground dw in the ww nowet and ww wet treatments whereas the percent dw increase in ws wet tended to be higher than that in ws nowet soil treatment water stress treatment had a significant effect on above ground dw final tr total and wue table 3 leaf wetting had a significant effect on tr total and wue but not on above ground dw final the interaction effects on wue was also significant above ground dw final values in the well watered plots ww nowet and ww wet were significantly higher than those of water stressed plots ws nowet and ws wet however there was no significant difference in above ground dw final between the same soil treatment groups indicating that leaf wetting had no effect on above ground dw final tr total values of the well watered plots ww nowet and ww wet were significantly higher than those of the water stressed plots ws nowet and ws wet within the same soil treatment groups tr total in ww nowet was significantly higher than that in ww wet whereas no significant difference was found between ws nowet and ws wet wue in the ws wet treatment was significantly higher than that in the other three plots ww nowet ww wet and ws nowet 4 discussion 4 1 seasonal changes in dew occurrence and its effect on leaf water potential the number of days upon which leaf wetting by dew occurred accounted for 45 of the cultivation period indicating that leaf wetting by dew occurred frequently in the field table 1 in the field leaf wetting also occurs by rain and guttation indicating that plants experience leaf wetting on a considerable number of days during their growth which highlights the importance of studying the effects of leaf wetting in semi arid regions dew occurrence became more frequent in later cultivation periods july august and september although dew is a common phenomenon in the region its seasonal patterns vary among sites zhang et al 2015 meng and wen 2016 zhuang and zhao 2017 indicating that local meteorological conditions are highly important factors in dew occurrence in our field dew occurrence became more frequent as the plants grew an increase in leaf area increases local water vapor by transpiration which could have become a source of dew in addition precipitation in the region is concentrated in july august and september which increases the water vapor supply by enhancing evapotranspiration zhuang and zhao 2014 generally soil moisture provided by irrigation and precipitation is lost to the atmosphere through evapotranspiration however if some of the evaporated soil water condenses on the leaf surface and contributes to improving plant water status it may be considered a recycling of water resources in our field the œà l value of wet leaves was higher than that of non wet leaves during the early morning 06 00 09 00 fig 1 at 06 00 œà l was almost the same for wet and non wet leaves indicating that plants were able to rehydrate regardless of the presence or absence of dew the œà l value of wet leaves was higher than that of non wet leaves from 07 00 08 00 although the values became similar to one another at 9 00 for wet leaves the time of higher œà l values approximately corresponded to the duration of leaf wetting therefore a decrease in transpirational water loss probably contributed to higher œà l values for wet leaves yasutake et al 2015 4 2 effects of leaf wetting on plant water relations and gas exchange fwu is a common phenomenon across many plant species and it is known as an important water acquisition pathway subsidiary to root water uptake dawson and goldsmith 2018 the present study showed that maize leaves also have the capacity for fwu fig 2 maize is one of the major crops in northwestern china tan and zheng 2017 and leaf wetting by dew frequently occurs in this region zhang et al 2015 meng and wen 2016 zhuang and zhao 2017 this suggests that fwu is likely a common phenomenon in agricultural fields of the region and has a large impact on the water cycle our results show that fwu increases as œà l decreases fig 2 indicating that the water potential gradient between the interior of the leaf and dew water on the surface of the leaf is the driving force of fwu therefore rehydration by fwu may be more effective when water stress becomes more severe fig 8 absorbed water through fwu would be transferred along the water potential gradient inside the plant and re enter the atmosphere through transpiration however a few studies have reported that absorbed water from leaf surfaces could also redistribute to the soil via the plant eller et al 2013 zhang et al 2019a 2019b although the fwu of leaf wetting by dew can positively affect plant water status it may have little effect on plant water relations when plants have sufficient soil water availability fig 8 this is probably because of the higher resistance of the fwu pathways compared with the root water uptake pathway guzm√°n delgado et al 2018 leaf wetting by dew can both directly and indirectly affect plant gas exchange at nighttime leaf wetting by dew would improve plant water status by fwu and consequently contributes to improving daytime photosynthesis under water stress conditions simonin et al 2009 eller et al 2013 leaf wetting by dew also affects plant gas exchange after sunrise decreasing transpirational water loss by decreasing evaporative demand yasutake et al 2015 such a decrease in transpiration would mitigate a decrease in photosynthesis by stomatal closure due to excessive transpirational water loss yokoyama et al 2019 however as reported in several studies leaf wetting could also decrease photosynthesis by blocking co2 uptake through stomata ishibashi and terashima 1995 hanba et al 2004 in addition photosynthesis can decrease under leaf wetting conditions for reasons other than stomatal blockage due to a water film berry and goldsmith 2020 in this study leaf wetting contributed to the maintenance of p n and g s under water stress conditions ws ww treatment whereas plants without leaf wetting ws nowet showed a rapid decrease in p n and g s under water stress conditions fig 4 on the other hand no clear difference was found between the gas exchange parameters of ww nowet and ww wet in our study the gas exchange measurement started after leaf moisture was evaporated since it is impossible to evaluate some important gas exchange parameters i e tr and g s when leaves are wet therefore we could not evaluate gas exchange under leaf wetting conditions however it can be assumed that there is a tradeoff between carbon gain and water loss under leaf wetting conditions a longer leaf wetting duration may suppress photosynthesis for a longer time yet reduced water loss by transpiration may consequently increase future photosynthesis and may offset the reduction in photosynthesis by leaf wetting after sunrise our findings show that plant water status is a key factor in whether leaf wetting benefits plant gas exchange fig 4 leaf morphological traits such as leaf water repellency may also be important factors in determining how leaf wetting affects plant gas exchange leaves with lower water repellency would hold a larger amount of water and a larger proportion of the leaf area would be covered with a water film which may result in lower photosynthesis and transpiration under leaf wetting conditions hanba et al 2004 urrego pereira et al 2013 4 3 effects of leaf wetting on plant growth characteristics and water consumption the results of this study showed that leaf wetting by dew would have significant effects on plant physiology under water stress conditions which may consequently affect plant growth characteristics as reported in several studies leaf wetting suppresses transpirational water loss by reducing evaporative demand specifically leaf wetting increases vapor pressure near the leaf surface and suppresses an increase in leaf temperature yasutake et al 2015 yokoyama et al 2019 such effects may be beneficial in terms of water relations but are not always so for photosynthesis therefore we here propose wue as a suitable candidate for evaluating the physiological significance of leaf wetting several studies have reported the positive effects of leaf wetting by dew or fog on plant growth through its effects on plant water relations under both well watered and water stressed conditions cassana and dillenburg 2013 eller et al 2013 zhang et al 2019a 2019b further studies have reported that the positive effects of leaf wetting on plant water relations not only contribute to higher photosynthesis but also facilitate turgor driven growth which would increase growth rate stepp et al 2018 schreel et al 2019 in our study the effect of leaf wetting on above ground dw final was not statistically significant table 3 however based on the trend in growth parameters and the physiological significance of leaf wetting under water stress we assume that leaf wetting would have positive effects on plant growth under water stress conditions fig 6 in terms of water consumption no significant difference was found between tr total of the ws nowet and ws wet treatments because transpiration in the ws nowet treatment was strongly inhibited by stomatal closure due to water stress contrary to previous studies growth rate in the ww wet treatment was lower than that of ww nowet one possible explanation for this is that if plants have sufficient water the positive effects of leaf wetting on photosynthesis would be very small because the positive effects of leaf wetting on photosynthesis occur via its effects on plant water relations simonin et al 2009 eller et al 2013 on the other hand the negative effects of leaf wetting on photosynthesis would be maintained ishibashi and terashima 1995 hanba et al 2004 berry and goldsmith 2020 therefore the negative effects of leaf wetting would become relatively strong under well watered conditions resulting in a lower growth rate one interesting finding is that the manner in which leaf wetting affects plant physiology changes depending on plant water status which resulted in different wue values among experimental plots fig 7c 4 4 implication of dew effects on arid and semi arid crop production our results showed leaf wetting by dew would be an important water resource for arid and semi arid crop production in arid regions which has positive effects on plant physiological functions the positive effects of leaf wetting by dew was found when plants were under water stressed conditions this finding suggests that leaf wetting by dew would be compatible with deficit irrigation which imposes mild water stress on plants cameron et al 2006 the major problem of deficit irrigation is maintaining plant water status within mild water stress conditions which requires precise monitoring and adjustment of soil or plant water status jones 2004 in our study fwu was higher at lower leaf water potentials i e higher degree of water stress and lower at higher leaf water potentials if deficit irrigation is conducted in areas where leaf wetting by dew occurs fwu would contribute to avoiding excessive water stress fwu may be more important water aquation pathway under saline conditions which often occurs in an irrigated crop field corwin 2021 because dew water has low salinity lekouch et al 2010 dew harvesting is recognized as a viable water resource supplement especially in arid and semi arid regions tomaszkiewicz et al 2017a although the yields of harvested water is relatively small the combination of physiological effects of dew would make up for the lower amount of harvested water to our knowledge no studies have examined the combined effects of leaf wetting by dew and dew harvesting irrigation though leaf wetting by dew would contribute to improving the water usage in arid and semi arid fields there is room for improvement with evaluating the effects of leaf wetting by dew one important future research is that quantifying the effects of leaf wetting on water balance in a field leaf wetting suppresses transpirational water loss by increasing humidity near the leaf surface and suppressing an increase in leaf temperature gerlein safdi et al 2018 yasutake et al 2018 however such reduced transpiration by leaf wetting has not been quantified in field conditions because it is difficult to evaluate the evaporation of dew and transpiration separately by conventional methods one possible approach to quantify the reduced transpiration rate is that combining stem heat balance and chamber method yasutake et al 2018 the transpiration suppression by leaf wetting can also be estimated by leaf energy balance and gas exchange models gerlein safdi et al 2018 5 conclusion this study was conducted to investigate the impact of leaf wetting by dew on crop production in a semi arid environment in terms of its effects on plant physiological functions specifically 1 we investigated the frequency and duration of leaf wetting by dew through the maize cultivation periods and its effect on the leaf water potential in the maizefield of northwest china and 2 evaluated the effects of leaf wetting by dew on plant physiological functions based on the greenhouse experiments our results showed that although the amount of dew may be much smaller than that of conventional resources it could have a significant impact on agricultural production in arid and semi arid climates through its effects on plant physiological functions in maize when plants had sufficient water neither positive nor negative effects of leaf wetting on plant physiological function and growth were found however when plants were under water stressed conditions the dew on leaves was directly absorbed from the leaf surface of maize during nighttime contributed to an improvement in plant water potential and consequently increased photosynthesis during the daytime as a result dew had significantly increased plant water use efficiency under water stressed conditions our study indicates that plant water status is one of the key factors determining how leaf wetting affects plant physiological functions the question raised by this study is the extent of water stress that maximize water use efficiency while avoiding yield loss a limitation of our study is that the water stressed treatment imposed in the experiment was relatively severe which resulted in lower plant growth indicating lower crop yield an ideal outcome is that increasing water use efficiency under leaf wetting condition while keeping crop yield under some extent of water stress therefore the investigation of the optimum extent of water stress under leaf wetting condition would help us to establish better water management of agriculture in an arid and semi arid region declaration of competing interest the

9969,dew is a frequently observed meteorological phenomenon and its importance to the water balance in arid and semi arid regions has been recognized the focus of our study was to evaluate the potential significance of leaf wetting by dew on semi arid crop production in terms of its effects on plant physiological functions we conducted a field experiment in a maizefield in northwest china leaf wetting by dew occurred on 45 of days during cultivation periods and leaf water potential was higher for leaves wetted by dew than for those not wetted during the morning in addition we conducted a potted maize control experiment consisting of four treatments two different soil water treatments water stressed and well watered and two different leaf wetting treatments with and without leaf wetting the water stressed treatment strongly inhibited plant physiological functions decrease in leaf water potential stomatal closure decrease in photosynthetic rate therefore growth rate decreased however in the water stressed with leaf wetting plot the maize leaves absorbed water from their surfaces during nighttime which significantly increased pre dawn leaf water potential consequently this plot showed a higher photosynthetic rate than did the water stressed without leaf wetting plot during daytime the positive effects of leaf wetting on plant physiological functions were not explicit in the well watered plots we assumed that the positive effects of leaf wetting were mainly manifest as effects on plant water relations such effects may be limited when plants have sufficient water as a result water stressed plants with leaf wetting showed greater water use efficiency our results indicate the importance of leaf wetting by dew as a water resource in semi arid crop production owing its effects on plant physiological functions keywords zea mays cornfield water use efficiency irrigation water stress plant water relations 1 introduction water is an essential resource for agricultural production however recent studies have predicted that the risk of water shortage will further increase in the near future ipcc 2013 the risk of water shortage is high in arid and semi arid regions which are home to approximately 38 of the global population huang et al 2016 therefore a more efficient use of water in agricultural production is required to sustain the food supply especially in arid and semi arid regions where crop yields are strongly dependent on the availability of water resources fischer et al 2007 it was previously considered that precipitation and irrigation were the only means of water input to agricultural production however it has more recently been recognized that non metric water inputs such as dew and fog serve as essential water sources for plants in many ecosystems zhuang and ratcliffe 2012 baguskas et al 2017 eller et al 2017 dew is a widely observed meteorological phenomenon and its potential significance as a water resource in arid and semi arid ecosystems has been reported vuollekoski et al 2015 zhang et al 2015 zhang et al 2019a 2019b aguirre guti√©rrez et al 2019 reported that dew accounted for up to 10 2 of the annual water input and 33 6 of the total dry season precipitation in a continental semi arid grassland dew harvesting using a dew condenser has been reported as a means of utilizing dew as a water resource maestre valero et al 2015 tomaszkiewicz et al 2017a 2017b showed that irrigation with harvested dew could significantly increase soil water content and could be utilized in reforestation and the growing of crops in arid and semi arid environments although the importance of dew has been recognized its significance as a water resource is often evaluated based on amount which might underestimate its relevance since the amount of dew water is much smaller than that of conventional water resources i e irrigation water and precipitation zhang et al 2015 zhang et al 2019a 2019b nevertheless dew can have significant effects on crop production through leaf wetting and subsequent effects on plant physiological functions direct water absorption from the leaf surface known as foliar water uptake is one of the important effects of leaf wetting on plant physiological functions martin and von willert 2000 simonin et al 2009 eller et al 2013 subsidiary to root water uptake foliar water uptake can be a significant water acquisition pathway that contributes to improvements in plant water relations and consequently mitigates decrease in photosynthetic rate increasing a plant s chances of survival under drought conditions martin and von willert 2000 simonin et al 2009 eller et al 2013 leaf wetting can also improve plant water relations by mitigating excessive transpirational water loss leaf wetting increases humidity near the leaf surface and suppresses increases in leaf temperature which leads to a decrease in evaporative demand and can contribute to limiting a midday depression in photosynthesis yasutake et al 2015 yokoyama et al 2019 overall these studies suggest that leaf wetting by dew would have significant effects on agricultural production through its effects on plant physiological functions even though the amount of dew present is small therefore the potential of dew as a water resource should also be evaluated in terms of its effects on plant physiological functions although recent studies have reported the positive effects of leaf wetting it has also been considered to negatively affect photosynthesis this is because the presence of water droplets or a water film on a leaf surface occludes the stomata causing a physical barrier to co2 uptake since co2 diffusion in water is much slower than that in air ishibashi and terashima 1995 hanba et al 2004 in contrast berry and goldsmith 2020 reported that leaf wetting decreases photosynthetic rate only for leaf surfaces without stomata indicating that the blockage of co2 uptake by leaf surface water is not the only factor involved in the short term photosynthetic response to leaf wetting how leaf wetting affects gas exchange is still not well understood however it is likely that the photosynthetic rate tends to decrease when the leaf surface is covered with water aparecido et al 2017 berry and goldsmith 2020 based on recent studies leaf wetting affects plant physiological functions both positively and negatively depending on environmental and plant physiological conditions leaf wetting may temporarily decrease the photosynthetic rate when a leaf is wet however at the same time transpiration rate can also decrease with leaf wetting a reduction in transpiration rate would be beneficial to plants in terms of mitigating water stress at times of high evaporative demand yokoyama et al 2019 consequently leaf wetting would increase the photosynthetic rate in the long term by mitigating water stress in addition leaf wetting by dew at nighttime contributes to improving plant water relations owing to foliar water uptake which indirectly affects daytime gas exchange overall to assess the effects of dew on plant physiological functions a comprehensive investigation with consideration of the tradeoff between carbon and water relations is needed dawson and goldsmith 2018 northwest china is an appropriate location for studying the effects of dew on agricultural production as it is an important agricultural region of china moreover the region has a mostly arid and semi arid climate and the imbalance between the supply and demand of water resources is a serious problem agricultural production accounts for about 90 of the total water consumption therefore measures to address water resource issues in agricultural production are needed shen et al 2013 it has been reported that dew frequently occurs in this region and its importance to the water balance in the region has been reported in several studies zhuang and zhao 2014 zhang et al 2015 meng and wen 2016 jia et al 2019 however there are few studies investigating the effects of leaf wetting by dew on plant physiological functions in this region zhang et al 2012 in particular there is a lack of information on how leaf wetting by dew affects plant physiological functions in crops and its potential significance for agricultural production the overall aim of this study was to investigate the impact of leaf wetting by dew on crop production in a semi arid environment in terms of its effects on plant physiological functions the specific aims are 1 to investigate the frequency and duration of leaf wetting by dew through the maize cultivation periods and to evaluate its effects on leaf water potential in a semi arid maizefield of northwest china and 2 to evaluate the effects of leaf wetting by dew on plant physiological functions such as plant water relations and gas exchange by greenhouse experiments and 3 to investigate the effects of leaf wetting by dew on plant water used efficiency by greenhouse experiments 2 materials and methods 2 1 field experiment 2 1 1 study site field observation was conducted on a maizefield in pingbu village baiyin city gansu province n 36 25

times of surface irrigation 2 1 2 leaf wetting by dew and leaf water potential measurements the occurrence and disappearance of dew during the cultivation periods were observed using leaf wetness sensors phytos 31 meter group inc pullman wa usa the sensors were installed in a weather station in the field at a height of 0 5 m the position of the sensor was determined so that the heat balance conditions of the sensor and the plant were mostly the same data were recorded using a data logger em50 meter group inc pullman wa usa at 10 minute intervals the measurements were conducted during the cultivation periods april to september in 2018 and 2019 the data obtained in 2019 is shown in the supporting information to evaluate the significance of leaf wetting by dew on plant water relations in the field we measured the leaf water potential œà l of maize using a pressure chamber model600 pms instruments albany or usa the measurements were conducted in the early morning 06 00 09 00 cst on june 4 2018 june 5 2018 and june 21 2019 on these days dew condensation was not uniform which allowed us to sample both wet and dry leaves to compare difference of leaf water potential between wet leaf and dry leaf we combined all the collected data of three days and calculated average values sample size of the measurements are 6 a m n 13 wet leaves n 13 dry leaves 7 a m n 8 wet leaves n 15 dry

ito plant experiment fields facilities faculty of agriculture kyushu university a ventilation fan was operated when t a exceeded 20 c and the side windows of the greenhouse were kept open during the cultivation period environmental conditions in the greenhouse i e solar radiation r s photosynthetic photon flux density ppfd air temperature relative humidity and co2 concentration were measured using a pyranometer cap sp 110 apogee instruments logan ut usa quantum sensor cap sq 110 apogee instruments logan ut usa and a datalogger integrated temperature humidity co2 sensor tr 76ui t d

exchange measurements the control experiment was conducted using a completely randomized design consisting of the cross of two factors two different soil water conditions well watered ww and water stressed ws and two types of leaf wetting condition no wetting nowet and wetting wet for this experiment maize plants at the 10th leaf stage were used the plants were divided into two groups and the water stress treatment was imposed on one group by gradually reducing the water supply approximately 10 days before the measurements volumetric soil water content swc was monitored daily using a moisture sensor ec 5 meter group inc pullman wa usa with a sensor read out device procheck meter group inc pullman wa usa the water potential of the soil was estimated from the soil water characteristic curve fig s1 soil water potential œà soil in the water stressed plants was set to approximately 0 35 mpa which was around the temporary wilting point of the soil each of the well watered and water stressed plants was further separated into two groups with one group subjected to leaf wetting and the other maintained under normal conditions no leaf wetting leaf wetting was conducted manually using a mist sprayer maista 726 maruhachi industrials tokyo japan both sides of the leaves were fully wetted resulting in coverage of approximately 99 9 g m 2 leaf wetness duration was set according to the measured dew duration in july in the field table 1 since the growth stage of the plant materials used in this experiment approximately corresponded to the growth stage of plants in july in the field leaf wetting was performed only on the day of measurement to evaluate how leaf wetting affects plant water relations we measured leaf water potential after sunset œà as and pre dawn œà pd using a pressure chamber mdel600 pms instruments albany or usa the measurements were conducted on april 25 and 26 2018 on five plants in each treatment plot in addition to investigate the relationship between œà pd and swc measurements were conducted on plants across various ranges of swc with and without leaf wetting the measurements were performed on september 13 and november 2 5 and 6 2018 gas exchange measurements were carried out in fully expanded recently matured leaves a few hours after the œà pd measurement from 9 00 15 00 on plants that had been subjected to the same treatments as the plants used for the leaf water potential measurements during the night note that plants used in the gas exchange measurement were not used for leaf water potential measurements in order to avoid influencing gas exchange with the destructive methods used to measure leaf water potential added water on the leaves was allowed to completely evaporate before the gas exchange measurements were performed photosynthetic rate p n and stomatal conductance g s were measured with a portable leaf chamber system li 6400xt li cor biosciences lincoln ne us under constant conditions of ppfd 1500 Œºmol m 2 s 1 and co2 concentration 400 Œºmol mol 1 air temperature and relative humidity were allowed to follow natural conditions the gas exchange measurements were performed on april 26 2018 2 2 3 growth and water consumption measurements to investigate how leaf wetting affects the growth and water consumption of maize we conducted a follow up greenhouse experiment for 12 days june 4 16 2019 that had a similar experimental design to the plant water relations and gas exchange studies the experimental plots consisted of the cross of two factors two different soil water conditions well watered ww and water stressed ws and two types of leaf wetting treatment no wetting nowet and wetting wet each plot consisted of five plants with the swc of each plot monitored using a moisture sensor ec 5 meter group inc pullman wa usa and recorded by a datalogger em50 meter group inc pullman wa usa all treatments were initiated on jun 4 when the plants were at the seventh leaf stage water stress was imposed by gradually decreasing water supply when the swc decreased to close to the primary wilting point the water supply was adjusted to keep the swc at this level in order to replicate nighttime leaf wetting by dew leaf wetting was performed using a misting system ms028m a maruyama mfg co inc tokyo japan the operation of the misting system was controlled by a timer and was switched on every 30 min for 3 min each time leaf wetness duration was set according to the measured dew duration in july in the field table 1 to prevent water from the leaf surface dripping onto the soil and affecting swc the soil surface of all pots was covered with plastic film plant height and whole plant leaf area were measured every three days jun 4 7 10 13 and 16 2019 the measurements were conducted in five plants per treatment leaf area was estimated as follows nomiyama et al 2012 1 la 0 807 l w 10 684 where la is the leaf area of a single leaf cm2 l is the length of the leaf and w is the width of the leaf in order to estimate an increase in above ground dry weight in a non destructive manner regression equations were estimated based on a preliminary experiment the dry weights of the leaves and stem were estimated as a function of leaf area and plant height respectively fig s2 at the end of the experiment all plants were separated into leaves and stems and oven dried at 80 c for 72 h to determine the final dry weight of the leaves and stems above ground dw final to evaluate the effects of leaf wetting on plant water consumption transpiration rate tr was evaluated by changes in pot weight the weight of each pot was measured every day after sunset prior to watering m i then plants were watered according to their treatments and the weight of the water supplied to the plants was also recorded m water tr was calculated as follows 2 tr m i m water m i 1 where m i 1 is the weight of the pot measured the day after m i note that we assumed pot weight changed only due to transpiration since the pot surface was covered with plastic film to prevent soil evaporation tr was normalized by leaf area with leaf area between the measurement days measured only every three days estimated by linear interpolation plant water use efficiency during the experimental periods was calculated using the ratio between changes in above ground dry weight and the total amount of transpired water tr total during the experimental periods 2 3 foliar water uptake measurement in order to investigate the relationship between foliar water uptake fwu and plant water status fwu was measured in leaves with different leaf water potentials œà l a range of œà l was established by setting up various soil water conditions initially œà l was measured with the scholander type pressure chamber model600 pms instruments albany or usa then the capacity for fwu by the maize leaves was measured based on changes in mass before and after leaf submergence as proposed by limm et al 2009 the cut section was immediately sealed after œà l measurement and the initial mass of the leaf m 1 was recorded the leaf was submerged in distilled water for 10 h after submergence moisture was removed with a paper towel and the leaf was reweighed m 2 to minimize errors resulting from residual water on the leaf surface the leaf was dried naturally for 5 min before the mass was measured again m 3 the leaf was then momentarily submerged again after which the moisture was removed with a paper towel before a final weighing m 4 this instantaneous rewetting did not allow sufficient time for fwu and thus any increase in mass related to rewetting represented the residual water on the leaf surface fwu normalized by leaf area was calculated as follows 3 fwu m 2 m 1 m 4 m 3 la 2 4 statistical analysis data normality was checked by the shapiro wilk s test the effects of soil treatment well watered and water stressed leaf wetting treatment with and without leaf wetting and their interaction on soil water potential leaf water potential above ground dry weight at the end of the experiment cumulative transpiration rate during the experiment and water use efficiency were tested using two way analysis of variance anova we used the tukey kramer test p 0 05 to detect any significant differences among plots all statistical analyses were conducted using the statistical program r ver 3 2 4 3 results 3 1 field observations on a total of 82 days leaf wetting by dew occurred which corresponds to 45 of the days during the cultivation periods table 1 leaf wetting by dew occurred more frequently in july august and september the start time of leaf wetting by dew was around 01 00 04 00 from april to june and around 20 00 23 00 from july to september there was relatively little difference in the time of dew disappearance via evaporation around 08 00 09 30 therefore the average dew duration from april to june was around 5 8 h and around 10 12 5 h in july august and september fig 1 shows temporal changes in œà l measured in the field non wet leaves and wet leaves showed almost the same œà l values before sunrise 06 00 however œà l of wet leaves decreased more slowly than that of non wet leaves from 06 00 08 00 decreasing to close to that of non wet leaves at 09 00 table 2 3 2 effects of leaf wetting on plant water relations maize leaves showed a capacity for fwu fig 2 fwu and œà l showed a linear relationship p 0 001 and fwu was greater when the œà l value taken before the fwu measurement was lower results of anova showed that there were significant differences in œà soil œà as œà pd and œà as œà pd between the two soil treatments well watered and water stressed moreover significant differences in œà pd and œà as œà pd were observed between the two leaf wetting treatments without leaf wetting and with leaf wetting since i leaf wetting was commenced after the measurement of œà as and ii we tried to avoid added water dripping onto the soil the effects of leaf wetting on both œà soil and œà as were not significant however the interactive effect of soil and leaf wetting on œà pd was significant for the ws nowet and ws wet treatments œà soil was significantly lower than that for the ww nowet and ww wet treatments fig 3a owing to lower water availability œà as values for the ws nowet and ws ww treatments were significantly lower than those for the ww nowet and ww wet treatments fig 3b after the leaf wetting treatment through the night from 22 00 08 30 œà pd in the ws nowet treatment was significantly lower than that in the other three plots ww nowet ww wet and ws wet and no significant differences were found between these three plots fig 3c œà as œà pd values for the ws nowet and ws wet treatments were much larger than those for the ww nowet and ww wet treatments fig 3d no significant difference in this parameter was found between the two well watered plots ww nowet and ww wet also there was no significant difference in œà as œà pd between the two water stressed plots ws nowet and ws wet 3 3 effects of leaf wetting on daytime gas exchange fig 4 shows the diurnal variations in photosynthetic rate p n and stomatal conductance g s in each plot in the morning soon after nighttime leaf water had evaporated both p n and g s in all the plots showed almost the same values this trend continued until 10 00 at 11 00 p n and g s in the ws nowet treatment decreased while the other plots ww nowet ww wet ws wet maintained relatively high p n and g s values p n and g s for the ws wet treatment decreased to the same value as that for the ws nowet treatment in the well watered plots ww nowet and ww wet p n and g s were maintained at higher values than in the water stressed plots ws nowet and ws wet through the afternoon 3 4 effects of leaf wetting on plant growth and water use efficiency to assess how leaf wetting affects plant growth and water consumption we conducted a follow up greenhouse experiment for 12 days fig 5 shows changes in daily integrated solar radiation r s volumetric swc and daily transpiration rate tr during the experimental periods tr in the well watered plots ww nowet and ww wet followed changes in r s fig 5 a c on the other hand tr in the water stressed plots ws nowet and ws wet followed the daily changes in r s until around jun 7 although tr was suppressed as swc decreased fig 6 shows the percent increase in plant growth characteristics leaf area plant height above ground dw from the beginning of the experiment no clear difference was seen in the percent increase in leaf area although leaf area in the ws nowet treatment showed a slightly lower percent increase compared with the other treatments in the late periods of the experiment fig 6a the percent increase in plant height showed a more distinct difference among the treatments toward the end of the experiment fig 6b plant height in the two well watered plots ww nowet and ww wet showed a higher percent increase compared with the two water stressed plots ws nowet and ws wet also the percent increase in plant height in the ww nowet treatment tended to be higher than that in the ww wet treatment and the percent increase in plant height in ws wet was higher than that in ws nowet in the late periods of the experiment the percent increase in above ground dw in the ww nowet and ww wet treatments showed a higher percent increase compared with those of ws nowet and ws wet there was no clear difference between the percent increase in above ground dw in the ww nowet and ww wet treatments whereas the percent dw increase in ws wet tended to be higher than that in ws nowet soil treatment water stress treatment had a significant effect on above ground dw final tr total and wue table 3 leaf wetting had a significant effect on tr total and wue but not on above ground dw final the interaction effects on wue was also significant above ground dw final values in the well watered plots ww nowet and ww wet were significantly higher than those of water stressed plots ws nowet and ws wet however there was no significant difference in above ground dw final between the same soil treatment groups indicating that leaf wetting had no effect on above ground dw final tr total values of the well watered plots ww nowet and ww wet were significantly higher than those of the water stressed plots ws nowet and ws wet within the same soil treatment groups tr total in ww nowet was significantly higher than that in ww wet whereas no significant difference was found between ws nowet and ws wet wue in the ws wet treatment was significantly higher than that in the other three plots ww nowet ww wet and ws nowet 4 discussion 4 1 seasonal changes in dew occurrence and its effect on leaf water potential the number of days upon which leaf wetting by dew occurred accounted for 45 of the cultivation period indicating that leaf wetting by dew occurred frequently in the field table 1 in the field leaf wetting also occurs by rain and guttation indicating that plants experience leaf wetting on a considerable number of days during their growth which highlights the importance of studying the effects of leaf wetting in semi arid regions dew occurrence became more frequent in later cultivation periods july august and september although dew is a common phenomenon in the region its seasonal patterns vary among sites zhang et al 2015 meng and wen 2016 zhuang and zhao 2017 indicating that local meteorological conditions are highly important factors in dew occurrence in our field dew occurrence became more frequent as the plants grew an increase in leaf area increases local water vapor by transpiration which could have become a source of dew in addition precipitation in the region is concentrated in july august and september which increases the water vapor supply by enhancing evapotranspiration zhuang and zhao 2014 generally soil moisture provided by irrigation and precipitation is lost to the atmosphere through evapotranspiration however if some of the evaporated soil water condenses on the leaf surface and contributes to improving plant water status it may be considered a recycling of water resources in our field the œà l value of wet leaves was higher than that of non wet leaves during the early morning 06 00 09 00 fig 1 at 06 00 œà l was almost the same for wet and non wet leaves indicating that plants were able to rehydrate regardless of the presence or absence of dew the œà l value of wet leaves was higher than that of non wet leaves from 07 00 08 00 although the values became similar to one another at 9 00 for wet leaves the time of higher œà l values approximately corresponded to the duration of leaf wetting therefore a decrease in transpirational water loss probably contributed to higher œà l values for wet leaves yasutake et al 2015 4 2 effects of leaf wetting on plant water relations and gas exchange fwu is a common phenomenon across many plant species and it is known as an important water acquisition pathway subsidiary to root water uptake dawson and goldsmith 2018 the present study showed that maize leaves also have the capacity for fwu fig 2 maize is one of the major crops in northwestern china tan and zheng 2017 and leaf wetting by dew frequently occurs in this region zhang et al 2015 meng and wen 2016 zhuang and zhao 2017 this suggests that fwu is likely a common phenomenon in agricultural fields of the region and has a large impact on the water cycle our results show that fwu increases as œà l decreases fig 2 indicating that the water potential gradient between the interior of the leaf and dew water on the surface of the leaf is the driving force of fwu therefore rehydration by fwu may be more effective when water stress becomes more severe fig 8 absorbed water through fwu would be transferred along the water potential gradient inside the plant and re enter the atmosphere through transpiration however a few studies have reported that absorbed water from leaf surfaces could also redistribute to the soil via the plant eller et al 2013 zhang et al 2019a 2019b although the fwu of leaf wetting by dew can positively affect plant water status it may have little effect on plant water relations when plants have sufficient soil water availability fig 8 this is probably because of the higher resistance of the fwu pathways compared with the root water uptake pathway guzm√°n delgado et al 2018 leaf wetting by dew can both directly and indirectly affect plant gas exchange at nighttime leaf wetting by dew would improve plant water status by fwu and consequently contributes to improving daytime photosynthesis under water stress conditions simonin et al 2009 eller et al 2013 leaf wetting by dew also affects plant gas exchange after sunrise decreasing transpirational water loss by decreasing evaporative demand yasutake et al 2015 such a decrease in transpiration would mitigate a decrease in photosynthesis by stomatal closure due to excessive transpirational water loss yokoyama et al 2019 however as reported in several studies leaf wetting could also decrease photosynthesis by blocking co2 uptake through stomata ishibashi and terashima 1995 hanba et al 2004 in addition photosynthesis can decrease under leaf wetting conditions for reasons other than stomatal blockage due to a water film berry and goldsmith 2020 in this study leaf wetting contributed to the maintenance of p n and g s under water stress conditions ws ww treatment whereas plants without leaf wetting ws nowet showed a rapid decrease in p n and g s under water stress conditions fig 4 on the other hand no clear difference was found between the gas exchange parameters of ww nowet and ww wet in our study the gas exchange measurement started after leaf moisture was evaporated since it is impossible to evaluate some important gas exchange parameters i e tr and g s when leaves are wet therefore we could not evaluate gas exchange under leaf wetting conditions however it can be assumed that there is a tradeoff between carbon gain and water loss under leaf wetting conditions a longer leaf wetting duration may suppress photosynthesis for a longer time yet reduced water loss by transpiration may consequently increase future photosynthesis and may offset the reduction in photosynthesis by leaf wetting after sunrise our findings show that plant water status is a key factor in whether leaf wetting benefits plant gas exchange fig 4 leaf morphological traits such as leaf water repellency may also be important factors in determining how leaf wetting affects plant gas exchange leaves with lower water repellency would hold a larger amount of water and a larger proportion of the leaf area would be covered with a water film which may result in lower photosynthesis and transpiration under leaf wetting conditions hanba et al 2004 urrego pereira et al 2013 4 3 effects of leaf wetting on plant growth characteristics and water consumption the results of this study showed that leaf wetting by dew would have significant effects on plant physiology under water stress conditions which may consequently affect plant growth characteristics as reported in several studies leaf wetting suppresses transpirational water loss by reducing evaporative demand specifically leaf wetting increases vapor pressure near the leaf surface and suppresses an increase in leaf temperature yasutake et al 2015 yokoyama et al 2019 such effects may be beneficial in terms of water relations but are not always so for photosynthesis therefore we here propose wue as a suitable candidate for evaluating the physiological significance of leaf wetting several studies have reported the positive effects of leaf wetting by dew or fog on plant growth through its effects on plant water relations under both well watered and water stressed conditions cassana and dillenburg 2013 eller et al 2013 zhang et al 2019a 2019b further studies have reported that the positive effects of leaf wetting on plant water relations not only contribute to higher photosynthesis but also facilitate turgor driven growth which would increase growth rate stepp et al 2018 schreel et al 2019 in our study the effect of leaf wetting on above ground dw final was not statistically significant table 3 however based on the trend in growth parameters and the physiological significance of leaf wetting under water stress we assume that leaf wetting would have positive effects on plant growth under water stress conditions fig 6 in terms of water consumption no significant difference was found between tr total of the ws nowet and ws wet treatments because transpiration in the ws nowet treatment was strongly inhibited by stomatal closure due to water stress contrary to previous studies growth rate in the ww wet treatment was lower than that of ww nowet one possible explanation for this is that if plants have sufficient water the positive effects of leaf wetting on photosynthesis would be very small because the positive effects of leaf wetting on photosynthesis occur via its effects on plant water relations simonin et al 2009 eller et al 2013 on the other hand the negative effects of leaf wetting on photosynthesis would be maintained ishibashi and terashima 1995 hanba et al 2004 berry and goldsmith 2020 therefore the negative effects of leaf wetting would become relatively strong under well watered conditions resulting in a lower growth rate one interesting finding is that the manner in which leaf wetting affects plant physiology changes depending on plant water status which resulted in different wue values among experimental plots fig 7c 4 4 implication of dew effects on arid and semi arid crop production our results showed leaf wetting by dew would be an important water resource for arid and semi arid crop production in arid regions which has positive effects on plant physiological functions the positive effects of leaf wetting by dew was found when plants were under water stressed conditions this finding suggests that leaf wetting by dew would be compatible with deficit irrigation which imposes mild water stress on plants cameron et al 2006 the major problem of deficit irrigation is maintaining plant water status within mild water stress conditions which requires precise monitoring and adjustment of soil or plant water status jones 2004 in our study fwu was higher at lower leaf water potentials i e higher degree of water stress and lower at higher leaf water potentials if deficit irrigation is conducted in areas where leaf wetting by dew occurs fwu would contribute to avoiding excessive water stress fwu may be more important water aquation pathway under saline conditions which often occurs in an irrigated crop field corwin 2021 because dew water has low salinity lekouch et al 2010 dew harvesting is recognized as a viable water resource supplement especially in arid and semi arid regions tomaszkiewicz et al 2017a although the yields of harvested water is relatively small the combination of physiological effects of dew would make up for the lower amount of harvested water to our knowledge no studies have examined the combined effects of leaf wetting by dew and dew harvesting irrigation though leaf wetting by dew would contribute to improving the water usage in arid and semi arid fields there is room for improvement with evaluating the effects of leaf wetting by dew one important future research is that quantifying the effects of leaf wetting on water balance in a field leaf wetting suppresses transpirational water loss by increasing humidity near the leaf surface and suppressing an increase in leaf temperature gerlein safdi et al 2018 yasutake et al 2018 however such reduced transpiration by leaf wetting has not been quantified in field conditions because it is difficult to evaluate the evaporation of dew and transpiration separately by conventional methods one possible approach to quantify the reduced transpiration rate is that combining stem heat balance and chamber method yasutake et al 2018 the transpiration suppression by leaf wetting can also be estimated by leaf energy balance and gas exchange models gerlein safdi et al 2018 5 conclusion this study was conducted to investigate the impact of leaf wetting by dew on crop production in a semi arid environment in terms of its effects on plant physiological functions specifically 1 we investigated the frequency and duration of leaf wetting by dew through the maize cultivation periods and its effect on the leaf water potential in the maizefield of northwest china and 2 evaluated the effects of leaf wetting by dew on plant physiological functions based on the greenhouse experiments our results showed that although the amount of dew may be much smaller than that of conventional resources it could have a significant impact on agricultural production in arid and semi arid climates through its effects on plant physiological functions in maize when plants had sufficient water neither positive nor negative effects of leaf wetting on plant physiological function and growth were found however when plants were under water stressed conditions the dew on leaves was directly absorbed from the leaf surface of maize during nighttime contributed to an improvement in plant water potential and consequently increased photosynthesis during the daytime as a result dew had significantly increased plant water use efficiency under water stressed conditions our study indicates that plant water status is one of the key factors determining how leaf wetting affects plant physiological functions the question raised by this study is the extent of water stress that maximize water use efficiency while avoiding yield loss a limitation of our study is that the water stressed treatment imposed in the experiment was relatively severe which resulted in lower plant growth indicating lower crop yield an ideal outcome is that increasing water use efficiency under leaf wetting condition while keeping crop yield under some extent of water stress therefore the investigation of the optimum extent of water stress under leaf wetting condition would help us to establish better water management of agriculture in an arid and semi arid region declaration of competing interest the
