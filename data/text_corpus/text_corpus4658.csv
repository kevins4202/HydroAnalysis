23290,this study develops a coupled nonlinear hydrodynamic model of a mooring system consisting of multiple cables for analyses of floating offshore wind turbines fowts the model is based on a finite difference model of submerged cables which considers cable seabed interaction current effect cable bending and torsional stiffness the implementation of the model proposes a parallelization scheme for solving the cable responses to improve the computational efficiency the developed program is then coupled with a spar type fowt and verified using an experimentally validated open source mooring simulation program furthermore the model is used to study the impact of nonlinear dynamics of the mooring system on fowt responses in the presence of current both static responses of a spar fowt under current load and dynamic responses of the spar fowt under wind wave and current loads are investigated responses are compared where varied mooring models are used including the linear model quasi static model and nonlinear mooring models without and with current effect on cables considered the results show that the current effect on cables can have a considerable impact on the restoring effect of the mooring system and hence the spar and cable responses the current effect on mooring cables needs to be properly considered in the fowt analysis keywords mooring dynamics finite difference model offshore floating wind turbines nonlinear dynamics current effect coupled analysis 1 introduction offshore wind energy is one of the most promising renewable energy solutions ewea business intelligence 2015 modeling floating offshore wind turbines fowts is the key for commercializing current concepts at water depth beyond 45 m james and ros 2015 the nonlinear mooring dynamics is one of the challenging tasks in modeling offshore floating structures butterfield et al 2005 matha et al 2011 mooring cables have been modeled as linear or nonlinear springs in earlier dynamic analysis of offshore moored structures jain 1980 sannasiraj et al 1998 the linear or nonlinear stiffness is determined based on the initial cable profile or from the cable profiles for a number of prescribed platform displacements jonkman 2007 quasi static models have been also widely used which solve a new static problem for each updated cable fairlead position the linear and quasi static models are mainly based on the analytical catenary solution irvine 1981 the classic catenary soltuion has also been extended to include seabed friction jonkman 2007 jonkman et al 2009 and to deal with multi segment mooring cables masciola et al 2013 the improved quasi static model has been implemented in the widely used offshore wind turbine analysis tool fast jonkman 2007 jonkman and matha 2011 masciola et al 2014 the quasi static model can account for part of the nonlinear cable behavior compared to the linear model however it still lacks in the description of the hydrodynamic effect in particular the damping effect owing to the hydrodynamic drag forces while the damping was found to have considerable impact on cable responses johanning et al 2007 a nonlinear dynamic model can additionally include the cable inertia effect and current load which can not be considered in the aforementioned two methods it can also account for the coupling effect of in plane and out of plane cable motions nonlinear models generally require more computational effort while with the advancement of computational techniques they are gaining more attention recently for offshore renewable energy some recent comparison studies have demonstrated the importance of nonlinear cable dynamics in numerical analysis of offshore renewable applications fitzgerald and bergdahl 2008 kim et al 2013 karimirad and moan 2012 jeon et al 2013 masciola et al 2013 hall et al 2014 azcona et al 2017b there are mainly four different models for nonlinear mooring dynamics i e lumped mass model which dates back to walton and polachek 1960 finite element model based on rod theory garrett 1982 finite difference model and multi body dynamics model kreuzer and wilke 2003 in fact a number of finite element models are available for instance the typical model ignoring cable bending stiffness aamo and fossen 2000 and the comprehensive one including both bending and torsion effects buckham et al 2004 to name but a few the most widely used finite difference model is based on a lagrangian formulation of the cable motion bliek 1984 tjavaras 1996 however mooring cable modeling is still a topical research area due to the complexity of this problem even though these fundamental investigations have been carried out decades ago recent studies have focused on extending and validating these models and the use of them in coupled analysis for example hall and goupee 2015 and azcona et al 2017a have validated two lumped mass models respectively palm et al 2013 2017 improved the finite element model for handling snap loading in cables and antonutti et al 2018 has modeled the mooring cables using an open source finite element modeling library in particular two open source mooring codes have been developed and coupled to fast for offshore wind turbine analysis the lumped mass model by hall and goupee 2015 and the finite element model by bae 2014 however in the dynamic mooring models the current effect on cables has not received adequate attention for example to the best knowledge of the authors the two dynamic models used in the present version of fast have not provided the capability to include the current load on cables therefore this study aims at developing a dynamic mooring system model considering the current load and further to study the impact of nonlinear mooring dynamics on the fowt responses in the presence of underlying current the finite difference model developed by bliek 1984 tjavaras 1996 is adopted for describing the cable mechanics which is comprehensive as it is able to consider the cable bending and torsional effects the nonlinear strain and stress relationship and drag and inertia effects of the surrounding flow it is also relatively simple to implement the issue of numerical drift for computing cable displacement using this model has been recently tackled by gobat and grosenbaugh 2006 making it further robust this model has been widely used for modeling riser dynamics chatjigeorgiou et al 2008 katifeoglou and chatjigeorgiou 2012 while it has not been coupled with fowts the rest of this paper is organized as follows section 2 introduces the single cable mechanics and develops the coupled mooring system model the model is then coupled to a simplified spar type fowt model in section 3 and verification of the developed mooring model is provided in section 4 the numerical study on the impact of nonlinear mooring dynamics in the presence of current based on the developed models is conducted in section 5 the paper is closed with concluding remarks in section 6 2 coupled mooring system model 2 1 problem description as illustrated in fig 1 is a typical mooring system consisting of several cables attached to a platform at the fairleads the platform and the cables are subjected to wave and current loads to describe their motions a fixed global coordinate system is defined as o x y z generally the platform can be modeled as a rigid body of six degrees of freedom 6dof and its motion can be described by the three translational displacements ξ 1 ξ 2 ξ 3 and three rotations ξ 4 ξ 5 ξ 6 of a reference point although cables in a mooring system often have identical properties and the horizontal layout of the cables is axisymmetric and symmetric with respect to horizontal axes the cable static and dynamic responses are coupled when the mean wind and current effects are considered they induce static offsets of the platform and hence the cable responses need to be analyzed simultaneously for each cable solving its static and dynamic responses is a two point boundary valued problem while the boundary conditions at the fairleads of all the cables are coupled by the platform motion 2 2 single cable mechanics for solving the two point boundary valued problem of each cable the cable model developed by tjavaras 1996 tjavaras et al 1998 gobat and grosenbaugh 2006 is used herein the cable is assumed to have a uniform circular cross section with diameter d mass per unit length m bending stiffness e i and torsional stiffness g j for describing the cable motion a fixed cartesian coordinate system x c y c z c is defined for each cable as shown in figs 1 and 2 the origin of the cable cartesian coordinate is placed at the cable seabed anchor with x c pointing upwards and the x c y c plane is in the vertical plane defined by the cable anchor and the initial fairlead location the horizontal and vertical distances between the cable anchor and the initial fairlead are denoted as l c and h c respectively in deriving the equations of motion the force and moment balances are established in a moving lagrangian coordinate system attached to the unstretched cable at an arc length of s with e 1 e 2 e 3 corresponding to the local tangential normal and binormal directions the lagrangian coordinate system is parametrized by s and two angles φ and θ the cable position in the cartesian coordinate system at the arc length s can be determined from s φ θ and the cable strain ε after solving the equations in the lagrangian coordinate system gobat 2000 note that in the model formulation the poisson ratio is assumed to be 0 5

1c represent the force balances in the three directions of the local reference frame the moment balances are governed by eqs 1d 1e assuming no distributed external moments eqs 1f 1h are the compatibility relations and eqs 1i 1j are the definition of material curvatures in the preceding equations w 0 is the submerged cable weight per unit length f ε denotes the tension as a function of ε

finite difference solver the ten equations in eq 1 are to be solved for the ten unknowns i e ε s n s b u v w φ θ κ 2 κ 3 the equations can be discretized by employing the keller box finite difference method which is of second order accuracy the resulting nonlinear algebraic equations can then be solved with associated boundary conditions using the relaxation method press et al 2007 2 2 3 boundary conditions the seabed is considered as an elastic foundation with friction negelected in numerical computation the seabed effect is implemented by reducing the wet weight of the cable part grounded on the seabed assuming the seabed force is always in vertical direction the effective wet weight of the cable is defined as 6 w e s j w 0 k s b x c s j where k s b is the seabed stiffness and s j is the cable coordinate of node j and w 0 w e 0 for static problems a normalized seabed stiffness is defined as k s b k s b w 0 d the cable solution is notwithstanding insensitive to the choice of k s b and here the stiffness is chosen such that the cable wet weight is balanced by the seabed completely when x c s j d i e k s b w 0 d webster 1995 the readers are referred to tjavaras 1996 and gobat and grosenbaugh 2006 for details in most cases the catenary solution can be used for initializing the dynamic analysis and then the angle φ can be determined from the catenary profile and it is assumed that θ κ 2 s b 0 and afterwards κ 3 and s n are determined from eqs 1i 1e the typical boundary conditions are zero curvatures at both the anchor and the fairlead 7a u 1 0 v 1 0 w 1 0 κ 2 1 0 κ 3 1 0 7b κ 2 n 0 κ 3 n 0 where the superscripts indicate the anchor node or the fairlead node considering that the cable is discretized using n node for static analysis the time derivatives in eq 1 vanish and the cable velocity is zero the other three boundary equations are commonly given as the fairlead tension components in the three directions of the x c y c z c coordinate system as 8a f x c f ε cos φ cos θ s n sin φ s b cos φ sin θ n 8b f y c f ε sin φ cos θ s n cos φ s b sin φ sin θ n 8c f z c f ε sin θ s b cos θ n if the fairlead position instead of the fairlead tension is known a shooting procedure for updating the fairlead tension might be needed for placing the fairlead to the desired spot gobat 2000 in dynamic analysis seven of the boundary conditions are the same as expressed by eq 7 the other three equations are given in terms of the fairlead velocity resulting from the platform motion denoted by u t v t and w t as 9a u t u cos φ cos θ v sin φ w cos φ sin θ n 9b v t u sin φ cos θ v cos φ w sin φ sin θ n 9c w t u sin θ w cos θ n after solving the cable state along the cable the three fairlead tension components in cable reference frame can thus be computed using eq 8 2 3 implementation the coupled model is implemented by object oriented programming using c and the program is named as openmoor an open source mooring system analysis tool with the source code hosted on github the dynamic mooring analysis typically carries out the following steps i obtain current fairlead position relative to the platform reference point and the velocity at each fairlead in platform coordinate system ii obtain fairlead displacement and velocity for each cable in the corresponding cable coordinate system by the axis rotation ii solve cable state for the fairlead displacement and velocity for each cable and obtain the fairlead forces in cable coordinate system noteworthy is that in this step each cable is solved independently and parallel computation is well suited to improve the computation efficiency in openmoor parallel computation using the open multi processing openmp is implemented iv obtain fairlead forces in platform coordinate system and compute the moments due to fairlead forces with respect to the platform reference point by the cross product of fairlead forces and relative fairlead positions and v assemble the mooring load by summing the fairlead forces and moments over all the cables and return six components associated with platform motion in x y z directions and platform roll pitch and yaw rotations for static analysis of the coupled system openmoor adopts a dynamic relaxation method which performs dynamic analysis until the transient responses due to the unbalance force die out day 1965 artificial damping and mass can be added to the platform to accelerate the relaxation procedure shugar 1990 wu 1995 3 coupled to a simplified spar fowt model to study the mooring dynamics on the fowt responses when considering current effect on both the platform and the cables the developed model is coupled to a spar type fowt fig 3 shows a typical spar fowt with three blades and three mooring cables the platform coordinate system x y z is placed at the still water level swl the three dimensional spar motion is considered to include the coupling effect due to the mooring load as already shown in the literature hall et al 2014 azcona et al 2017b that the mooring dynamics has limited effects on the components far from the platform including the blades and the tower simplified modeling of these components is applied herein only the dynamic elastic deformation of the blades and the tower in y z plane are considered and rigid body motion of the blade and tower is considered in x direction the edgewise vibrations of the turbine blades are modeled here to study the mooring dynamics on the blade and tower vibrations in the presence of current as will be shown in section 5 the effects of mooring dynamics and current on the tower and blade vibrations are ignorable which justifies this simplification for the present purpose in derivation of the model the euler lagrange equation is used following dinh and basu 2013 fitzgerald et al 2013 fitzgerald and basu 2014 zhang et al 2015 dinh et al 2016 3 1 motion description the edgewise vibration of each blade is modeled using the rayleigh ritz method with the first edgewise mode retained leading to three generalized displacements relative to the undeformed blades q 1 q 2 and q 3 the tower is considered as rigidly connected to the spar at its bottom and the first mode side to side vibration is modeled also using the rayleigh ritz method with generalized horizontal in plane displacement q 4 the absolute displacements of tower top in y and z directions are denoted as q 4 and q 5 respectively the nacelle is modeled as a lumped mass fixed at the top of the tower the spar is modeled as a rigid body with the reference point placed at the center of gravity g the 6dof at the reference point is illustrated in figs 1 and 3 the axial deformation of the tower is ignorable and the rotations of the spar are generally small jonkman 2007 it is thus approximated that the vertical displacement along the tower is a constant and hence q 5 ξ 3 and hence the nacelle the top of the tower vertical displacement is denoted as ξ 3 for conciseness as a consequence the spar fowt motion is defined by the generalized displacement vector as 10 q t q 1 q 2 q 10 q 1 q 2 q 3 q 4 ξ 1 ξ 2 ξ 3 ξ 4 ξ 5 ξ 6 where the superscript is the vector transpose operator 3 2 tower and nacelle model the first mode shape of the tower side to side vibration is denoted by ϕ t z t where z t is the tower axis upward originating from tower base hence the tower lateral deformation is denoted as ϕ t z t q 4 t the tower height is denoted as h t measured from the base of the tower and tower mass per unit height is denoted as μ t z t the velocities along the tower in x y and z directions are denoted by 11a u t z t t ξ 1 h h t z t ξ 5 11b v t z t t ϕ t z t q 4 ξ 2 h h t z t ξ 4 11c w t z t t ξ 3 where denotes the time derivative the tower displacements at the top in y and z directions are approximated as 12a q 4 q 4 ϕ t h t ξ 2 h sin ξ 4 q 4 ϕ t h t ξ 2 h ξ 4 12b q 5 ξ 3 h 1 cos ξ 4 ξ 3 where h is the distance between the hub center and the spar center of gravity g note that the mode shape function ϕ t is normalized so that ϕ t h t 1 which is thus omitted in the following 3 3 blade model each blade is modeled as a bernoulli euler cantilever beam of length r with variable bending stiffness and variable mass per unit length μ b r where r is the blade coordinate along the blade axis with origin at the hub center as shown in fig 3 considering that the blades rotate at a constant speed ω rad s the azimuthal angle ψ i t of blade i at time t is expressed as 13 ψ i t ω t i 1 2 π 3 given the fundamental edgewise mode shape of the blade ϕ b r the lateral displacement of the blade i at a longitudinal location r and time instant t is expressed as ϕ b r q i t i 1 2 3 the absolute velocities along blade longitudinal and lateral directions are thus obtained as dinh and basu 2015 14a v b i r t q 4 sinψ i ξ 3 cosψ i ω ϕ b r q i 14b w b i r t q 4 cosψ i ξ 3 sinψ i ϕ b r q i ω r and the blade velocity in x direction is u b i t ξ 1 h ξ 5 3 4 euler lagrange equation the equation of motion of the spar fowt can be established by using the euler lagrange equation as 15 d d t t q t q v q f t where f denotes the external forces and will be detailed in the next section the total kinetic energy t of the spar fowt is computed as 16 t 1 2 i 1 3 0 r μ b r u b i 2 t v b i 2 r t w b i 2 r t d r 1 2 0 h t μ t z t u t 2 z t t v t 2 z t t w t 2 z t t d z t 1 2 m n q 4 2 ξ 3 2 ξ 1 h ξ 5 1 2 m s ξ 1 2

and z directions the total potential energy v of the spar fowt is obtained as hansen 2003 staino et al 2012 17 v 1 2 i 1 3 k b e k b i g k b ω q i 2 1 2 k t e q 4 2 where k b e and k t e are modal stiffness of the blade and the tower respectively i e k b e ω b 2 m b e and k t e ω t 2 m t e with ω b and ω t being the natural angular frequencies of the blade and tower the blade and tower modal masses are given as m b e 0 r μ b r ϕ b 2 d r and m t e 0 h t μ t ϕ t z t d z t the term k b i g i 1 2 3 is the blade stiffness arising from gravity 18 k b i g g cosψ i 0 r r r μ b τ d τ d ϕ b d r 2 d r in which g is the gravitational acceleration and τ is an integration variable the term k b c is the centrifugal stiffening effect on blade 19 k b c ω 2 0 r r r μ b τ τ d τ d ϕ b d r 2 d r substituting eq 16 and eq 17 into the left hand side of the euler lagrange equation gives the mass stiffness and damping matrices owing to structural elasticity and blade rotation denoted as m k and c respectively expressions for these matrices are given in appendix a 3 5 spar fowt loads the loads on the spar fowt include the aerodynamic loading on the blades due to wind hydrostatic effect on spar hydrodynamic effect on spar due to waves and current and the mooring load the hydrostatic and hydrodynamic effects of the cables due to the current are included in computing the mooring load the wind load acting on the tower is neglected since the spar fowt responses in operational condition are concerned in this study karimirad and moan 2012 3 5 1 aerodynamic load on blades given a virtual displacement of the spar fowt δ q the virtual work done by external wind load acting on the blades can be expressed as 20 δ w w i 1 3 0 r p i r t d r ϕ b δ q i δ q 4 cosψ i δ ξ 3 sinψ i δ ξ 1 where p i r t i 1 2 3 is the wind load intensity along the blade length in the edgewise direction calculated by using blade element momentum method hansen 2008 staino et al 2012 for the steady state loads and by applying quasi static approach for both rotational sampled turbulence and the induced aerodynamic loads herein the wind considered is in the same direction as the rotor axis differentiating the preceding equation with respect to q the generalized aerodynamic load vector is obtained denoted as f w f w j with nonzero components given as 21a f w j 0 r p j r t ϕ b r d r j 1 2 3 21b f w j i 1 3 0

the total tower mass is m t 0 h t μ t d z t the preceding expression is differentiated with respect to q to obtain the generalized gravitational load denoted as f g f g j with nonzero components 23a f g j m b 1 g sinψ j j 1 2 3 23b f g 7 3 m b m n m t m s g where m b 0 r μ b r d r is the total mass of each blade and m b 1 0 r μ b r ϕ b r d r is the blade mass weighted by the mode shape 3 5 3 hydrostatic and hydrodynamic effects on the spar the buoyancy load f b can be computed using archimedes s principle based on the draft of the spar fowt leading to one nonzero component f b 7 the restoring stiffness matrix k r is obtained based on the water plane area and the center of the buoyancy faltinsen 1993 the hydrodynamic forces per unit length on the spar in horizontal directions are determined using the morison formula morison et al 1950 jonkman 2007 the moments due to these hydrodynamic force are calculated accordingly they are given as 24a d f h 5 z c s a ρ π 4 d s 2 z u s z d z 1 c s a ρ π 4 d s 2 z u f z d z 1 2 c s d ρ d s z u s f z u s f 2 z v s f 2 z 1 2 d z 24b d f h 6 z c s a ρ π 4 d s 2 z v s z d z 1 c s a ρ π 4 d s 2 z v f z d z 1 2 c s d ρ d s z v s f z u s f 2 z v s f 2 z 1 2 d z d f h 8 z z z g d f h 6 z d f h 9 z z z g d f h 5 z where c s a and c s d are the added mass coefficient and drag coefficient of the spar u s z v s z are spar horizontal velocity components in x and y directions u f z and v f z are fluid velocity components in x y directions and the horizontal fluid velocities relative to the spar are calculated as u s f u f u s and v s f v f v s the spar velocity at a particular depth can be computed based on the rigid motion of the spar from the velocity of the spar at the reference point using the strip theory the spar is divided into segments and the preceding expressions are used to obtain the hydrodynamic force on each segment and the total forces are computed by summing up them over the spar draft the added mass and damping effect of the flow in the heave direction are ignored the hydrodynamic force for spar heave motion f h 7 is only due to the wave excitation which is calculated using the dynamic pressure method karimirad et al 2011 in other words the dynamic pressure on the spar is computed using potential theory and is then integrated over the bottom and conical area of the spar 3 5 4 wave and current modeling the linear potential theory faltinsen 1993 is adopted for the wave velocity acceleration and dynamic pressure at the spar position for irregular waves the pierson moskowitz wave spectrum defined in the iec 61400 3 design standard for offshore wind turbines is used here international electrotechnical commission 2009 jonkman 2007 with h s denoting the significance wave height and t p denoting the peak wave period the current velocity profile is often described using discrete data points in the global coordinate here current velocity is considered as a function of the water depth and the profile is first fitted using a polynomial function which is then used to update the current velocity at the spar and the cable positions the fluid flow due to waves and current are superposed ignoring the wave current interaction the current is considered in the same or opposite direction of the traveling waves in the following numerical analysis both the wave and current in x and y directions are considered in the latter case a 90 degree misalignment between the wave and wind directions is assumed which is practically feasible according to field measurements barth and eecen 2006 3 6 coupled analysis substituting the loads into eq 15 one obtains 25 m q c q k k r q f w f g f b f h f m the structural damping of the blade and tower and additional hydrodynamic spar damping can be directly added to c matrix at each time step the displacements and velocities of the platform at the gravity center are fed to openmoor to obtain the mooring load f m the preceding second order differential equation is recast into a first order differential equation and solved using ode4 or ode45 in matlab 2010 openmoor has been compiled as a dynamic linking library to couple with the spar fowt model the flowchart of the coupled analysis is illustrated in fig 4 4 verification in this section the developed mooring model is verified with an open source mooring model moordyn which has been validated against experiments hall and goupee 2015 as aforementioned the nonlinear mooring dynamics is known to have marginal effect on the blade and tower responses in this section the blade and tower in plane vibrations are also ignored and the mass of the superstructure is lumped to the center of gravity of the spar leading to a 6dof spar fowt model 4 1 spar fowt description the nrel offshore 5 mw baseline wind turbine supported on the oc3 hywind spar buoy is used for numerical analysis jonkman et al 2009 jonkman 2010 the structural properties of the blades the tower and the spar including distributed mass bending stiffness and mode shape and blade aerodynamics are extracted from the fast test case input files the main structural properties are summarized in table 1 the modal damping ratios for the blades and tower are 0 48 and 1 respectively and additional spar damping is also included jonkman 2010 the gravitational acceleration g 9 80665 m s2 and the density of water ρ 1025 kg m3 are used the mooring system of the oc3 hywind platform has three cables with associated parameters listed in table 2 note that the crow foot of the mooring system is neglected in mooring modeling while additional stiffness to the platform yaw motion is added to the restoring stiffness matrix jonkman 2010 jonkman and matha 2011 a linear stress stain relationship is considered as f ε e a ε where e a is the cable axial stiffness the cable bending and torsional stiffnesses are set to zeros the hydrodynamic coefficients are adopted following azcona et al 2017b 4 2 verification of openmoor in using openmoor the cable is discretized using 50 nodes gobat and grosenbaugh 2006 and correspondingly 50 segments are used in applying moordyn hall and goupee 2015 the spar is subjected to irregular waves described using the pierson moskowitz spectrum with significant height 9 8 m and peak period of 14 3 s azcona et al 2017b corresponding to the 1 year significant wave condition of a location in the coast of ireland in the first case the waves are in x direction since the system is symmetric with respect to x axis and hence the platform displacement in y direction the roll and yaw rotations are quite small fig 5 shows the surge and heave displacements the pitch rotation of the spar and the fairlead tension of cable 1 which is subjected to the largest fairlead tension variation among the three cables the responses computed using both programs are consistent in the second case waves in y direction are considered the mooring system behaves differently as compared to case 1 because the system is not symmetric with respect to y axis which leads to coupled surge and sway motions the spar motion and the fairlead tension of cable 2 are illustrated in fig 6 as can be seen the surge motion of the spar induces low frequency motion in x direction and a static drift in x direction is also observable yaw rotation is also observed due to the coupling effect albeit of pretty small amplitude again the results obtained using both programs are quite consistent small difference is seen in the spar surge motion while the overall displacement is small 5 application to study the impact of nonlinear mooring dynamics on fowt responses in the presence of current in this section the mooring model is used to study the impact of the mooring dynamics on the spar fowt responses in the presence of current both static and dynamic responses are studied and the fowt responses are computed using four different mooring models for comparison i e the linear spring model quasi static model openmoor without considering current effect on cables labeled as openmoor in the following graphics and openmoor including the current effect on cables since at the beginning of the analysis the static position of the spar is unknown the linear cable stiffness is computed based on the initial configuration of the cables using the method in kreuzer and wilke 2003 the quasi static mooring load is computed based on the classic catenary solution irvine 1981 5 1 static responses in the static analysis the 6dof model of the spar fowt the same as in the verification case is used a uniform current of 1 0 m s is considered in x and y directions respectively the static responses are computed using the dynamic relaxation method the actual mass and damping matrices are used in the relaxation procedure when the current is in x direction the spar undergoes a significant static offset in the same direction fig 7 shows the spar surge motion and the fairlead tension of cable 1 considerable differences are seen from the responses obtained using different mooring models the linear mooring model provides conservative estimates in this case using the dynamic mooring model with current effect on cables considered the surge offset of the spar is 9 48 m as compared to 8 77 m when this effect is ignored the quasi static result is in between these two results from fig 7 it is seen that the current induces a clear decrement of the fairlead tension of cable 1 in this case as shown in fig 8 the current in y direction induces not only a static offset of the spar in y direction but also observable movements in x and z directions due to the coupling effect again considerable differences can be found in the results using varied mooring models the modeling of the current effect on cables is shown to be important to model the coupling of the spar motion in different directions 5 2 dynamics responses for the dynamic analysis the spar fowt model described in section 3 is used the blade rotation speed is considered to be at the rated rotor speed for the baseline wind turbine i e 12 1 rpm the mean wind speed at the top of the tower is considered to be at the rated wind speed of 12 m s with a turbulence of 15 the wave loading is the same as in the verification case and a uniform current of 1 0 m s is additionally considered in the same direction of the waves in all the simulated cases the blade responses computed using different mooring models are almost identical and hence are not plotted in the following fig 9 shows the spar motion and cable fairlead tensions when the wave and current are in x direction in this case the tower side to side displacement is also small and not shown quite significant differences can be seen from the spar surge displacement and the cable fairlead tensions using varied mooring models the current effect on cables increases the mean value of the surge displacement while the dynamic variation is broadly the same as the result when this effect is not considered notwithstanding the current not only affects the mean values of the fairlead tensions but can also increase the amplitude of the dynamic variations fig 10 shows the tower and spar responses and the cable fairlead tensions when the wave and current are in the y direction the tower responses show slight difference when the dynamics of the mooring cables is modeled however whether the current effect on cables is included when using the dynamic model has very small effect on the tower responses for the spar motion the current load on cables has a clear effect on the mean value of the displacement while seems not to influence the dynamic responses much again the current clearly increases the dynamic fairlead tensions of the cables in all the dynamic analyses the current load on cables has very small effect on the spar heave motion because of the relatively large restoring stiffness due to buoyancy effect in this direction generally speaking the current load on mooring cables increases the dynamic responses of the mooring cables nevertheless its effect on the overall restoring stiffness of the mooring system depends on the current direction and the horizontal layout of the mooring cables as well the current effect on cables should be taken into account in dynamic analysis of fowts if the spar and cable responses are concerned this effect on the blade and tower responses is pretty small which in turn validate the use of a simplified blade and tower model in the present study 6 concluding remarks this study has developed a coupled mooring system model based on a finite different model of mooring cables the model able to consider cable seabed interaction bending stiffness and current effect is implemented with parallel computation for efficiently handling mooring systems with multiple cables the model is then coupled with a simplified spar fowt model and it is verified with an open source mooring analysis program when no current is considered good agreements are found in the results using the two programs for coupled analysis the developed model has been further applied to study the mooring dynamics on the fowt responses in the presence of current both static responses and dynamic responses have been investigated based on the nrel offshore 5 mw baseline wind turbine supported by the oc3 hywind spar buoy by comparing the spar fowt responses using varied mooring models it is found that for most cases the current effect on the cable can be ignored when the blade and tower responses are concerned the current effect can induce larger fairlead tension variations of mooring cables however the overall effect on the restoring effect of the mooring system on the platform depends on the current direction and also the layout of the cables when the spar motion and in particular the mooring cables are of concern the current effect on the cable needs to be properly included further study is directed to validating the present model using experimental data the model will also be coupled with more detailed model to study the current effects and the wave current interaction on the offshore floating structures acknowledgments

23290,this study develops a coupled nonlinear hydrodynamic model of a mooring system consisting of multiple cables for analyses of floating offshore wind turbines fowts the model is based on a finite difference model of submerged cables which considers cable seabed interaction current effect cable bending and torsional stiffness the implementation of the model proposes a parallelization scheme for solving the cable responses to improve the computational efficiency the developed program is then coupled with a spar type fowt and verified using an experimentally validated open source mooring simulation program furthermore the model is used to study the impact of nonlinear dynamics of the mooring system on fowt responses in the presence of current both static responses of a spar fowt under current load and dynamic responses of the spar fowt under wind wave and current loads are investigated responses are compared where varied mooring models are used including the linear model quasi static model and nonlinear mooring models without and with current effect on cables considered the results show that the current effect on cables can have a considerable impact on the restoring effect of the mooring system and hence the spar and cable responses the current effect on mooring cables needs to be properly considered in the fowt analysis keywords mooring dynamics finite difference model offshore floating wind turbines nonlinear dynamics current effect coupled analysis 1 introduction offshore wind energy is one of the most promising renewable energy solutions ewea business intelligence 2015 modeling floating offshore wind turbines fowts is the key for commercializing current concepts at water depth beyond 45 m james and ros 2015 the nonlinear mooring dynamics is one of the challenging tasks in modeling offshore floating structures butterfield et al 2005 matha et al 2011 mooring cables have been modeled as linear or nonlinear springs in earlier dynamic analysis of offshore moored structures jain 1980 sannasiraj et al 1998 the linear or nonlinear stiffness is determined based on the initial cable profile or from the cable profiles for a number of prescribed platform displacements jonkman 2007 quasi static models have been also widely used which solve a new static problem for each updated cable fairlead position the linear and quasi static models are mainly based on the analytical catenary solution irvine 1981 the classic catenary soltuion has also been extended to include seabed friction jonkman 2007 jonkman et al 2009 and to deal with multi segment mooring cables masciola et al 2013 the improved quasi static model has been implemented in the widely used offshore wind turbine analysis tool fast jonkman 2007 jonkman and matha 2011 masciola et al 2014 the quasi static model can account for part of the nonlinear cable behavior compared to the linear model however it still lacks in the description of the hydrodynamic effect in particular the damping effect owing to the hydrodynamic drag forces while the damping was found to have considerable impact on cable responses johanning et al 2007 a nonlinear dynamic model can additionally include the cable inertia effect and current load which can not be considered in the aforementioned two methods it can also account for the coupling effect of in plane and out of plane cable motions nonlinear models generally require more computational effort while with the advancement of computational techniques they are gaining more attention recently for offshore renewable energy some recent comparison studies have demonstrated the importance of nonlinear cable dynamics in numerical analysis of offshore renewable applications fitzgerald and bergdahl 2008 kim et al 2013 karimirad and moan 2012 jeon et al 2013 masciola et al 2013 hall et al 2014 azcona et al 2017b there are mainly four different models for nonlinear mooring dynamics i e lumped mass model which dates back to walton and polachek 1960 finite element model based on rod theory garrett 1982 finite difference model and multi body dynamics model kreuzer and wilke 2003 in fact a number of finite element models are available for instance the typical model ignoring cable bending stiffness aamo and fossen 2000 and the comprehensive one including both bending and torsion effects buckham et al 2004 to name but a few the most widely used finite difference model is based on a lagrangian formulation of the cable motion bliek 1984 tjavaras 1996 however mooring cable modeling is still a topical research area due to the complexity of this problem even though these fundamental investigations have been carried out decades ago recent studies have focused on extending and validating these models and the use of them in coupled analysis for example hall and goupee 2015 and azcona et al 2017a have validated two lumped mass models respectively palm et al 2013 2017 improved the finite element model for handling snap loading in cables and antonutti et al 2018 has modeled the mooring cables using an open source finite element modeling library in particular two open source mooring codes have been developed and coupled to fast for offshore wind turbine analysis the lumped mass model by hall and goupee 2015 and the finite element model by bae 2014 however in the dynamic mooring models the current effect on cables has not received adequate attention for example to the best knowledge of the authors the two dynamic models used in the present version of fast have not provided the capability to include the current load on cables therefore this study aims at developing a dynamic mooring system model considering the current load and further to study the impact of nonlinear mooring dynamics on the fowt responses in the presence of underlying current the finite difference model developed by bliek 1984 tjavaras 1996 is adopted for describing the cable mechanics which is comprehensive as it is able to consider the cable bending and torsional effects the nonlinear strain and stress relationship and drag and inertia effects of the surrounding flow it is also relatively simple to implement the issue of numerical drift for computing cable displacement using this model has been recently tackled by gobat and grosenbaugh 2006 making it further robust this model has been widely used for modeling riser dynamics chatjigeorgiou et al 2008 katifeoglou and chatjigeorgiou 2012 while it has not been coupled with fowts the rest of this paper is organized as follows section 2 introduces the single cable mechanics and develops the coupled mooring system model the model is then coupled to a simplified spar type fowt model in section 3 and verification of the developed mooring model is provided in section 4 the numerical study on the impact of nonlinear mooring dynamics in the presence of current based on the developed models is conducted in section 5 the paper is closed with concluding remarks in section 6 2 coupled mooring system model 2 1 problem description as illustrated in fig 1 is a typical mooring system consisting of several cables attached to a platform at the fairleads the platform and the cables are subjected to wave and current loads to describe their motions a fixed global coordinate system is defined as o x y z generally the platform can be modeled as a rigid body of six degrees of freedom 6dof and its motion can be described by the three translational displacements ξ 1 ξ 2 ξ 3 and three rotations ξ 4 ξ 5 ξ 6 of a reference point although cables in a mooring system often have identical properties and the horizontal layout of the cables is axisymmetric and symmetric with respect to horizontal axes the cable static and dynamic responses are coupled when the mean wind and current effects are considered they induce static offsets of the platform and hence the cable responses need to be analyzed simultaneously for each cable solving its static and dynamic responses is a two point boundary valued problem while the boundary conditions at the fairleads of all the cables are coupled by the platform motion 2 2 single cable mechanics for solving the two point boundary valued problem of each cable the cable model developed by tjavaras 1996 tjavaras et al 1998 gobat and grosenbaugh 2006 is used herein the cable is assumed to have a uniform circular cross section with diameter d mass per unit length m bending stiffness e i and torsional stiffness g j for describing the cable motion a fixed cartesian coordinate system x c y c z c is defined for each cable as shown in figs 1 and 2 the origin of the cable cartesian coordinate is placed at the cable seabed anchor with x c pointing upwards and the x c y c plane is in the vertical plane defined by the cable anchor and the initial fairlead location the horizontal and vertical distances between the cable anchor and the initial fairlead are denoted as l c and h c respectively in deriving the equations of motion the force and moment balances are established in a moving lagrangian coordinate system attached to the unstretched cable at an arc length of s with e 1 e 2 e 3 corresponding to the local tangential normal and binormal directions the lagrangian coordinate system is parametrized by s and two angles φ and θ the cable position in the cartesian coordinate system at the arc length s can be determined from s φ θ and the cable strain ε after solving the equations in the lagrangian coordinate system gobat 2000 note that in the model formulation the poisson ratio is assumed to be 0 5

finite difference solver the ten equations in eq 1 are to be solved for the ten unknowns i e ε s n s b u v w φ θ κ 2 κ 3 the equations can be discretized by employing the keller box finite difference method which is of second order accuracy the resulting nonlinear algebraic equations can then be solved with associated boundary conditions using the relaxation method press et al 2007 2 2 3 boundary conditions the seabed is considered as an elastic foundation with friction negelected in numerical computation the seabed effect is implemented by reducing the wet weight of the cable part grounded on the seabed assuming the seabed force is always in vertical direction the effective wet weight of the cable is defined as 6 w e s j w 0 k s b x c s j where k s b is the seabed stiffness and s j is the cable coordinate of node j and w 0 w e 0 for static problems a normalized seabed stiffness is defined as k s b k s b w 0 d the cable solution is notwithstanding insensitive to the choice of k s b and here the stiffness is chosen such that the cable wet weight is balanced by the seabed completely when x c s j d i e k s b w 0 d webster 1995 the readers are referred to tjavaras 1996 and gobat and grosenbaugh 2006 for details in most cases the catenary solution can be used for initializing the dynamic analysis and then the angle φ can be determined from the catenary profile and it is assumed that θ κ 2 s b 0 and afterwards κ 3 and s n are determined from eqs 1i 1e the typical boundary conditions are zero curvatures at both the anchor and the fairlead 7a u 1 0 v 1 0 w 1 0 κ 2 1 0 κ 3 1 0 7b κ 2 n 0 κ 3 n 0 where the superscripts indicate the anchor node or the fairlead node considering that the cable is discretized using n node for static analysis the time derivatives in eq 1 vanish and the cable velocity is zero the other three boundary equations are commonly given as the fairlead tension components in the three directions of the x c y c z c coordinate system as 8a f x c f ε cos φ cos θ s n sin φ s b cos φ sin θ n 8b f y c f ε sin φ cos θ s n cos φ s b sin φ sin θ n 8c f z c f ε sin θ s b cos θ n if the fairlead position instead of the fairlead tension is known a shooting procedure for updating the fairlead tension might be needed for placing the fairlead to the desired spot gobat 2000 in dynamic analysis seven of the boundary conditions are the same as expressed by eq 7 the other three equations are given in terms of the fairlead velocity resulting from the platform motion denoted by u t v t and w t as 9a u t u cos φ cos θ v sin φ w cos φ sin θ n 9b v t u sin φ cos θ v cos φ w sin φ sin θ n 9c w t u sin θ w cos θ n after solving the cable state along the cable the three fairlead tension components in cable reference frame can thus be computed using eq 8 2 3 implementation the coupled model is implemented by object oriented programming using c and the program is named as openmoor an open source mooring system analysis tool with the source code hosted on github the dynamic mooring analysis typically carries out the following steps i obtain current fairlead position relative to the platform reference point and the velocity at each fairlead in platform coordinate system ii obtain fairlead displacement and velocity for each cable in the corresponding cable coordinate system by the axis rotation ii solve cable state for the fairlead displacement and velocity for each cable and obtain the fairlead forces in cable coordinate system noteworthy is that in this step each cable is solved independently and parallel computation is well suited to improve the computation efficiency in openmoor parallel computation using the open multi processing openmp is implemented iv obtain fairlead forces in platform coordinate system and compute the moments due to fairlead forces with respect to the platform reference point by the cross product of fairlead forces and relative fairlead positions and v assemble the mooring load by summing the fairlead forces and moments over all the cables and return six components associated with platform motion in x y z directions and platform roll pitch and yaw rotations for static analysis of the coupled system openmoor adopts a dynamic relaxation method which performs dynamic analysis until the transient responses due to the unbalance force die out day 1965 artificial damping and mass can be added to the platform to accelerate the relaxation procedure shugar 1990 wu 1995 3 coupled to a simplified spar fowt model to study the mooring dynamics on the fowt responses when considering current effect on both the platform and the cables the developed model is coupled to a spar type fowt fig 3 shows a typical spar fowt with three blades and three mooring cables the platform coordinate system x y z is placed at the still water level swl the three dimensional spar motion is considered to include the coupling effect due to the mooring load as already shown in the literature hall et al 2014 azcona et al 2017b that the mooring dynamics has limited effects on the components far from the platform including the blades and the tower simplified modeling of these components is applied herein only the dynamic elastic deformation of the blades and the tower in y z plane are considered and rigid body motion of the blade and tower is considered in x direction the edgewise vibrations of the turbine blades are modeled here to study the mooring dynamics on the blade and tower vibrations in the presence of current as will be shown in section 5 the effects of mooring dynamics and current on the tower and blade vibrations are ignorable which justifies this simplification for the present purpose in derivation of the model the euler lagrange equation is used following dinh and basu 2013 fitzgerald et al 2013 fitzgerald and basu 2014 zhang et al 2015 dinh et al 2016 3 1 motion description the edgewise vibration of each blade is modeled using the rayleigh ritz method with the first edgewise mode retained leading to three generalized displacements relative to the undeformed blades q 1 q 2 and q 3 the tower is considered as rigidly connected to the spar at its bottom and the first mode side to side vibration is modeled also using the rayleigh ritz method with generalized horizontal in plane displacement q 4 the absolute displacements of tower top in y and z directions are denoted as q 4 and q 5 respectively the nacelle is modeled as a lumped mass fixed at the top of the tower the spar is modeled as a rigid body with the reference point placed at the center of gravity g the 6dof at the reference point is illustrated in figs 1 and 3 the axial deformation of the tower is ignorable and the rotations of the spar are generally small jonkman 2007 it is thus approximated that the vertical displacement along the tower is a constant and hence q 5 ξ 3 and hence the nacelle the top of the tower vertical displacement is denoted as ξ 3 for conciseness as a consequence the spar fowt motion is defined by the generalized displacement vector as 10 q t q 1 q 2 q 10 q 1 q 2 q 3 q 4 ξ 1 ξ 2 ξ 3 ξ 4 ξ 5 ξ 6 where the superscript is the vector transpose operator 3 2 tower and nacelle model the first mode shape of the tower side to side vibration is denoted by ϕ t z t where z t is the tower axis upward originating from tower base hence the tower lateral deformation is denoted as ϕ t z t q 4

u t z t t ξ 1 h h t z t ξ 5 11b v t z t t ϕ t z t q 4 ξ 2 h h t z t ξ 4 11c w t z t t ξ 3 where denotes the time derivative the tower displacements at the top in y and z directions are approximated as 12a q 4 q 4 ϕ t h t ξ 2 h sin ξ 4 q 4 ϕ t h t ξ 2 h ξ 4 12b q 5 ξ 3 h 1 cos ξ 4 ξ 3 where h is the distance between the hub center and the spar center of gravity g note that the mode shape function ϕ

variable mass per unit length μ b r where r is the blade coordinate along the blade axis with origin at the hub center as shown in fig 3 considering that the blades rotate at a constant speed ω rad s the azimuthal angle ψ i t of blade i at time t is expressed as 13 ψ i t ω t i 1 2 π 3 given the fundamental edgewise mode shape of the blade ϕ b r the lateral displacement of the blade i at a longitudinal location r and time instant t is expressed as ϕ b r q i t i 1 2 3 the absolute velocities along blade longitudinal and lateral directions are thus obtained as dinh and basu 2015 14a v b i r t q 4 sinψ i ξ 3 cosψ i ω ϕ b r q i 14b w b i r t q 4 cosψ i ξ 3 sinψ i ϕ b r q i ω r and the blade velocity in x direction is u b i t ξ 1 h ξ 5 3 4 euler lagrange equation the equation of motion of the spar fowt can be established by using the euler lagrange equation as 15 d d t t q t q v q f t where f denotes the external forces and will be detailed in the next section the total kinetic energy

stiffness of the blade and the tower respectively i e k b e ω b 2 m b e and k t e ω t 2 m t e with ω b and ω t being the natural angular frequencies of the blade and tower the blade and tower modal masses are given as m b e 0 r μ b r ϕ b 2 d r and m t e 0 h t μ t ϕ t z t d z t the term k b i g i 1 2 3 is the blade stiffness arising from gravity 18 k b i g g cosψ i 0 r r r μ b τ d τ d ϕ b d r 2 d

substituting eq 16 and eq 17 into the left hand side of the euler lagrange equation gives the mass stiffness and damping matrices owing to structural elasticity and blade rotation denoted as m k and c respectively expressions for these matrices are given in appendix a 3 5 spar fowt loads the loads on the spar fowt include the aerodynamic loading on the blades due to wind hydrostatic effect on spar hydrodynamic effect on spar due to waves and current and the mooring load the hydrostatic and hydrodynamic effects of the cables due to the current are included in computing the mooring load the wind load acting on the tower is neglected since the spar fowt responses in operational condition are concerned in this study karimirad and moan 2012 3 5 1 aerodynamic load on blades given a virtual displacement of the spar fowt δ q the virtual work done by external wind load acting on the blades can be expressed as 20 δ w w i 1 3 0 r p i r t d r ϕ b δ q i δ q 4 cosψ i δ ξ 3 sinψ i δ ξ 1 where p i r t i 1 2 3 is the wind load intensity along the blade length in the edgewise direction calculated by using blade element momentum method hansen 2008 staino et al 2012 for the steady state loads and by applying quasi static approach for both rotational sampled turbulence and the induced aerodynamic loads herein the wind considered is in the same direction as the rotor axis differentiating the preceding equation with respect to q the generalized aerodynamic load vector is obtained denoted as f w f w j with nonzero components given as 21a f w j 0 r p j r t ϕ b r d r j 1 2 3 21b f w j i 1 3 0

the total tower mass is m t 0 h t μ t d z t the preceding expression is differentiated with respect to q to obtain the generalized gravitational load denoted as f g f g j with nonzero components 23a f

hydrostatic and hydrodynamic effects on the spar the buoyancy load f b can be computed using archimedes s principle based on the draft of the spar fowt leading to one nonzero component f b 7 the restoring stiffness matrix k r is obtained based on the water plane area and the center of the buoyancy faltinsen 1993 the hydrodynamic forces per unit length on the spar in horizontal directions are determined using the morison formula morison et al 1950 jonkman 2007 the moments due to these hydrodynamic force are calculated accordingly they are given as 24a d f h 5 z c s a ρ π 4 d s 2 z u s z d

components in x and y directions u f z and v f z are fluid velocity components in x y directions and the horizontal fluid velocities relative to the spar are calculated as u s f u f u s and v s f v f v s the spar velocity at a particular depth can be computed based on the rigid motion of the spar from the velocity of the spar at the reference point using the strip theory the spar is divided into segments and the preceding expressions are used to obtain the hydrodynamic force on each segment and the total forces are computed by summing up them over the spar draft the added mass and damping effect of the flow in the heave direction are ignored the hydrodynamic force for spar heave motion f h 7 is only due to the wave excitation which is calculated using the dynamic pressure method karimirad et al 2011 in other words the dynamic pressure on the spar is computed using potential theory and is then integrated over the bottom and conical area of the spar 3 5 4 wave and current modeling the linear potential theory faltinsen 1993 is adopted for the wave velocity acceleration and dynamic pressure at the spar position for irregular waves the pierson moskowitz wave spectrum defined in the iec 61400 3 design standard for offshore wind turbines is used here international electrotechnical commission 2009 jonkman 2007 with h s denoting the significance wave height and t p denoting the peak wave period the current velocity profile is often described using discrete data points in the global coordinate here current velocity is considered as a function of the water depth and the profile is first fitted using a polynomial function which is then used to update the current velocity at the spar and the cable positions the fluid flow due to waves and current are superposed ignoring the wave current interaction the current is considered in the same or opposite direction of the traveling waves in the following numerical analysis both the wave and current in x and y directions are considered in the latter case a 90 degree misalignment between the wave and wind directions is assumed which is practically feasible according to field measurements barth and eecen 2006 3 6 coupled analysis substituting the loads into eq 15 one obtains 25 m q c q k k r q f w f g f b f h f m the structural damping of the blade and tower and additional hydrodynamic spar damping can be directly added to c matrix at each time step the displacements and velocities of the platform at the gravity center are fed to openmoor to obtain the mooring load f m the preceding second order differential equation is recast into a first order differential equation and solved using ode4 or ode45 in matlab 2010 openmoor has been compiled as a dynamic linking library to couple with the spar fowt model the flowchart of the coupled analysis is illustrated in fig 4 4 verification in this section the developed mooring model is verified with an open source mooring model moordyn which has been validated against experiments hall and goupee 2015 as aforementioned the nonlinear mooring dynamics is known to have marginal effect on the blade and tower responses in this section the blade and tower in plane vibrations are also ignored and the mass of the superstructure is lumped to the center of gravity of the spar leading to a 6dof spar fowt model 4 1 spar fowt description the nrel offshore 5 mw baseline wind turbine supported on the oc3 hywind spar buoy is used for numerical analysis jonkman et al 2009 jonkman 2010 the structural properties of the blades the tower and the spar including distributed mass bending stiffness and mode shape and blade aerodynamics are extracted from the fast test case input files the main structural properties are summarized in table 1 the modal damping ratios for the blades and tower are 0 48 and 1 respectively and additional spar damping is also included jonkman 2010 the gravitational acceleration g 9 80665 m s2 and the density of water ρ 1025 kg m3 are used the mooring system of the oc3 hywind platform has three cables with associated parameters listed in table 2 note that the crow foot of the mooring system is neglected in mooring modeling while additional stiffness to the platform yaw motion is added to the restoring stiffness matrix jonkman 2010 jonkman and matha 2011 a linear stress stain relationship is considered as f ε e a ε where e a is the cable axial stiffness the cable bending and torsional stiffnesses are set to zeros the hydrodynamic coefficients are adopted following azcona et al 2017b 4 2 verification of openmoor in using openmoor the cable is discretized using 50 nodes gobat and grosenbaugh 2006 and correspondingly 50 segments are used in applying moordyn hall and goupee 2015 the spar is subjected to irregular waves described using the pierson moskowitz spectrum with significant height 9 8 m and peak period of 14 3 s azcona et al 2017b corresponding to the 1 year significant wave condition of a location in the coast of ireland in the first case the waves are in x direction since the system is symmetric with respect to x axis and hence the platform displacement in y direction the roll and yaw rotations are quite small fig 5 shows the surge and heave displacements the pitch rotation of the spar and the fairlead tension of cable 1 which is subjected to the largest fairlead tension variation among the three cables the responses computed using both programs are consistent in the second case waves in y direction are considered the mooring system behaves differently as compared to case 1 because the system is not symmetric with respect to y axis which leads to coupled surge and sway motions the spar motion and the fairlead tension of cable 2 are illustrated in fig 6 as can be seen the surge motion of the spar induces low frequency motion in x direction and a static drift in x direction is also observable yaw rotation is also observed due to the coupling effect albeit of pretty small amplitude again the results obtained using both programs are quite consistent small difference is seen in the spar surge motion while the overall displacement is small 5 application to study the impact of nonlinear mooring dynamics on fowt responses in the presence of current in this section the mooring model is used to study the impact of the mooring dynamics on the spar fowt responses in the presence of current both static and dynamic responses are studied and the fowt responses are computed using four different mooring models for comparison i e the linear spring model quasi static model openmoor without considering current effect on cables labeled as openmoor in the following graphics and openmoor including the current effect on cables since at the beginning of the analysis the static position of the spar is unknown the linear cable stiffness is computed based on the initial configuration of the cables using the method in kreuzer and wilke 2003 the quasi static mooring load is computed based on the classic catenary solution irvine 1981 5 1 static responses in the static analysis the 6dof model of the spar fowt the same as in the verification case is used a uniform current of 1 0 m s is considered in x and y directions respectively the static responses are computed using the dynamic relaxation method the actual mass and damping matrices are used in the relaxation procedure when the current is in x direction the spar undergoes a significant static offset in the same direction fig 7 shows the spar surge motion and the fairlead tension of cable 1 considerable differences are seen from the responses obtained using different mooring models the linear mooring model provides conservative estimates in this case using the dynamic mooring model with current effect on cables considered the surge offset of the spar is 9 48 m as compared to 8 77 m when this effect is ignored the quasi static result is in between these two results from fig 7 it is seen that the current induces a clear decrement of the fairlead tension of cable 1 in this case as shown in fig 8 the current in y direction induces not only a static offset of the spar in y direction but also observable movements in x and z directions due to the coupling effect again considerable differences can be found in the results using varied mooring models the modeling of the current effect on cables is shown to be important to model the coupling of the spar motion in different directions 5 2 dynamics responses for the dynamic analysis the spar fowt model described in section 3 is used the blade rotation speed is considered to be at the rated rotor speed for the baseline wind turbine i e 12 1 rpm the mean wind speed at the top of the tower is considered to be at the rated wind speed of 12 m s with a turbulence of 15 the wave loading is the same as in the verification case and a uniform current of 1 0 m s is additionally considered in the same direction of the waves in all the simulated cases the blade responses computed using different mooring models are almost identical and hence are not plotted in the following fig 9 shows the spar motion and cable fairlead tensions when the wave and current are in x direction in this case the tower side to side displacement is also small and not shown quite significant differences can be seen from the spar surge displacement and the cable fairlead tensions using varied mooring models the current effect on cables increases the mean value of the surge displacement while the dynamic variation is broadly the same as the result when this effect is not considered notwithstanding the current not only affects the mean values of the fairlead tensions but can also increase the amplitude of the dynamic variations fig 10 shows the tower and spar responses and the cable fairlead tensions when the wave and current are in the y direction the tower responses show slight difference when the dynamics of the mooring cables is modeled however whether the current effect on cables is included when using the dynamic model has very small effect on the tower responses for the spar motion the current load on cables has a clear effect on the mean value of the displacement while seems not to influence the dynamic responses much again the current clearly increases the dynamic fairlead tensions of the cables in all the dynamic analyses the current load on cables has very small effect on the spar heave motion because of the relatively large restoring stiffness due to buoyancy effect in this direction generally speaking the current load on mooring cables increases the dynamic responses of the mooring cables nevertheless its effect on the overall restoring stiffness of the mooring system depends on the current direction and the horizontal layout of the mooring cables as well the current effect on cables should be taken into account in dynamic analysis of fowts if the spar and cable responses are concerned this effect on the blade and tower responses is pretty small which in turn validate the use of a simplified blade and tower model in the present study 6 concluding remarks this study has developed a coupled mooring system model based on a finite different model of mooring cables the model able to consider cable seabed interaction bending stiffness and current effect is implemented with parallel computation for efficiently handling mooring systems with multiple cables the model is then coupled with a simplified spar fowt model and it is verified with an open source mooring analysis program when no current is considered good agreements are found in the results using the two programs for coupled analysis the developed model has been further applied to study the mooring dynamics on the fowt responses in the presence of current both static responses and dynamic responses have been investigated based on the nrel offshore 5 mw baseline wind turbine supported by the oc3 hywind spar buoy by comparing the spar fowt responses using varied mooring models it is found that for most cases the current effect on the cable can be ignored when the blade and tower responses are concerned the current effect can induce larger fairlead tension variations of mooring cables however the overall effect on the restoring effect of the mooring system on the platform depends on the current direction and also the layout of the cables when the spar motion and in particular the mooring cables are of concern the current effect on the cable needs to be properly included further study is directed to validating the present model using experimental data the model will also be coupled with more detailed model to study the current effects and the wave current interaction on the offshore floating structures acknowledgments

23291,the present paper provides a method to estimate the clearance between two flexible risers in tandem arrangement by taking into account the hydrodynamic wake interference when subjected to a current flow and a combined current plus waves flow modelling of the wake interference in the near wake field is based on the modification of the mean wake velocity deficit in the far wake field two modified wake models are introduced in the presented paper the wake effects in steady current and in current plus waves are investigated by using both wake models for the current only flow the deflection shapes of a pair of tandem risers in steep wave configuration are presented highlighting the importance of the wake effect on clearance estimation for combined current plus waves the wake interference is investigated by considering the position dependent drag force with different combinations of riser natural frequency and wave frequency the collision failure probability is predicted when the risers are subjected to current plus random waves keywords wake interference riser collision probability current plus waves wake models drag force 1 introduction the collision between adjacent risers in an array has become an important issue as the oil and gas industry moves to deep water since the risk of collision increases with increasing water depth potential collision can be caused by the wake interference which takes place when the downstream riser is placed within the wake field generated by the upstream one the wake interference will change the flow around the downstream riser i e reducing the local flow velocity this change will therefore reduce the drag force acting on the downstream riser and induce an additional lift force if the risers are in staggered arrangement this effect in turn reduces the clearance between the risers leading to a potential clashing one possible model for calculating the velocity deficit behind a single cylinder is given by schlichting and gersten 2003 this model expresses the velocity deficit as a function of the relative distance between the downstream and upstream cylinders and gives good agreements with the experimental data in the far wake field huse et al 1998 2000 modified the model by introducing a concept of virtual source distance so that the wake model can be applied in the near wake field the authors also proposed a calculation procedure for predicting the drag reduction on individual cylinders in an array blevins 2005 developed a wake model by correlating experimental data with the schlichting s wake model which allows that both lift and drag forces can be determined in closed form in terms of the drag coefficient of a single cylinder the relative distance between the two cylinders and their diameters wake interference might also cause instability problem for high value of the reduced velocity i e wake induced oscillation wio it refers to the state that when the downstream cylinder is placed in the wake of the upstream one any small disturbance to the system might force the downstream cylinder into an unstable state i e a small disturbance can either be amplified until a new equilibrium state is achieved or the system breaks and collision between the risers occurs wu 2003 the mechanism of wio is not yet fully understood and research is ongoing hover and triantafyllou 2001 huera huarte and bearman 2011 huera huarte and gharib 2011 huang et al 2011 huang and herfjord 2013 it is observed from the experiments that wio is a low frequency motion with large amplitude arising at the first natural period of the riser which is substantially lower than the vortex shedding frequency the oscillation amplitude is larger than 4d even when the reduced velocity exceeds the typical lock in range huera huarte and bearman 2011 investigated two flexible circular cylinders in the near wake with reynolds number r e v d ν up 12000 where v is the flow velocity d is the cylinder diameter and ν is the kinematic viscosity and found the different response regimes based on the type of oscillations exhibited by the cylinders viv vortex induced vibration wio or combinations of both moreover wu 2003 investigated the mechanism of wio of a pair of tandem riser arrangements numerically the author applied a full routh hurwitz stability algorithm together with a direct numerical eigenvalue search technique for understanding the mechanism of wio and prediction of potential collision another reason for riser collision is the oscillating wave loads which can excite individual risers moving dynamically around the static equilibrium positions on one hand the differences in excitation force on neighbouring risers will cause large relative distance leading to possible collision especially when subjected to a severe sea state on the other hand the wake interference caused by oscillating waves is also a reason for the collision however relatively few experimental studies have been carried out regarding riser collision caused by oscillating wave loads bushnell et al 1977 carried out laboratory tests to determine the flow interference effects between arrays of cylinders subjected to harmonic oscillating flow duggal and niedzwecki 1993 studied the complex interaction between regular and random waves for a single flexible cylinder they performed an experimental study of tandem riser pairs subjected to random waves in order to understand the dynamic response due to wake interference in order to avoid collision clearance assessment is required generally there are two different design strategies for riser collision assessment according to dnv rp f203 2009 one is called no collision allowed which means that riser collision is not allowed under normal extreme or survival conditions the problem is then reduced to determine the probability of the relative distance between risers over a given threshold value another one is collision allowed indicating that infrequent collision may be allowed in some extreme conditions hence assessment of structural interaction is further required for the present study the former design strategy will be considered the objective of this paper is to develop a simplified method to estimate the clearance between risers when subjected to currents and combined current plus waves by which the wake effect is taking into account particular attention is given to a pair of flexible risers in a wave configuration the risers are arranged in tandem so that the lift force on the downstream riser can be neglected two modified wake models i e the blevins model and the huse model are presented and applied in the analysis due to the non linearity of the collision problem time domain simulation is necessary the investigation of the wake effect in waves is carried out by a 2d cylinder system which is achieved by updating the drag coefficient at each time step based on the instantaneous relative distance the results are compared with that for the constant drag coefficient in addition collision probability between two cylinders subjected to current plus random waves is estimated 2 wake model 2 1 mean deficit velocity according to schlichting and gersten 2003 the local flow velocity behind a single cylinder can be expressed as the difference between the undistributed flow velocity given as 1 v x y v 0 v d x y v 0 1 v ˆ d x y where v x y is the local flow velocity in the wake field v 0 is the free stream current velocity v d x y is the mean deficit velocity and v ˆ d x y v d x y v 0 is the non dimensional mean deficit velocity which can be expressed as 2 v ˆ d x y 0 95 c d 0 d x exp y 2 0 08888 c d 0 d x where c d 0 is the reference drag coefficient and d is the diameter of the cylinder the origin of the local coordinate system is located at the center of the cylinder with the x axis pointing the incoming flow direction and the y axis in the transverse direction as shown in fig 1 schlichting s formula agree well with experimental data in the far wake field i e x d 50 schlichting and gersten 2003 however in the near wake field it gives too large velocity deficits and a too narrow wake leading to an error when calculating the drag force on the downstream cylinder by using the morison equation fredheim 2005 therefore two modified models for calculation of the drag force in the near wake field are introduced 2 2 huse model huse et al 2000 introduced a concept of virtual source distance i e x v 4 d c d which means that the origin is moved to the front of the cylinder so that the wake width at the cylinder center is exactly equal to the cylinder diameter see fig 2 hence the local flow velocity v ˆ d x y can be determined by using the modified distance x s x x v instead of x in eq 2 a problem is that the deficit velocity v d x y varies over the domain occupied by the downstream cylinder to solve this problem huse suggested that the root mean square rms value averaged over the cylinder diameter i e v d r m s x y can be used for calculating the drag force which in non dimensional form in terms of v 0 is given by 3 v ˆ d r m s x y v d r m s x y v 0 1 d 2 y d 2 2 y d 2 2 v ˆ d 2 x y d y 1 2 where d 2 is the diameter of the downstream cylinder the drag force acting on the downstream cylinder can be calculated by the morison equation as 4 f d 1 2 ρ d 2 v 0 2 1 v ˆ d r m s 2 c d 0 where ρ is the water density the huse model can easily be applied to a riser array by summing up the wake contributions from all upstream cylinders 2 3 blevins model the schlichting deficit velocity at the cylinder center is directly used in the blevins model with the assumption that the drag force on the downstream cylinder in the wake is proportional to the local dynamic pressure evaluated at its center the variation of the local velocity can be translated to the variation of the drag coefficient by the expression 5 f d 1 2 ρ d 2 v 2 x y c d 0 1 2 ρ d 2 v 0 2 1 v ˆ d 2 c d 0 1 2 ρ d 2 v 0 2 c d x y where 6 c d x y c d 0 1 v ˆ d 2 by inserting eq 2 into eq 6 it becomes 7 c d x y c d 0 1 k 1 c d 0 d 1 x exp k 2 y 2 c d 0 d 1 x 2 1 2 where k 1 1 and k 2 4 5 are determined by fitting to the price and paidoussis 1984 experimental data at x d 3 5 9 and 20 3 by using the least squares method according to blevins 2005 however more data is required in order to validate this model blevins model also comprises the inward lift force on the downstream cylinder towards the wake center line which is proportional to transverse gradient of drag according to c b rawlins postulate in the present study however the downstream riser is placed at the wake center line so that the lift force caused by the asymmetry flow can be neglected more details about the lift force induced by the wake effect are given in blevins 2005 2 4 comparison and modification in figs 3 6 the calculated drag coefficients obtained from the original schlichting model and the modified huse and blevins models are presented with different combinations of x d and y d the reference drag coefficient c d 0 1 15 is used for all the calculated results in the same figure the measurements by price and paidoussis 1984 and by herfjord et al 2002 for r e 5 3 10 4 are presented from figs 3 and 4 it appears that compared with the original schlichting model the huse model gives a wider wake and a smaller deficit velocity resulting in a larger c d in the tandem arrangement and a smaller c d when the downstream cylinder is outside the wake center line the blevins model gives a wider wake but a smaller c d due to the experimental data used for fitting fig 5 shows the calculated c d for the three models versus horizontal distance x for y 0 from the top figure it appears that the models have the same asymptotic behaviour in the far wake field i e x 50 it also found that in the near wake field there are large differences between the huse model and the other two models the reason is that the origin in the huse model see fig 2 is not the same as in the other two models see fig 1 the latter become singular at x 0 actually the blevins model is valid for a relative distance between the centres of cylinders greater than 2 3 times the diameter of the upstream cylinder at distances less than this value the interference becomes more complex with negative suck force involved to avoid this it is assumed that the drag coefficient is constant if x 2 d and equal to the value of c d at x 2 d the modified model is shown in the bottom of fig 5 in the same figure the measurements by price and paidoussis 1984 for r e 5 3 10 4 by zdravkovich 1977 for r e 1 2 10 5 and by herfjord et al 2002 for r e 5 3 10 4 are presented fig 6 presents the results for the different models as a function of x d for y d 0 25 and y d 0 5 showing the properties of the modified models in the near wake it appears that at y d 0 25 the huse model always gives a larger c d compared with the blevins model for y d 0 5 the difference between the two modified models becomes smaller and c d becomes larger as a result of the wider wake for the upstream cylinder bokaian et al 1985 has shown that the fluid interaction has no influence on the upstream cylinder if the relative distance is more than about 2 3 diameters thus the drag force on the upstream cylinder is here calculated by the undisturbed morison equation 3 wake interference in current the wake effect in steady current is investigated by combining the finite element software riflex 1987 along with the modified wake models riflex is specially designed to handle static and dynamic analyses of flexible risers and other slender structures the static analysis methods comprise catenary analyses available for a limited range of systems the dynamic analysis comprises linear and nonlinear time domain analysis as mentioned previously the drag force on the downstream riser depends on the wake models which are functions of the relative distance between downstream and upstream risers consequently the forces vary along the risers due to the current profile and the riser boundary condition in order to consider the wake interference in static analysis an iteration procedure is necessary for determining the static equilibrium position particular attention is given to a pair of flexible risers with steep wave configuration in tandem arrangement a steep wave riser has the addition of buoyancy modules along a part of the riser length in order to form a wave shape so that some of the axial tensile forces acting on the riser can be relieved as shown in fig 7 the total length of the riser is l 160 m with diameter d 0 25 m the length of the buoyancy module is l b 50 m with diameter d b 0 63 m and along the riser at water depth h 60 90 m the main riser properties are summarized in table 1 both blevins model and huse model are used in the static analysis the iteration procedure is proposed in fu et al 2017 in the present study this method is refined by calculating the local drag force for each finite element instead of each segment this is achieved by dividing the two risers into 320 elements and calculating the relative distance for each pair of elements the main steps used to determine the static equilibrium position are as follows 1 calculate the local drag coefficient c d 1 according to the blevins model and the huse model based on the initial position i e l 0 2 perform a static analysis using riflex and compute the relative distance between each pair of elements x r i 3 update the local drag coefficient i e c d i 1 based on the calculated distance x r i 4 repeat steps 2 3 until convergence is achieved the static equilibrium deflection shapes of the risers subjected to current loads are illustrated in figs 8 and 9 by using the different wake models with different combinations of the current velocity v 0 and the initial center to center distance l 0 the finial deflection shapes of the two risers without wake effects are also shown in the same figures the notation ur and dr in the figures refer to the upstream riser and downstream riser respectively fig 8 presents the finial static deflection shape for initial distance l 0 8 m and current velocity v 0 1 m s from the figure it appears that the wake effect has a notable influence on the downstream riser both of the modified models give a reduced relative distance compared with that for the model with no wake effect the minimum distance is identified in the joint region where the buoyancy modules and the bare riser segments are located this is because the influence of the wake effect is significant in this region where the diameter and flexibility is increased it is also observed that the blevins model leads to a small gap at a submerged depth around h 60 m where the relative distance x r 1 8 d actually in such close region collision might happen due to the suck force in practice depending on the reynolds number and the roughness ratio zdravkovich 1977 in order to increase the final relative distance and avoid collision some modifications can be carried out as shown in fig 9 it is illustrated in fig 9a that the static equilibrium deflection shapes of risers when l 0 is increased from 8 m to 10 m this change ensures that there is sufficient clearance between the upstream and downstream risers in fig 9b the current velocity is decreased from 1 0 m s to 0 8 m s which leads to a reduced drag force on the risers as a consequence the risk of riser collision can be reduced significantly 4 wake interference in current plus waves 4 1 numerical model dynamic wave loads will excite the individual risers such that they oscillate around their static equilibrium positions if the excitation corresponding to the fluid loads is so strong that the risers start to move with large amplitudes the risers may collide with each other the wave induced excitation forces froude kriloff and diffraction forces can be computed by a long wavelength approximation which involves added mass and potential damping of the actual cross section together with the wave kinematics the viscous loads are computed using the drag term in a modified morisons equation taking into account the relative motion between risers and fluid flow additionally wake effects generated by the upstream cylinder are accounted for in order to investigate the effect of the wake interference in waves the hydrodynamic forces are calculated based on two dimensional strip theory in the present study a simple 2d cylinder system with one degree of freedom is used as shown in fig 10 since the wake effects only influence the hydrodynamic behaviour of the downstream cylinder and the configuration of the upstream cylinder does not change the property the upstream cylinder is taken to be fixed in order to simplify the problem the downstream cylinder is placed in the wake center line and is free to oscillate in the x direction as illustrated in fig 10 the equation of motion for the downstream cylinder in terms of the coordinate system x y can be written as 8 m m a x c x k x 20 x f d f i where the origin of the coordinate system x y is placed at the center of the static position of the downstream cylinder as shown in fig 10 m is the cylinder mass per unit length m a is the added mass per unit length c is the structural damping f i c m ρ d x is the inertia force per unit length c m is the inertia coefficient and a typical value of 2 is used the drag force per unit length acting on the downstream cylinder is given by using the morisons equation taking into account the relative motion between the flow and the cylinder 9 f d 1 2 ρ d v r v r c d where v r is the relative velocity between the flow and the cylinder and c d is the drag coefficient these parameters are defined as following according to different wake models 1 v r and c d in the huse model since the huse model gives the local velocity as shown in eq 3 it is assumed that the drag coefficient of the downstream cylinder is the same as the upstream one which is constant i e c d c d this implies that the variation in the downstream cylinder s drag force will be governed by the local wake velocity considering the motion of the cylinders v r is defined as the relative velocity between the reduced flow and the moving cylinder i e v r v 0 v w 1 v ˆ d r m s x where v w is the wave particle velocity it is convenient to transfer the variation from the local wake velocity into a modified drag coefficient by introducing the following equality c d 0 v r 2 c d x v 0 v w x 2 2 v r and c d in the blevins model according to the blevins model the variation in the downstream cylinder s drag force is governed by the local drag coefficient as given in eq 7 the flow velocity is taken as the undisturbed velocity hence the relative velocity v r is defined as the relative velocity between the undisturbed flow and the moving cylinder i e v r v 0 v w x the calculation of the drag force mentioned above is based on the assumption that the modified wake models which have been established for steady flow can be applied to a current dominated flow for each time step a current dominated flow is required in order to make sure that wake shielding effects from the upstream cylinder always act on the downstream cylinder when subjected to a combined current plus waves based on the above definition the drag forces are updated at each time step based on the instantaneous relative distance x the equation of motion becomes a high non linear equation due to the position dependent c d x and v r x and can be solved numerically by using the numerical time integration a simplified method as a first approximation is to use a constant c d based on the relative distance between cylinders obtained from static equilibrium position it implies that the wake effect generated by the relative motion due to wave loads is neglected in the following calculation both the updated c d and constant c d will be applied and compared 4 2 current plus regular waves the effect of the wake interference due to current plus regular waves is investigated in this section the cylinders are placed at a submerged depth of z 60 m which is chosen because it represents a region where the relative distance was minimum according to the previous static analysis in section 2 both the cylinders have the same diameter d 0 25 m the surface wave elevation is ζ ζ 0 sin ω w t k x where ζ 0 is the wave amplitude ω w 2 π t is the wave frequency and t is the wave period linear wave theory is used to calculate the wave particle velocity at a given water depth i e v w ω ζ 0 e k z c o s ω w t k x where the wave number is k 2 π λ and λ is the wave length determined from the deep water dispersion relationship i e λ 2 π g ω w the natural frequency of the cylinder is ω n 2 π t n k x m m a where t n is the natural period of the cylinder in order to apply the most critical environmental loads the current and the waves are both in the x direction in figs 11 14 the calculated dynamic responses obtained by using both of the modified models are presented with the frequency ratio which is defined as β ωw ωn varying from 0 6 to 1 4 the red dashed line in all figures indicates the static result when the risers are subjected to current only table 2 shows the prescribed cylinder and environmental conditions that are applied in the present study fig 11 shows the results obtained by application of the blevins model for different values of the frequency ratio β both the results calculated from constant c d and updated c d are shown in the same figure denoted as c d c o n s t a n t and c d u p d a t e d respectively the initial distance is set to be l 0 8 d fig 11a illustrates the c d x range based on the calculations and fig 11b shows the associated displacement range in terms of the non dimensional displacement x d for both c d c o n s t a n t and c d u p d a t e d from fig 11 it appears that for static results the cylinder moves to its static equilibrium position x r 12 8 d with the corresponding c d x r 0 56 when subjected to the current loads subsequently it oscillates around this position when the wave loads are applied the amplitude of the motion is reduced as β increases apparently this is because a small β corresponds to a long wave which induces a large particle motion amplitude by comparing the amplitude of the motion calculated based on c d c o n s t a n t and c d u p d a t e d it is found that the cylinder motion range is enlarged by using c d u p d a t e d for β 0 6 and 0 8 this is because the drag force will increase due to the increase of the updated drag coefficient when the cylinder moves away from the upstream cylinder conversely the drag coefficient will decrease when the cylinder moves towards to the upstream cylinder however as β increases the importance of the drag force is reduced relative to the inertia force so that the variation of the drag force has an insignificant effect on the excitation force accordingly also on the response of the cylinder fig 12 presents the results obtained by using the huse model the results associated with both the constant and updated drag coefficients are presented as well the ranges of x d for different β are shown in fig 12b the static equilibrium position is x r 13 8 d with the corresponding c d x r 0 67 as seen in fig 12a which are slightly larger than the results obtained by the blevins model for each β the huse model leads to a relative smaller motion amplitude and a larger relative distance between the two cylinders as compared with that for the blevins model consequently the collision probability decreases by comparing the results calculated based on c d c o n s t a n t and c d u p d a t e d it is found that for the longer waves corresponding to β 0 6 and 0 8 the maximum distance between the two cylinders is enlarged when using c d u p d a t e d while the minimum distance is almost the same this implies that updating of the drag coefficient for the huse model doesn t influence the dynamic response of the cylinder significantly similarly the drag force becomes relatively less important as β increases and accordingly the variation of the drag force has a limited effect on the excitation force as well as on the response of the cylinder figs 13 and 14 show the results obtained by application of the two modified models for an initial distance l 0 5 d for such a close initial distance the cylinders are more likely to collide when subjected to current plus waves according to the previous definition collision events occur when the relative distance is x r 2 d and the drag coefficient of the downstream cylinder is here then locked at c d x c d 2 d as shown in fig 13 collisions occur both by applying c d c o n s t a n t and c d u p d a t e d for β 0 6 0 8 and 1 0 due to the low drag force when the cylinder moves towards to the upstream direction as β increases c d u p d a t e d leads to a relatively small change in the motion amplitude since the hydrodynamic force is governed by the inertial force similarly fig 14 shows the dynamic responses obtained by application of the huse model no collision is detected for the present condition and the minimum distance between the two risers is not significantly affected by updating versus keeping the drag coefficient constant 4 3 current plus irregular waves the wake effects on the downstream cylinder subjected to a combination of irregular waves and collinear current is studied in this section the jonswap spectrum with a γ factor of 3 3 is used to characterize a sea state with significant wave height h s 10 25 m and peak period t p 15 s the current velocity is v 0 1 m s the duration of the simulation is 1 h for all the calculations fig 15 show sequences of the time history of x d for the downstream cylinder by application of the modified models for the initial distance l 0 8 d the green line indicates the collision criterion i e x 2 d the displacement histories of the cylinder from time t 2200 s to t 2500 s which are obtained by using the blevins model based on both c d c o n s t a n t and c d u p d a t e d are plotted in fig 15a it appears that at t 2355 s the minimum distance is x d 2 2 for c d c o n s t a n t and x d 1 7 for c d u p d a t e d a collision event is hence detected in the latter case similar results are plotted in fig 15b by application of the huse model and no collision is detected by application of both sets of drag coefficients based on the comparison of these results it is found that the blevins model will imply a relatively higher risk of collision than the huse model 5 collision probability the collision probability associated with random waves is further considered the probability of the riser collision actually is an extreme minimum value problem it is convenient to transform the extreme minimum value problem to the extreme maximum value problem in non dimensional form by writing the process as 10 x t x d in this way x t 0 and the cylinders physically collide when x t 1 in the present study however it is defined that the collision occurs when x t 2 based on the previous discussion due to the statistical uncertainties which are inherent in the random response process repeated simulations are required in order to obtain a reliable estimation of the extreme response the classical extreme value theory assume that the distribution of a sequence of independent and identically distributed random variables will normally converge towards one of three possible asymptotic extreme value distributions as n naess and moan 2012 in the present study the gumbel distribution function will be adopted due to the behaviour of the upper tail of the distribution of maxima the gumbel probability paper method is a simple and efficient method to determine the distribution parameters the cumulative distribution function is given by 11 f x e x exp exp α x u where α and μ are the scale and location parameters respectively by taking the logarithm of both left and right hand side of this equation twice the following equation is obtained 12 ln ln f x e x α x u further by introducing y ln ln f x e x a linear function y α x u is obtained which implies that in a x y axis system the cumulative distribution becomes a straight line the parameters α and μ can be estimated by the least square fitting of the samples to the straight line the fitted straight line and the extreme samples identified from the 25 1 h simulations with different random seeds for generating time series of waves are plotted in figs 16 and 17 with the blevins model and huse model respectively the results obtained by application of the constant and updated c d x for each model are compared in the same figure the failure criterion i e x 2 is illustrated as the dotted vertical line the estimated gumbel parameters and the failure probability p f 1 f x obtained by the two models are summarized in table 3 generally the results show that the blevins model increases the probability of failure by about two orders of magnitude thus emphasizing the importance of accounting for the uncertainties related to the wake model in the context of a riser collision reliability assessment it is also found that updating of c d has a noticeable effect on the probability of failure for the present case with β 1 for the blevins model this implies that the uncertainties of the value of c d must be estimated before a proper collision reliability assessment can be performed on the contrary the results obtained by using the huse model imply that the uncertainties of the value of c d is less important 6 conclusions consideration of the wake interference in the near field is essential for prediction of the likelihold of riser collision in fu et al 2017 a method for this purpose was proposed however in that study only the wake interaction based on the static blevins model was considered in the present work an additional modified wake model in the near field i e the huse model is presented together with the blevins model and the results obtained from both models are compared the wake effect on the static deflection of a pair of flexible risers is studied by using the computer code riflex for both the modified models the results identify the region where the risers are most likely to collide and some modifications are proposed in order to avoid collision waves can also cause riser collision if the wave induced loading is sufficiently large to cause the risers to interact therefore wake interference in waves is investigated based on the assumption that the modified wake models which were established for steady flow conditions can also be applied for current dominated flow for each time step by comparing this dynamic wake model with the static wake model it is found that the importance of updating c d according to the instantanous relative distance at each time step depends on the frequency ratio β for a no collision allowed approach to design of marine risers the collision failure event is regarded as an extreme value problem by using a gumbel probability paper it is shown that the uncertainties associated with the wake model has a significant effect on the failure probability estimation as a general observation it is found that these model uncertainties must be properly reflected in order to perform an adequate reliability assessment 
23291,the present paper provides a method to estimate the clearance between two flexible risers in tandem arrangement by taking into account the hydrodynamic wake interference when subjected to a current flow and a combined current plus waves flow modelling of the wake interference in the near wake field is based on the modification of the mean wake velocity deficit in the far wake field two modified wake models are introduced in the presented paper the wake effects in steady current and in current plus waves are investigated by using both wake models for the current only flow the deflection shapes of a pair of tandem risers in steep wave configuration are presented highlighting the importance of the wake effect on clearance estimation for combined current plus waves the wake interference is investigated by considering the position dependent drag force with different combinations of riser natural frequency and wave frequency the collision failure probability is predicted when the risers are subjected to current plus random waves keywords wake interference riser collision probability current plus waves wake models drag force 1 introduction the collision between adjacent risers in an array has become an important issue as the oil and gas industry moves to deep water since the risk of collision increases with increasing water depth potential collision can be caused by the wake interference which takes place when the downstream riser is placed within the wake field generated by the upstream one the wake interference will change the flow around the downstream riser i e reducing the local flow velocity this change will therefore reduce the drag force acting on the downstream riser and induce an additional lift force if the risers are in staggered arrangement this effect in turn reduces the clearance between the risers leading to a potential clashing one possible model for calculating the velocity deficit behind a single cylinder is given by schlichting and gersten 2003 this model expresses the velocity deficit as a function of the relative distance between the downstream and upstream cylinders and gives good agreements with the experimental data in the far wake field huse et al 1998 2000 modified the model by introducing a concept of virtual source distance so that the wake model can be applied in the near wake field the authors also proposed a calculation procedure for predicting the drag reduction on individual cylinders in an array blevins 2005 developed a wake model by correlating experimental data with the schlichting s wake model which allows that both lift and drag forces can be determined in closed form in terms of the drag coefficient of a single cylinder the relative distance between the two cylinders and their diameters wake interference might also cause instability problem for high value of the reduced velocity i e wake induced oscillation wio it refers to the state that when the downstream cylinder is placed in the wake of the upstream one any small disturbance to the system might force the downstream cylinder into an unstable state i e a small disturbance can either be amplified until a new equilibrium state is achieved or the system breaks and collision between the risers occurs wu 2003 the mechanism of wio is not yet fully understood and research is ongoing hover and triantafyllou 2001 huera huarte and bearman 2011 huera huarte and gharib 2011 huang et al 2011 huang and herfjord 2013 it is observed from the experiments that wio is a low frequency motion with large amplitude arising at the first natural period of the riser which is substantially lower than the vortex shedding frequency the oscillation amplitude is larger than 4d even when the reduced velocity exceeds the typical lock in range huera huarte and bearman 2011 investigated two flexible circular cylinders in the near wake with reynolds number r e v d ν up 12000 where v is the flow velocity d is the cylinder diameter and ν is the kinematic viscosity and found the different response regimes based on the type of oscillations exhibited by the cylinders viv vortex induced vibration wio or combinations of both moreover wu 2003 investigated the mechanism of wio of a pair of tandem riser arrangements numerically the author applied a full routh hurwitz stability algorithm together with a direct numerical eigenvalue search technique for understanding the mechanism of wio and prediction of potential collision another reason for riser collision is the oscillating wave loads which can excite individual risers moving dynamically around the static equilibrium positions on one hand the differences in excitation force on neighbouring risers will cause large relative distance leading to possible collision especially when subjected to a severe sea state on the other hand the wake interference caused by oscillating waves is also a reason for the collision however relatively few experimental studies have been carried out regarding riser collision caused by oscillating wave loads bushnell et al 1977 carried out laboratory tests to determine the flow interference effects between arrays of cylinders subjected to harmonic oscillating flow duggal and niedzwecki 1993 studied the complex interaction between regular and random waves for a single flexible cylinder they performed an experimental study of tandem riser pairs subjected to random waves in order to understand the dynamic response due to wake interference in order to avoid collision clearance assessment is required generally there are two different design strategies for riser collision assessment according to dnv rp f203 2009 one is called no collision allowed which means that riser collision is not allowed under normal extreme or survival conditions the problem is then reduced to determine the probability of the relative distance between risers over a given threshold value another one is collision allowed indicating that infrequent collision may be allowed in some extreme conditions hence assessment of structural interaction is further required for the present study the former design strategy will be considered the objective of this paper is to develop a simplified method to estimate the clearance between risers when subjected to currents and combined current plus waves by which the wake effect is taking into account particular attention is given to a pair of flexible risers in a wave configuration the risers are arranged in tandem so that the lift force on the downstream riser can be neglected two modified wake models i e the blevins model and the huse model are presented and applied in the analysis due to the non linearity of the collision problem time domain simulation is necessary the investigation of the wake effect in waves is carried out by a 2d cylinder system which is achieved by updating the drag coefficient at each time step based on the instantaneous relative distance the results are compared with that for the constant drag coefficient in addition collision probability between two cylinders subjected to current plus random waves is estimated 2 wake model 2 1 mean deficit velocity according to schlichting and gersten 2003 the local flow velocity behind a single cylinder can be expressed as the difference between the undistributed flow velocity given as 1 v x y v 0 v d x y v 0 1 v ˆ d x y where v x y is the local flow velocity in the wake field v 0 is the free stream current velocity v d x y is the mean deficit velocity and v ˆ d x y v d x y v 0 is the non dimensional mean deficit velocity which can be expressed as 2 v ˆ d x y 0 95 c d 0 d x exp y 2 0 08888 c d 0 d x where c d 0 is the reference drag coefficient and d is the diameter of the cylinder the origin of the local coordinate system is located at the center of the cylinder with the x axis pointing the incoming flow direction and the y axis in the transverse direction as shown in fig 1 schlichting s formula agree well with experimental data in the far wake field i e x d 50 schlichting and gersten 2003 however in the near wake field it gives too large velocity deficits and a too narrow wake leading to an error when calculating the drag force on the downstream cylinder by using the morison equation fredheim 2005 therefore two modified models for calculation of the drag force in the near wake field are introduced 2 2 huse model huse et al 2000 introduced a concept of virtual source distance i e x v 4 d c d which means that the origin is moved to the front of the cylinder so that the wake width at the cylinder center is exactly equal to the cylinder diameter see fig 2 hence the local flow velocity v ˆ d x y can be determined by using the modified distance x s x x v instead of x in eq 2 a problem is that the deficit velocity v d x y varies over the domain occupied by the downstream cylinder to solve this problem huse suggested that the root mean square rms value averaged over the cylinder diameter i e v d r m s x y can be used for calculating the drag force which in non dimensional form in terms of v 0 is given by 3 v ˆ d r m s x y v d r m s x y v 0 1 d 2 y d 2 2 y d 2 2 v ˆ d 2 x y d y 1 2 where d 2 is the diameter of the downstream cylinder the drag force acting on the downstream cylinder can be calculated by the morison equation as 4 f d 1 2 ρ d 2 v 0 2 1 v ˆ d r m s 2 c d 0 where ρ is the water density the huse model can easily be applied to a riser array by summing up the wake contributions from all upstream cylinders 2 3 blevins model the schlichting deficit velocity at the cylinder center is directly used in the blevins model with the assumption that the drag force on the downstream cylinder in the wake is proportional to the local dynamic pressure evaluated at its center the variation of the local velocity can be translated to the variation of the drag coefficient by the expression 5 f d 1 2 ρ d 2 v 2 x y c d 0 1 2 ρ d 2 v 0 2 1 v ˆ d 2 c d 0 1 2 ρ d 2 v 0 2 c d x y where 6 c d x y c d 0 1 v ˆ d 2 by inserting eq 2 into eq 6 it becomes 7 c d x y c d 0 1 k 1 c d 0 d 1 x exp k 2 y 2 c d 0 d 1 x 2 1 2 where k 1 1 and k 2 4 5 are determined by fitting to the price and paidoussis 1984 experimental data at x d 3 5 9 and 20 3 by using the least squares method according to blevins 2005 however more data is required in order to validate this model blevins model also comprises the inward lift force on the downstream cylinder towards the wake center line which is proportional to transverse gradient of drag according to c b rawlins postulate in the present study however the downstream riser is placed at the wake center line so that the lift force caused by the asymmetry flow can be neglected more details about the lift force induced by the wake effect are given in blevins 2005 2 4 comparison and modification in figs 3 6 the calculated drag coefficients obtained from the original schlichting model and the modified huse and blevins models are presented with different combinations of x d and y d the reference drag coefficient c d 0 1 15 is used for all the calculated results in the same figure the measurements by price and paidoussis 1984 and by herfjord et al 2002 for r e 5 3 10 4 are presented from figs 3 and 4 it appears that compared with the original schlichting model the huse model gives a wider wake and a smaller deficit velocity resulting in a larger c d in the tandem arrangement and a smaller c d when the downstream cylinder is outside the wake center line the blevins model gives a wider wake but a smaller c d due to the experimental data used for fitting fig 5 shows the calculated c d for the three models versus horizontal distance x for y 0 from the top figure it appears that the models have the same asymptotic behaviour in the far wake field i e x 50 it also found that in the near wake field there are large differences between the huse model and the other two models the reason is that the origin in the huse model see fig 2 is not the same as in the other two models see fig 1 the latter become singular at x 0 actually the blevins model is valid for a relative distance between the centres of cylinders greater than 2 3 times the diameter of the upstream cylinder at distances less than this value the interference becomes more complex with negative suck force involved to avoid this it is assumed that the drag coefficient is constant if x 2 d and equal to the value of c d at x 2 d the modified model is shown in the bottom of fig 5 in the same figure the measurements by price and paidoussis 1984 for r e 5 3 10 4 by zdravkovich 1977 for r e 1 2 10 5 and by herfjord et al 2002 for r e 5 3 10 4 are presented fig 6 presents the results for the different models as a function of x d for y d 0 25 and y d 0 5 showing the properties of the modified models in the near wake it appears that at y d 0 25 the huse model always gives a larger c d compared with the blevins model for y d 0 5 the difference between the two modified models becomes smaller and c d becomes larger as a result of the wider wake for the upstream cylinder bokaian et al 1985 has shown that the fluid interaction has no influence on the upstream cylinder if the relative distance is more than about 2 3 diameters thus the drag force on the upstream cylinder is here calculated by the undisturbed morison equation 3 wake interference in current the wake effect in steady current is investigated by combining the finite element software riflex 1987 along with the modified wake models riflex is specially designed to handle static and dynamic analyses of flexible risers and other slender structures the static analysis methods comprise catenary analyses available for a limited range of systems the dynamic analysis comprises linear and nonlinear time domain analysis as mentioned previously the drag force on the downstream riser depends on the wake models which are functions of the relative distance between downstream and upstream risers consequently the forces vary along the risers due to the current profile and the riser boundary condition in order to consider the wake interference in static analysis an iteration procedure is necessary for determining the static equilibrium position particular attention is given to a pair of flexible risers with steep wave configuration in tandem arrangement a steep wave riser has the addition of buoyancy modules along a part of the riser length in order to form a wave shape so that some of the axial tensile forces acting on the riser can be relieved as shown in fig 7 the total length of the riser is l 160 m with diameter d 0 25 m the length of the buoyancy module is l b 50 m with diameter d b 0 63 m and along the riser at water depth h 60 90 m the main riser properties are summarized in table 1 both blevins model and huse model are used in the static analysis the iteration procedure is proposed in fu et al 2017 in the present study this method is refined by calculating the local drag force for each finite element instead of each segment this is achieved by dividing the two risers into 320 elements and calculating the relative distance for each pair of elements the main steps used to determine the static equilibrium position are as follows 1 calculate the local drag coefficient c d 1 according to the blevins model and the huse model based on the initial position i e l 0 2 perform a static analysis using riflex and compute the relative distance between each pair of elements x r i 3 update the local drag coefficient i e c d i 1 based on the calculated distance x r i 4 repeat steps 2 3 until convergence is achieved the static equilibrium deflection shapes of the risers subjected to current loads are illustrated in figs 8 and 9 by using the different wake models with different combinations of the current velocity v 0 and the initial center to center distance l 0 the finial deflection shapes of the two risers without wake effects are also shown in the same figures the notation ur and dr in the figures refer to the upstream riser and downstream riser respectively fig 8 presents the finial static deflection shape for initial distance l 0 8 m and current velocity v 0 1 m s from the figure it appears that the wake effect has a notable influence on the downstream riser both of the modified models give a reduced relative distance compared with that for the model with no wake effect the minimum distance is identified in the joint region where the buoyancy modules and the bare riser segments are located this is because the influence of the wake effect is significant in this region where the diameter and flexibility is increased it is also observed that the blevins model leads to a small gap at a submerged depth around h 60 m where the relative distance x r 1 8 d actually in such close region collision might happen due to the suck force in practice depending on the reynolds number and the roughness ratio zdravkovich 1977 in order to increase the final relative distance and avoid collision some modifications can be carried out as shown in fig 9 it is illustrated in fig 9a that the static equilibrium deflection shapes of risers when l 0 is increased from 8 m to 10 m this change ensures that there is sufficient clearance between the upstream and downstream risers in fig 9b the current velocity is decreased from 1 0 m s to 0 8 m s which leads to a reduced drag force on the risers as a consequence the risk of riser collision can be reduced significantly 4 wake interference in current plus waves 4 1 numerical model dynamic wave loads will excite the individual risers such that they oscillate around their static equilibrium positions if the excitation corresponding to the fluid loads is so strong that the risers start to move with large amplitudes the risers may collide with each other the wave induced excitation forces froude kriloff and diffraction forces can be computed by a long wavelength approximation which involves added mass and potential damping of the actual cross section together with the wave kinematics the viscous loads are computed using the drag term in a modified morisons equation taking into account the relative motion between risers and fluid flow additionally wake effects generated by the upstream cylinder are accounted for in order to investigate the effect of the wake interference in waves the hydrodynamic forces are calculated based on two dimensional strip theory in the present study a simple 2d cylinder system with one degree of freedom is used as shown in fig 10 since the wake effects only influence the hydrodynamic behaviour of the downstream cylinder and the configuration of the upstream cylinder does not change the property the upstream cylinder is taken to be fixed in order to simplify the problem the downstream cylinder is placed in the wake center line and is free to oscillate in the x direction as illustrated in fig 10 the equation of motion for the downstream cylinder in terms of the coordinate system x y can be written as 8 m m a x c x k x 20 x f d f i where the origin of the coordinate system x y is placed at the center of the static position of the downstream cylinder as shown in fig 10 m is the cylinder mass per unit length m a is the added mass per unit length c is the structural damping f i c m ρ d x is the inertia force per unit length c m is the inertia coefficient and a typical value of 2 is used the drag force per unit length acting on the downstream cylinder is given by using the morisons equation taking into account the relative motion between the flow and the cylinder 9 f d 1 2 ρ d v r v r c d where v r is the relative velocity between the flow and the cylinder and c d is the drag coefficient these parameters are defined as following according to different wake models 1 v r and c d in the huse model since the huse model gives the local velocity as shown in eq 3 it is assumed that the drag coefficient of the downstream cylinder is the same as the upstream one which is constant i e c d c d this implies that the variation in the downstream cylinder s drag force will be governed by the local wake velocity considering the motion of the cylinders v r is defined as the relative velocity between the reduced flow and the moving cylinder i e v r v 0 v w 1 v ˆ d r m s x where v w is the wave particle velocity it is convenient to transfer the variation from the local wake velocity into a modified drag coefficient by introducing the following equality c d 0 v r 2 c d x v 0 v w x 2 2 v r and c d in the blevins model according to the blevins model the variation in the downstream cylinder s drag force is governed by the local drag coefficient as given in eq 7 the flow velocity is taken as the undisturbed velocity hence the relative velocity v r is defined as the relative velocity between the undisturbed flow and the moving cylinder i e v r v 0 v w x the calculation of the drag force mentioned above is based on the assumption that the modified wake models which have been established for steady flow can be applied to a current dominated flow for each time step a current dominated flow is required in order to make sure that wake shielding effects from the upstream cylinder always act on the downstream cylinder when subjected to a combined current plus waves based on the above definition the drag forces are updated at each time step based on the instantaneous relative distance x the equation of motion becomes a high non linear equation due to the position dependent c d x and v r x and can be solved numerically by using the numerical time integration a simplified method as a first approximation is to use a constant c d based on the relative distance between cylinders obtained from static equilibrium position it implies that the wake effect generated by the relative motion due to wave loads is neglected in the following calculation both the updated c d and constant c d will be applied and compared 4 2 current plus regular waves the effect of the wake interference due to current plus regular waves is investigated in this section the cylinders are placed at a submerged depth of z 60 m which is chosen because it represents a region where the relative distance was minimum according to the previous static analysis in section 2 both the cylinders have the same diameter d 0 25 m the surface wave elevation is ζ ζ 0 sin ω w t k x where ζ 0 is the wave amplitude ω w 2 π t is the wave frequency and t is the wave period linear wave theory is used to calculate the wave particle velocity at a given water depth i e v w ω ζ 0 e k z c o s ω w t k x where the wave number is k 2 π λ and λ is the wave length determined from the deep water dispersion relationship i e λ 2 π g ω w the natural frequency of the cylinder is ω n 2 π t n k x m m a where t n is the natural period of the cylinder in order to apply the most critical environmental loads the current and the waves are both in the x direction in figs 11 14 the calculated dynamic responses obtained by using both of the modified models are presented with the frequency ratio which is defined as β ωw ωn varying from 0 6 to 1 4 the red dashed line in all figures indicates the static result when the risers are subjected to current only table 2 shows the prescribed cylinder and environmental conditions that are applied in the present study fig 11 shows the results obtained by application of the blevins model for different values of the frequency ratio β both the results calculated from constant c d and updated c d are shown in the same figure denoted as c d c o n s t a n t and c d u p d a t e d respectively the initial distance is set to be l 0 8 d fig 11a illustrates the c d x range based on the calculations and fig 11b shows the associated displacement range in terms of the non dimensional displacement x d for both c d c o n s t a n t and c d u p d a t e d from fig 11 it appears that for static results the cylinder moves to its static equilibrium position x r 12 8 d with the corresponding c d x r 0 56 when subjected to the current loads subsequently it oscillates around this position when the wave loads are applied the amplitude of the motion is reduced as β increases apparently this is because a small β corresponds to a long wave which induces a large particle motion amplitude by comparing the amplitude of the motion calculated based on c d c o n s t a n t and c d u p d a t e d it is found that the cylinder motion range is enlarged by using c d u p d a t e d for β 0 6 and 0 8 this is because the drag force will increase due to the increase of the updated drag coefficient when the cylinder moves away from the upstream cylinder conversely the drag coefficient will decrease when the cylinder moves towards to the upstream cylinder however as β increases the importance of the drag force is reduced relative to the inertia force so that the variation of the drag force has an insignificant effect on the excitation force accordingly also on the response of the cylinder fig 12 presents the results obtained by using the huse model the results associated with both the constant and updated drag coefficients are presented as well the ranges of x d for different β are shown in fig 12b the static equilibrium position is x r 13 8 d with the corresponding c d x r 0 67 as seen in fig 12a which are slightly larger than the results obtained by the blevins model for each β the huse model leads to a relative smaller motion amplitude and a larger relative distance between the two cylinders as compared with that for the blevins model consequently the collision probability decreases by comparing the results calculated based on c d c o n s t a n t and c d u p d a t e d it is found that for the longer waves corresponding to β 0 6 and 0 8 the maximum distance between the two cylinders is enlarged when using c d u p d a t e d while the minimum distance is almost the same this implies that updating of the drag coefficient for the huse model doesn t influence the dynamic response of the cylinder significantly similarly the drag force becomes relatively less important as β increases and accordingly the variation of the drag force has a limited effect on the excitation force as well as on the response of the cylinder figs 13 and 14 show the results obtained by application of the two modified models for an initial distance l 0 5 d for such a close initial distance the cylinders are more likely to collide when subjected to current plus waves according to the previous definition collision events occur when the relative distance is x r 2 d and the drag coefficient of the downstream cylinder is here then locked at c d x c d 2 d as shown in fig 13 collisions occur both by applying c d c o n s t a n t and c d u p d a t e d for β 0 6 0 8 and 1 0 due to the low drag force when the cylinder moves towards to the upstream direction as β increases c d u p d a t e d leads to a relatively small change in the motion amplitude since the hydrodynamic force is governed by the inertial force similarly fig 14 shows the dynamic responses obtained by application of the huse model no collision is detected for the present condition and the minimum distance between the two risers is not significantly affected by updating versus keeping the drag coefficient constant 4 3 current plus irregular waves the wake effects on the downstream cylinder subjected to a combination of irregular waves and collinear current is studied in this section the jonswap spectrum with a γ factor of 3 3 is used to characterize a sea state with significant wave height h s 10 25 m and peak period t p 15 s the current velocity is v 0 1 m s the duration of the simulation is 1 h for all the calculations fig 15 show sequences of the time history of x d for the downstream cylinder by application of the modified models for the initial distance l 0 8 d the green line indicates the collision criterion i e x 2 d the displacement histories of the cylinder from time t 2200 s to t 2500 s which are obtained by using the blevins model based on both c d c o n s t a n t and c d u p d a t e d are plotted in fig 15a it appears that at t 2355 s the minimum distance is x d 2 2 for c d c o n s t a n t and x d 1 7 for c d u p d a t e d a collision event is hence detected in the latter case similar results are plotted in fig 15b by application of the huse model and no collision is detected by application of both sets of drag coefficients based on the comparison of these results it is found that the blevins model will imply a relatively higher risk of collision than the huse model 5 collision probability the collision probability associated with random waves is further considered the probability of the riser collision actually is an extreme minimum value problem it is convenient to transform the extreme minimum value problem to the extreme maximum value problem in non dimensional form by writing the process as 10 x t x d in this way x t 0 and the cylinders physically collide when x t 1 in the present study however it is defined that the collision occurs when x t 2 based on the previous discussion due to the statistical uncertainties which are inherent in the random response process repeated simulations are required in order to obtain a reliable estimation of the extreme response the classical extreme value theory assume that the distribution of a sequence of independent and identically distributed random variables will normally converge towards one of three possible asymptotic extreme value distributions as n naess and moan 2012 in the present study the gumbel distribution function will be adopted due to the behaviour of the upper tail of the distribution of maxima the gumbel probability paper method is a simple and efficient method to determine the distribution parameters the cumulative distribution function is given by 11 f x e x exp exp α x u where α and μ are the scale and location parameters respectively by taking the logarithm of both left and right hand side of this equation twice the following equation is obtained 12 ln ln f x e x α x u further by introducing y ln ln f x e x a linear function y α x u is obtained which implies that in a x y axis system the cumulative distribution becomes a straight line the parameters α and μ can be estimated by the least square fitting of the samples to the straight line the fitted straight line and the extreme samples identified from the 25 1 h simulations with different random seeds for generating time series of waves are plotted in figs 16 and 17 with the blevins model and huse model respectively the results obtained by application of the constant and updated c d x for each model are compared in the same figure the failure criterion i e x 2 is illustrated as the dotted vertical line the estimated gumbel parameters and the failure probability p f 1 f x obtained by the two models are summarized in table 3 generally the results show that the blevins model increases the probability of failure by about two orders of magnitude thus emphasizing the importance of accounting for the uncertainties related to the wake model in the context of a riser collision reliability assessment it is also found that updating of c d has a noticeable effect on the probability of failure for the present case with β 1 for the blevins model this implies that the uncertainties of the value of c d must be estimated before a proper collision reliability assessment can be performed on the contrary the results obtained by using the huse model imply that the uncertainties of the value of c d is less important 6 conclusions consideration of the wake interference in the near field is essential for prediction of the likelihold of riser collision in fu et al 2017 a method for this purpose was proposed however in that study only the wake interaction based on the static blevins model was considered in the present work an additional modified wake model in the near field i e the huse model is presented together with the blevins model and the results obtained from both models are compared the wake effect on the static deflection of a pair of flexible risers is studied by using the computer code riflex for both the modified models the results identify the region where the risers are most likely to collide and some modifications are proposed in order to avoid collision waves can also cause riser collision if the wave induced loading is sufficiently large to cause the risers to interact therefore wake interference in waves is investigated based on the assumption that the modified wake models which were established for steady flow conditions can also be applied for current dominated flow for each time step by comparing this dynamic wake model with the static wake model it is found that the importance of updating c d according to the instantanous relative distance at each time step depends on the frequency ratio β for a no collision allowed approach to design of marine risers the collision failure event is regarded as an extreme value problem by using a gumbel probability paper it is shown that the uncertainties associated with the wake model has a significant effect on the failure probability estimation as a general observation it is found that these model uncertainties must be properly reflected in order to perform an adequate reliability assessment 
23292,upwelling and back eddy are usually selected as obvious indices to study the characteristics of the flow field of artificial reefs the influences of cut opening ratio or cut opening shape os and cut opening number on on the flow field of a cubic artificial reef were investigated a reynolds averaged navier stokes equation was established to solve the flow field of an artificial reef based on the finite volume method the standard k ε model was used to discretize the reynolds averaged navier stokes equation flume model experiments were carried out to validate the accuracy of the numerical simulation a multivariate analysis of variance was used to analyze the diversities of the or os and on the results showed that the upwelling velocities including the maximum upwelling velocity and the volume weighted average velocity changed less with the above three factors the on and or had prominent effects on the volume of upwelling and back eddy while the os had the least effect a reasonable arrangement of on and or can enhance the field of upwelling and back eddy while an excessive or or on can weaken them this study provided a scientific reference for the optimal design of cubic artificial reefs keywords artificial reef cut opening ratio cut opening shape cut opening number flow field 1 introduction globally coastal ecosystems are suffering from global climate change marine environmental pollution natural habitat degradation and overfishing it has been reported that some coastal ecosystems are no longer suitable for fishing activities and many fish populations have been overexploited or fully exploited in recent decades fao 2014 garcía and leiva moreno 2003 garcia and newton 1994 lundin and lindén 1993 myers and worm 2003 pauly et al 2002 2005 to prevent this situation marine ranching and the development of artificial reefs are important measures to alleviate the decline of fishery resources improve the ecological environment of coastal waters and provide a natural shelter for marine organisms collins et al 1990 jensen et al 1994 steimle et al 2002 seaman and sprague 2013 fang et al 2013 an artificial reef is a submerged structure deployed on the seabed to emulate some features of a natural reef such as protecting concentrating and enhancing populations of living marine organisms london convention and protocol unep 2009 kim et al 2016 after putting reefs on the seabed an optical shadow is created around the reefs forming a dark area in the water and changing the original light and shade distribution in the area he and shi 1995 the presence of artificial reefs affects the spatial distribution of seawater when the reefs are put in combination on the seabed they have a great influence on the seafloor space and will directly change the seafloor topographic conditions baine 2001 in addition the main function of an artificial reef is to alter the water flow field and circulate the water column much better the flow is separated by the reef blockage and the separated part of water flows upwards to form an upwelling which helps to promote the exchange layer of sea water increase the bottom and surface water nutrient transport and enhance the effect of bait diffusion around reef area haro et al 2004 lan et al 2004 accordingly upwelling region has obvious effects in attracting fish on the other hand part of the separated flow will cross the reef to bring in a series of flow field changes such as vortex and sediment flow which accelerates the frequency of seawater exchange in the whole seabed area furthermore behind the reef there is a small velocity swirl zone that vortex flow speed is slow and stable many studies have indicated that fish tend to group around reefs because the back eddy flow provides the fish with favorable conditions bohnsack and sutherland 1985 collins et al 1990 godoy et al 2002 the characteristics of back eddy around the reef is stable and tranquil compared with turbulent flow from the structure perspective porous reef structures are natural breeding habitats to repair the marine ecosystem as well as to conserve the fisheries resources as shown in fig 1 complex back eddies and upwelling are formed when currents encounter an artificial reef much research has focused on the effect of reef shape and structure on the hydrodynamics and flow field effects of reefs because of the extreme complications owing to different reef structures and shapes pickering and whitmarsh 1997 because cubic artificial reefs have simple mechanical structures and low manufacturing costs many investigations have been carried out on the flow field characteristics of cubic reefs by wind tunnel experiments flume experiments and numerical simulation technology based on computational fluid dynamics cfd tang et al 2007 studied the influence of the velocity of incoming currents at different angles on the flow field and the resistance of cubic reefs by the flume test and found that the resistance of reefs to incoming current at an angle of 45 was larger than that at an angle of 0 liu et al 2012 concluded that the height and area of the upwelling regions changed less with various incoming velocities using the cubic artificial reef model liu and su 2013 and cui et al 2011 analyzed the influence of different pitch arrangement on flow field around cubic reefs using cfd and a wind tunnel experiment and found that the optimum spacing adjustment between cubic reefs was about 1 1 5 times the length or width of a reef shao et al 2014 and huang et al 2014 conducted numerical simulations on the influences of the cut opening ratio or and incoming velocity on the flow field of cubic reefs and found that the or had a significant impact on the flow field and the incoming velocity seemed to have no effect on the flow field of reefs based on the results of a two way analysis of variance fu et al 2012 studied the influence of the or and the shape of a reef on the flow field and showed that the effect of reef shape on the flow field was less significant than that of the or all of the aforementioned works provided important information for the optimal design and layout of cubic reefs it has been shown that variations of structure including outline shape cut opening shape os cut opening ratio or and cut opening number on of artificial reefs might have significant effects on the flow field around reefs but related research is still lacking or is the ratio of the projected area of the cut opening hole to the whole projected area of the reef surface in the direction perpendicular to the flow in this study a statistical method was employed to investigate the combined influences of cut opening factors on the flow field of cubic artificial reefs based on numerical analysis results of cfd by ansys fluent 15 0 illuminating the influence of multi structure factors on flow fields is instrumental in improving organizational efficiency of cut openings with less expenditure by combining appropriate parameters of or os and on the aim of this study was to provide a scientific reference for the optimal design of cubic reefs in order to simplify this work several hypotheses should be discussed before carrying out investigations on cut openings and flow field firstly the seafloor was assumed to be horizontal and infinity without considering the existence of other marine organism on the seabed reefs fell on the seabed without being affected by other objects during the process of deploying secondly we assumed that the flow velocity and direction of current in the reef area remained constant so the effects of change of the current on the flow field around reefs are ignored in reality after the reefs deployed on the seabed occasional stacking or burial around the reefs might occur in the reef area forming reef sets or groups and enhancing the flow field effects around the reefs to some degree grove and sonu 1985 yoon et al 2016 furthermore stacking or burial around the reef might lead to the intervals or spaces around reefs causing the change of effective usable volume or facilitate volume yoon et al 2016 but study subject of this paper focused on impacts of cut openings of single reef on the flow field reef sets or groups were not included for the time being finally considering the scope of this study it was assumed that the reef kept stable after layout in current although cut openings of the reef caused the weight loss of the reef and consequently affected the stability of the reef for field engineers such as rolling and slipping on the seabed for this reason it is suggested that the arrangement of cut openings of reef should be symmetric as far as possible 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials in this study a cubic artificial reef 3 0 m 3 0 m 3 0 m without a top or bottom cover was used as the prototype design the height width and length of the cubic reef model were 150 mm with a geometric scale of 1 20 and the thickness of reef wall was 7 5 mm as shown in fig 2 cut openings on the side surfaces of the reef were symmetrically centered on the centroid and each side surface had 1 4 or 9 cut openings in this study 60 cross combinations with three types of ons 1 4 and 9 four types of oss square hexagonal octagonal and circular and five types of ors 0 1 0 2 0 3 0 4 and 0 5 were employed the details of all model cases are shown in table 1 2 2 numerical simulations 2 2 1 governing equations and standard k ε turbulence model to simplify the simulation the water in the flow field was assumed to be an incompressible steady and viscous newtonian fluid heat exchange in the fluid was neglected and the water temperature was isothermal at 25 c a continuity equation eq 1 and a three dimensional reynolds averaged navier stokes equation eq 2 were used to calculate the velocity of the water particles 1 ρ t x i ρ u i 0 2 t u i x j u i u j p x i x j μ u i x j x j u i u j where u i and u j represent the average velocity i 1 2 3 represent components x y and z in the cartesian coordinate system respectively p is the static pressure ρ is the density of the fluid μ is the dynamic viscosity of the fluid u i and u j represent the fluctuating velocity and u i u j are the reynolds stresses owing to the different methods dealing with reynolds stresses turbulence models consisted of the reynolds stress model rsm and an eddy viscosity model evm to simplify the calculation under the premise of ensuring accuracy the evm was adopted to solve the reynolds stresses in the evm reynolds stresses were not directly solved but were expressed by a function of eddy viscosity the viscosity of a turbulent flow was derived from the eddy viscosity hypothesis of boussinesq this assumption established the relationship between the reynolds stress and the mean velocity gradient eq 3 3 ρ u i u j μ t u i x j u j x i 2 3 ρ k μ t u i x i δ i j where μ t is the turbulent viscosity μ i is the time averaged velocity δ ij is the kronecker delta and k is the turbulent kinetic energy based on the boussinesq hypothesis the key to the calculation of turbulent motion is the determination of μ t in this study the standard k ε model was used to derive μ t the finite volume method fvm was used to discretize the reynolds averaged navier stokes equation thus the specific form of the turbulent flow field was calculated by all of the above methods the details of the k and ε equations are shown as follows incompressible flow user defined source terms are not included 4 ρ k t ρ k u i x i x j μ

cartesian coordinate system of which the origin was set at the bottom center of the reef 1 0 m downstream from the inflow entrance boundary conditions were classified as inlet outflow and wall as follows 1 inlet was applied at the front side of the domain which is the inflow entrance of the computational domain furthermore k and ε which represent turbulent intensity of the entire domain were initialized at the inlet 2 outflow was applied at the back side of the domain and used to model flow exits when the details of the flow velocity and pressure were not known prior to solving the flow problem this boundary condition was applied to the case where the flow was fully developed at the outlet 3 a stationary no slip wall boundary condition was employed at the bottom of the domain in addition the surface roughness coefficient of reef had impacts on its hydrodynamics and flow filed colebrook 1939 shockling et al 2006 zhang et al 2017 so the reef surfaces were defined as no slip wall with a roughness coefficient of 0 014 the reinforced concrete s roughness coefficient in the numerical scheme the roughness coefficient was associated with roughness height for a uniform sand grain roughness the height of the sand grain can simply be taken for roughness height and the sand grain height of reinforced concrete was set to 0 003 m 4 a moving no slip wall boundary condition was applied at the top of the domain the free surface of fluid with a zero shear stress and the same speed as the inflow 2 2 3 grid generation in this study tetrahedral unstructured grids were adopted suitable for the complex geometric features of a reef as the surfaces of a reef and the surrounding regions were the focus of our calculation the grids on the surfaces of the reef were specially treated the standard k ε model was a high reynolds number turbulent model suitable for a fully developed turbulent flow field nevertheless because of the low reynolds number and slow velocity in the boundary layer near the reef the standard k ε model could not be used to discretize the navier stokes equation directly therefore in this study standard wall functions were used for the near wall treatment to simulate a low reynolds flow in the boundary layer using a set of formulas eqs 6 10 to associate parameters in the boundary layer with a reynolds number and a reference length 6 u u u τ 7

of the wall and also a function of the reynolds number and the length of the boundary layer eqs 7 9 l bl is the length of the boundary layer and c f is the skin friction coefficient related to the reynolds number for a turbulent boundary layer prandtl schlichting skin friction formulas for a flat plate can be used to estimate c f with varying reynolds numbers schlichting 1979 fitted the relations between the coefficient of local skin coefficient and reynolds number forming the piecewise and empirical equations by the classification for different parts of reynolds number according to this eq 8 is valid in the whole range of reynolds numbers up to 109 δy is the height of the first cell near the reef surface the y of the turbulent flow is in the logarithm layer when y 11 63 the characteristics of the logarithm layer are identical to those at the core of the turbulence consequently the near wall treatment was carried out if the height of the first layer δy was arranged in the logarithmic layer and y 11 63 as shown in fig 4 the accuracy and efficiency of the calculation can be improved by an appropriate mesh size however excessively large or small sizes may lead to a decrease in the accuracy of the calculation or an increase in the workloads of the workstation as a consequence mesh size of grids was obtained through a mesh optimization test to ensure stable and convergent calculations fig 4 case 17 for example volume of upwelling and the maximum upwelling velocity were selected as the target indices to carry out the test it s obvious that two indices got stable after the gird number reached 5 25 106 so the maximum size of an element in the computational domain and reef surfaces was 0 05 m and 0 001 m respectively as shown in fig 5 the total number of nodes and elements were approximately 1 07 106 and 5 25 106 in each case after meshing respectively 2 2 4 numerical solution the entire computational domain was composed of cells and elements discretized by the fvm a control volume based technique was used to convert a general scalar transport equation to an algebraic equation that can be solved numerically ansys inc 2013 discretization of the governing equations can be illustrated most easily by considering the unsteady conservation equation for transport of a scalar quantity φ to specify the scalar transport equation a two dimensional triangular cell fig 6 example was used to φ how discretization of this equation between cells 12 ρ φ t f n f a c e s ρ f v f φ f a f f n f a c e s γ φ φ f a f s φ v where n faces is number of faces enclosing cell φ f is the value of φ convected through face f ρ f v f φ f represents mass flux through the face a f is the area of face f φ f is the gradient of φ at face f v is the cell volume this equation took the same general form as the one given above and apply readily to multi dimensional unstructured meshed composed of arbitrary polyhedra it contained the unknown scalar variable φ at the cell center as well as the unknown values in surrounding neighbor cells such as velocity or pressure however face values φ f were required for the convection terms in eq 12 and must be interpolated from the cell center values in this paper or similar terrain this was accomplished using the second order upwind scheme fang et al 2011 and the gradient φ f was computed by least squares cell based method during the cfd simulations a 3 d pressure based solver and simplec semi implicit method for pressure linked equations consistent algorithm were used to iterate the pressure linked equations yao et al 2011 accordingly the scalar φ that we studied at the cell centers was obtained the convergence standard was 10 4 and the maximum iteration step was 5000 in this study i e the calculation was stopped if the residual of continuity velocity pressure turbulent kinetic energy and energy dissipation rate fell below 10 4 2 3 flume model experiments to verify the accuracy of the numerical calculation results reef model experiments were carried out in a circulating tank at the fishery engineering hydrodynamics laboratory at the ocean university of china the circulating tank was 4 0 m 1 2 m 1 0 m length width water depth as shown in fig 7 vectrino current meters range 0 2 m s accuracy 0 5 were equipped to measure the flow velocity the cartesian coordinate system was set in the flume with the origin located at the bottom center of the cubic reef the direction of the positive axis x was the incoming flow direction axis y was the vertical direction and axis z was perpendicular to the plane composed of axis x and axis y as a representative example a model test of the reef case 36 in table 1 was carried out in the flume tank as shown in fig 8 the velocity at 15 points was measured all measurement points were distributed on the mid vertical plane of the computational domain z 0 dimensions of the experimental model and the simulation model remained the same the cubic reef without a top or bottom cover was constructed of plexiglass with a roughness coefficient of 0 014 roughness height 0 003 m to prevent reef model from slippage and rolling at the bottom of the flume the model was fixed with a smooth thin copper plate at the bottom of the flume according to zheng et al 2014 the use of a smooth copper plate in a smooth horizontal plane allows the impact of the boundary layer on the flow field to be neglected the velocity of each measurement point in the horizontal and vertical directions were measured by vectrino current meters when the incoming velocity was 0 2 m s comparisons between experimental and numerical simulation results are presented in section 3 1 2 4 data statistics for a cubic reef with cut openings or guide plates 5 relative divergence level was adopted to distinguish velocity of upwelling from incoming velocity so a region exceeding 1 05 times the incoming velocity was defined as an upwelling jiang et al 2013 2016 as presented in fig 9 a c the back eddy region is defined as the recirculating flow around reefs kim et al 2014 fig 9d f to study the properties of a flow field around a cubic reef typical indicators such as the maximum velocity in the upwelling region and the height of the upwelling region were chosen in previous works huang et al 2014 kim et al 2014 the same maximum velocity in the upwelling region was adopted in this study to describe the characteristics of upwelling in addition the volume weighted averaged velocity v was defined to indicate the stability of a turbulent flow and the average disturbance caused by on os and or in the numerical scheme v was computed by dividing the summation of the product of velocity in each cell center and cell volume by the total volume of the cell zone based on fvm ansys inc 2013 13 v v v d v v 1 v i 1 n v i v i where v is the total volume of upwelling or back eddy dv is the differential element and v is the upwelling or back eddy velocity of the differential element v i is the cell center velocity in each cell of upwelling or back eddy region v i is the volume of each cell in the upwelling or back eddy influence volume is considered a better indicator for the assessment of upwelling and back eddies than influence length and area because the 1 d reef length and 2 d area parameters may be inaccurate compared to the influence of volume 3 d huang et al 2017 for example the height of upwelling or length of a back eddy are usually studied with a mid vertical plane in the computational domain as a reference however because of the different cut openings on the side surfaces in this study the height of the upwelling or the length of the back eddy based on the mid vertical plane may not equal the actual length therefore 3 d parameters and volume were used to assess the hydrodynamic characteristics of the upwelling and back eddies the efficiency indice of upwelling and the efficiency indice of back eddy were defined to indicate the volume of upwelling and back eddies produced by a unit volume of reef respectively kim et al 2016 14 i u v u p v a r 15 i w v w v a r where v up represents the volume of the upwelling v w is the volume of the back eddy and v ar is the actual volume of the reef according to fvm and numerical solution methods described in the above parts values of pressure or velocities at the cell centers were acquired benefited from its highly efficient and easy to use cfd post was employed to conduct the postprocessing based on the cell vertex scheme and element based finite volume method ebfvm filippini et al 2014 joodaki and ashrafizadeh 2014 profito et al 2015 for the tetrahedral cell study the certain cell is regarded as an upwelling or back eddy finite volume only if the velocities at all nodes of tetrahedral cell satisfy the value conditions of upwelling or back eddy consequently the volume of back eddy or upwelling was obtained by summing all these cell volumes meet the criteria kim et al 2016 to ensure that these indices could be used in aided design of actual reefs in the future work efficiency indices of upwelling or back eddy volumes should be non dimensionalized i u and i w associate the influence volumes with the actual reef volumes and express the relation between flow field effects and cost effects in other words larger the indices are larger the cost benefit of reefs are based on the results of the numerical simulation the influences of on os and or of cubic reefs on i u and i w were analyzed through a multivariate analysis of variance carried out by the spss 19 0 statistical package and diversities were taken to be significant when p 0 05 3 results and discussions 3 1 validation results of flume experiment fig 10 presents comparisons between the numerical results and experimental results as shown in fig 10 at the front of the reef the velocity of each point was about 0 2 m s which is consistent with the incoming velocity the velocity v y at points 3 and 9 presented an increased trend while v x of which were close to 0 it was normal due to the existence of upwelling in front of reef model in the back eddy region v y at points 6 10 11 14 and 15 were negative compared with others considering the existence of the back eddy it can be seen that the simulated results had good agreement with the experimental ones except for a few points therefore it can be considered that the numerical approach by cfd can accurately reflect any change of flow field around a cubic reef and can be used to simulate the flow field of a cubic reef in this study it is hoped that the influences of on os and or on the flow field of cubic reefs can be analyzed by divergence analysis based on the results of numerical simulation 3 2 results and analysis of numerical simulation 3 2 1 influence of cut opening factors on upwelling velocity the influences of three factors on os and or on the maximum upwelling velocity are shown in fig 11 when the on was 1 the maximum upwelling velocity decreased when the or increased this is consistent with the results obtained by huang et al 2014 when the on was 4 or 9 the maximum upwelling velocity first decreased and then increased with an increasing or however it is clear that the os had the least impact on the maximum upwelling velocity compared with the on and or as shown in table 2 the maximum upwelling velocity in all cases shown in table 2 ranged from 0 24 m s to 0 26 m s when the incoming velocity was 0 2 m s when the incoming velocity remained unchanged v in all cases changed little ranging from 0 211 m s to 0 214 m s as shown in table 2 the results indicated that the influences of the three factors on the average disturbance of upwelling were the same within a margin of error the turbulent flow was stable and steady when varying cut openings 3 2 2 influence of cut opening factors on volume of upwelling and back eddy according to the statistical results in table 3 at a given confidence level 95 it was shown that the on and or had a significant impact on i u and i w p 0 05 while the os had the least impact p 0 05 3 2 2 1 effects of cut opening shape on volume of upwelling and back eddy as previously mentioned the os had no significant effect on i u and i w in comparison with the or and on in order to specify the irrelevance with or and on relative divergences of i u or i w with different os and same or and on were descripted in detail in fig 12 besides the cases whose os were square were regarded as standard group control group as can be noted from fig 12 except for few points relative divergences were shown clearly that the maximum divergence was within 10 between any two group with different os fig 13 illustrates the effects of the os and on on the efficiency indices of upwelling and back eddy when the or equaled 0 1 a b and the or equaled 0 2 c d fig 14 illustrates the flow field around reefs with a square os case 21 and circular os case 36 on the mid vertical plane z 0 it is obvious that fig 14a and b are identical and provide an easy to understand example of the minimal influence of the os on the upwelling and back eddy 3 2 2 2 effects of cut opening number on volume of upwelling and back eddy because the os had the least impact on the upwelling and back eddy fig 15 is used to explain how the on effected i u and i w in the example of a circular cut opening i u obviously increased with an increase in the on except when the or equaled 0 1 fig 15a and i w decreased remarkably when the on increased or when the or was 0 4 and 0 5 fig 15b however when the or was less than 0 3 i w increased slightly as the on increased fig 15b on the basis of material expense a proper increase in the on of a cubic reef is beneficial to expand the upwelling and back eddy range of the flow field especially when the or is less than or equal to 0 3 3 2 2 3 effect of cut opening ratio on volume of upwelling and back eddy fig 16 shows the effects of the or on i u and i w i u decreased when the or increased and the on was 1 while i u first increased then decreased when the or increased and the on was 4 or 9 furthermore the maximum i u occurred when the or was 0 2 or 0 3 and i u was relatively small when the or attained 0 5 among all cases as shown in fig 16a in conclusion it is better when the cases of on and or attained 4 9 and 0 2 0 4 respectively indicating that an excessive or may result in the enhanced permeability of a cubic reef therefore the decrease of i u was obvious when the or was relatively large 0 4 and 0 5 compared with the cases in which the or was small 0 1 and 0 2 i w decreased with an increase in the or when the on was 1 while i w first increased then decreased when the or increased when the on was 4 or 9 and the maximum i w occurred when the or achieved 0 2 the i w when or was 0 1 or 0 2 was much greater than that when the or was 0 4 or 0 5 indicating that an excessive or might result in a large permeability of a cubic reef for the same reason as described above when the or was relatively large 0 4 and 0 5 the i w when the on was 1 was larger than that when the on was 4 or 9 proving that increasing the on is unfavorable for forming a back eddy when the or is relatively large the wake effect is related to the fact that the flow passes directly through with little reef shading 4 conclusion this study was carried out by numerical simulation and flume experimental verification the results of the flume experiments agreed well with the numerical simulation within a margin of error a multivariate analysis of variance was used to study the influences on upwelling and back eddies caused by the or os and on in the design of a cubic artificial reef the conclusions are summarized as follows 1 the three factors or os and on had no significant influence on the maximum upwelling velocity when the on was 1 the maximum upwelling velocity decreased as the or increased while the maximum upwelling velocity first decreased then increased when the or increased and the on was 4 or 9 none of the three factors had an influence on the volume weighted average velocity 2 the on and or had a significant influence on the efficiency indice of upwelling and the efficiency indice of back eddy respectively while the os had no significant influence considering the reduction in material expenses and the collocations of reefs it is recommended that an on of 4 or 9 and an or of 0 2 or 0 3 is a good balance for the maximum influence of upwelling and back eddies in flow fields around cubic artificial reefs 3 in terms of the or and expenses a proper increase in the on of a cubic reef is beneficial to expand the range of upwelling and back eddies in the flow field in addition excessive or may cause enhanced permeability of a cubic artificial reef resulting in an obvious reduction of i u and i w at a high level of or previous studies took just a single cut opening factor into account which might cause conclusions about cut openings partial or incorrect nevertheless the purpose of this study laid foundation for future designs and practical application of cubic artificial reef by studying influences of comprehensive cut opening factors on flow field effects especially variations of velocities indices and efficiency indices of upwelling and back eddy only three cut opening factors e g on os and or have been considered in this paper more cut opening factors should be considered in future study such as symmetry properties of cut openings layout the hydrodynamics and structural mechanics as well as flow field characteristics of reefs are both pivotal parameters in cfd issues which can reflect the ecological effects and stability properties of reefs cut openings of reef might lose its weights consequently causing reefs rolling or slipping on the seabed and structural damage under the actual engineering conditions therefore further research should focus on the effects of cut opening arrangements of reefs on stability properties hydrodynamics and structural mechanics in addition both seabed effects and flow velocities effects on flow field and hydrodynamics should be also consummated in the future work acknowledgements this study was supported by the specialized research fund for the doctoral program of higher education

23292,upwelling and back eddy are usually selected as obvious indices to study the characteristics of the flow field of artificial reefs the influences of cut opening ratio or cut opening shape os and cut opening number on on the flow field of a cubic artificial reef were investigated a reynolds averaged navier stokes equation was established to solve the flow field of an artificial reef based on the finite volume method the standard k ε model was used to discretize the reynolds averaged navier stokes equation flume model experiments were carried out to validate the accuracy of the numerical simulation a multivariate analysis of variance was used to analyze the diversities of the or os and on the results showed that the upwelling velocities including the maximum upwelling velocity and the volume weighted average velocity changed less with the above three factors the on and or had prominent effects on the volume of upwelling and back eddy while the os had the least effect a reasonable arrangement of on and or can enhance the field of upwelling and back eddy while an excessive or or on can weaken them this study provided a scientific reference for the optimal design of cubic artificial reefs keywords artificial reef cut opening ratio cut opening shape cut opening number flow field 1 introduction globally coastal ecosystems are suffering from global climate change marine environmental pollution natural habitat degradation and overfishing it has been reported that some coastal ecosystems are no longer suitable for fishing activities and many fish populations have been overexploited or fully exploited in recent decades fao 2014 garcía and leiva moreno 2003 garcia and newton 1994 lundin and lindén 1993 myers and worm 2003 pauly et al 2002 2005 to prevent this situation marine ranching and the development of artificial reefs are important measures to alleviate the decline of fishery resources improve the ecological environment of coastal waters and provide a natural shelter for marine organisms collins et al 1990 jensen et al 1994 steimle et al 2002 seaman and sprague 2013 fang et al 2013 an artificial reef is a submerged structure deployed on the seabed to emulate some features of a natural reef such as protecting concentrating and enhancing populations of living marine organisms london convention and protocol unep 2009 kim et al 2016 after putting reefs on the seabed an optical shadow is created around the reefs forming a dark area in the water and changing the original light and shade distribution in the area he and shi 1995 the presence of artificial reefs affects the spatial distribution of seawater when the reefs are put in combination on the seabed they have a great influence on the seafloor space and will directly change the seafloor topographic conditions baine 2001 in addition the main function of an artificial reef is to alter the water flow field and circulate the water column much better the flow is separated by the reef blockage and the separated part of water flows upwards to form an upwelling which helps to promote the exchange layer of sea water increase the bottom and surface water nutrient transport and enhance the effect of bait diffusion around reef area haro et al 2004 lan et al 2004 accordingly upwelling region has obvious effects in attracting fish on the other hand part of the separated flow will cross the reef to bring in a series of flow field changes such as vortex and sediment flow which accelerates the frequency of seawater exchange in the whole seabed area furthermore behind the reef there is a small velocity swirl zone that vortex flow speed is slow and stable many studies have indicated that fish tend to group around reefs because the back eddy flow provides the fish with favorable conditions bohnsack and sutherland 1985 collins et al 1990 godoy et al 2002 the characteristics of back eddy around the reef is stable and tranquil compared with turbulent flow from the structure perspective porous reef structures are natural breeding habitats to repair the marine ecosystem as well as to conserve the fisheries resources as shown in fig 1 complex back eddies and upwelling are formed when currents encounter an artificial reef much research has focused on the effect of reef shape and structure on the hydrodynamics and flow field effects of reefs because of the extreme complications owing to different reef structures and shapes pickering and whitmarsh 1997 because cubic artificial reefs have simple mechanical structures and low manufacturing costs many investigations have been carried out on the flow field characteristics of cubic reefs by wind tunnel experiments flume experiments and numerical simulation technology based on computational fluid dynamics cfd tang et al 2007 studied the influence of the velocity of incoming currents at different angles on the flow field and the resistance of cubic reefs by the flume test and found that the resistance of reefs to incoming current at an angle of 45 was larger than that at an angle of 0 liu et al 2012 concluded that the height and area of the upwelling regions changed less with various incoming velocities using the cubic artificial reef model liu and su 2013 and cui et al 2011 analyzed the influence of different pitch arrangement on flow field around cubic reefs using cfd and a wind tunnel experiment and found that the optimum spacing adjustment between cubic reefs was about 1 1 5 times the length or width of a reef shao et al 2014 and huang et al 2014 conducted numerical simulations on the influences of the cut opening ratio or and incoming velocity on the flow field of cubic reefs and found that the or had a significant impact on the flow field and the incoming velocity seemed to have no effect on the flow field of reefs based on the results of a two way analysis of variance fu et al 2012 studied the influence of the or and the shape of a reef on the flow field and showed that the effect of reef shape on the flow field was less significant than that of the or all of the aforementioned works provided important information for the optimal design and layout of cubic reefs it has been shown that variations of structure including outline shape cut opening shape os cut opening ratio or and cut opening number on of artificial reefs might have significant effects on the flow field around reefs but related research is still lacking or is the ratio of the projected area of the cut opening hole to the whole projected area of the reef surface in the direction perpendicular to the flow in this study a statistical method was employed to investigate the combined influences of cut opening factors on the flow field of cubic artificial reefs based on numerical analysis results of cfd by ansys fluent 15 0 illuminating the influence of multi structure factors on flow fields is instrumental in improving organizational efficiency of cut openings with less expenditure by combining appropriate parameters of or os and on the aim of this study was to provide a scientific reference for the optimal design of cubic reefs in order to simplify this work several hypotheses should be discussed before carrying out investigations on cut openings and flow field firstly the seafloor was assumed to be horizontal and infinity without considering the existence of other marine organism on the seabed reefs fell on the seabed without being affected by other objects during the process of deploying secondly we assumed that the flow velocity and direction of current in the reef area remained constant so the effects of change of the current on the flow field around reefs are ignored in reality after the reefs deployed on the seabed occasional stacking or burial around the reefs might occur in the reef area forming reef sets or groups and enhancing the flow field effects around the reefs to some degree grove and sonu 1985 yoon et al 2016 furthermore stacking or burial around the reef might lead to the intervals or spaces around reefs causing the change of effective usable volume or facilitate volume yoon et al 2016 but study subject of this paper focused on impacts of cut openings of single reef on the flow field reef sets or groups were not included for the time being finally considering the scope of this study it was assumed that the reef kept stable after layout in current although cut openings of the reef caused the weight loss of the reef and consequently affected the stability of the reef for field engineers such as rolling and slipping on the seabed for this reason it is suggested that the arrangement of cut openings of reef should be symmetric as far as possible 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials in this study a cubic artificial reef 3 0 m 3 0 m 3 0 m without a top or bottom cover was used as the prototype design the height width and length of the cubic reef model were 150 mm with a geometric scale of 1 20 and the thickness of reef wall was 7 5 mm as shown in fig 2 cut openings on the side surfaces of the reef were symmetrically centered on the centroid and each side surface had 1 4 or 9 cut openings in this study 60 cross combinations with three types of ons 1 4 and 9 four types of oss square hexagonal octagonal and circular and five types of ors 0 1 0 2 0 3 0 4 and 0 5 were employed the details of all model cases are shown in table 1 2 2 numerical simulations 2 2 1 governing equations and standard k ε turbulence model to simplify the simulation the water in the flow field was assumed to be an incompressible steady and viscous newtonian fluid heat exchange in the fluid was neglected and the water temperature was isothermal at 25 c a continuity equation eq 1 and a three dimensional reynolds averaged navier stokes equation eq 2 were used to calculate the velocity of the water particles 1 ρ t x i ρ u i 0 2 t u i x j u i u j p x i x j μ u i x j x j u i u j where u i and u j represent the average velocity i 1 2 3 represent components x y and z in the cartesian coordinate system respectively p is the static pressure ρ is the density of the fluid μ is the dynamic viscosity of the fluid u i and u j represent the fluctuating velocity and u i u j are the reynolds stresses owing to the different methods dealing with reynolds stresses turbulence models consisted of the reynolds stress model rsm and an eddy viscosity model evm to simplify the calculation under the premise of ensuring accuracy the evm was adopted to solve the reynolds stresses in the evm reynolds stresses were not directly solved but were expressed by a function of eddy viscosity the viscosity of a turbulent flow was derived from the eddy viscosity hypothesis of boussinesq this assumption established the relationship between the reynolds stress and the mean velocity gradient eq 3 3 ρ u i u j μ t u i x j u j x i 2 3 ρ k μ t u i x i δ i j where μ t is the turbulent viscosity μ i is the time averaged velocity δ ij is the kronecker delta and k is the turbulent kinetic energy based on the boussinesq hypothesis the key to the calculation of turbulent motion is the determination of μ t in this study the standard k ε model was used to derive μ t the finite volume method fvm was used to discretize the reynolds averaged navier stokes equation thus the specific form of the turbulent flow field was calculated by all of the above methods the details of the k and ε equations are shown as follows incompressible flow user defined source terms are not included 4 ρ k t ρ k u i x i x j μ

cartesian coordinate system of which the origin was set at the bottom center of the reef 1 0 m downstream from the inflow entrance boundary conditions were classified as inlet outflow and wall as follows 1 inlet was applied at the front side of the domain which is the inflow entrance of the computational domain furthermore k and ε which represent turbulent intensity of the entire domain were initialized at the inlet 2 outflow was applied at the back side of the domain and used to model flow exits when the details of the flow velocity and pressure were not known prior to solving the flow problem this boundary condition was applied to the case where the flow was fully developed at the outlet 3 a stationary no slip wall boundary condition was employed at the bottom of the domain in addition the surface roughness coefficient of reef had impacts on its hydrodynamics and flow filed colebrook 1939 shockling et al 2006 zhang et al 2017 so the reef surfaces were defined as no slip wall with a roughness coefficient of 0 014 the reinforced concrete s roughness coefficient in the numerical scheme the roughness coefficient was associated with roughness height for a uniform sand grain roughness the height of the sand grain can simply be taken for roughness height and the sand grain height of reinforced concrete was set to 0 003 m 4 a moving no slip wall boundary condition was applied at the top of the domain the free surface of fluid with a zero shear stress and the same speed as the inflow 2 2 3 grid generation in this study tetrahedral unstructured grids were adopted suitable for the complex geometric features of a reef as the surfaces of a reef and the surrounding regions were the focus of our calculation the grids on the surfaces of the reef were specially treated the standard k ε model was a high reynolds number turbulent model suitable for a fully developed turbulent flow field nevertheless because of the low reynolds number and slow velocity in the boundary layer near the reef the standard k ε model could not be used to discretize the navier stokes equation directly therefore in this study standard wall functions were used for the near wall treatment to simulate a low reynolds flow in the boundary layer using a set of formulas eqs 6 10 to associate parameters in the boundary layer with a reynolds number and a reference length 6 u u u τ 7 re u l b l ν 8 c f 2 l g r e x 0 65 2 3 9 τ w c f 1 2 ρ u 2 10 y δ y ρ u τ μ δ y ν τ w ρ 11 u τ τ w ρ 1 2 where u is the incoming velocity and u τ is the wall friction velocity τ w is the shear stress of the wall and also a function of the reynolds number and the length of the boundary layer eqs 7 9 l bl is the length of the boundary layer and c f is the skin friction coefficient related to the reynolds number for a turbulent boundary layer prandtl schlichting skin friction formulas for a flat plate can be used to estimate c f with varying reynolds numbers schlichting 1979 fitted the relations between the coefficient of local skin coefficient and reynolds number forming the piecewise and empirical equations by the classification for different parts of reynolds number according to this eq 8 is valid in the whole range of reynolds numbers up to 109 δy is the height of the first cell near the reef surface the y of the turbulent flow is in the logarithm layer when y 11 63 the characteristics of the logarithm layer are identical to those at the core of the turbulence consequently the near wall treatment was carried out if the height of the first layer δy was arranged in the logarithmic layer and y 11 63 as shown in fig 4 the accuracy and efficiency of the calculation can be improved by an appropriate mesh size however excessively large or small sizes may lead to a decrease in the accuracy of the calculation or an increase in the workloads of the workstation as a consequence mesh size of grids was obtained through a mesh optimization test to ensure stable and convergent calculations fig 4 case 17 for example volume of upwelling and the maximum upwelling velocity were selected as the target indices to carry out the test it s obvious that two indices got stable after the gird number reached 5 25 106 so the maximum size of an element in the computational domain and reef surfaces was 0 05 m and 0 001 m respectively as shown in fig 5 the total number of nodes and elements were approximately 1 07 106 and 5 25 106 in each case after meshing respectively 2 2 4 numerical solution the entire computational domain was composed of cells and elements discretized by the fvm a control volume based technique was used to convert a general scalar transport equation to an algebraic equation that can be solved numerically ansys inc 2013 discretization of the governing equations can be illustrated most easily by considering the unsteady conservation equation for transport of a scalar quantity φ to specify the scalar transport equation a two dimensional triangular cell fig 6 example was used to φ how discretization of this equation between cells 12 ρ φ t f n f a c e s ρ f v f φ f a f f n f a c e s γ φ φ f a f s φ v where n faces is number of faces enclosing cell φ f is the value of φ convected through face f ρ f v f φ f represents mass flux through the face a f is the area of face f φ f is the gradient of φ at face f v is the cell volume this equation took the same general form as the one given above and apply readily to multi dimensional unstructured meshed composed of arbitrary polyhedra it contained the unknown scalar variable φ at the cell center as well as the unknown values in surrounding neighbor cells such as velocity or pressure however face values φ f were required for the convection terms in eq 12 and must be interpolated from the cell center values in this paper or similar terrain this was accomplished using the second order upwind scheme fang et al 2011 and the gradient φ f was computed by least squares cell based method during the cfd simulations a 3 d pressure based solver and simplec semi implicit method for pressure linked equations consistent algorithm were used to iterate the pressure linked equations yao et al 2011 accordingly the scalar φ that we studied at the cell centers was obtained the convergence standard was 10 4 and the maximum iteration step was 5000 in this study i e the calculation was stopped if the residual of continuity velocity pressure turbulent kinetic energy and energy dissipation rate fell below 10 4 2 3 flume model experiments to verify the accuracy of the numerical calculation results reef model experiments were carried out in a circulating tank at the fishery engineering hydrodynamics laboratory at the ocean university of china the circulating tank was 4 0 m 1 2 m 1 0 m length width water depth as shown in fig 7 vectrino current meters range 0 2 m s accuracy 0 5 were equipped to measure the flow velocity the cartesian coordinate system was set in the flume with the origin located at the bottom center of the cubic reef the direction of the positive axis x was the incoming flow direction axis y was the vertical direction and axis z was perpendicular to the plane composed of axis x and axis y as a representative example a model test of the reef case 36 in table 1 was carried out in the flume tank as shown in fig 8 the velocity at 15 points was measured all measurement points were distributed on the mid vertical plane of the computational domain z 0 dimensions of the experimental model and the simulation model remained the same the cubic reef without a top or bottom cover was constructed of plexiglass with a roughness coefficient of 0 014 roughness height 0 003 m to prevent reef model from slippage and rolling at the bottom of the flume the model was fixed with a smooth thin copper plate at the bottom of the flume according to zheng et al 2014 the use of a smooth copper plate in a smooth horizontal plane allows the impact of the boundary layer on the flow field to be neglected the velocity of each measurement point in the horizontal and vertical directions were measured by vectrino current meters when the incoming velocity was 0 2 m s comparisons between experimental and numerical simulation results are presented in section 3 1 2 4 data statistics for a cubic reef with cut openings or guide plates 5 relative divergence level was adopted to distinguish velocity of upwelling from incoming velocity so a region exceeding 1 05 times the incoming velocity was defined as an upwelling jiang et al 2013 2016 as presented in fig 9 a c the back eddy region is defined as the recirculating flow around reefs kim et al 2014 fig 9d f to study the properties of a flow field around a cubic reef typical indicators such as the maximum velocity in the upwelling region and the height of the upwelling region were chosen in previous works huang et al 2014 kim et al 2014 the same maximum velocity in the upwelling region was adopted in this study to describe the characteristics of upwelling in addition the volume weighted averaged velocity v was defined to indicate the stability of a turbulent flow and the average disturbance caused by on os and or in the numerical scheme v was computed by dividing the summation of the product of velocity in each cell center and cell volume by the total volume of the cell zone based on fvm ansys inc 2013 13 v v v d v v 1 v i 1 n v i v i where v is the total volume of upwelling or back eddy dv is the differential element and v is the upwelling or back eddy velocity of the differential element v i is the cell center velocity in each cell of upwelling or back eddy region v i is the volume of each cell in the upwelling or back eddy influence volume is considered a better indicator for the assessment of upwelling and back eddies than influence length and area because the 1 d reef length and 2 d area parameters may be inaccurate compared to the influence of volume 3 d huang et al 2017 for example the height of upwelling or length of a back eddy are usually studied with a mid vertical plane in the computational domain as a reference however because of the different cut openings on the side surfaces in this study the height of the upwelling or the length of the back eddy based on the mid vertical plane may not equal the actual length therefore 3 d parameters and volume were used to assess the hydrodynamic characteristics of the upwelling and back eddies the efficiency indice of upwelling and the efficiency indice of back eddy were defined to indicate the volume of upwelling and back eddies produced by a unit volume of reef respectively kim et al 2016 14 i u v u p v a r 15 i w v w v a r where v up represents the volume of the upwelling v w is the volume of the back eddy and v ar is the actual volume of the reef according to fvm and numerical solution methods described in the above parts values of pressure or velocities at the cell centers were acquired benefited from its highly efficient and easy to use cfd post was employed to conduct the postprocessing based on the cell vertex scheme and element based finite volume method ebfvm filippini et al 2014 joodaki and ashrafizadeh 2014 profito et al 2015 for the tetrahedral cell study the certain cell is regarded as an upwelling or back eddy finite volume only if the velocities at all nodes of tetrahedral cell satisfy the value conditions of upwelling or back eddy consequently the volume of back eddy or upwelling was obtained by summing all these cell volumes meet the criteria kim et al 2016 to ensure that these indices could be used in aided design of actual reefs in the future work efficiency indices of upwelling or back eddy volumes should be non dimensionalized i u and i w associate the influence volumes with the actual reef volumes and express the relation between flow field effects and cost effects in other words larger the indices are larger the cost benefit of reefs are based on the results of the numerical simulation the influences of on os and or of cubic reefs on i u and i w were analyzed through a multivariate analysis of variance carried out by the spss 19 0 statistical package and diversities were taken to be significant when p 0 05 3 results and discussions 3 1 validation results of flume experiment fig 10 presents comparisons between the numerical results and experimental results as shown in fig 10 at the front of the reef the velocity of each point was about 0 2 m s which is consistent with the incoming velocity the velocity v y at points 3 and 9 presented an increased trend while v x of which were close to 0 it was normal due to the existence of upwelling in front of reef model in the back eddy region v y at points 6 10 11 14 and 15 were negative compared with others considering the existence of the back eddy it can be seen that the simulated results had good agreement with the experimental ones except for a few points therefore it can be considered that the numerical approach by cfd can accurately reflect any change of flow field around a cubic reef and can be used to simulate the flow field of a cubic reef in this study it is hoped that the influences of on os and or on the flow field of cubic reefs can be analyzed by divergence analysis based on the results of numerical simulation 3 2 results and analysis of numerical simulation 3 2 1 influence of cut opening factors on upwelling velocity the influences of three factors on os and or on the maximum upwelling velocity are shown in fig 11 when the on was 1 the maximum upwelling velocity decreased when the or increased this is consistent with the results obtained by huang et al 2014 when the on was 4 or 9 the maximum upwelling velocity first decreased and then increased with an increasing or however it is clear that the os had the least impact on the maximum upwelling velocity compared with the on and or as shown in table 2 the maximum upwelling velocity in all cases shown in table 2 ranged from 0 24 m s to 0 26 m s when the incoming velocity was 0 2 m s when the incoming velocity remained unchanged v in all cases changed little ranging from 0 211 m s to 0 214 m s as shown in table 2 the results indicated that the influences of the three factors on the average disturbance of upwelling were the same within a margin of error the turbulent flow was stable and steady when varying cut openings 3 2 2 influence of cut opening factors on volume of upwelling and back eddy according to the statistical results in table 3 at a given confidence level 95 it was shown that the on and or had a significant impact on i u and i w p 0 05 while the os had the least impact p 0 05 3 2 2 1 effects of cut opening shape on volume of upwelling and back eddy as previously mentioned the os had no significant effect on i u and i w in comparison with the or and on in order to specify the irrelevance with or and on relative divergences of i u or i w with different os and same or and on were descripted in detail in fig 12 besides the cases whose os were square were regarded as standard group control group as can be noted from fig 12 except for few points relative divergences were shown clearly that the maximum divergence was within 10 between any two group with different os fig 13 illustrates the effects of the os and on on the efficiency indices of upwelling and back eddy when the or equaled 0 1 a b and the or equaled 0 2 c d fig 14 illustrates the flow field around reefs with a square os case 21 and circular os case 36 on the mid vertical plane z 0 it is obvious that fig 14a and b are identical and provide an easy to understand example of the minimal influence of the os on the upwelling and back eddy 3 2 2 2 effects of cut opening number on volume of upwelling and back eddy because the os had the least impact on the upwelling and back eddy fig 15 is used to explain how the on effected i u and i w in the example of a circular cut opening i u obviously increased with an increase in the on except when the or equaled 0 1 fig 15a and i w decreased remarkably when the on increased or when the or was 0 4 and 0 5 fig 15b however when the or was less than 0 3 i w increased slightly as the on increased fig 15b on the basis of material expense a proper increase in the on of a cubic reef is beneficial to expand the upwelling and back eddy range of the flow field especially when the or is less than or equal to 0 3 3 2 2 3 effect of cut opening ratio on volume of upwelling and back eddy fig 16 shows the effects of the or on i u and i w i u decreased when the or increased and the on was 1 while i u first increased then decreased when the or increased and the on was 4 or 9 furthermore the maximum i u occurred when the or was 0 2 or 0 3 and i u was relatively small when the or attained 0 5 among all cases as shown in fig 16a in conclusion it is better when the cases of on and or attained 4 9 and 0 2 0 4 respectively indicating that an excessive or may result in the enhanced permeability of a cubic reef therefore the decrease of i u was obvious when the or was relatively large 0 4 and 0 5 compared with the cases in which the or was small 0 1 and 0 2 i w decreased with an increase in the or when the on was 1 while i w first increased then decreased when the or increased when the on was 4 or 9 and the maximum i w occurred when the or achieved 0 2 the i w when or was 0 1 or 0 2 was much greater than that when the or was 0 4 or 0 5 indicating that an excessive or might result in a large permeability of a cubic reef for the same reason as described above when the or was relatively large 0 4 and 0 5 the i w when the on was 1 was larger than that when the on was 4 or 9 proving that increasing the on is unfavorable for forming a back eddy when the or is relatively large the wake effect is related to the fact that the flow passes directly through with little reef shading 4 conclusion this study was carried out by numerical simulation and flume experimental verification the results of the flume experiments agreed well with the numerical simulation within a margin of error a multivariate analysis of variance was used to study the influences on upwelling and back eddies caused by the or os and on in the design of a cubic artificial reef the conclusions are summarized as follows 1 the three factors or os and on had no significant influence on the maximum upwelling velocity when the on was 1 the maximum upwelling velocity decreased as the or increased while the maximum upwelling velocity first decreased then increased when the or increased and the on was 4 or 9 none of the three factors had an influence on the volume weighted average velocity 2 the on and or had a significant influence on the efficiency indice of upwelling and the efficiency indice of back eddy respectively while the os had no significant influence considering the reduction in material expenses and the collocations of reefs it is recommended that an on of 4 or 9 and an or of 0 2 or 0 3 is a good balance for the maximum influence of upwelling and back eddies in flow fields around cubic artificial reefs 3 in terms of the or and expenses a proper increase in the on of a cubic reef is beneficial to expand the range of upwelling and back eddies in the flow field in addition excessive or may cause enhanced permeability of a cubic artificial reef resulting in an obvious reduction of i u and i w at a high level of or previous studies took just a single cut opening factor into account which might cause conclusions about cut openings partial or incorrect nevertheless the purpose of this study laid foundation for future designs and practical application of cubic artificial reef by studying influences of comprehensive cut opening factors on flow field effects especially variations of velocities indices and efficiency indices of upwelling and back eddy only three cut opening factors e g on os and or have been considered in this paper more cut opening factors should be considered in future study such as symmetry properties of cut openings layout the hydrodynamics and structural mechanics as well as flow field characteristics of reefs are both pivotal parameters in cfd issues which can reflect the ecological effects and stability properties of reefs cut openings of reef might lose its weights consequently causing reefs rolling or slipping on the seabed and structural damage under the actual engineering conditions therefore further research should focus on the effects of cut opening arrangements of reefs on stability properties hydrodynamics and structural mechanics in addition both seabed effects and flow velocities effects on flow field and hydrodynamics should be also consummated in the future work acknowledgements this study was supported by the specialized research fund for the doctoral program of higher education

23293,the need for compliance with the stringent requirements of the energy efficiency design index eedi in phase ii and iii in the next few years and the everlasting objective to decrease fuel costs is expected to put new challenges to the designers of future ships and lead to design solutions with significantly reduced propulsion power compared to ships currently in service this gave rise to partly justified concerns by the maritime industry regarding the sufficiency of the propulsion power and steering devices to maintain manoeuvrability of future ships in adverse conditions hence justified worries about the safety of the vessels in this respect the present paper explores a significant part of the huge design space of ropax vessels and containerships aiming at critically assessing the rationale of relevant eedi regulations this is accomplished by the development of a parametric multi objective optimisation procedure which enables the identification of designs with adequate power while considering the eedi framework as constraint and ensuring safe operation in adverse weather conditions resulting designs exhibit a reasonable rationally supported balance between economy efficiency and safety of the ship and the environment the essence of the presented work was conducted in the frame of the eu funded project shopera 2013 2016 keywords eedi minimum powering propulsion efficiency manoeuvrability safety adverse conditions 1 introduction shipping is by far the most efficient and environmentally friendly means of transportation of large quantities of cargo around the world despite the proven efficiency of maritime transportation the impact of greenhouse emissions from shipping is quite significant maritime transport emits around 1000 million tonnes of co2 annually and is responsible for about 2 5 of global greenhouse gas emissions international maritime organization 2015 emissions from shipping up to year 2050 are expected to increase by 50 250 depending on worldwide economic growth acknowledging the catastrophic impact of toxic gas emission on climate changes due to global warming the marine environment protection committee mepc of imo adopted after lengthy debates in year 2011 a series of international regulations international maritime organization 2009 2011a for the control of greenhouse gas emissions from shipping including the following instruments energy efficiency design index eedi energy efficiency operational indicator eeoi and ship energy efficiency management plan seemp whereas the eedi regulatory provisions referred to future ship designs new buildings after january 1 2013 eeoi and seemp are dealing with the efficiency of operation of both future and existing ships the background for the introduction of the regulatory requirements referring to eedi was statistics of design data of existing ships namely based on statistics of the existing fleet over a certain period maximum allowable values for the energy efficiency design index were developed for each ship type as a function of ship size expressed by transport capacity deadweight for cargo ships or tonnage grt for pax ships these requirements on eedi are assumed to get more stringent in five year intervals phases namely lowering the eedi level values by in total 30 in comparison with phase 0 until year 2025 international maritime organization 2011a 2014b thus achieving a substantial reduction of greenhouse gas emissions from shipping eedi is proportional to ship s fuel consumption therefore to the installed power divided by its transport capacity and speed international maritime organization 2014a for the same transport capacity and speed a reduction of eedi might be achieved by either reducing the specific fuel oil consumption the required installed power or a combination of both it may be expected that in the near future technological developments will enable the design of more efficient ships and propulsion systems in terms of energy consumption and cleanness of energy generation by developing more efficient hullforms streamlined and optimised appendages introduction of dual fuel technology or the use of alternative fuels natural gas hydrogen methanol etc installation of energy saving devices and waste heat recovery systems improvements in hull coatings or by the combination of the above solutions if however the benefits from technological advances are not enough to enable compliance with the increasingly demanding eedi requirements coming into force in january 1 2020 phase 2 and 2025 phase 3 then an obvious design solution would be to reduce the propulsion power by an adequate reduction of ship s service speed note that the service speed of many ship types was significantly reduced in recent years aiming to reduce fuel costs in either case it can be expected that future ships will be designed with significantly reduced propulsion power in comparison with those before the introduction of eedi there are however serious concerns regarding the safety of underpowered ships related to the sufficiency of the installed propulsion power and steering devices to maintain their manoeuvrability in adverse weather conditions this gave reason for additional considerations and studies at imo as a result guidelines for the evaluation of minimum propulsion power were proposed international maritime organization 2011b 2011c which later resulted in the 2012 interim guidelines international maritime organization 2012a 2012b updated in 2013 international maritime organization 2013 these guidelines for the minimum powering evaluation should be considered as a provisional remedy rather than a permanent solution since it was acknowledged that at the time of their adoption there was a significant lack of understanding of the impact of the various underlying parameters affecting the dynamic behaviour and hence the manoeuvrability of ships in adverse weather conditions to address the above challenges by in depth research the eu funded project shopera energy efficient safe ship operation 2013 2016 was launched in october 2013 the ultimate goal of the shopera project was to develop criteria and corresponding environmental conditions along with the required assessment methods of varying complexity and accuracy which can be applied to assess the sufficiency of propulsion and steering systems of ships for manoeuvrability in adverse conditions including open sea coastal waters and restricted areas the impact of the proposed new guidelines for the minimum propulsion and steering efficiency on the design and operational characteristics of various ship types and sizes is investigated among other measures by a conducting a large number of case studies by design teams comprising designers shipyards ship owners classification societies research institutes and universities b developing and applying optimisation procedures targeting sufficient propulsion and steering requirements for safe ship operation in adverse weather conditions while keeping the right balance between ship economy efficiency and safety of ship and the environment the development of such an optimisation procedure for the design of ropax vessels and containerships is presented in the following the adopted procedures for the assessment of a ship s propulsion and manoeuvrability in adverse weather conditions are outlined and the obtained results are presented and discussed 2 manoeuvrability in adverse weather conditions 2 1 criteria manoeuvrability of ships is presently addressed by the imo manoeuvrability standards international maritime organization 2002 which norm turning initial turning yaw checking course keeping and emergence stopping abilities of ships these standards have been often criticized for not addressing ship manoeuvring characteristics at limited speed in restricted areas and in adverse weather conditions the latter has been addressed in the project shopera papanikolaou et al 2015 based on the analysis of accident statistics accident reports interviews of ship masters and existing proposals for manoeuvrability criteria in adverse conditions shigunov and papanikolaou 2014 2015 proposed to address three scenarios of adverse conditions and defined the corresponding functional requirements 1 in the open sea it is sufficient for the ship to be able to weather vane i e change the heading to a favourable with respect to seaway and keep this heading however even uncontrolled drifting with seaway can be acceptable for a limited time 2 in coastal areas the requirements to manoeuvrability are more stringent first the ship should be able to perform in principle any manoeuvre in seaway from any direction and second the ship should be able to leave the dangerous area before the storm escalates 3 manoeuvring at limited speed in restricted areas is relevant in situations where forward speed is limited because of navigational restrictions the ship should be able to manoeuvre at reduced speed in the presence of strong wind and obstacles based on these functional requirements shigunov and papanikolaou 2014 2015 proposed equivalent but simple to evaluate in design and approval practical criteria in the open sea weather vaning criterion the ship should be able to keep heading in head to bow quartering seaway up to 60 off bow in coastal areas steering ability criterion the ship should be able to change or keep course in waves and wind from any direction and propulsion ability criterion the ship should be able to keep a prescribed advance speed 6 knots was proposed by shopera in waves and wind from any direction in restricted areas at limited speed course keeping at a specified low speed in strong wind in shallow water shallow water near a bank and shallow water during overtaking by a quicker ship the corresponding standard environmental conditions for the assessment of the above criteria in coastal waters are as follows h 1 3 4 m for l pp 200 m h 1 3 5 5 m for l pp 250 m linear over l pp for 200 l pp 250 m whereas imo manoeuvrability standards international maritime organization 2002 are evaluated in full scale trials this is impossible for the proposed criteria in adverse weather conditions an alternative model tests with self propelled ship models in simulated irregular waves and wind for all required combinations of wave direction and wave period is impracticable at the present state of technology whereas direct numerical simulations of transient manoeuvres in irregular waves are not mature enough yet for routine design and approval therefore shopera proposed three practical assessment procedures to evaluate the above criteria in design the comprehensive assessment allows the best accuracy by solving coupled nonlinear motion equations this level is the most accurate and is necessary for ships with innovative propulsion and steering arrangements the simplified assessment method is also based on first principles but with reduced number of considered situations and reduced complexity of motion equations having complexity of a spreadsheet calculation the sufficient propulsion and steering ability check is based on pure empirical formulae to define the required installed power as a function of main ship parameters deadweight block coefficient windage area rudder area engine and propulsion type with a complexity of a pocket calculator in the present paper the assessment of the manoeuvrability of each design alternative in adverse weather conditions was performed according to the simplified procedure more specifically for each design alternative compliance with the propulsion ability criterion and the steering ability criterion was checked applying evaluation procedures developed within the shopera project 2 2 simplified propulsion ability assessment typical results derived with the comprehensive assessment of the propulsion and steering ability criteria are illustrated in fig 1 the results are presented in polar coordinates using ship speed as the radial coordinate and seaway direction as the circumferential coordinate with head waves and wind coming from the top along line a the required delivered power p d is equal to the available delivered power p d av i e line a indicates the maximum achievable speed for the given engine wave height and wave period as a function of seaway direction along line b the speed is equal to a prescribed minimum advance speed 2 0 m s in fig 1 line c limits the highlighted area in which the rudder angle required for steering exceeds the maximum available rudder angle assumed here 25 the left plot corresponds to a seaway in which the installed power is sufficient to fulfil both criteria line a does not cross lines b and c when wave height increases or the installed power is reduced line a shrinks whereas the area limited by line c increases in size if line a touches first line b as in the middle plot the propulsion ability criterion will be critical for the required installed power whereas if line a touches first line c as in the right plot the steering ability criterion will be critical the simplified propulsion ability assessment is based on the observation that bow seaways are more critical for required power at a given speed i e line a is crossing line b always in bow sea ways fig 1 middle therefore it is enough to consider only seaway directions from 0 to about 60 off bow in the assessment and in addition that the influence of drift on the required thrust and required power can be neglected thus the system of motion equations reduces to one surge equation 1 x s x w x d x r t 1 t h 0 where x d the time average wave induced surge force frequently referred to as added resistance x w wind resistance and x r rudder resistance are longitudinal forces with respect to the ship defined as the maximum over mean seaway directions from 0 to 60 off bow and calculated at a forward speed of 6 knots x s is the calm water resistance t is the propeller thrust and t h is the thrust deduction factor according to the simplified assessment procedure wind resistance x w added resistance in irregular short crested bow waves x d calm water resistance x s and rudder resistance x r are calculated first as described below subsequently the required thrust t is calculated from eq 1 the corresponding required advance ratio of the propeller j is then obtained from eq 2 2 k t j 2 t ρ d p 4 u a 2 where u a v s 1 w is the propeller advance speed w is the wake fraction and v s 3 087 m s is the ship speed from the required advance ratio the propeller rotation speed n p u a j d p and the required delivered power to the propeller p d 2 π k q ρ n p 3 d p 5 are found the available delivered power p d av is defined at the actual propeller rotation speed and compared with the required delivered power p d to satisfy the propulsion ability requirement p d should not exceed p d av the calm water characteristics calm water resistance x s open water propeller characteristics k t and k q thrust deduction t h and wake fraction w can be defined by those methods that are approved for eedi verification in this paper the calm water resistance and hull propeller interaction coefficients were defined using empirical formulae whereas the open water propeller characteristics were defined from propeller series data the wind resistance x w can be defined from wind tunnel tests equivalent methods approved by administrations or alternatively calculated from empirical formulae here the following expression was used international maritime organization 2017a shigunov 2017 3 x w 0 5 x w ρ a v wr 2 a f where ρ a 1 2 kg m 3 is the air density v wr v s v w is the relative speed of head wind v w is the absolute wind speed a f is the frontal windage area of the hull and superstructure and x w is the non dimensional aerodynamic resistance coefficient 1 1 for ships with the lateral projected area of the deck cranes less than 10 of the total lateral projected area above the waterline and 1 4 otherwise the additional rudder resistance due to manoeuvring in bow quartering seaway x r can be defined from model tests or equivalent methods in the simplified assessment an empirical estimation x r 0 03 t can also be used in international maritime organization 2017a a slightly improved less conservative formula is used x r 0 02 t the added resistance in irregular short crested bow waves x d can be calculated by a spectral method combined with model tests or equivalent methods approved by the administrations to define the quadratic transfer functions of added resistance in regular waves specifically for the simplified assessment an empirical formula was developed in shopera which provides directly the added resistance in irregular short crested bow waves maximum over wave headings from head waves to 60 off bow international maritime organization 2016a 4 x d 83 l pp c b 1 5 1 fr 0 5 h s 2 where fr v s g l pp 0 5 is the froude number note that the above formula was updated later for blunt ships international maritime organization 2017a shigunov 2017 eq 4 was developed using numerical computations with the gl rankine code söding and shigunov 2015 and spectral integration for the jonswap spectrum with the peak parameter γ 3 3 and a cos2 wave energy directional spreading the calculations indicated that for ropax ships the above criteria for propulsion ability were easily fulfilled this of course was not unexpected since ropax ships are highly powered in comparison with other types of ships of equal displacement and are equipped with controllable pitch propellers thus they have full power available under high load therefore for ropax ships the propulsion criterion was assessed requiring a minimum speed of 12 kn instead of the 6 kn that have been used for the other ship types keeping in mind that passenger ships may require higher safety than other ship types 2 3 simplified steering ability assessment the steering ability criterion is more complex since it concerns both the steering and propulsion systems for example this criterion takes into account that ships with high propulsion power may have a smaller rudder whereas ships with weaker propulsion may compensate this with larger or more effective steering devices the simplified assessment is based on several observations first note that the steering ability assessment is purposeful only when the power required to satisfy the steering ability criterion exceeds the power required to satisfy the propulsion ability criterion i e when due to increasing wave height or reducing installed power line a crosses line c while not crossing yet line b fig 1 right plot this always happens in seaway directions close to beam therefore as the first simplification in the simplified steering ability assessment the time average wave and wind induced forces and moments are evaluated in beam seaway the second simplification stems from the observation that in critical conditions for steering i e at the crossing point of lines a and c in fig 1 the levers of the time average wave and wind yaw moments are significantly less than the lever of the calm water yaw moment as a result the sway and yaw equations can be replaced with a simple requirement on the available lateral force on the rudder 5 y r b y w 90 y d 90 where y d 90 and y w 90 denote the time average sway force due to wind and waves respectively and b is an empirical factor which can be conservatively assumed equal to 0 5 thus the simplified assessment of steering ability reduces to the solution of only surge equation 6 x s x w 90 x d 90 x r t 1 t h 0 from this equation the maximum attainable speed in beam seaway is found together with the corresponding propeller rotation speed and thrust which define the maximum available lateral steering force on the rudder y r av to fulfil the steering ability criterion this steering force should be not less than the required lateral steering force defined by eq 5 thus both steering and propulsion characteristics are considered practically the assessment is performed as follows 1 select a set of propeller advance ratio values covering the range from bollard pull j 0 to full speed in calm water with a sufficiently small step 2 combine the open water propeller characteristic k q j with the engine limit curve specified either as the maximum available torque q av n p or equivalently as the maximum available power p d av n p 2 π q av to find the maximum propeller rotation rate n p corresponding to each j 3 for each value of j and the corresponding maximum n p found in step 2 calculate the corresponding propeller advance speed u a j d p n p and ship forward speed v s u a 1 w 4 for each value of j define the calm water resistance x s added resistance due to irregular short crested beam waves x d 90 beam wind x w 90 and rudder x r s below based on which the required propeller thrust t can be calculated from eq 6 5 for each value of j and the corresponding maximum n p found in step 2 calculate the maximum available thrust as t av ρ n p 2 d p 4 k t j 6 by interpolation find the value of j for which t t av 1 and then find the corresponding v s equal to the maximum attainable speed in beam seaway for this attainable speed and the corresponding values of the propeller rotation speed and propeller thrust the available steering force y r av can be defined from model tests cfd computations or with validated empirical models in this paper the semi empirical method of brix 1993 was used the ship fulfils the simplified steering ability assessment if this force is not less than the required steering force defined from eq 5 this assessment requires the definition of the time average wave induced forces x d 90 and y d 90 and wind forces x w 90 and y w 90 in beam seaway these forces can be defined with any of the methods numerical or experimental used in the comprehensive assessment in addition dedicated simple empirical formulae which seem as a suitable alternative for the simplified assessment were developed in shopera international maritime organization 2016a shigunov 2017 and are given below the surge force due to beam wind x w 90 strongly depends on the geometry of the windage area of the ship it can be shown that a close approximation may be obtained by the following expression 7 x w 90 0 5 x w 0 ρ a v s 2 a f where x w 0 is the head wind resistance coefficient conservatively x w 0 1 1 can be assumed the sway force due to beam wind can be simply approximated as 8 y w 90 0 5 y w 90 ρ a a l v w 2 where y w 90 is the beam wind force coefficient y w 90 1 0 can be conservatively assumed using numerical computations with gl rankine code and spectral integration for the jonswap wave energy spectrum with γ 3 3 and a cos2 directional wave energy spreading the following empirical formulae were developed in shopera for the time average surge and sway forces in irregular short crested beam waves maximum over peak wave periods from 7 0 to 15 0 s respectively 9 x d 90 380 l pp c b 1 5 0 1 fr h s 2 10 y d 90 540 l pp h s 2 1 t p c b 1 l pp 1 2 5 note that eq 10 was developed to define the maximum time average wave induced sway force over the peak wave periods used in the assessment procedure thus it works well for the shortest wave periods used in the assessment but is too conservative in longer waves 2 4 engine and propeller according to the assessment procedures developed by shopera characteristics of the engine and propulsion systems used in the assessment should be provided by the manufacturer this is especially important for accurate representation of engine limits under high loading which are essential for both propulsion and steering abilities in adverse weather conditions modelling of the engine and propulsion system in the shopera assessment procedures is outlined in international maritime organization 2016a and will be described in detail elsewhere for the present study it is important to keep in mind the difference between propulsion systems with a fixed pitch propellers fpp used on majority of cargo ships and controllable pitch propellers cpp typically used on ropax ships for engines with fpp the rotation speed reduces under high load therefore the available engine power in adverse conditions is significantly reduced compared to mcr whereas engines with cpp run at a constant nominal rotation speed and adjust the pitch of propeller blades to achieve the required thrust thus they have full mcr available under high load as a result manoeuvring abilities of ships with cpp in adverse conditions are significantly better than of vessels with fpp with the same installed power note that in this study propeller characteristics were taken from the wageningen b series propeller data therefore the propeller was designed for the ship at design draught in normal operational conditions whereas in the evaluation of the shopera propulsion and steering criteria calculations were performed for a range of p d ratios and the propeller with the suitable p d ratio was used in the analysis 3 parametric models and design procedure employing the so called parametric design procedure the design of a certain object component or system may be automatically elaborated for each particular set of values of the design variables defined by the designer or even by an optimisation algorithm based on the use of specifically developed software tools papanikolaou 2010 papanikolaou et al 2010 zaraphonitis et al 2016 in the case of large integrated systems such as an industrial plant or a cargo ship the implementation of a parametric model is a quite complicated and demanding task requiring particular attention in order to ensure its integrity accuracy robustness and functionality birk and harries 2003 hochkirch and bertram 2012 nowacki 2010 such tools if available could be used as the core of a formal optimisation procedure facilitating the rational exploration of the design space and the identification of a series of optimal or near optimal design solutions while at the same time fulfilling a set of design constraints papanikolaou et al 2010 sames et al 2011 a ship needs to be optimised for cost effectiveness operational efficiency adequate safety and comfort of passengers and crew and last but not least for minimum environmental impact minimization of risk of accidental oil outflow greenhouse gas emissions etc in the course of the shopera project a series of parametric models have been developed for various types and sizes of ships including ropax ships cruise ships tankers bulk carriers containerships and general cargo carriers some of them were developed using the napa software by napa oy others using the caeses software by friendship framework in the present paper the parametric models for the global optimisation of ropax vessels and containerships will be outlined and selected results obtained from their application in a series of optimisation studies will be presented 3 1 parametric model for the design of ropax ships the parametric model for the ropax ships was developed in napa the main advantage of this software tool apart from a large suite of modules and tasks suitable for the detailed 3d modelling and analysis of ship designs is the availability of napa basic an embedded programming language which facilitates the development of a parametric model with the level of detail needed for the work at hand using the functionality provided by the napa basic programming language it is possible to fully automate the development and evaluation of a 3d model of the ship without the need for any user intervention the development of each design variant is based on a set of design parameters the most important of which are listed in the following main particulars length bp beam draught depth length of entrance mid body and run variables controlling local hullform details e g shape and size of bulbous bow transom and duck tail length and position of engine room s optional number of bulkheads aft and forward of the engine room s number of vehicle decks and deck heights below and above the bulkhead deck number of passengers berthed and total service speed range the parametric model is quite generic and can be used for the design of ropax ships of small medium or large size once called by the napa optimisation manager the parametric design methodology is automatically executed and the following basic tasks are elaborated hullform development resistance and propulsion estimations development of internal layout weights estimation definition of loading conditions evaluation of transport capacity lanes length number of cars trucks payload evaluation of stability criteria and other regulatory requirements assessment of building and operational cost annual income and selected economic indices evaluation of energy efficiency design index eedi evaluation of hydrodynamic manoeuvring performance in adverse weather conditions the first step of the parametric design procedure is the development of the hullform a set of napa macros have been developed facilitating the fully automatic hullform definition considerable attention has been given to ensure that the resulting hullforms are of adequately high quality to serve as the basis of the subsequent tasks particularly the hydrodynamic and the intact and damage stability calculations apart from the main particulars specific parameters are introduced to control local hullform details such as the size and shape of the bulbous bow the shape of the flat of side and flat of bottom the immersion of the transom or the existence of a propeller tunnel a duck tail or a stern wedge the resulting hullforms are typical of modern twin screw ropax vessels with fine fore bodies and buttock flow sterns the development of the vessel s internal layout starts with the definition of the watertight subdivision below the main car deck a horizontal bulkhead deck and a piecewise horizontal double bottom deck are created according to user defined parameters the vessel is subsequently divided in zones aft and forward of the main engine room the size and position of the main engine room are determined first the length of the engine room is derived from the size of the main engines based on empirical formulae derived from the statistical analysis of data from existing vessels in order to minimize the shaft length the aft bulkhead of the engine room is positioned as far aft as possible based on the shape of the hullform alternatively the size and position of the engine room may be defined by the user the main transverse bulkheads aft and forward of the engine room are subsequently positioned and the corresponding watertight compartments are created the number of car decks and the type of vehicles carried on each of them mix of private cars and trucks are specified by a series of user defined parameters in accordance with the size of the vessel smaller vessels have usually only one deck for the carriage of trucks and private cars for the larger vessels an additional upper deck for trucks and or private cars and or one or two lower holds for private cars located forward of the engine room may be created according to the user s specifications alternative layouts with central or side casings may be modelled as specified by the user a number of upper decks are then generated providing the necessary area for the accommodation of passengers and crew according to the passengers transport capacity specified by the user and the required crew number the model of the internal arrangement of accommodation spaces is rather coarse however it is ensured that ample room for public spaces and cabins for passengers and crew and for the required service spaces is provided the upper decks layout considers also the accommodation of the vessel s lifesaving equipment required for the particular service i e life boats and or life raft the internal layout of a small ropax created by the parametric model is presented in fig 2 the prediction of the vessel s calm water resistance and propulsion power are performed by applying the holtrop 1984 procedure these predictions may be corrected using appropriate calibration factors provided by the user then suitable diesel engine models are selected from a database the ship s light weight is decomposed in the following main weight categories structural propulsion auxiliary deck machinery and outfitting electrical piping heating and air conditioning accommodation and miscellaneous the steel weight is estimated based on enclosed volumes of the main hull and superstructure using appropriate weight coefficients for the main engines the actual weight provided by the engine manufacturer is used the calculation of the remaining weight groups is based on empirical formulae and appropriate weight coefficients a series of typical loading conditions are created for which the intact stability assessment is performed based on the requirements of imo resolution a 749 international maritime organization 1993 suitable napa macros for the assessment of damage stability are also implemented but they were not applied during the optimisation studies presented below in order to keep the calculation time in reasonable limits the assessment of propulsion and manoeuvring performance of the ship in adverse weather conditions is performed by series of napa macros applying the assessment procedure presented in the previous section developed by the shopera project the building cost is divided in labour cost and cost of material the latter is decomposed in the cost of steel outfitting main and auxiliary engines technical and other the cost of each of these items is calculated using appropriate unit cost coefficients for the calculation of labour cost an estimation of the required man hours is needed the latter may be calculated by a similar decomposition assuming appropriate man hour rates per ton of steel area of accommodation spaces kw of installed power etc the second approach for the estimation of man hours is based on the compensated gross tons cgt concept oecd directorate for science technology and industry 2007 jointly developed by the community of european shipyards associations cesa the shipbuilders association of japan saj and the korean shipbuilders association ksa who together represent around 75 of world shipbuilding output the compensated gross tons is a function of the actual gross tons and may be calculated by the following formula 11 c g t a g t b where a represents mainly the influence of ship type b is the influence of ship size and gt is the gross tonnage of the vessel for ferries a is set equal to 20 and b equal to 0 71 and for containerships 19 and 0 68 respectively using an average of 30 effective hours per cgt an estimation of the required man hours for the construction of a ship may be readily obtained it is also possible to use the reference known cost of an existing ship and to calculate the cost difference applying either one of the above procedures the financial evaluation of the shipbuilding investment is based on the calculation of the net present value according to an investment scenario and an operating scenario defined by the user the investment scenario is defined by the building instalments the years to delivery of the ship the loan factor loan as percentage of ship price the loan years the interest rate and the discount rate the operation scenario is used for the calculation of the annual income and operating cost and based on these for the assessment of the annual cash flow tax allowances taxable profits and taxes in order to calculate the annual discounted cash flow throughout the lifetime of the ship and the selling price after the end of service the operating scenario is defined on an annual basis and is assumed to remain unchanged throughout the economic life cycle of the ship in the course of one year three periods of economic exploitation i e low intermediate and high season are taken into account for each of these periods the duration in months the details of the route including distance between the ports and operating speed passenger and vehicle occupancy rates and the corresponding fares and port charges are defined by the user the annual income is calculated consisting of earnings from passenger and vehicle fares and from services to passengers on board the ship and any state subsidies per trip if applicable the operating costs consist of the annual port fuel crew upkeeping maintenance and other costs an inflation rate and a fuel price escalation pattern both defined by the user are taken into consideration 3 2 parametric model for the design of containerships the parametric model for the containerships was developed in the casd software caeses the development of each design variant is based on a large set of design parameters the most important of which are block coefficient lcb number of rows of containers number of bays of containers number of tiers in hold number of tiers on deck draft double bottom height double side width speed the first step of the parametric design procedure is the development of the hull form the next step is the development of the vessel s internal layout for the cargo arrangement both below and above the main deck advanced caeses features are used developed by ntua the feature used for the development of the internal cargo storage arrangement creates the surface on which the teus are stored while monitoring the distance of this inner surface from the outer shell of the hull cargo spaces are created forward and aft of the engine room the feature used for the development of the cargo storage arrangement above the main deck is taking into account the constraints imposed by the visibility line requirement a representative design of a 5000 teu containership developed by the parametric model with a length bp of 242 0 m beam of 37 4 m and design draught of 12 0 m is shown in fig 3 the prediction of the vessel s resistance and calm water propulsion power are performed using the holtrop 1984 method the calculation of the light weight of the ship is based on empirical formulae specifically developed for each ship size a series of typical loading conditions are then created for which the intact stability assessment is performed based on the requirements of imo resolution a 749 international maritime organization 1993 damaged stability calculations have been omitted in these studies in order to keep the calculation time within reasonable limits the assessment of propulsion and manoeuvring performance of each design alternative in adverse weather conditions is performed by a series of caeses features applying the criteria and assessment procedure developed by the shopera project the financial evaluation of a shipbuilding investment is based on the calculation of the net present value an investment scenario is used that is similar to the one described for the ropax ships an operation scenario is developed for each optimisation study based on a selected service route the annual income and cost are calculated for the corresponding number of trips per year connecting a series of ports along the specified route 4 optimisation case studies 4 1 overview as already mentioned the developed parametric models are quite generic and have been applied for the design and optimisation of ships of various sizes in the following results obtained from the optimisation of a small and a larger ropax will be presented the objective of these studies was to maximise the net present value of the owner s investment while ensuring compliance with safety regulations eedi phase ii or phase iii requirements and the shopera criteria for manoeuvrability in adverse weather conditions as well as various operational constraints such as draught and trim constraints for the various loading conditions upper limit on building cost lower limits on dwt and lanes length requirements constraints on the average truck weight etc two containership case studies are also presented for 5000 teu and 10 000 teu containerships the objective of these studies was to maximise the net present value of the owner s investment while ensuring compliance with safety regulations eedi requirements and the shopera criteria for manoeuvrability in adverse weather conditions as well as various operational constraints 4 2 optimisation of a small ropax ship the small ropax ship is designed for operation between piraeus and the island of crete port of rethymno with a roundtrip length of 320 sm a transport capacity of 1200 passengers 200 private cars and 21 trucks and a service speed of 23 8 kn the ship will be operated year round considering a high season during summer of one and a half months with seven roundtrips per week a medium season of five and a half months with five roundtrips per week and a low season of five months with three roundtrips per week the corresponding occupancy rates of passengers cars and trucks that have been assumed for the calculation of annual revenues are 70 65 and 52 respectively for the high season 50 30 and 75 for the medium season and 30 20 and 75 for the low season the ship s earnings per trip are calculated assuming an income of 39 per passenger average ticket price plus earnings from services to passengers on board 50 per car and 557 per truck the assumed oil prices are 220 for fo 420 for do and 950 for lo a lifetime of 25 years has been used over this lifetime an average inflation rate of 2 has been assumed while for the oil prices in particular an annual escalation rate of 4 has been applied for the above operational scenario several studies have been performed with the optimisation tool available in napa i e the optimisation manager using genetic algorithms the results presented in the following were obtained by varying the main dimensions within the following limits length bp from 105 0 m to 115 0 m beam from 18 0 m to 20 0 m and design draught from 5 0 m to 5 4 m a scatter diagram of the net present value as a function of length bp is presented in fig 4 only feasible designs are included the starting point of this optimisation the original design in this and the following diagrams is marked by a cross as shown in fig 4 the maximum npv is obtained with the length at the upper limit of the design space the impact of the other main dimensions on npv was less significant this fact is mainly attributed to the impact of the length on the required propulsion power scatter diagrams of npv vs the building cost dwt and propulsion power are shown in figs 5 7 respectively a negative relationship between npv and dwt is shown in fig 6 this is because the freight rate of trucks was assumed to be constant irrespectively of their weight this way ships capable of carrying the same number of trucks but of increased mean weight are penalised because of their increased propulsion power requirements whereas at the same time they are not receiving any credit for their increased dwt capacity the obtained results indicate that compliance with the eedi phase ii requirement was quite demanding for this study as most of the unfeasible designs failed because of their inability to satisfy this criterion at the same time only two designs were identified able to marginally fulfil the eedi phase iii requirement scatter diagrams of the calculated margins with respect to the eedi phase ii and phase iii requirements are plotted in fig 8 the eedi margin is herein defined as the required eedi according to the regulations minus the attained value therefore a positive margin indicates a design complying with the corresponding phase while designs with negative margin are failing to comply with the requirement a scatter diagram of the calculated eedi margin with respect to the phase iii requirement versus npv is plotted in fig 9 the results shown in this plot indicate that increased npv is associated with improved performance with respect to eedi the net present value of the two designs capable of complying with phase iii is equal to m 14 35 and m 14 37 it is anticipated that systematic hullform and propeller optimisations installation of energy saving devices waste heat recovery systems or other technological advances might help the designers to improve the performance of future ships without the need of significant compromises with respect to service speed however with the current parametric model it was found that in order to obtain a significant number of designs in compliance with eedi phase iii requirement the design speed should be reduced down to 21 6 kn a reduction that would have a significant impact on the specified operational scenario for the design speed of 23 8 kn four wärtsilä 9v32 engines were selected for all ships presented herein these engines were replaced by four wärtsilä 9l26 engines for the reduced speed of 21 6 kn as a result compliance with eedi phase iii requirement was achieved see fig 10 in contrast to what was observed for other ship types compliance with the shopera criteria for manoeuvrability in adverse weather conditions was easily achieved the same conclusion was derived by all optimisation studies for ropax ships that were carried out regardless of their size this of course was not unexpected since ropax ships are highly powered in comparison with other types of ships of equal displacement and are equipped with controllable pitch propellers which allow using the full available power under high load even the designs with reduced service speed of 21 6 kn complying with eedi phase iii had enough power to ensure manoeuvrability in adverse weather conditions calculations performed with only one propeller in operation in order to verify the potential for the redundancy of the propulsion system and assuming a 30 reduction of the propeller thrust to account for ship motions unsteady conditions and propeller racing indicated that all feasible designs were able to achieve 12 kn speed in bow waves at a significant wave height of 4 0 m see fig 11 assessment results according to the propulsion criterion are plotted in this figure as a ratio of the required to the available propulsion power therefore values less than 1 0 indicate compliance with the criterion with both propellers in operation even with a 50 reduction of thrust all feasible designs still could achieve 12 kn speed at a significant wave height of 5 5 m the maximum wave height for which compliance with the steering criterion was obtained is shown in fig 12 once again the presented results are obtained with one propeller in operation and assuming a 30 reduction of the propeller thrust 4 3 optimisation of medium size ropax ship in the following results obtained from the optimisation of a larger vessel are presented the ship is designed for operation between piraeus and the island of rhodes with a roundtrip length of 514 sm a transport capacity of 1800 passengers 640 private cars and 130 trucks and a service speed of 27 kn the ship will be operated year round with a high season during summer of one month with seven roundtrips per week a medium season of three months with five roundtrips per week and a low season of six months with three roundtrips per week the corresponding occupancy rates of passengers cars and trucks that have been assumed for the calculation of annual revenues are 80 30 and 30 respectively for the high season 50 20 and 60 for the medium season and 40 12 and 60 for the low season the ship s earnings per trip are calculated assuming an income of 32 per passenger ticket price plus earnings from services to passengers on board 42 per car and 400 per truck the assumed oil prices are 220 for fo 420 for do and 950 for lo a lifetime of 25 years has been used over this lifetime an average inflation rate of 2 has been assumed for the oil prices an annual escalation rate of 4 has been applied for the above operational scenario several studies have been performed with the optimisation tool available in napa i e the optimisation manager using genetic algorithms the results presented in the following were obtained by varying the main dimensions within the following limits length bp from 155 0 m to 165 0 m beam from 25 2 m to 27 2 m and design draught from 6 1 m to 6 5 m a scatter diagram of the net present value as a function of length bp is presented in fig 13 only feasible designs are included the starting point of this optimisation the original design in this and the following diagrams is marked by a cross as shown in fig 13 the maximum npv is obtained with a length close to the upper limit of the design space the impact of the other main dimensions on npv was less significant scatter diagrams of npv vs the building cost dwt and propulsion power are shown in figs 14 16 the negative relationship between npv and dwt that was observed in the results for the small ropax is found also in this case see fig 15 once again the obtained results indicate that compliance with the eedi phase ii requirement was quite demanding as most of the unfeasible designs failed because of their inability to satisfy this criterion however 293 designs were identified capable of complying with phase ii requirement none of the obtained designs was able to fulfil the phase iii requirement see fig 17 compliance with the shopera criteria for manoeuvrability in adverse weather conditions was easily achieved also for this vessel calculations performed with only one propeller in operation and assuming a 30 reduction of the propeller thrust to account for ship motions unsteady conditions and propeller racing indicated that all feasible designs were able to achieve 12 kn speed at bow waves with a significant wave height of 6 5 m see fig 18 the maximum wave height for which compliance with the steering criterion was obtained is shown in fig 19 the results presented in this figure are obtained with one propeller in operation and assuming a 30 reduction of the propeller thrust 4 4 optimisation of 5000 teu containership results obtained from the optimisation of a 5000 teu containership are presented next the ship is assumed to operate on a route connecting the ports of caucedo santos buenos aires montevideo rio grande itajai santos rio de janeiro cartagena veracruz altamira houston and new orleans with a roundtrip length of 11 984 sm the ship s service speed is 21 5 kn earnings per trip are calculated assuming an average freight rate of 395 per teu the assumed oil prices are 246 for fo 470 for do and 1065 for lo a lifetime of 20 years has been used over this lifetime an average inflation rate of 2 has been assumed the results presented below were obtained by varying the following design variables number of bays defines length from 14 to 18 rows of containers defines breadth from 13 to 17 tiers in hold defines depth from 6 to 10 design draught from 10 0 m to 14 0 m block coefficient from 0 56 to 0 77 scatter diagrams of npv vs the length between perpendiculars building cost and dwt are shown in figs 20 22 the calculated margins with respect to the eedi phase 0 phase i and phase ii vs dwt are plotted in fig 23 compliance with the eedi phase ii requirement was set as a constraint therefore all the feasible designs that are presented in the following diagrams comply with it compliance with the shopera propulsion criterion vs dwt is illustrated in fig 24 as the ratio of the required to available delivered power a scatter diagram of eedi margin vs the assessment according to the propulsion criterion is shown in fig 25 compliance with the shopera steering criterion the ratio of the required to available delivered power vs dwt is illustrated in fig 26 this optimisation study resulted in 153 feasible designs i e designs complying with all specified constrains and requirements including the eedi phase ii requirement and the shopera propulsion and steering criteria in addition five of these designs were able to comply with the eedi phase iii requirement 4 5 optimisation of 10 000 teu containership results obtained from the optimisation of a 10 000 teu containership will be presented next the ship is assumed to operate in a route connecting the ports of busan singapore suez flexisowe antwerp rotterdam bremerhaven and hamburg with a roundtrip length of 13 784 sm the ship s service speed is 24 kn the ship s earnings per trip are calculated assuming an average freight rate of 465 per teu the assumed oil prices are 246 for fo 470 for do and 1065 for lo a lifetime of 20 years has been used over this lifetime an average inflation rate of 2 has been assumed the results presented below were obtained by varying the following design variables number of bays defines length from 18 to 22 rows of containers defines breadth from 16 to 20 tiers in hold defines depth from 8 to 12 design draught from 14 0 m to 16 0 m block coefficient from 0 57 to 0 77 scatter diagrams of npv vs building cost and dwt are shown in fig 27 and fig 28 respectively the calculated margins with respect to the eedi phase 0 phase i and phase ii vs dwt are plotted in fig 29 compliance with eedi phase ii requirement was set as a constraint therefore all the feasible designs that are presented in the following diagrams comply with eedi phase ii compliance with the shopera propulsion criterion vs dwt is shown in fig 30 a scatter diagram of eedi margin vs the margin of assessment according to the propulsion criterion ratio of the required to available delivered power is shown in fig 31 compliance with the shopera steering criterion quantified as the ratio of the required delivered power to satisfy the criterion to the available delivered power vs dwt is illustrated in fig 32 this optimisation study resulted in 156 feasible designs i e designs complying with all specified constrains and requirements including the eedi phase ii requirement and the shopera propulsion and steering criteria none of these designs was able to fulfil the phase iii requirement however many of these designs would be able to comply with phase iii requirement with a speed reduction of less than 1 kn the resulting speed is still greater than that of many contemporary slow steaming containerships of similar size 5 conclusions the conducted optimisations for two distinct vessel types namely ropax and containerships allow us some important conclusions which need to be taken into account when reviewing the eedi phase ii and iii requirements at imo mepc the results from the optimisation of the two ropax ships indicate that compliance with the eedi phase ii requirements is quite demanding as most of the unfeasible designs failed due to their inability to satisfy this criterion this is even more valid for the phase iii requirements which are more stringent than the phase ii requirements additional reduction of power by 10 in particular for the studied typical small ropax ship a number of 161 designs were identified capable of complying with phase ii requirement but only two of them were able to marginally fulfil the phase iii requirements for the larger ropax ship a number of 293 designs were identified capable of complying with phase ii requirements whereas no design was able to fulfil the phase iii requirements it is expected that systematic hullform and propeller optimisations the introduction of new technologies like the installation of energy saving devices and or waste heat recovery systems might help the designers to come up with future designs of improved efficiency ropax ships without opting for significant reduction of the service speed noting that reduction in service speed may not be possible according to the market demands note that when using the current parametric model it was necessary to reduce the ship s service speed by about 10 in order to obtain a significant number of designs in compliance with eedi phase iii requirement for the small ropax ship this meant a reduction of the service speed from 23 8 kn down to 21 6 kn note that in contrast to what was observed for tankers and bulk carriers international maritime organization 2016a compliance with the shopera minimum propulsion criterion for safe operation in adverse weather conditions was easily achieved by the ropax ships even by the designs with reduced propulsion power that comply with eedi phase iii requirements this of course was expected since ropax ships are highly powered in comparison with other types of ships of equal displacement and are equipped with controllable pitch propellers which allows using full installed power under high load the optimisation study on the containerships resulted in a series of valuable design alternatives complying with eedi phase ii requirements as well as with the shopera propulsion and steering criteria compliance with eedi phase iii requirements was achieved by five designs in the case of the small containership while in the case of the larger containership this could be achieved with a speed reduction of less than 1 kn with the ships still being able to comply with the shopera propulsion and steering criteria even with this speed reduction the resulting speed of these designs is still greater than that of many contemporary slow steaming containerships of similar size in contrast to what was observed for tankers and bulk carriers the smaller containership complied easier with the steering criterion than with the propulsion criterion for the larger containership optimisation ships particularly those with dwt around 90 000 tonnes are exhibiting similar margins with respect to both criteria these conclusions agree with the analysis of the statistics of accidents related to insufficient manoeuvrability in adverse conditions ventikos et al 2015 although roro ships are involved in a significant portion 26 of relevant accidents and have the second largest rate of relevant accidents per ship per year after general cargo ships the relevant accidents with ropax ships happen almost exclusively in ports usually contact with the pier during berthing or unberthing and only very insignificant portion of accidents happen en route containerships account for only 4 of the relevant accidents and are the safest ship type from those considered in terms of the number of accidents per ship per year because they are sufficiently powered and especially larger ships have less frequent port calls than other ship types as for ropax ships most of the relevant accidents with containerships happen in ports some accidents happen in restricted waters and almost no accidents happen en route these results suggest that insufficient installed power is not relevant as a reason of accidents for ropax and containerships and that the relevant scenario of accidents for these vessels is the limited speed manoeuvrability in ports the outcome of a large number of case studies carried out in the shopera project for all the ship types within eedi framework also supports the conclusions of this study indicating that with the exception of tankers bulk carriers and probably some types of general cargo vessels all other ship types can fulfil the requirements of phase iii of eedi implementation as presently formulated and at the same time satisfy the proposed criteria for manoeuvrability in adverse weather conditions with the proposed standards however none of the ropax ships used in the case studies could satisfy the eedi phase iii requirements without speed reduction in short the current eedi criteria and reference lines appear not problematic for future containerships whereas there is an urgent need for a critical review of the eedi requirements for ropax ships which appear to be less realistic this may be also related to the controversial definition and way of calculation of the eedi index for ropax and pax ships alissafaki and papanikolaou 2016 in addition simply reducing the service speed to comply with the eedi regulatory framework is not a valid option for ropax ships because the market demands are asking for high transportation speed comfort and safety of passengers crew and roro cargo this is also the background for the concerns expressed recently by the international passenger ferry interferry industry at imo mepc international maritime organization 2016b c and d and 2017b calling for a rationalisation of eedi requirements in the frame of the planned phase iii review of the eedi regulations acknowledgments the work presented in this paper was partly

23293,the need for compliance with the stringent requirements of the energy efficiency design index eedi in phase ii and iii in the next few years and the everlasting objective to decrease fuel costs is expected to put new challenges to the designers of future ships and lead to design solutions with significantly reduced propulsion power compared to ships currently in service this gave rise to partly justified concerns by the maritime industry regarding the sufficiency of the propulsion power and steering devices to maintain manoeuvrability of future ships in adverse conditions hence justified worries about the safety of the vessels in this respect the present paper explores a significant part of the huge design space of ropax vessels and containerships aiming at critically assessing the rationale of relevant eedi regulations this is accomplished by the development of a parametric multi objective optimisation procedure which enables the identification of designs with adequate power while considering the eedi framework as constraint and ensuring safe operation in adverse weather conditions resulting designs exhibit a reasonable rationally supported balance between economy efficiency and safety of the ship and the environment the essence of the presented work was conducted in the frame of the eu funded project shopera 2013 2016 keywords eedi minimum powering propulsion efficiency manoeuvrability safety adverse conditions 1 introduction shipping is by far the most efficient and environmentally friendly means of transportation of large quantities of cargo around the world despite the proven efficiency of maritime transportation the impact of greenhouse emissions from shipping is quite significant maritime transport emits around 1000 million tonnes of co2 annually and is responsible for about 2 5 of global greenhouse gas emissions international maritime organization 2015 emissions from shipping up to year 2050 are expected to increase by 50 250 depending on worldwide economic growth acknowledging the catastrophic impact of toxic gas emission on climate changes due to global warming the marine environment protection committee mepc of imo adopted after lengthy debates in year 2011 a series of international regulations international maritime organization 2009 2011a for the control of greenhouse gas emissions from shipping including the following instruments energy efficiency design index eedi energy efficiency operational indicator eeoi and ship energy efficiency management plan seemp whereas the eedi regulatory provisions referred to future ship designs new buildings after january 1 2013 eeoi and seemp are dealing with the efficiency of operation of both future and existing ships the background for the introduction of the regulatory requirements referring to eedi was statistics of design data of existing ships namely based on statistics of the existing fleet over a certain period maximum allowable values for the energy efficiency design index were developed for each ship type as a function of ship size expressed by transport capacity deadweight for cargo ships or tonnage grt for pax ships these requirements on eedi are assumed to get more stringent in five year intervals phases namely lowering the eedi level values by in total 30 in comparison with phase 0 until year 2025 international maritime organization 2011a 2014b thus achieving a substantial reduction of greenhouse gas emissions from shipping eedi is proportional to ship s fuel consumption therefore to the installed power divided by its transport capacity and speed international maritime organization 2014a for the same transport capacity and speed a reduction of eedi might be achieved by either reducing the specific fuel oil consumption the required installed power or a combination of both it may be expected that in the near future technological developments will enable the design of more efficient ships and propulsion systems in terms of energy consumption and cleanness of energy generation by developing more efficient hullforms streamlined and optimised appendages introduction of dual fuel technology or the use of alternative fuels natural gas hydrogen methanol etc installation of energy saving devices and waste heat recovery systems improvements in hull coatings or by the combination of the above solutions if however the benefits from technological advances are not enough to enable compliance with the increasingly demanding eedi requirements coming into force in january 1 2020 phase 2 and 2025 phase 3 then an obvious design solution would be to reduce the propulsion power by an adequate reduction of ship s service speed note that the service speed of many ship types was significantly reduced in recent years aiming to reduce fuel costs in either case it can be expected that future ships will be designed with significantly reduced propulsion power in comparison with those before the introduction of eedi there are however serious concerns regarding the safety of underpowered ships related to the sufficiency of the installed propulsion power and steering devices to maintain their manoeuvrability in adverse weather conditions this gave reason for additional considerations and studies at imo as a result guidelines for the evaluation of minimum propulsion power were proposed international maritime organization 2011b 2011c which later resulted in the 2012 interim guidelines international maritime organization 2012a 2012b updated in 2013 international maritime organization 2013 these guidelines for the minimum powering evaluation should be considered as a provisional remedy rather than a permanent solution since it was acknowledged that at the time of their adoption there was a significant lack of understanding of the impact of the various underlying parameters affecting the dynamic behaviour and hence the manoeuvrability of ships in adverse weather conditions to address the above challenges by in depth research the eu funded project shopera energy efficient safe ship operation 2013 2016 was launched in october 2013 the ultimate goal of the shopera project was to develop criteria and corresponding environmental conditions along with the required assessment methods of varying complexity and accuracy which can be applied to assess the sufficiency of propulsion and steering systems of ships for manoeuvrability in adverse conditions including open sea coastal waters and restricted areas the impact of the proposed new guidelines for the minimum propulsion and steering efficiency on the design and operational characteristics of various ship types and sizes is investigated among other measures by a conducting a large number of case studies by design teams comprising designers shipyards ship owners classification societies research institutes and universities b developing and applying optimisation procedures targeting sufficient propulsion and steering requirements for safe ship operation in adverse weather conditions while keeping the right balance between ship economy efficiency and safety of ship and the environment the development of such an optimisation procedure for the design of ropax vessels and containerships is presented in the following the adopted procedures for the assessment of a ship s propulsion and manoeuvrability in adverse weather conditions are outlined and the obtained results are presented and discussed 2 manoeuvrability in adverse weather conditions 2 1 criteria manoeuvrability of ships is presently addressed by the imo manoeuvrability standards international maritime organization 2002 which norm turning initial turning yaw checking course keeping and emergence stopping abilities of ships these standards have been often criticized for not addressing ship manoeuvring characteristics at limited speed in restricted areas and in adverse weather conditions the latter has been addressed in the project shopera papanikolaou et al 2015 based on the analysis of accident statistics accident reports interviews of ship masters and existing proposals for manoeuvrability criteria in adverse conditions shigunov and papanikolaou 2014 2015 proposed to address three scenarios of adverse conditions and defined the corresponding functional requirements 1 in the open sea it is sufficient for the ship to be able to weather vane i e change the heading to a favourable with respect to seaway and keep this heading however even uncontrolled drifting with seaway can be acceptable for a limited time 2 in coastal areas the requirements to manoeuvrability are more stringent first the ship should be able to perform in principle any manoeuvre in seaway from any direction and second the ship should be able to leave the dangerous area before the storm escalates 3 manoeuvring at limited speed in restricted areas is relevant in situations where forward speed is limited because of navigational restrictions the ship should be able to manoeuvre at reduced speed in the presence of strong wind and obstacles based on these functional requirements shigunov and papanikolaou 2014 2015 proposed equivalent but simple to evaluate in design and approval practical criteria in the open sea weather vaning criterion the ship should be able to keep heading in head to bow quartering seaway up to 60 off bow in coastal areas steering ability criterion the ship should be able to change or keep course in waves and wind from any direction and propulsion ability criterion the ship should be able to keep a prescribed advance speed 6 knots was proposed by shopera in waves and wind from any direction in restricted areas at limited speed course keeping at a specified low speed in strong wind in shallow water shallow water near a bank and shallow water during overtaking by a quicker ship the corresponding standard environmental conditions for the assessment of the above criteria in coastal waters are as follows h 1 3 4 m for l pp 200 m h 1 3 5 5 m for l pp 250 m linear over l pp for 200 l pp 250 m whereas imo manoeuvrability standards international maritime organization 2002 are evaluated in full scale trials this is impossible for the proposed criteria in adverse weather conditions an alternative model tests with self propelled ship models in simulated irregular waves and wind for all required combinations of wave direction and wave period is impracticable at the present state of technology whereas direct numerical simulations of transient manoeuvres in irregular waves are not mature enough yet for routine design and approval therefore shopera proposed three practical assessment procedures to evaluate the above criteria in design the comprehensive assessment allows the best accuracy by solving coupled nonlinear motion equations this level is the most accurate and is necessary for ships with innovative propulsion and steering arrangements the simplified assessment method is also based on first principles but with reduced number of considered situations and reduced complexity of motion equations having complexity of a spreadsheet calculation the sufficient propulsion and steering ability check is based on pure empirical formulae to define the required installed power as a function of main ship parameters deadweight block coefficient windage area rudder area engine and propulsion type with a complexity of a pocket calculator in the present paper the assessment of the manoeuvrability of each design alternative in adverse weather conditions was performed according to the simplified procedure more specifically for each design alternative compliance with the propulsion ability criterion and the steering ability criterion was checked applying evaluation procedures developed within the shopera project 2 2 simplified propulsion ability assessment typical results derived with the comprehensive assessment of the propulsion and steering ability criteria are illustrated in fig 1 the results are presented in polar coordinates using ship speed as the radial coordinate and seaway direction as the circumferential coordinate with head waves and wind coming from the top along line a the required delivered power p d is equal to the available delivered power p d av i e line a indicates the maximum achievable speed for the given engine wave height and wave period as a function of seaway direction along line b the speed is equal to a prescribed minimum advance speed 2 0 m s in fig 1 line c limits the highlighted area in which the rudder angle required for steering exceeds the maximum available rudder angle assumed here 25 the left plot corresponds to a seaway in which the installed power is sufficient to fulfil both criteria line a does not cross lines b and c when wave height increases or the installed power is reduced line a shrinks whereas the area limited by line c increases in size if line a touches first line b as in the middle plot the propulsion ability criterion will be critical for the required installed power whereas if line a touches first line c as in the right plot the steering ability criterion will be critical the simplified propulsion ability assessment is based on the observation that bow seaways are more critical for required power at a given speed i e line a is crossing line b always in bow sea ways fig 1 middle therefore it is enough to consider only seaway directions from 0 to about 60 off bow in the assessment and in addition that the influence of drift on the required thrust and required power can be neglected thus the system of motion equations reduces to one surge equation 1 x s x w x d x r t 1 t h 0 where x d the time average wave induced surge force frequently referred to as added resistance x w wind resistance and x r rudder resistance are longitudinal forces with respect to the ship defined as the maximum over mean seaway directions from 0 to 60 off bow and calculated at a forward speed of 6 knots x s is the calm water resistance t is the propeller thrust and t h is the thrust deduction factor according to the simplified assessment procedure wind resistance x w added resistance in irregular short crested bow waves x d calm water resistance x s and rudder resistance x r are calculated first as described below subsequently the required thrust t is calculated from eq 1 the corresponding required advance ratio of the propeller j is then obtained from eq 2 2 k t j 2 t ρ d p 4 u a 2 where u a v s 1 w is the propeller advance speed w is the wake fraction and v s 3 087 m s is the ship speed from the required advance ratio the propeller rotation speed n p u a j d p and the required delivered power to the propeller p d 2 π k q ρ n p 3 d p 5 are found the available delivered power p d av is defined at the actual propeller rotation speed and compared with the required delivered power p d to satisfy the propulsion ability requirement p d should not exceed p d av the calm water characteristics calm water resistance x s open water propeller characteristics k t and k q thrust deduction t h and wake fraction w can be defined by those methods that are approved for eedi verification in this paper the calm water resistance and hull propeller interaction coefficients were defined using empirical formulae whereas the open water propeller characteristics were defined from propeller series data the wind resistance x w can be defined from wind tunnel tests equivalent methods approved by administrations or alternatively calculated from empirical formulae here the following expression was used international maritime organization 2017a shigunov 2017 3 x w 0 5 x w ρ a v wr 2 a f where ρ a 1 2 kg m 3 is the air density v wr v s v w is the relative speed of head wind v w is the absolute wind speed a f is the frontal windage area of the hull and superstructure and x w is the non dimensional aerodynamic resistance coefficient 1 1 for ships with the lateral projected area of the deck cranes less than 10 of the total lateral projected area above the waterline and 1 4 otherwise the additional rudder resistance due to manoeuvring in bow quartering seaway x r can be defined from model tests or equivalent methods in the simplified assessment an empirical estimation x r 0 03 t can also be used in international maritime organization 2017a a slightly improved less conservative formula is used x r 0 02 t the added resistance in irregular short crested bow waves x d can be calculated by a spectral method combined with model tests or equivalent methods approved by the administrations to define the quadratic transfer functions of added resistance in regular waves specifically for the simplified assessment an empirical formula was developed in shopera which provides directly the added resistance in irregular short crested bow waves maximum over wave headings from head waves to 60 off bow international maritime organization 2016a 4 x d 83 l pp c b 1 5 1 fr 0 5 h s 2 where fr v s g l pp 0 5 is the froude number note that the above formula was updated later for blunt ships international maritime organization 2017a shigunov 2017 eq 4 was developed using numerical computations with the gl rankine code söding and shigunov 2015 and spectral integration for the jonswap spectrum with the peak parameter γ 3 3 and a cos2 wave energy directional spreading the calculations indicated that for ropax ships the above criteria for propulsion ability were easily fulfilled this of course was not unexpected since ropax ships are highly powered in comparison with other types of ships of equal displacement and are equipped with controllable pitch propellers thus they have full power available under high load therefore for ropax ships the propulsion criterion was assessed requiring a minimum speed of 12 kn instead of the 6 kn that have been used for the other ship types keeping in mind that passenger ships may require higher safety than other ship types 2 3 simplified steering ability assessment the steering ability criterion is more complex since it concerns both the steering and propulsion systems for example this criterion takes into account that ships with high propulsion power may have a smaller rudder whereas ships with weaker propulsion may compensate this with larger or more effective steering devices the simplified assessment is based on several observations first note that the steering ability assessment is purposeful only when the power required to satisfy the steering ability criterion exceeds the power required to satisfy the propulsion ability criterion i e when due to increasing wave height or reducing installed power line a crosses line c while not crossing yet line b fig 1 right plot this always happens in seaway directions close to beam therefore as the first simplification in the simplified steering ability assessment the time average wave and wind induced forces and moments are evaluated in beam seaway the second simplification stems from the observation that in critical conditions for steering i e at the crossing point of lines a and c in fig 1 the levers of the time average wave and wind yaw moments are significantly less than the lever of the calm water yaw moment as a result the sway and yaw equations can be replaced with a simple requirement on the available lateral force on the rudder 5 y r b y w 90 y d 90 where y d 90 and y w 90 denote the time average sway force due to wind and waves respectively and b is an empirical factor which can be conservatively assumed equal to 0 5 thus the simplified assessment of steering ability reduces to the solution of only surge equation 6 x s x w 90 x d 90 x r t 1 t h 0 from this equation the maximum attainable speed in beam seaway is found together with the corresponding propeller rotation speed and thrust which define the maximum available lateral steering force on the rudder y r av to fulfil the steering ability criterion this steering force should be not less than the required lateral steering force defined by eq 5 thus both steering and propulsion characteristics are considered practically the assessment is performed as follows 1 select a set of propeller advance ratio values covering the range from bollard pull j 0 to full speed in calm water with a sufficiently small step 2 combine the open water propeller characteristic k q j with the engine limit curve specified either as the maximum available torque q av n p or equivalently as the maximum available power p d av n p 2 π q av to find the maximum propeller rotation rate n p corresponding to each j 3 for each value of j and the corresponding maximum n p found in step 2 calculate the corresponding propeller advance speed u a j d p n p and ship forward speed v s u a 1 w 4 for each value of j define the calm water resistance x s added resistance due to irregular short crested beam waves x d 90 beam wind x w 90 and rudder x r s below based on which the required propeller thrust t can be calculated from eq 6 5 for each value of j and the corresponding maximum n p found in step 2 calculate the maximum available thrust as t av ρ n p 2 d p 4 k t j 6 by interpolation find the value of j for which t t av 1 and then find the corresponding v s equal to the maximum attainable speed in beam seaway for this attainable speed and the corresponding values of the propeller rotation speed and propeller thrust the available steering force y r av can be defined from model tests cfd computations or with validated empirical models in this paper the semi empirical method of brix 1993 was used the ship fulfils the simplified steering ability assessment if this force is not less than the required steering force defined from eq 5 this assessment requires the definition of the time average wave induced forces x d 90 and y d 90 and wind forces x w 90 and y w 90 in beam seaway these forces can be defined with any of the methods numerical or experimental used in the comprehensive assessment in addition dedicated simple empirical formulae which seem as a suitable alternative for the simplified assessment were developed in shopera international maritime organization 2016a shigunov 2017 and are given below the surge force due to beam wind x w 90 strongly depends on the geometry of the windage area of the ship it can be shown that a close approximation may be obtained by the following expression 7 x w 90 0 5 x w 0 ρ a v s 2 a f where x w 0 is the head wind resistance coefficient conservatively x w 0 1 1 can be assumed the sway force due to beam wind can be simply approximated as 8 y w 90 0 5 y w 90 ρ a a l v w 2 where y w 90 is the beam wind force coefficient y w 90 1 0 can be conservatively assumed using numerical computations with gl rankine code and spectral integration for the jonswap wave energy spectrum with γ 3 3 and a cos2 directional wave energy spreading the following empirical formulae were developed in shopera for the time average surge and sway forces in irregular short crested beam waves maximum over peak wave periods from 7 0 to 15 0 s respectively 9 x d 90 380 l pp c b 1 5 0 1 fr h s 2 10 y d 90 540 l pp h s 2 1 t p c b 1 l pp 1 2 5 note that eq 10 was developed to define the maximum time average wave induced sway force over the peak wave periods used in the assessment procedure thus it works well for the shortest wave periods used in the assessment but is too conservative in longer waves 2 4 engine and propeller according to the assessment procedures developed by shopera characteristics of the engine and propulsion systems used in the assessment should be provided by the manufacturer this is especially important for accurate representation of engine limits under high loading which are essential for both propulsion and steering abilities in adverse weather conditions modelling of the engine and propulsion system in the shopera assessment procedures is outlined in international maritime organization 2016a and will be described in detail elsewhere for the present study it is important to keep in mind the difference between propulsion systems with a fixed pitch propellers fpp used on majority of cargo ships and controllable pitch propellers cpp typically used on ropax ships for engines with fpp the rotation speed reduces under high load therefore the available engine power in adverse conditions is significantly reduced compared to mcr whereas engines with cpp run at a constant nominal rotation speed and adjust the pitch of propeller blades to achieve the required thrust thus they have full mcr available under high load as a result manoeuvring abilities of ships with cpp in adverse conditions are significantly better than of vessels with fpp with the same installed power note that in this study propeller characteristics were taken from the wageningen b series propeller data therefore the propeller was designed for the ship at design draught in normal operational conditions whereas in the evaluation of the shopera propulsion and steering criteria calculations were performed for a range of p d ratios and the propeller with the suitable p d ratio was used in the analysis 3 parametric models and design procedure employing the so called parametric design procedure the design of a certain object component or system may be automatically elaborated for each particular set of values of the design variables defined by the designer or even by an optimisation algorithm based on the use of specifically developed software tools papanikolaou 2010 papanikolaou et al 2010 zaraphonitis et al 2016 in the case of large integrated systems such as an industrial plant or a cargo ship the implementation of a parametric model is a quite complicated and demanding task requiring particular attention in order to ensure its integrity accuracy robustness and functionality birk and harries 2003 hochkirch and bertram 2012 nowacki 2010 such tools if available could be used as the core of a formal optimisation procedure facilitating the rational exploration of the design space and the identification of a series of optimal or near optimal design solutions while at the same time fulfilling a set of design constraints papanikolaou et al 2010 sames et al 2011 a ship needs to be optimised for cost effectiveness operational efficiency adequate safety and comfort of passengers and crew and last but not least for minimum environmental impact minimization of risk of accidental oil outflow greenhouse gas emissions etc in the course of the shopera project a series of parametric models have been developed for various types and sizes of ships including ropax ships cruise ships tankers bulk carriers containerships and general cargo carriers some of them were developed using the napa software by napa oy others using the caeses software by friendship framework in the present paper the parametric models for the global optimisation of ropax vessels and containerships will be outlined and selected results obtained from their application in a series of optimisation studies will be presented 3 1 parametric model for the design of ropax ships the parametric model for the ropax ships was developed in napa the main advantage of this software tool apart from a large suite of modules and tasks suitable for the detailed 3d modelling and analysis of ship designs is the availability of napa basic an embedded programming language which facilitates the development of a parametric model with the level of detail needed for the work at hand using the functionality provided by the napa basic programming language it is possible to fully automate the development and evaluation of a 3d model of the ship without the need for any user intervention the development of each design variant is based on a set of design parameters the most important of which are listed in the following main particulars length bp beam draught depth length of entrance mid body and run variables controlling local hullform details e g shape and size of bulbous bow transom and duck tail length and position of engine room s optional number of bulkheads aft and forward of the engine room s number of vehicle decks and deck heights below and above the bulkhead deck number of passengers berthed and total service speed range the parametric model is quite generic and can be used for the design of ropax ships of small medium or large size once called by the napa optimisation manager the parametric design methodology is automatically executed and the following basic tasks are elaborated hullform development resistance and propulsion estimations development of internal layout weights estimation definition of loading conditions evaluation of transport capacity lanes length number of cars trucks payload evaluation of stability criteria and other regulatory requirements assessment of building and operational cost annual income and selected economic indices evaluation of energy efficiency design index eedi evaluation of hydrodynamic manoeuvring performance in adverse weather conditions the first step of the parametric design procedure is the development of the hullform a set of napa macros have been developed facilitating the fully automatic hullform definition considerable attention has been given to ensure that the resulting hullforms are of adequately high quality to serve as the basis of the subsequent tasks particularly the hydrodynamic and the intact and damage stability calculations apart from the main particulars specific parameters are introduced to control local hullform details such as the size and shape of the bulbous bow the shape of the flat of side and flat of bottom the immersion of the transom or the existence of a propeller tunnel a duck tail or a stern wedge the resulting hullforms are typical of modern twin screw ropax vessels with fine fore bodies and buttock flow sterns the development of the vessel s internal layout starts with the definition of the watertight subdivision below the main car deck a horizontal bulkhead deck and a piecewise horizontal double bottom deck are created according to user defined parameters the vessel is subsequently divided in zones aft and forward of the main engine room the size and position of the main engine room are determined first the length of the engine room is derived from the size of the main engines based on empirical formulae derived from the statistical analysis of data from existing vessels in order to minimize the shaft length the aft bulkhead of the engine room is positioned as far aft as possible based on the shape of the hullform alternatively the size and position of the engine room may be defined by the user the main transverse bulkheads aft and forward of the engine room are subsequently positioned and the corresponding watertight compartments are created the number of car decks and the type of vehicles carried on each of them mix of private cars and trucks are specified by a series of user defined parameters in accordance with the size of the vessel smaller vessels have usually only one deck for the carriage of trucks and private cars for the larger vessels an additional upper deck for trucks and or private cars and or one or two lower holds for private cars located forward of the engine room may be created according to the user s specifications alternative layouts with central or side casings may be modelled as specified by the user a number of upper decks are then generated providing the necessary area for the accommodation of passengers and crew according to the passengers transport capacity specified by the user and the required crew number the model of the internal arrangement of accommodation spaces is rather coarse however it is ensured that ample room for public spaces and cabins for passengers and crew and for the required service spaces is provided the upper decks layout considers also the accommodation of the vessel s lifesaving equipment required for the particular service i e life boats and or life raft the internal layout of a small ropax created by the parametric model is presented in fig 2 the prediction of the vessel s calm water resistance and propulsion power are performed by applying the holtrop 1984 procedure these predictions may be corrected using appropriate calibration factors provided by the user then suitable diesel engine models are selected from a database the ship s light weight is decomposed in the following main weight categories structural propulsion auxiliary deck machinery and outfitting electrical piping heating and air conditioning accommodation and miscellaneous the steel weight is estimated based on enclosed volumes of the main hull and superstructure using appropriate weight coefficients for the main engines the actual weight provided by the engine manufacturer is used the calculation of the remaining weight groups is based on empirical formulae and appropriate weight coefficients a series of typical loading conditions are created for which the intact stability assessment is performed based on the requirements of imo resolution a 749 international maritime organization 1993 suitable napa macros for the assessment of damage stability are also implemented but they were not applied during the optimisation studies presented below in order to keep the calculation time in reasonable limits the assessment of propulsion and manoeuvring performance of the ship in adverse weather conditions is performed by series of napa macros applying the assessment procedure presented in the previous section developed by the shopera project the building cost is divided in labour cost and cost of material the latter is decomposed in the cost of steel outfitting main and auxiliary engines technical and other the cost of each of these items is calculated using appropriate unit cost coefficients for the calculation of labour cost an estimation of the required man hours is needed the latter may be calculated by a similar decomposition assuming appropriate man hour rates per ton of steel area of accommodation spaces kw of installed power etc the second approach for the estimation of man hours is based on the compensated gross tons cgt concept oecd directorate for science technology and industry 2007 jointly developed by the community of european shipyards associations cesa the shipbuilders association of japan saj and the korean shipbuilders association ksa who together represent around 75 of world shipbuilding output the compensated gross tons is a function of the actual gross tons and may be calculated by the following formula 11 c g t a g t b where a represents mainly the influence of ship type b is the influence of ship size and gt is the gross tonnage of the vessel for ferries a is set equal to 20 and b equal to 0 71 and for containerships 19 and 0 68 respectively using an average of 30 effective hours per cgt an estimation of the required man hours for the construction of a ship may be readily obtained it is also possible to use the reference known cost of an existing ship and to calculate the cost difference applying either one of the above procedures the financial evaluation of the shipbuilding investment is based on the calculation of the net present value according to an investment scenario and an operating scenario defined by the user the investment scenario is defined by the building instalments the years to delivery of the ship the loan factor loan as percentage of ship price the loan years the interest rate and the discount rate the operation scenario is used for the calculation of the annual income and operating cost and based on these for the assessment of the annual cash flow tax allowances taxable profits and taxes in order to calculate the annual discounted cash flow throughout the lifetime of the ship and the selling price after the end of service the operating scenario is defined on an annual basis and is assumed to remain unchanged throughout the economic life cycle of the ship in the course of one year three periods of economic exploitation i e low intermediate and high season are taken into account for each of these periods the duration in months the details of the route including distance between the ports and operating speed passenger and vehicle occupancy rates and the corresponding fares and port charges are defined by the user the annual income is calculated consisting of earnings from passenger and vehicle fares and from services to passengers on board the ship and any state subsidies per trip if applicable the operating costs consist of the annual port fuel crew upkeeping maintenance and other costs an inflation rate and a fuel price escalation pattern both defined by the user are taken into consideration 3 2 parametric model for the design of containerships the parametric model for the containerships was developed in the casd software caeses the development of each design variant is based on a large set of design parameters the most important of which are block coefficient lcb number of rows of containers number of bays of containers number of tiers in hold number of tiers on deck draft double bottom height double side width speed the first step of the parametric design procedure is the development of the hull form the next step is the development of the vessel s internal layout for the cargo arrangement both below and above the main deck advanced caeses features are used developed by ntua the feature used for the development of the internal cargo storage arrangement creates the surface on which the teus are stored while monitoring the distance of this inner surface from the outer shell of the hull cargo spaces are created forward and aft of the engine room the feature used for the development of the cargo storage arrangement above the main deck is taking into account the constraints imposed by the visibility line requirement a representative design of a 5000 teu containership developed by the parametric model with a length bp of 242 0 m beam of 37 4 m and design draught of 12 0 m is shown in fig 3 the prediction of the vessel s resistance and calm water propulsion power are performed using the holtrop 1984 method the calculation of the light weight of the ship is based on empirical formulae specifically developed for each ship size a series of typical loading conditions are then created for which the intact stability assessment is performed based on the requirements of imo resolution a 749 international maritime organization 1993 damaged stability calculations have been omitted in these studies in order to keep the calculation time within reasonable limits the assessment of propulsion and manoeuvring performance of each design alternative in adverse weather conditions is performed by a series of caeses features applying the criteria and assessment procedure developed by the shopera project the financial evaluation of a shipbuilding investment is based on the calculation of the net present value an investment scenario is used that is similar to the one described for the ropax ships an operation scenario is developed for each optimisation study based on a selected service route the annual income and cost are calculated for the corresponding number of trips per year connecting a series of ports along the specified route 4 optimisation case studies 4 1 overview as already mentioned the developed parametric models are quite generic and have been applied for the design and optimisation of ships of various sizes in the following results obtained from the optimisation of a small and a larger ropax will be presented the objective of these studies was to maximise the net present value of the owner s investment while ensuring compliance with safety regulations eedi phase ii or phase iii requirements and the shopera criteria for manoeuvrability in adverse weather conditions as well as various operational constraints such as draught and trim constraints for the various loading conditions upper limit on building cost lower limits on dwt and lanes length requirements constraints on the average truck weight etc two containership case studies are also presented for 5000 teu and 10 000 teu containerships the objective of these studies was to maximise the net present value of the owner s investment while ensuring compliance with safety regulations eedi requirements and the shopera criteria for manoeuvrability in adverse weather conditions as well as various operational constraints 4 2 optimisation of a small ropax ship the small ropax ship is designed for operation between piraeus and the island of crete port of rethymno with a roundtrip length of 320 sm a transport capacity of 1200 passengers 200 private cars and 21 trucks and a service speed of 23 8 kn the ship will be operated year round considering a high season during summer of one and a half months with seven roundtrips per week a medium season of five and a half months with five roundtrips per week and a low season of five months with three roundtrips per week the corresponding occupancy rates of passengers cars and trucks that have been assumed for the calculation of annual revenues are 70 65 and 52 respectively for the high season 50 30 and 75 for the medium season and 30 20 and 75 for the low season the ship s earnings per trip are calculated assuming an income of 39 per passenger average ticket price plus earnings from services to passengers on board 50 per car and 557 per truck the assumed oil prices are 220 for fo 420 for do and 950 for lo a lifetime of 25 years has been used over this lifetime an average inflation rate of 2 has been assumed while for the oil prices in particular an annual escalation rate of 4 has been applied for the above operational scenario several studies have been performed with the optimisation tool available in napa i e the optimisation manager using genetic algorithms the results presented in the following were obtained by varying the main dimensions within the following limits length bp from 105 0 m to 115 0 m beam from 18 0 m to 20 0 m and design draught from 5 0 m to 5 4 m a scatter diagram of the net present value as a function of length bp is presented in fig 4 only feasible designs are included the starting point of this optimisation the original design in this and the following diagrams is marked by a cross as shown in fig 4 the maximum npv is obtained with the length at the upper limit of the design space the impact of the other main dimensions on npv was less significant this fact is mainly attributed to the impact of the length on the required propulsion power scatter diagrams of npv vs the building cost dwt and propulsion power are shown in figs 5 7 respectively a negative relationship between npv and dwt is shown in fig 6 this is because the freight rate of trucks was assumed to be constant irrespectively of their weight this way ships capable of carrying the same number of trucks but of increased mean weight are penalised because of their increased propulsion power requirements whereas at the same time they are not receiving any credit for their increased dwt capacity the obtained results indicate that compliance with the eedi phase ii requirement was quite demanding for this study as most of the unfeasible designs failed because of their inability to satisfy this criterion at the same time only two designs were identified able to marginally fulfil the eedi phase iii requirement scatter diagrams of the calculated margins with respect to the eedi phase ii and phase iii requirements are plotted in fig 8 the eedi margin is herein defined as the required eedi according to the regulations minus the attained value therefore a positive margin indicates a design complying with the corresponding phase while designs with negative margin are failing to comply with the requirement a scatter diagram of the calculated eedi margin with respect to the phase iii requirement versus npv is plotted in fig 9 the results shown in this plot indicate that increased npv is associated with improved performance with respect to eedi the net present value of the two designs capable of complying with phase iii is equal to m 14 35 and m 14 37 it is anticipated that systematic hullform and propeller optimisations installation of energy saving devices waste heat recovery systems or other technological advances might help the designers to improve the performance of future ships without the need of significant compromises with respect to service speed however with the current parametric model it was found that in order to obtain a significant number of designs in compliance with eedi phase iii requirement the design speed should be reduced down to 21 6 kn a reduction that would have a significant impact on the specified operational scenario for the design speed of 23 8 kn four wärtsilä 9v32 engines were selected for all ships presented herein these engines were replaced by four wärtsilä 9l26 engines for the reduced speed of 21 6 kn as a result compliance with eedi phase iii requirement was achieved see fig 10 in contrast to what was observed for other ship types compliance with the shopera criteria for manoeuvrability in adverse weather conditions was easily achieved the same conclusion was derived by all optimisation studies for ropax ships that were carried out regardless of their size this of course was not unexpected since ropax ships are highly powered in comparison with other types of ships of equal displacement and are equipped with controllable pitch propellers which allow using the full available power under high load even the designs with reduced service speed of 21 6 kn complying with eedi phase iii had enough power to ensure manoeuvrability in adverse weather conditions calculations performed with only one propeller in operation in order to verify the potential for the redundancy of the propulsion system and assuming a 30 reduction of the propeller thrust to account for ship motions unsteady conditions and propeller racing indicated that all feasible designs were able to achieve 12 kn speed in bow waves at a significant wave height of 4 0 m see fig 11 assessment results according to the propulsion criterion are plotted in this figure as a ratio of the required to the available propulsion power therefore values less than 1 0 indicate compliance with the criterion with both propellers in operation even with a 50 reduction of thrust all feasible designs still could achieve 12 kn speed at a significant wave height of 5 5 m the maximum wave height for which compliance with the steering criterion was obtained is shown in fig 12 once again the presented results are obtained with one propeller in operation and assuming a 30 reduction of the propeller thrust 4 3 optimisation of medium size ropax ship in the following results obtained from the optimisation of a larger vessel are presented the ship is designed for operation between piraeus and the island of rhodes with a roundtrip length of 514 sm a transport capacity of 1800 passengers 640 private cars and 130 trucks and a service speed of 27 kn the ship will be operated year round with a high season during summer of one month with seven roundtrips per week a medium season of three months with five roundtrips per week and a low season of six months with three roundtrips per week the corresponding occupancy rates of passengers cars and trucks that have been assumed for the calculation of annual revenues are 80 30 and 30 respectively for the high season 50 20 and 60 for the medium season and 40 12 and 60 for the low season the ship s earnings per trip are calculated assuming an income of 32 per passenger ticket price plus earnings from services to passengers on board 42 per car and 400 per truck the assumed oil prices are 220 for fo 420 for do and 950 for lo a lifetime of 25 years has been used over this lifetime an average inflation rate of 2 has been assumed for the oil prices an annual escalation rate of 4 has been applied for the above operational scenario several studies have been performed with the optimisation tool available in napa i e the optimisation manager using genetic algorithms the results presented in the following were obtained by varying the main dimensions within the following limits length bp from 155 0 m to 165 0 m beam from 25 2 m to 27 2 m and design draught from 6 1 m to 6 5 m a scatter diagram of the net present value as a function of length bp is presented in fig 13 only feasible designs are included the starting point of this optimisation the original design in this and the following diagrams is marked by a cross as shown in fig 13 the maximum npv is obtained with a length close to the upper limit of the design space the impact of the other main dimensions on npv was less significant scatter diagrams of npv vs the building cost dwt and propulsion power are shown in figs 14 16 the negative relationship between npv and dwt that was observed in the results for the small ropax is found also in this case see fig 15 once again the obtained results indicate that compliance with the eedi phase ii requirement was quite demanding as most of the unfeasible designs failed because of their inability to satisfy this criterion however 293 designs were identified capable of complying with phase ii requirement none of the obtained designs was able to fulfil the phase iii requirement see fig 17 compliance with the shopera criteria for manoeuvrability in adverse weather conditions was easily achieved also for this vessel calculations performed with only one propeller in operation and assuming a 30 reduction of the propeller thrust to account for ship motions unsteady conditions and propeller racing indicated that all feasible designs were able to achieve 12 kn speed at bow waves with a significant wave height of 6 5 m see fig 18 the maximum wave height for which compliance with the steering criterion was obtained is shown in fig 19 the results presented in this figure are obtained with one propeller in operation and assuming a 30 reduction of the propeller thrust 4 4 optimisation of 5000 teu containership results obtained from the optimisation of a 5000 teu containership are presented next the ship is assumed to operate on a route connecting the ports of caucedo santos buenos aires montevideo rio grande itajai santos rio de janeiro cartagena veracruz altamira houston and new orleans with a roundtrip length of 11 984 sm the ship s service speed is 21 5 kn earnings per trip are calculated assuming an average freight rate of 395 per teu the assumed oil prices are 246 for fo 470 for do and 1065 for lo a lifetime of 20 years has been used over this lifetime an average inflation rate of 2 has been assumed the results presented below were obtained by varying the following design variables number of bays defines length from 14 to 18 rows of containers defines breadth from 13 to 17 tiers in hold defines depth from 6 to 10 design draught from 10 0 m to 14 0 m block coefficient from 0 56 to 0 77 scatter diagrams of npv vs the length between perpendiculars building cost and dwt are shown in figs 20 22 the calculated margins with respect to the eedi phase 0 phase i and phase ii vs dwt are plotted in fig 23 compliance with the eedi

complying with all specified constrains and requirements including the eedi phase ii requirement and the shopera propulsion and steering criteria in addition five of these designs were able to comply with the eedi phase iii requirement 4 5 optimisation of 10 000 teu containership results obtained from the optimisation of a 10 000 teu containership will be presented next the ship is assumed to

dwt are shown in fig 27 and fig 28 respectively the calculated margins with respect to the eedi phase 0 phase i and phase ii vs dwt are plotted in fig 29 compliance with eedi phase ii requirement was set as a constraint therefore all the feasible designs that are presented in the following diagrams comply with eedi phase ii compliance with the shopera propulsion criterion vs dwt is shown in fig 30 a scatter diagram of eedi margin vs the margin of assessment according to the propulsion criterion ratio of the required to available delivered power is shown in fig 31 compliance with the shopera steering criterion quantified as the ratio of the required delivered power to satisfy the criterion to the available delivered power vs dwt is illustrated in fig 32 this optimisation study resulted in 156 feasible designs i e designs complying with all specified constrains and requirements including the eedi phase ii requirement and the shopera propulsion and steering criteria none of these designs was able to fulfil the phase iii requirement however many of these designs would be able to comply with phase iii requirement with a speed reduction of less than 1 kn the resulting speed is still greater than that of many contemporary slow steaming containerships of similar size 5 conclusions the conducted optimisations for two distinct vessel types namely ropax and containerships allow us some important conclusions which need to be taken into account when reviewing the eedi phase ii and iii requirements at imo mepc the results from the optimisation of the two ropax ships indicate that compliance with the eedi phase ii requirements is quite demanding as most of the unfeasible designs failed due to their inability to satisfy this criterion this is even more valid for the phase iii requirements which are more stringent than the phase ii requirements additional reduction of power by 10 in particular for the studied typical small ropax ship a number of 161 designs were identified capable of complying with phase ii requirement but only two of them were able to marginally fulfil the phase iii requirements for the larger ropax ship a number of 293 designs were identified capable of complying with phase ii requirements whereas no design was able to fulfil the phase iii requirements it is expected that systematic hullform and propeller optimisations the introduction of new technologies like the installation of energy saving devices and or waste heat recovery systems might help the designers to come up with future designs of improved efficiency ropax ships without opting for significant reduction of the service speed noting that reduction in service speed may not be possible according to the market demands note that when using the current parametric model it was necessary to reduce the ship s service speed by about 10 in order to obtain a significant number of designs in compliance with eedi phase iii requirement for the small ropax ship this meant a reduction of the service speed from 23 8 kn down to 21 6 kn note that in contrast to what was observed for tankers and bulk carriers international maritime organization 2016a compliance with the shopera minimum propulsion criterion for safe operation in adverse weather conditions was easily achieved by the ropax ships even by the designs with reduced propulsion power that comply with eedi phase iii requirements this of course was expected since ropax ships are highly powered in comparison with other types of ships of equal displacement and are equipped with controllable pitch propellers which allows using full installed power under high load the optimisation study on the containerships resulted in a series of valuable design alternatives complying with eedi phase ii requirements as well as with the shopera propulsion and steering criteria compliance with eedi phase iii requirements was achieved by five designs in the case of the small containership while in the case of the larger containership this could be achieved with a speed reduction of less than 1 kn with the ships still being able to comply with the shopera propulsion and steering criteria even with this speed reduction the resulting speed of these designs is still greater than that of many contemporary slow steaming containerships of similar size in contrast to what was observed for tankers and bulk carriers the smaller containership complied easier with the steering criterion than with the propulsion criterion for the larger containership optimisation ships particularly those with dwt around 90 000 tonnes are exhibiting similar margins with respect to both criteria these conclusions agree with the analysis of the statistics of accidents related to insufficient manoeuvrability in adverse conditions ventikos et al 2015 although roro ships are involved in a significant portion 26 of relevant accidents and have the second largest rate of relevant accidents per ship per year after general cargo ships the relevant accidents with ropax ships happen almost exclusively in ports usually contact with the pier during berthing or unberthing and only very insignificant portion of accidents happen en route containerships account for only 4 of the relevant accidents and are the safest ship type from those considered in terms of the number of accidents per ship per year because they are sufficiently powered and especially larger ships have less frequent port calls than other ship types as for ropax ships most of the relevant accidents with containerships happen in ports some accidents happen in restricted waters and almost no accidents happen en route these results suggest that insufficient installed power is not relevant as a reason of accidents for ropax and containerships and that the relevant scenario of accidents for these vessels is the limited speed manoeuvrability in ports the outcome of a large number of case studies carried out in the shopera project for all the ship types within eedi framework also supports the conclusions of this study indicating that with the exception of tankers bulk carriers and probably some types of general cargo vessels all other ship types can fulfil the requirements of phase iii of eedi implementation as presently formulated and at the same time satisfy the proposed criteria for manoeuvrability in adverse weather conditions with the proposed standards however none of the ropax ships used in the case studies could satisfy the eedi phase iii requirements without speed reduction in short the current eedi criteria and reference lines appear not problematic for future containerships whereas there is an urgent need for a critical review of the eedi requirements for ropax ships which appear to be less realistic this may be also related to the controversial definition and way of calculation of the eedi index for ropax and pax ships alissafaki and papanikolaou 2016 in addition simply reducing the service speed to comply with the eedi regulatory framework is not a valid option for ropax ships because the market demands are asking for high transportation speed comfort and safety of passengers crew and roro cargo this is also the background for the concerns expressed recently by the international passenger ferry interferry industry at imo mepc international maritime organization 2016b c and d and 2017b calling for a rationalisation of eedi requirements in the frame of the planned phase iii review of the eedi regulations acknowledgments the work presented in this paper was partly

23294,the twin screw fully appended onr tumblehome ship model is numerically studied for the standard 10 10 zigzag maneuver simulations are carried out using naoe foam sjtu a cfd solver developed on open source platform openfoam overset grid technique and 6dof module with a hierarchy of bodies are applied to solve the motions of the free running ship with twin rotating propellers and turning rudders the self propulsion point is using the constant value obtained by the previous cfd simulation of the twin screw self propelled ship in calm water simulations of the standard zigzag maneuver in both calm water and different incident waves are considered the present cfd results agree well with the available experimental measurement for both ship motions and the main parameters of zigzag maneuver this indicates that the direct simulations for ship zigzag maneuver in waves utilizing present methods are feasible and reliable in addition it is found that unsteady effects of the hydrodynamic loads on the free running ship during zigzag maneuver in waves is noticeable furthermore flow visualizations in different incident waves are presented so as to give a better understanding of the wave influences on free running ship maneuver keywords zigzag maneuver in waves twin screw ship rans overset grid method naoe foam sjtu solver 1 introduction ship maneuver is closely related to the navigational safety when considering ship maneuver in waves it will further strongly interact with the seakeeping performance thus making the evaluation of ship maneuverability more complicated and difficult recently the research of maneuvering in waves is becoming increasingly popular consequently a specialist committee which is responsible for maneuvering in waves is established by the 28th international towing tank conference ittc 2017a generally ship maneuver experiences large low frequency motions in calm water while in waves it encounters high frequency wave induced motions free running ship maneuver in most cases is conducted by executing rudders along with rotating propellers and it becomes more complicated when evaluating the performance of fully appended ship in waves as one of the most difficult problems in the research of ship hydrodynamics the accurate prediction of ship maneuvering performance during free running motion through either experimental or numerical method is still challenging traditional experimental test in a conventional towing tank or wave basin still plays an important role in predicting the ship maneuvering and seakeeping behaviors however the increasing demand of applying self propelled ships when conducting free running ship model tests also proposes a higher requirement of the measurement facility for instance extensive experiments have been done at the iowa institute of hydraulic research iihr wave basin for free running ship maneuver in both calm water and waves araki et al 2012 sanada et al 2013 which provided plenty of reliable experimental data sprenger et al 2017 has done turning circle tests in marintek wave basin within the shopera project however the high cost of the experimental measurements and the complexity in local flow measurement still hold back its application and this is the reason why the experiment measurements are only required at the final design stage besides the experiment measurements several numerical approaches have been proposed to study the ship maneuvering and seakeeping problems system based simulation sbs sakamoto et al 2012 simonsen et al 2012 is a traditional method for modeling ship maneuvering motion however sbs require a large number of data from experiments or computational fluid dynamics cfd simulated results to predict maneuvering performance therefore the prediction is strongly dependent on the available database potential theory fonseca and guedes soares 1998 pérez arribas 2007 can be very fast to give predicted results for ship motion in waves unfortunately since both sbs method and potential theory rely on the simpler mathematical modeling by not directly simulating the moving appendages it is nearly impossible to give reliable and accurate results of the unsteady local flows around the fully appended hull with complex geometries such as rotating propellers and turning rudders previously people use mathematical models to predict the maneuvering motion at the same time they calculate the wave induced motions according to the potential theory zhang and zou 2015 applied the 4 degrees of freedom 4dof maneuvering modeling group mmg model to solve ship maneuvering motion and they determined the high frequency wave induced motions by solving a linearized boundary value problem bvp in time domain nonetheless there is a large discrepancy between their predicted results and experiment data which shows that the potential theory actually cannot accurately describe the maneuvering characters in waves seo and kim 2011 applied a similar approach to model the maneuvering motion and wave induced ship response their results show reasonable agreement but less accuracy therefore cfd methods are preferable in the predictions of ship maneuvering and seakeeping performances direct cfd simulations are able to provide accurate prediction of hydrodynamic locals and specific local flow details since they can well resolve the complex flows around the hull and its appendages but due to the high computational cost and complex numerical models only few free running simulations have been performed by cfd approach and the number is even less for the free running in waves so far the most reliable and robust approach to simulate free running ship maneuver is the dynamic overset grid method coupled with full 6dof motion solver with a hierarchy of bodies this approach was firstly introduced to ship and ocean engineering for cfd simulations of self propelled ships carrica et al 2010 castro et al 2011 without rudder with the dynamic overset grid technique simulations of ship maneuvers with active rudders became feasible carrica et al 2012 simulated the turn and zigzag maneuver by using a reynolds average navier stokes rans approach where the deflection of rudders were achieved by the dynamic overset grid technique with a hierarchy of hull and rudders while the rotating propellers were simplified by body forces furthermore carrica et al 2012 performed maneuver simulations in waves by using the simplified model and found that the main discrepancy between the cfd and experiments can possibly be tracked to the simplistic propeller model mofidi and carrica 2014 presented the direct simulation of free running zigzag maneuver for a single screw kriso container ship kcs where standard 10 10 zigzag maneuver and modified 15 1 zigzag maneuver with actual rotating propeller and turning rudder were computed in calm water the results were promising when compared with the experiment although the authors emphasized that the computational cost in direct calculating free running ships was still very high carrica et al 2016 further extended the direct simulation of zigzag maneuver of kcs ship model in shallow water with rather low approaching speed the cfd results agreed well with the experiment data for most hydrodynamic quantities broglia et al 2015 and dubbioso et al 2016 used a similar overset grid approach to simulate the turning circle maneuver in calm water by using a finite volume method cfd solver the ship model was a fully appended twin screw vessel with a single rudder the twin rotating propellers were simulated by an actuator disk model which was modified to account for oblique flow effects further analysis for the distribution of forces and moments on the hull and appendages was done to obtain the hydrodynamic behavior in turning tests recently dubbioso et al 2017 and muscari et al 2017 conducted cfd investigations of propeller bearing loads in steady and transient maneuvers using overset grid approach shen et al 2014 2015 implemented the dynamic overset grid module to the open source cfd software openfoam and presented some applications to the turn and zigzag maneuvering simulations for benchmark ship models such as kcs kriso very large crude carrier kvlcc2 us navy combatant dtmb5415 unlike previous studies the unstructured overset grid technique was introduced which showed impressive flexibility and efficiency of the mesh generation for complex geometries their results agreed well with the experimental data indicating that the fully discretized model with overset grid method was feasible even for the relatively coarse unstructured grids wang et al 2016 used the same approach to simulate the self propulsion and turning circle maneuver of the fully appended twin screw office of naval research onr tumblehome model in calm water the predicted ship motions for the maneuvering conditions agreed well with the available experimental data most of previous studies on ship maneuver with free running ship models only focus on the calm water conditions and most of them only used the simplified propeller model which cannot accurately capture the unsteady local flows in particular with such a model the effects of the rotating propeller are missing however a precise simulation of ship maneuvering in waves inevitably has to consider large amplitude ship motions with more violent free surface deformation and more notable hull propeller rudder interactions which is more difficult than the simulation in calm water wang et al 2017 extended the free running simulations from calm water to waves for a course keeping problem and showed the capability of cfd with dynamic overset grid in predicting ship maneuvering in waves in the present paper more emphasis is put on the free running zigzag maneuver under various wave conditions for a fully appended twin screw ship the motivation of this study is to find out whether it is reliable for the numerical computations of free running zigzag maneuver in waves and to study the wave effects on the ship maneuver this paper is organized as follows the computational methods are presented in the second section the simulation designs including the geometry model test conditions and grid distribution are described in the third section the simulation results and discussions are presented in the fourth section finally conclusions from the present study are made 2 computational methods the computations are performed with the ship hydrodynamics cfd solver naoe foam sjtu developed on an open source platform openfoam it is easy to achieve the free running ship maneuvering motion see section 2 1 since this solver has the dynamic overset grid capability and includes a full 6dof motion module with a hierarchy of bodies in general naoe foam sjtu solves the reynolds averaged navier stokes rans equations for unsteady turbulent flows around complex geometries for capturing the free surface elevation a volume of fluid vof approach with bounded compression technique is used berberović et al 2009 the turbulence features are modeled by a blended k ω k ε shear stress transport sst turbulence model menter et al 2003 wall functions are used to model the velocity gradient effects near the wall the solver has been extensively validated on large amount of ship hydrodynamic cases e g ship resistance zha et al 2015 seakeeping shen and wan 2013 2016 wang and wan 2016 and maneuvering shen et al 2015 wang et al 2016 2017 the computational domain is discretized by multi unstructured overlapping grids and the finite volume method fvm is used to transform the equations from physical space into computational space besides the pressure implicit split operator piso algorithm issa 1986 is applied for pressure velocity coupling in solving governing equations in addition several built in discretization schemes in openfoam are used to solve the partial differential equations pde the implicit euler scheme is used for temporal discretization second order total variation diminishing tvd scheme is used to discretize the convection term in momentum equation a central differencing scheme is applied for diffusion terms 2 1 dynamic overset grid and maneuvering control the dynamic overset grid technology and full 6dof motion method with a hierarchy of bodies are crucial to simulate the free running ship maneuver including complex geometries with independent motions e g rotating propellers and turning rudders generally overset grid includes two or more blocks of overlapping structured or unstructured grids and the value of a flow variable in the fringe cell is obtained by interpolation from the donor cells in the present work suggar library noack et al 2009 is utilized to obtain the overset connectivity at run time more details about the overset grid implementation in openfoam can be found in shen et al 2015 and wang et al 2017 with dynamic overset grid 6dof motion solver is incorporated with a hierarchy of bodies which allows the ship and its appendages propellers rudders etc to move simultaneously fig 1 gives a general description of overset grids for ship and its appendages with the coordinate systems for motion controls during the calculation the ship moves according to the 6dof equations the propellers and rudders follow the ship with the same forward speed but can translate or rotate in their own systems based on special control mechanism when handling with the motion of overlapping grids in computations the propeller or rudder grid blocks taken to be the children level first rotate or turn according their control laws then they move together with the ship grid block parent level according to the ship motion obtained by 6dof equations finally the background grid which connects the ship to farfield boundary follows the ship with surge sway and yaw motion so that the free surface stays horizontal two coordinate systems are used to solve the 6dof equations based on euler angles the flow equations are solved in the inertial system earth fixed system and the calculated forces and moments are then transformed to the non inertial system ship fixed system where the rigid body equations are solved in the present work the 6dof motion equations are solved using a semi implicit approach where the solution is given by iterations to fulfil convergence and more detailed information of 6dof motion solver can be found in shen et al 2015 regarding the maneuvering control this study adopts the open loop of feedback controllers under specified requirement of desired ship motion such as the rotational speed of propeller heading control and roll control etc for zigzag maneuver the ship is moving forward with nominal constant speed and the rudder is executed to a specified maximum rudder angle at the maximum rudder rate then the ship responses with a turning motion due to the rudder deflection which can be used to access the ship maneuverability as for the zigzag maneuver simulated in the present work the rudder deflection for the standard 10 10 zigzag maneuver follows 1 δ t min k t 10 max k t 10 min k t 10 t 1 t t 2 t 2 t t 3 t 3 t t 4 where δ t is the rudder angle which is positive when the rudder turns to the starboard side k is the maximum rudder rate which is provided by the model test t i is the ith time for rudder execution in addition fig 2 demonstrates the main parameters in a standard 10 10 zigzag maneuver such as the first and second overshoot angle osa of the ship the excess angle between the maximum minimum ship s heading and the check heading angle the period time to complete one zigzag cycle etc 2 2 wave generation in the present simulations the computational domain namely the background grid is moving forward with the ship horizontal motion therefore the velocity inlet boundary condition for wave generation may be not appropriate since the boundary may deviate from its original position in order to generate desired wave environment with the moving computational domain the open source toolbox waves2foam jacobsen et al 2012 is used for all the computations the methodology adopts the relaxation zones to avoid reflections of waves from outlet boundaries and further to avoid waves reflected internally in the computational domain to interfere with the wave maker boundaries the flow parameters such as velocity u and volume of fraction α can be blended by a relaxation factor γ r the details of the relaxation technique can be found in jacobsen et al 2012 the schematic of the computational domain and wave generation zone is shown in fig 3 a frozen type relaxation zone is used in the present simulations so that the wave generation zone can move with the computational domain this guarantees that the waves can propagate to the area around ship model no matter how the computational domain rotates or translates in the present work the first order stokes wave theory with specified wave parameters is adopted 3 simulation design 3 1 geometry model onr tumblehome model 5613 is a preliminary design of a modern surface combatant fully appended with skeg and bilge keels in addition the model is equipped with twin rudders shafts and twin propellers with propeller shaft brackets it is one of the benchmark ship models in 2015 tokyo cfd workshop in ship hydrodynamics and has extensive experimental data the geometry of onr tumblehome ship model is shown in fig 4 and main particulars are listed in table 1 3 2 grid distribution the computational domain is divided into six parts according to the motion level of overset grid topology one for the background grid one for the grid around the ship hull two for the grids around the two propellers on starboard side and port side respectively two parts for the two rudders for the overset grids arrangement the background domain extends to 1 5 l w l x 3 5 l w l 1 5 l w l y 1 5 l w l 1 0 l w l z 0 5 l w l and the hull domain is much smaller with a range of 0 15 l w l x 1 2 l w l 0 13 l w l y 0 13 l w l 0 2 l w l z 0 2 l w l the detailed overset grid arrangements are shown in fig 5 a unstructured grids are generated by the pre processing utilities provided by openfoam overset grid topology around solid surfaces is shown in fig 5b near wall grid spacing is designed to meet the requirement of turbulence model using wall functions where the y is around 60 the total grid number for the free running simulations is around 7 million where the background grid varies in different simulation cases the motion of each part grid which follows the control laws of free running ship maneuver is discussed in section 2 1 as for the boundary conditions of the computational domain the inlet and relaxation zone as shown in fig 3 is used to generate desired waves the conditions of velocity and volume of fraction are imposed by the specified first order stokes wave theory the farfield boundaries are identical with zero velocity and zero gradient of pressure the surfaces of the moving bodies are non slip and the outlet is specified by the downstream boundaries once all the grids are generated a preprocessing step requires setting up and running suggar with appropriate boundary conditions with the aim of checking the validity of interpolations among different grid blocks it should be emphasized that artificial gaps between propellers and shafts rudders and rudder roots are reserved to obtain enough fringe donor cells for the overlapping grid interpolation the positions and geometries of the rudders and propellers remain unchanged and only the shafts and rudder roots are slightly adjusted to keep the gaps another procedure before the simulations started is a simple hydrostatic computation which is used to obtain the longitudinal location of the center of buoyancy the displacement and the static wetted area of the ship in even keel condition with the discretized computational model the resulting displacement of the ship model is 0 07 larger than the value used in the experiment the small deviation is due to the spatial discretization error of the geometry 3 3 test conditions all the simulations conditions are defined based on two non dimensional number the reynold number re u 0 l w l υ and the froude number f r u 0 g l w l where υ is the kinematic viscosity g is the gravitational acceleration all the computations of the free running ship maneuver are at the same approaching speed of 1 11 m s in model scale corresponding to fr 0 20 according to the model tests the self propelled ship was set to advance at model point with full 6dof motion in both calm water and regular waves in cfd simulations the self propulsion test must be performed to obtain the self propulsion point and then the model point is used for the free running ship maneuver simulations this work has already been done in the previous work wang et al 2017 and the cfd results of the rotational speed of twin propeller is 8 819 resolutions per second rps which is reasonable when compared with the experiment data of 8 97 rps in the present calculations of zigzag maneuver in waves the same rotational speed of twin propellers obtained by the previous work is applied and is kept constant during the maneuver simulations using a fixed rotational speed in the free running ship maneuver simulations can reduce the difficulty and uncertainties and help cfd researcher to validate their numerical approaches since it is quite challenging for cfd simulations to repeat exactly the same conditions as in the experiment the details of test cases are shown in table 2 zigzag maneuver simulations are firstly performed under calm water conditions due to its simplicity then five wave conditions are considered with the combination of three wave lengths and three wave steepness 4 numerical simulations and discussions all the calculations are conducted on the hpc cluster center in computational marine hydrodynamics lab cmhl shanghai jiao tong university each node consists of 2 cpus with 20 cores per node and 64 gb accessible memory intel xeon e5 2680v2 2 8 ghz 4 1 grid convergence study according to the literature involving simulations of free running ship maneuver with dynamic overset grid the grid refinement will strongly affect the quality of overlapping grids especially for the complex hull propeller rudder system where the gaps between each component are very small as a result a grid convergence study for such complicated problem is rarely done by the researchers in the present work open water calculations with simpler overset grid arrangements are employed for the grid convergence study the open water case is a proper candidate for the grid convergence study with the fact that the computations for rotating propeller are crucial for the simulations for self propelled ships open water calculation follows the experimental setup available at tokyo 2015 cfd workshop where the rate of resolution of propeller is fixed with value of 8 97 rps the computational domain is divided into two parts i e background grid and propeller grid as shown in fig 6 a during the calculation the propeller grid rotates with the rotating propeller while the background grid moves forward with the advancing velocity three grids with a refinement ratio of 2 in each direction are used for grid convergence study which follows the recommended procedures and guidelines ittc 2017b result changes between medium fine ε 21 s 2 s 1 and coarse medium ε 32 s 3 s 2 are used to define the convergence ratio r g 2 r g ε 21 ε 32 and rg is used to determine convergence condition where s 1 s 2 and s 3 correspond to solutions with fine medium and coarse grid respectively three convergence conditions are possible 3 i 0 r g 1 m o n o t o n i c c o n v e r g e n c e i i r g 0 o s c i l l a t o r y c o n v e r g e n c e i i i r g 1 d i v e r g e n c e for condition iii grid convergence study cannot be estimated hydrodynamic parameters k t k q and η are used to estimate the grid convergence the propulsion coefficients mentioned above are defined as 4 j v a n d p 5 k t t ρ n 2 d p 4 6 k q q ρ n 2 d p 5 7 η j k t 2 π k q where t and q are the propeller thrust and torque d p is the diameter of propeller n is the rps and v a is the advancing speed grid distribution around propeller for medium grid is shown in fig 6b for all three grids the resulting y varies from 40 to 120 with the consideration of wall function are applied near wall the grid convergence study is carried out at j 1 0 for the open water case with respect to the most approximate condition to the propeller at self propulsion and zigzag maneuver simulation during the computation the time step was set to a rather small value of δ t 0 0005 s in order to resolve the transient flow due to the rotating propeller which corresponds to approximately 1 5 of propeller rotation per time step and the resultant courant number is around 0 1 20 processors are assigned to calculate the open water case in which 19 processors are for the flow calculation and another processor is used for suggar calculation it costs approximately 30 55 and 122 h to complete the computations for coarse medium and fine grid cases respectively table 3 summarizes the results of the grid convergence study for open water calculations it can be seen from table 3 that the thrust coefficient k t shows monotonic convergence with r g 0 078 and the predicted value of k t is highly accurate with errors lower than 1 7 the torque coefficient k q is overestimated by all three grids with errors up to 9 8 and the efficiency η is underestimated with largest error of 10 5 both torque coefficient and efficiency show monotonic convergence with r g 0 7916 and 0 5915 respectively note that the grid size of propellers in free running zigzag maneuver simulation is larger than medium grid but smaller than the fine grid this indicates that the propeller grid used in the free running ship maneuver simulation will slightly change the numerical results 4 2 zigzag maneuver in calm water for the simulations of free running ship maneuver in both calm water and waves 40 processors are adopted in which 38 processors are for the flow calculation and the other 2 processors are used for suggar calculation the time step was set to δ t 0 0005 s which is according to the previous open water calculations it costs approximately 325 h of clock time with about 39000 time steps to complete the computation in calm water while 347 h for the cases in waves the simulation case of standard 10 10 zigzag maneuver in calm water is used to validate the present cfd method due to its simplicity furthermore the calm water computation can give the guidance of numerical setup for the free running ship maneuver computations in waves and most importantly to be a useful reference for evaluating the wave effects as mentioned in section 3 3 the rotational speed of propellers is set fixed with constant value 8 819 rps and the rudder is controlled by an autopilot shown in eqn 1 the initial flow state of the zigzag maneuver computation is from the stable state of self propulsion condition then the ship model is released in 6dof with specified rudder control to achieve the zigzag maneuver motion fig 7 shows the time histories of ship yaw motion and rudder angle for the 10 10 zigzag maneuver in calm water simulation the comparison of main parameters for standard zigzag maneuver in calm water is depicted in table 4 good agreement between the cfd results and experimental measurements by experimental fluid dynamics efd is achieved in terms of the time to execute rudder the overshoot angle and the period to complete one zigzag turn despite the overall agreement the overshoot angle is underestimated by 21 6 1st osa and 18 1 2nd osa while the time to check yaw as well as the period is overestimated by the simulation the discrepancies can be explained by the different settings between the present simulations and the experiment unlike the experiments the simulation adopts a constant rotational speed of propellers which directly affects the approaching speed during the zigzag maneuver and further leads to the discrepancy of the time to check yaw and the period more differences between the cfd and efd can be found in the time variations of ship motions and speeds as shown in fig 8 the initial state of the experiment differs a lot from the simulations especially for the ship speeds which makes sense for the discrepancies in the two conditions apparently there is some uncertainty on how accurately the nominal approach speed has been achieved in the experiments instead the time is measured from the start of the efd maneuver and the cfd results are shifted a small amount to match the first rudder execution from port to starboard after the large rudder deflection the transient due to different initial conditions between cfd and efd is weakened for the time histories of yaw rate it can be obviously seen that the predicted yaw rate is smaller at the turning points which lead to the underestimation of overshoot angle shown in fig 7 the main difference for the roll and drift angle is the phase shift compared with the measurements where the predicted results are delayed in time the predicted peak value for roll angle is 2 43 compared with the measurement data of 3 20 though little discrepancies exist the present cfd results for the zigzag maneuver in calm water is promising compared with the available experimental data and can lay a good foundation for the numerical simulations of free running zigzag maneuver in waves fig 9 illustrates the time histories of thrust and torque during the zigzag simulation in calm water both thrust and torque are evidently related to the ship motions and rudder execution for instance when the ship experiences rudder execution the thrust and torque of the rotating propeller will show significant difference which is mainly due to the large flow disturbance around the propeller caused by the rudder the different behavior of port and starboard side propellers can be better understood through the local flow shown later besides high frequency fluctuations in thrust and torque that correlate to the blade passage frequency are presented which can be obviously seen in the viewport the thrust and torque curves for both propellers can give a better illustration of the propulsion performance during the zigzag maneuver in calm water the time histories of predicted rudder resistance and lateral rudder force are shown in fig 10 every time the rudder is executed there is a peak rudder resistance and lateral force another feature is that both the resistance and lateral force show alternate behaviors at the beginning the ship is advancing straight forward and the hydrodynamic forces are almost the same and symmetric after the execution of rudders the ship response to the corresponding rudder force and making highly difference of the wake flow around twin rudders due to the auto pilot of zigzag maneuver the rudder force changes alternatingly as shown in fig 10 to help understand the hydrodynamic performance of twin propellers and rudders shown in figs 9 and 10 the wake region around twin propellers and rudders on a horizontal plane is shown in fig 11 four typical time instants a b c d as shown in fig 10 are adopted to analyze the results it is obvious that the inflow for twin propellers show much difference at different time and oblique inflow occurs frequently which lead to the highly difference for the thrust and torque variation for the rudder forces it is found that at instant a and b the flow around the port side rudder obviously is much more complex than that on the starboard side this well explains the larger resistance and lateral force from instant a to b for port side rudder as for instant c and d the flow field shows the opposite features and the starboard side rudder experiences larger resistance and lateral force the flow visualization can give a general description of the hydrodynamic behavior for twin propellers and rudders 4 3 zigzag maneuver in waves the simulation of free running zigzag maneuver in waves mainly involves two parts first is the same wave steepness with three different wave lengths which follows the same conditions as in the experiments the other one is the same wave height with three different wave lengths as shown in table 2 the former case is simulated to investigate the effect of different wave length on the free running ship maneuver and to validate the cfd results by comparing with the available experimental data the latter one is conducted to study the influences of the wave height on the maneuvering performances this section firstly presents the motion performances of the zigzag maneuver in different waves where time histories of ship motions speeds yaw rate and rudder deflection are discussed in detail then the forces during the maneuvering simulation is used to investigate the hydrodynamic performances for free running ship maneuver in waves where the ship resistance the propulsion performance thrust and torque and the forces on twin rudders in different waves are presented finally detailed flow visualizations e g wave elevation wake profiles and vortical structures are given to further explain the hydrodynamic effects on ship maneuvering performance under different incident wave conditions 4 3 1 motions figs 12 14 show the time histories of yaw and rudder angle in different incident waves with the same wave steepness of 0 02 the cfd results show an overall agreement to the experiment measurements for all wave conditions though some discrepancies are observed for both yaw and rudder angle same as in the calm water case the predicted period to complete one zigzag turn is slightly overestimated for all the three wave conditions detailed quantities such as overshoot angles osa and period of a standard zigzag maneuver are listed in table 5 both first 1st and second 2nd overshoot angles are under estimated from 11 9 to 15 8 while the absolute error is small according to the value of yaw at time of overshoot angle 2 1 3 1 fig 15 demonstrates the first and second overshoot angles of three different wave lengths where the total trend matches very well with the measurements the parameters of period to complete one zigzag turn can be accurately predicted with an error varies from 0 56 to 1 54 figs 16 18 show the time histories of ship motions yaw rate instantaneous ship speed and drift angle under different wave conditions the predicted results shown as solid lines are compared with the experimental data represented by circles cfd predictions match well with the measurements except for the large discrepancies at the beginning which have been discussed in the calm water case the high frequency wave induced motions and low frequency maneuvering motion can be observed in the time variation data where the short wave indicates the smallest motion response the wave induced oscillations in longer incident waves λ l w l 1 0 λ l w l 1 2 are significant for the heave pitch drift yaw rate and ship instantaneous speed in order to characterize the wave effects on the free running zigzag maneuvers the fourier series fs shen and wan 2013 tezdogan et al 2015 are used to analyze the ship motions and velocities due to waves the peak value of roll motions 1st harmonic fs term of heave and pitch taken as the mean fluctuation amplitude and the mean value of ship speed represented by the 0th harmonic fs term are listed in table 6 in addition the comparison between time histories of ship motions and velocities in calm water and waves are shown in fig 19 as shown in figs 17 and 18 and table 6 the heave and pitch motions quickly reach an apparently periodic wave induced motions after the waves are fully generated in the computational domain the heave and pitch motions under different wave conditions considered in fig 19 are localized to a smaller time scale with the consideration of better understanding the wave length effects on the ship performance the mean amplitude of the oscillations of both heave and pitch motions represented by the 1st harmonic fs shows strong relations with the wave lengths where the amplitudes increase with the increasing of wave length in addition the heave and pitch motions can be enlarged significantly when the wave length is around one ship length for example the mean amplitude of heave in waves of λ l w l 1 0 and λ l w l 1 2 can be increased by 913 6 and 1227 6 respectively the phenomenon can be observed from both the predicted results and the measurements the cfd predictions of roll angle match the total trend with the measurements with the peak values slightly underestimated the drift angle which is defined as the angle between the axis of a ship when turning and the tangent to the path on which it is turning is usually used to characterized the turning quality as shown in the figures the fluctuations of measured drift angle due to the incident waves is larger than that of the cfd results this indicates that the ship model is easier to turn in the experiments than the computations which can explain the under estimation of the overshoot angles shown in table 5 as for the yaw rate the present simulation results are promising compared with the available data where both the low frequency maneuvering rate and the high frequency wave induced rate are accurately resolved the speed loss is a main character for ship advancing in waves and it can be obtained by the ship instantaneous speed shown in figs 16 18 the mean value of the speed is using the 0th harmonic term of fs which is listed in table 6 the speed loss in waves of λ l w l 0 5 λ l w l 1 0 λ l w l 1 2 are 6 76 21 85 and 19 65 respectively the comparisons of time histories of the ship instantaneous speed are shown in fig 19 the case with largest wave length undergoes the largest amplitude of fluctuations while the case with wave length identical to the ship length experiences the largest speed loss the ship instantaneous speed is closely related to the period to complete one zigzag turn hence there is an obvious phase shift for the results of roll yaw yaw rate corresponding to the speed loss the wave conditions of λ l w l 1 0 experiences the longest period 20 0388s compared with 15 7565s of λ l w l 0 5 and 19 4279s of λ l w l 1 2 above all cfd results of ship speeds follow the behavior of efd fairly well even though there is some uncertainty on how accurately the nominal approach speed has been achieved in the experiments apart from the free running zigzag maneuver in waves with the same wave steepness the simulations are also conducted for different wave heights of the three wave lengths described in table 2 these conditions are used to investigate wave height effects on the free running zigzag maneuver fig 20 illustrates heave pitch roll yaw instantaneous ship speeds and yaw rate with different wave heights but the same wave length during the simulation time table 7 summarizes the peak values of roll angle overshoot angles the mean value of the amplitude of heave and pitch as well as the mean value of the ship speeds the amplitudes of heave and pitch motions obtained by the 1st harmonic fs term show consistent growth with the wave height for instance in the short wave cases the wave steepness of 0 04 experiences almost twice than the wave steepness of 0 02 in general the different wave heights for the same wave length means the wave contains different energy therefore when encountering the steeper wave it costs more power for ship to advance forward consequently the mean value of ship speed obtained by the 0th harmonic fs term of instantaneous ship speed is larger with the lower wave height meanwhile the speed loss in short waves are 6 76 and 11 94 for the wave steepness of 0 02 and 0 04 respectively and in waves of λ l w l 1 2 the speed loss are 16 19 and 19 65 with wave steepness of 0 0167 and 0 02 respectively due to the different performance with the speeds the discrepancies shown in the time histories of roll yaw and yaw rate in fig 20 are mainly the time delay under higher wave condition where the wave induced amplitude of oscillations are also larger than that in lower wave case 4 3 2 forces the hydrodynamic loads acting on the fully appended free running ship can directly reflect the motion behavior during the zigzag maneuver in waves at the beginning the forces in the case of the wave length equals ship length are adopted to analyze the hydrodynamic performance fig 21 presents the longitudinal forces on ship hull propeller and rudder where the propeller force or rudder force are the resultant force on the twin propeller or the twin rudder respectively as can be seen from the figure the ship resistance takes the main part of the total resistance and the large fluctuations lead to the oscillations of ship speeds shown in fig 17 to further analyze the propulsion performance the predicted propulsion forces are presented in fig 22 during the simulation time both thrust and torque are evidently related to the ship motions high frequency rudder execution low frequency and wave frequency medium frequency different from the calm water case the thrust and torque curves show significant fluctuations with wave frequency and the mean value increase considerably wave induced fluctuations can be as large as the fluctuation due to low frequency maneuvering motion high frequency fluctuations in thrust and torque that correlate to the blade passage frequency can also be captured which can be seen in the partial enlarged view the thrust and torque curves for both side propellers can give a better description of the propulsion performance during the zigzag maneuver in waves where the local flow around twin propellers and rudders can change a lot due to the rudder deflection and ship maneuvering motion forces acting on twin rudders during zigzag maneuver in waves are depicted in fig 23 compared with the calm water case both rudder resistance and lateral force follow the behavior of the trend while the fluctuations due to the incident waves are remarkable the force amplitude induced by the waves can as large as the force due to rudder execution which indicates that the wave effect is of great importance during the zigzag motion cfd simulations of free running ship maneuver in waves take most of the effects into account such as viscous flow resistance rudder forces propeller loads wave effects etc as a result the present simulations can capture the unsteady behavior of the hydrodynamic loads the detailed information of the forces acting on the twin screw fully append ship presented above can give a better understanding of the hydrodynamic behavior for the free running ship maneuver in waves however the lack of experiment data for forces and moments of ship hull propellers and rudders prevent the validation and so this phenomenon needs further investigations apart from the wave condition of λ l w l 1 0 discussed above the hydrodynamic behavior with different wave lengths are also compared to analyze the wave length effects on the free running zigzag maneuver fig 24 shows the time histories of ship resistance with three different wave lengths but the same wave steepness 0 02 fast fourier transform fft of the time histories of the ship resistance is used to identify the main dominant frequencies associated with the unsteady behavior as can be seen from the results of fft the dominant frequency for all the conditions are the wave encounter frequency a secondary frequency is detected for the waves of λ l w l 1 0 and λ l w l 1 2 in which the crest is most evident for the case of λ l w l 1 0 this phenomenon can also be observed in the time histories of the ship resistance which is mainly due to the nonlinearity of the free running ship in waves as maybe occurred in most occasions the nonlinear effect is caused by the ship motions or so called radiation effects but in this case the frequencies of ship motions are not correlated with the secondary frequency the flow visualizations show that wave breaking occurs when ship bow experiences the wave crest and a second wave crest appears before the incident wave crest this strong nonlinear phenomenon leads to the high frequency effect show in the time histories of ship resistance fig 25 presents the total thrust and rudder resistance in different waves by adding the port side and starboard side value similar to the ship resistance the fluctuation amplitude of total thrust and rudder resistance is larger when the wave length increases the rudder resistance experiences the transition when the rudder executes which has been discussed in the calm water case in order to quantitatively analyze the wave length effects on the hydrodynamic loads on the free running ship maneuver the fs is used for the comparisons for the ship resistance total thrust and rudder resistance shown in table 8 the mean value of the ship resistance and total thrust for waves of λ l w l 1 0 is almost the same with waves of λ l w l 1 2 while the mean amplitude of fluctuations obtained by the 1st harmonic fs term can be enlarged by 80 5 and 66 1 in the longer wave length case apart from the hydrodynamic loads with different wave lengths the time histories of ship resistance with different wave heights are shown in figs 26 and 27 it is clear that the wave height can significantly enlarge the ship resistance which will further lead to the larger speed loss discussed in section 4 3 1 fft analysis is also applied for the time histories of the ship resistance under different wave conditions to identify the main dominant frequencies associated with the unsteady behavior as can be seen from the results of fft fig 26 the dominant frequency is slightly smaller in larger wave height condition it can be concluded that the wave height effects on the free running ship maneuver are the hydrodynamic load amplitude and the dominant frequency 4 3 3 flow visualizations as mentioned in the introduction experiments still play an important role in the research of free running ship maneuver especially in waves nevertheless cfd approaches are becoming more and more attractive with its improvements of the capabilities and the large amount of data which can provide detailed visualization of the flow field fig 28 illustrates the four snapshots of free surface and vortical structures depicted by iso surfaces of q 100 q criterion is the second invariant of the velocity gradient tensor around twin rotating propellers and moving rudders during one encounter wave period with wave length equals ship length the time instants are chosen from 13 95s to 14 67s with respect to the simulation time and the rudder deflection stays constant value of 10 within the range views of the free surface and vortices can directly reflect the ship motion response in one wave period where the ship model bows up after encountering with the wave crest and then the stern goes up when the ship advances from trough to crest it is found that a new wave crest appears just before encountering the crest at t t e 0 75 t e is the encountering period this strong nonlinear phenomena leads to the obviously unsteady behavior shown in the fft results of time histories of ship resistance mentioned in the last section in addition the propellers tip root and hub vortices interacted with the aligned rudders can be clearly observed it can be noticed that the velocity of propeller vortices at t t e 0 25 and t t e 0 50 is lower than that at t t e 0 and t t e 0 75 the ship model in former situations is experiencing the wave trough where the wave velocity is in the opposite direction of ship speed thus the absolute velocity at propeller disk is reduced and further lead to the increase of the propeller load on the contrary the wave velocities are the same with the ship speed at t t e 0 and t t e 0 75 contributing to the reduce of the propeller loads the changes of propeller loads discussed above can also be proven by the time histories of thrust and torque shown in fig 22 moreover the trajectory of hub vortices can reflect the trend of the ship motions fig 29 shows the free surface colored with wave elevation for the standard 10 10 zigzag maneuver at four time instants corresponding to maximum and minimum yaw zero yaw from starboard to port and port to starboard it is clear that at time instant c there is an obvious bow wave crest before encountering the incident wave crest this phenomenon also lead to the nonlinear performance of the ship resistance shown in fig 24 in addition fig 30 presents a closer look at wake flow around twin propellers and rudders colored by vorticity magnitude in the horizontal section at the rotational center during the four time instants mentioned in fig 29 different from the calm water case both side rudders experience much more complex flows and this can explain the large fluctuation during the most simulation time as shown in fig 23 the flow separation of twin rudders is evident and it is strongly affected by the hub vortices of the rotating propellers at time instant a and c the hub vortices of starboard side are disturbed by the aligned rudder and cause violent flows around the rudder on the contrary the port side hub vortices are significantly affected by the rudder at time instant b and d furthermore the existence of the rudders can even affect the tip vortices which can be clearly seen for the port side vortices at time instant a and b the evident flow separations for the twin rudders and its encountering complex flows can play an important role for the ship maneuver in waves the 3d vortical structures around ship hull appendages twin propellers and rudders in one zigzag period are shown in fig 31 the vortices are presented as iso surfaces of q 100 colored by the axial velocity the tip and hub vortices produced by the twin rotating propellers are evident during all the simulation time and the strengths are stronger compared with the vortices separated from the bilge keels or skeg also of notice is the vortices at the root and tip of rudders the rudder root vortices are partially caused by the artificial gap to gain enough interpolation cells and when the rudder deflects there is angle between the rudder and rudder root which may cause the vortices the rudder tip vortices are remarkable at time instant a and c where the ship model meets the maximum and minimum yaw moreover the rudder tip vortices are joined together with the hub vortices generated by the twin rotating propellers this phenomenon is mainly caused by the ship motions especially the pitch motion where the vortices follow the ship trajectory while the near field vortices are redirected another feature of the vortical structures is the strong interaction between the propeller vortices and the aligned rudder when the rudders turn to a different direction or the ship moving toward a different course the disturbance may be the tip vortices or the hub vortices besides free surface elevations for the shorter wave and longer wave with the same wave steepness of 0 02 are shown in figs 32 and 33 compared with the previous case of wave length equals the ship length the short wave case experience higher encountering frequency and the diffraction wave extends to a smaller region it can also be observed that the wave patterns show strong relation with the maneuvering motion of the ship especially at time instant b and d where the ship hull is experiencing zero yaw angle the highly difference of the wave distribution around ship hull also contributes to the lateral force and turning moment acting on the maneuvering ship it can also be noticed that the ship bow meets the wave crest for all the four instants fig 33 shows the free surface elevations around free running ship in longer incident waves of λ l w l 1 2 the mid ship meets the wave crest for the time instant of a and c where the ship is experiencing the maximum and minimum yaw angle a similar phenomenon appears at time instant b where a new wave crest forms before the ship bow experiences the wave crest compared with fig 32 the diffraction wave extends to a larger range and the ship wave making especially for the stern wave is relatively small compared to the incident waves this can also explains the large wave induced oscillations of ship motions and velocities discussed in section 4 3 1 5 conclusions and future work this paper presents the direct simulations of free running zigzag maneuver in both calm water and waves by using the cfd solver naoe foam sjtu coupled with dynamic overset grid technique open source toolbox waves2foam is utilized to generate the desired wave environment with the moving computational domain twin screw fully appended onr tumblehome ship model is used for all the numerical simulations with the capability of dynamic overset grids the full 6dof motion solver with maneuvering control is successfully applied to simulate the standard 10 10 zigzag maneuver with actual rotating propellers and rudders in various wave environments grid convergence study for open water calculations and maneuvering in calm water is firstly performed to validate the cfd approach with the consideration of its simplicity compared with the wave conditions next three wave lengths i e λ l w l 0 5 λ l w l 1 0 λ l w l 1 2 are used in the simulations to investigate the wave length effects on the free running zigzag maneuver the predicted ship motions for all the cases show remarkable good agreement with the free running tests which further indicates the reliability and feasibility of the present cfd approach with dynamic overset grid the main wave length effect is the speed loss and period to complete one zigzag turn where the wave of λ l w l 1 0 meets the largest speed loss of 21 85 and longest period of 20 0388s wave induced motions are enlarged significantly when increasing the wave length where the wave of λ l w l 1 2 experiences the largest wave induced oscillations of ship motions including speeds and yaw rate in addition different wave heights are also taken into account to study how the wave height affect the performance of free running ship maneuver with the same wave length larger wave height causes larger hydrodynamic loads larger motion response as well as larger speed loss the wave induced motion is almost proportional to the wave height since the cfd simulations can take most of the effects into account strong unsteady and nonlinear behavior is found in the hydrodynamic loads acting on the hull twin propellers and rudders propulsion forces and the rudder forces are also presented to illustrate the hydrodynamic performance during free running zigzag maneuver in waves flow visualizations such as wave elevations wake flow around twin propellers and rudder and vortical structures are presented to give a better description of the flow variation during the free running zigzag maneuver in waves the main conclusion of the present work is that the present cfd solver naoe foam sjtu can be effectively used to handle problems with free running zigzag maneuver in various wave conditions future work includes simulations of turning circle maneuver in waves in order to study the wave effects on the trajectory and the course which are other important characteristic parameters for evaluating

23294,the twin screw fully appended onr tumblehome ship model is numerically studied for the standard 10 10 zigzag maneuver simulations are carried out using naoe foam sjtu a cfd solver developed on open source platform openfoam overset grid technique and 6dof module with a hierarchy of bodies are applied to solve the motions of the free running ship with twin rotating propellers and turning rudders the self propulsion point is using the constant value obtained by the previous cfd simulation of the twin screw self propelled ship in calm water simulations of the standard zigzag maneuver in

hydrodynamic loads on the free running ship during zigzag maneuver in waves is noticeable furthermore flow visualizations in different incident waves are presented so as to give a better understanding of the wave influences on free running ship maneuver keywords zigzag maneuver in waves twin screw ship rans overset grid method naoe foam sjtu solver 1 introduction ship maneuver is closely related to the navigational safety when considering ship maneuver in waves it will further strongly interact with the seakeeping performance thus making the evaluation of ship maneuverability more complicated and difficult recently the research of maneuvering in waves is becoming increasingly popular consequently a specialist committee which is responsible for maneuvering in waves is established by the 28th international towing tank conference ittc 2017a generally ship maneuver experiences large low frequency motions in calm water while in waves it encounters high frequency wave induced motions free running ship maneuver in most cases is conducted by executing rudders along with rotating propellers and it becomes more complicated when evaluating the performance of fully appended ship in waves as one of the most difficult problems in the research of ship hydrodynamics the accurate prediction of ship maneuvering performance during free running motion through either experimental or numerical method is still challenging traditional experimental test in a conventional towing tank or wave basin still plays an important role in predicting the ship maneuvering and seakeeping behaviors however the increasing demand of applying self propelled ships when conducting free running ship model tests also proposes a higher requirement of the measurement facility for instance extensive experiments have been done at the iowa institute of hydraulic research iihr wave basin for free running ship maneuver in both calm water and waves araki et al 2012 sanada et al 2013 which provided plenty of reliable experimental data sprenger et al 2017 has done turning circle tests in marintek wave basin within the shopera project however the high cost of the experimental measurements and the complexity in local flow measurement still hold back its application and this is the reason why the experiment measurements are only required at the final design stage besides the experiment measurements several numerical approaches have been proposed to study the ship maneuvering and seakeeping problems system based simulation sbs sakamoto et al 2012 simonsen et al 2012 is a traditional method for modeling ship maneuvering motion however sbs require a large number of data from experiments or computational fluid dynamics cfd simulated results to predict maneuvering performance therefore the prediction is strongly dependent on the available database potential theory fonseca and guedes soares 1998 pérez arribas 2007 can be very fast to give predicted results for ship motion in waves unfortunately since both sbs method and potential theory rely on the simpler mathematical modeling by not directly simulating the moving appendages it is nearly impossible to give reliable and accurate results of the unsteady local flows around the fully appended hull with complex geometries such as rotating propellers and turning rudders previously people use mathematical models to predict the maneuvering motion at the same time they calculate the wave induced motions according to the potential theory zhang and zou 2015 applied the 4 degrees of freedom 4dof maneuvering modeling group mmg model to solve ship maneuvering motion and they determined the high frequency wave induced motions by solving a linearized boundary value problem bvp in time domain nonetheless there is a large discrepancy between their predicted results and experiment data which shows that the potential theory actually cannot accurately describe the maneuvering characters in waves seo and kim 2011 applied a similar approach to model the maneuvering motion and wave induced ship response their results show reasonable agreement but less accuracy therefore cfd methods are preferable in the predictions of ship maneuvering and seakeeping performances direct cfd simulations are able to provide accurate prediction of hydrodynamic locals and specific local flow details since they can well resolve the complex flows around the hull and its appendages but due to the high computational cost and complex numerical models only few free running simulations have been performed by cfd approach and the number is even less for the free running in waves so far the most reliable and robust approach to simulate free running ship maneuver is the dynamic overset grid method coupled with full 6dof motion solver with a hierarchy of bodies this approach was firstly introduced to ship and ocean engineering for cfd simulations of self propelled ships carrica et al 2010 castro et al 2011 without rudder with the dynamic overset grid technique simulations of ship maneuvers with active rudders became feasible carrica et al 2012 simulated the turn and zigzag maneuver by using a reynolds average navier stokes rans approach where the deflection of rudders were achieved by the dynamic overset grid technique with a hierarchy of hull and rudders while the rotating propellers were simplified by body forces furthermore carrica et al 2012 performed maneuver simulations in waves by using the simplified model and found that the main discrepancy between the cfd and experiments can possibly be tracked to the simplistic propeller model mofidi and carrica 2014 presented the direct simulation of free running zigzag maneuver for a single screw kriso container ship kcs where standard 10 10 zigzag maneuver and modified 15 1 zigzag maneuver with actual rotating propeller and turning rudder were computed in calm water the results were promising when compared with the experiment although the authors emphasized that the computational cost in direct calculating free running ships was still very high carrica et al 2016 further extended the direct simulation of zigzag maneuver of kcs ship model in shallow water with rather low approaching speed the cfd results agreed well with the experiment data for most hydrodynamic quantities broglia et al 2015 and dubbioso et al 2016 used a similar overset grid approach to simulate the turning circle maneuver in calm water by using a finite volume method cfd solver the ship model was a fully appended twin screw vessel with a single rudder the twin rotating propellers were simulated by an actuator disk model which was modified to account for oblique flow effects further analysis for the distribution of forces and moments on the hull and appendages was done to obtain the hydrodynamic behavior in turning tests recently dubbioso et al 2017 and muscari et al 2017 conducted cfd investigations of propeller bearing loads in steady and transient maneuvers using overset grid approach shen et al 2014 2015 implemented the dynamic overset grid module to the open source cfd software openfoam and presented some applications to the turn and zigzag maneuvering simulations for benchmark ship models such as kcs kriso very large crude carrier kvlcc2 us navy combatant dtmb5415 unlike previous studies the unstructured overset grid technique was introduced which showed impressive flexibility and efficiency of the mesh generation for complex geometries their results agreed well with the experimental data indicating that the fully discretized model with overset grid method was feasible even for the relatively coarse unstructured grids wang et al 2016 used the same approach to simulate the self propulsion and turning circle maneuver of the fully appended twin screw office of naval research onr tumblehome model in calm water the predicted ship motions for the maneuvering conditions agreed well with the available experimental data most of previous studies on ship maneuver with free running ship models only focus on the calm water conditions and most of them only used the simplified propeller model which cannot accurately capture the unsteady local flows in particular with such a model the effects of the rotating propeller are missing however a precise simulation of ship maneuvering in waves inevitably has to consider large amplitude ship motions with more violent free surface deformation and more notable hull propeller rudder interactions which is more difficult than the simulation in calm water wang et al 2017 extended the free running simulations from calm water to waves for a course keeping problem and showed the capability of cfd with dynamic overset grid in predicting ship maneuvering in waves in the present paper more emphasis is put on the free running zigzag maneuver under various wave conditions for a fully appended twin screw ship the motivation of this study is to find out whether it is reliable for the numerical computations of free running zigzag maneuver in waves and to study the wave effects on the ship maneuver this paper is organized as follows the computational methods are presented in the second section the simulation designs including the geometry model test conditions and grid distribution are described in the third section the simulation results and discussions are presented in the fourth section finally conclusions from the present study are made 2 computational methods the computations are performed with the ship hydrodynamics cfd solver naoe foam sjtu developed on an open source platform openfoam it is easy to achieve the free running ship maneuvering motion see section 2 1 since this solver has the dynamic overset grid capability and includes a full 6dof motion module with a hierarchy of bodies in general naoe foam sjtu solves the reynolds averaged navier stokes rans equations for unsteady turbulent flows around complex geometries for capturing the free surface elevation a volume of fluid vof approach with bounded compression technique is used berberović et al 2009 the turbulence features are modeled by a blended k ω k ε shear stress transport sst turbulence model menter et al 2003 wall functions are used to model the velocity gradient effects near the wall the solver has been extensively validated on large amount of ship hydrodynamic cases e g ship resistance zha et al 2015 seakeeping shen and wan 2013 2016 wang and wan 2016 and maneuvering shen et al 2015 wang et al 2016 2017 the computational domain is discretized by multi unstructured overlapping grids and the finite volume method fvm is used to transform the equations from physical space into computational space besides the pressure implicit split operator piso algorithm issa 1986 is applied for pressure velocity coupling in solving governing equations in addition several built in discretization schemes in openfoam are used to solve the partial differential equations pde the implicit euler scheme is used for temporal discretization second order total variation diminishing tvd scheme is used to discretize the convection term in momentum equation a central differencing scheme is applied for diffusion terms 2 1 dynamic overset grid and maneuvering control the dynamic overset grid technology and full 6dof motion method with a hierarchy of bodies are crucial to simulate the free running ship maneuver including complex geometries with independent motions e g rotating propellers and turning rudders generally overset grid includes two or more blocks of overlapping structured or unstructured grids and the value of a flow variable in the fringe cell is obtained by interpolation from the donor cells in the present work suggar library noack et al 2009 is utilized to obtain the overset connectivity at run time more details about the overset grid implementation in openfoam can be found in shen et al 2015 and wang et al 2017 with dynamic overset grid 6dof motion solver is incorporated with a hierarchy of bodies which allows the ship and its appendages propellers rudders etc to move simultaneously fig 1 gives a general description of overset grids for ship and its appendages with the coordinate systems for motion controls during the calculation the ship moves according to the 6dof equations the propellers and rudders follow the ship with the same forward speed but can translate or rotate in their own systems based on special control mechanism when handling with the motion of overlapping grids in computations the propeller or rudder grid blocks taken to be the children level first rotate or turn according their control laws then they move together with the ship grid block parent level according to the ship motion obtained by 6dof equations finally the background grid which connects the ship to farfield boundary follows the ship with surge sway and yaw motion so that the free surface stays horizontal two coordinate systems are used to solve the 6dof equations based on euler angles the flow equations are solved in the inertial system earth fixed system and the calculated forces and moments are then transformed to the non inertial system ship fixed system where the rigid body equations are solved in the present work the 6dof motion equations are solved using a semi implicit approach where the solution is given by iterations to fulfil convergence and more detailed information of 6dof motion solver can be found in shen et al 2015 regarding the maneuvering control this study adopts the open loop of feedback controllers under specified requirement of desired ship motion such as the rotational speed of propeller heading control and roll control etc for zigzag maneuver the ship is moving forward with nominal constant speed and the rudder is executed to a specified maximum rudder angle at the maximum rudder rate then the ship responses with a turning motion due to the rudder deflection which can be used to access the ship maneuverability as for the zigzag maneuver simulated in the present work the rudder deflection for the standard 10 10 zigzag maneuver follows 1 δ t min k t 10 max k t 10 min k t 10 t 1 t t 2 t 2 t t 3 t 3 t t 4 where δ t is the rudder angle which is positive when the rudder turns to the starboard side k is the maximum rudder rate which is provided by the model test t i is the ith time for rudder execution in addition fig 2 demonstrates the main parameters in a standard 10 10 zigzag maneuver such as the first and second overshoot angle osa of the ship the excess angle between the maximum minimum ship s heading and the check heading angle the period time to complete one zigzag cycle etc 2 2 wave generation in the present simulations the computational domain namely the background grid is moving forward with the ship horizontal motion therefore the velocity inlet boundary condition for wave generation may be not appropriate since the boundary may deviate from its original position in order to generate desired wave environment with the moving computational domain the open source toolbox waves2foam jacobsen et al 2012 is used for all the computations the methodology adopts the relaxation zones to avoid reflections of waves from outlet boundaries and further to avoid waves reflected internally in the computational domain to interfere with the wave maker boundaries the flow parameters such as velocity u and volume of fraction α can be blended by a relaxation factor γ r the details of the relaxation technique can be found in jacobsen et al 2012 the schematic of the computational domain and wave generation zone is shown in fig 3 a frozen type relaxation zone is used in the present simulations so that the wave generation zone can move with the computational domain this guarantees that the waves can propagate to the area around ship model no matter how the computational domain rotates or translates in the present work the first order stokes wave theory with specified wave parameters is adopted 3 simulation design 3 1 geometry model onr tumblehome model 5613 is a preliminary design of a modern surface combatant fully appended with skeg and bilge keels in addition the model is equipped with twin rudders shafts and twin propellers with propeller shaft brackets it is one of the benchmark ship models in 2015 tokyo cfd workshop in ship hydrodynamics and has extensive experimental data the geometry of onr tumblehome ship model is shown in fig 4 and main particulars are listed in table 1 3 2 grid distribution the computational domain is divided into six parts according to the motion level of overset grid topology one for the background grid one for the grid around the ship hull two for the grids around the two propellers on starboard side and port side respectively two parts for the two rudders for the overset grids arrangement the background domain extends to 1 5 l w l x 3 5 l w l 1 5 l w l y 1 5 l w l 1 0 l w l z 0 5 l w l and the hull domain is much smaller with a range of 0 15 l w l x 1 2 l w l 0 13 l w l y 0 13 l w l 0 2 l w l z 0 2 l w l the detailed overset grid arrangements are shown in fig 5 a unstructured grids are generated by the pre processing utilities provided by openfoam overset grid topology around solid surfaces is shown in fig 5b near wall grid spacing is designed to meet the requirement of turbulence model using wall functions where the y is around 60 the total grid number for the free running simulations is around 7 million where the background grid varies in different simulation cases the motion of each part grid which follows the control laws of free running ship maneuver is discussed in section 2 1 as for the boundary conditions of the computational domain the inlet and relaxation zone as shown in fig 3 is used to generate desired waves the conditions of velocity and volume of fraction are imposed by the specified first order stokes wave theory the farfield boundaries are identical with zero velocity and zero gradient of pressure the surfaces of the moving bodies are non slip and the outlet is specified by the downstream boundaries once all the grids are generated a preprocessing step requires setting up and running suggar with appropriate boundary conditions with the aim of checking the validity of interpolations among different grid blocks it should be emphasized that artificial gaps between propellers and shafts rudders and rudder roots are reserved to obtain enough fringe donor cells for the overlapping grid interpolation the positions and geometries of the rudders and propellers remain unchanged and only the shafts and rudder roots are slightly adjusted to keep the gaps another procedure before the simulations started is a simple hydrostatic computation which is used to obtain the longitudinal location of the center of buoyancy the displacement and the static wetted area of the ship in even keel condition with the discretized computational model the resulting displacement of the ship model is 0 07 larger than the value used in the experiment the small deviation is due to the spatial discretization error of the geometry 3 3 test conditions all the simulations conditions are defined based on two non dimensional number the reynold number re u 0 l w l υ and the froude number f r u 0 g l w l where υ is the kinematic viscosity g is the gravitational acceleration all the computations of the free running ship maneuver are at the same approaching speed of 1 11 m s in model scale corresponding to fr 0 20 according to the model tests the self propelled ship was set to advance at model point with full 6dof motion in both calm water and regular waves in cfd simulations the self propulsion test must be performed to obtain the self propulsion point and then the model point is used for the free running ship maneuver simulations this work has already been done in the previous work wang et al 2017 and the cfd results of the rotational speed of twin propeller is 8 819 resolutions per second rps which is reasonable when compared with the experiment data of 8 97 rps in the present calculations of zigzag maneuver in waves the same rotational speed of twin propellers obtained by the previous work is applied and is kept constant during the maneuver simulations using a fixed rotational speed in the free running ship maneuver simulations can reduce the difficulty and uncertainties and help cfd researcher to validate their numerical approaches since it is quite challenging for cfd simulations to repeat exactly the same conditions as in the experiment the details of test cases are shown in table 2 zigzag maneuver simulations are firstly performed under calm water conditions due to its simplicity then five wave conditions are considered with the combination of three wave lengths and three wave steepness 4 numerical simulations and discussions all the calculations are conducted on the hpc cluster center in computational marine hydrodynamics lab cmhl shanghai jiao tong university each node consists of 2 cpus with 20 cores per node and 64 gb accessible memory intel xeon e5 2680v2 2 8 ghz 4 1 grid convergence study according to the literature involving simulations of free running ship maneuver with dynamic overset grid the grid refinement will strongly affect the quality of overlapping grids especially for the complex hull propeller rudder system where the gaps between each component are very small as a result a grid convergence study for such complicated problem is rarely done by the researchers in the present work open water calculations with simpler overset grid arrangements are employed for the grid convergence study the open water case is a proper candidate for the grid convergence study with the fact that the computations for rotating propeller are crucial for the simulations for self propelled ships open water calculation follows the experimental setup available at tokyo 2015 cfd workshop where the rate of resolution of propeller is fixed with value of 8 97 rps the computational domain is divided into two parts i e background grid and propeller grid as shown in fig 6 a during the calculation the propeller grid rotates with the rotating propeller while the background grid moves forward with the advancing velocity three grids with a refinement ratio of 2 in each direction are used for grid convergence study which follows the recommended procedures and guidelines ittc 2017b result changes between medium fine ε 21 s 2 s 1 and coarse medium ε 32 s 3 s 2 are used to define the convergence ratio r g 2 r g ε 21 ε 32 and rg is used to determine convergence condition where s 1 s 2 and s 3 correspond to solutions with fine medium and coarse grid respectively three convergence conditions are possible 3 i 0 r g 1 m o n o t o n i c c o n v e r g e n c e i i r g 0 o s c i l l a t o r y c o n v e r g e n c e i i i r g 1 d i v e r g e n c e for condition iii grid convergence study cannot be estimated hydrodynamic parameters k t k q and η are used to estimate the grid convergence the propulsion coefficients mentioned above are defined as 4 j v a n d p 5 k t t ρ n 2 d p 4 6 k q q ρ n 2 d p 5 7 η j k t 2 π k q where t and q are the propeller thrust and torque d p is the diameter of propeller n is the rps and v a is the advancing speed grid distribution around propeller for medium grid is shown in fig 6b for all three grids the resulting y varies from 40 to 120 with the consideration of wall function are applied near wall the grid convergence study is carried out at j 1 0 for the open water case with respect to the most approximate condition to the propeller at self propulsion and zigzag maneuver simulation during the computation the time step was set to a rather small value of δ t 0 0005 s in order to resolve the transient flow due to the rotating propeller which corresponds to approximately 1 5 of propeller rotation per time step and the resultant courant number is around 0 1 20 processors are assigned to calculate the open water case in which 19 processors are for the flow calculation and another processor is used for suggar calculation it costs approximately 30 55 and 122 h to complete the computations for coarse medium and fine grid cases respectively table 3 summarizes the results of the grid convergence study for open water calculations it can be seen from table 3 that the thrust coefficient k t shows monotonic convergence with r g 0 078 and the predicted value of k t is highly accurate with errors lower than 1 7 the torque coefficient k q is overestimated by all three grids with errors up to 9 8 and the efficiency η is underestimated with largest error of 10 5 both torque coefficient and efficiency show monotonic convergence with r g 0 7916 and 0 5915 respectively note that the grid size of propellers in free running zigzag maneuver simulation is larger than medium grid but smaller than the fine grid this indicates that the propeller grid used in the free running ship maneuver simulation will slightly change the numerical results 4 2 zigzag maneuver in calm water for the simulations of free running ship maneuver in both calm water and waves 40 processors are adopted in which 38 processors are for the flow calculation and the other 2 processors are used for suggar calculation the time step was set to δ t 0 0005 s which is according to the previous open water calculations it costs approximately 325 h of clock time with about 39000 time steps to complete the computation in calm water while 347 h for the cases in waves the simulation case of standard 10 10 zigzag maneuver in calm water is used to validate the present cfd method due to its simplicity furthermore the calm water computation can give the guidance of numerical setup for the free running ship maneuver computations in waves and most importantly to be a useful reference for evaluating the wave effects as mentioned in section 3 3 the rotational speed of propellers is set fixed with constant value 8 819 rps and the rudder is controlled by an autopilot shown in eqn 1 the initial flow state of the zigzag maneuver computation is from the stable state of self propulsion condition then the ship model is released in 6dof with specified rudder control to achieve the zigzag maneuver motion fig 7 shows the time histories of ship yaw motion and rudder angle for the 10 10 zigzag maneuver in calm water simulation the comparison of main parameters for standard zigzag maneuver in calm water is depicted in table 4 good agreement between the cfd results and experimental measurements by experimental fluid dynamics efd is achieved in terms of the time to execute rudder the overshoot angle and the period to complete one zigzag turn despite the overall agreement the overshoot angle is underestimated by 21 6 1st osa and 18 1 2nd osa while the time to check yaw as well as the period is overestimated by the simulation the discrepancies can be explained by the different settings between the present simulations and the experiment unlike the experiments the simulation adopts a constant rotational speed of propellers which directly affects the approaching speed during the zigzag maneuver and further leads to the discrepancy of the time to check yaw and the period more differences between the cfd and efd can be found in the time variations of ship motions and speeds as shown in fig 8 the initial state of the experiment differs a lot from the simulations especially for the ship speeds which makes sense for the discrepancies in the two conditions apparently there is some uncertainty on how accurately the nominal approach speed has been achieved in the experiments instead the time is measured from the start of the efd maneuver and the cfd results are shifted a small amount to match the first rudder execution from port to starboard after the large rudder deflection the transient due to different initial conditions between cfd and efd is weakened for the time histories of yaw rate it can be obviously seen that the predicted yaw rate is smaller at the turning points which lead to the underestimation of overshoot angle shown in fig 7 the main difference for the roll and drift angle is the phase shift compared with the measurements where the predicted results are delayed in time the predicted peak value for roll angle is 2 43 compared with the measurement data of 3 20 though little discrepancies exist the present cfd results for the zigzag maneuver in calm water is promising compared with the available experimental data and can lay a good foundation for the numerical simulations of free running zigzag maneuver in waves fig 9 illustrates the time histories of thrust and torque during the zigzag simulation in calm water both thrust and torque are evidently related to the ship motions and rudder execution for instance when the ship experiences rudder execution the thrust and torque of the rotating propeller will show significant difference which is mainly due to the large flow disturbance around the propeller caused by the rudder the different behavior of port and starboard side propellers can be better understood through the local flow shown later besides high frequency fluctuations in thrust and torque that correlate to the blade passage frequency are presented which can be obviously seen in the viewport the thrust and torque curves for both propellers can give a better illustration of the propulsion performance during the zigzag maneuver in calm water the time histories of predicted rudder resistance and lateral rudder force are shown in fig 10 every time the rudder is executed there is a peak rudder resistance and lateral force another feature is that both the resistance and lateral force show alternate behaviors at the beginning the ship is advancing straight forward and the hydrodynamic forces are almost the same and symmetric after the execution of rudders the ship response to the corresponding rudder force and making highly difference of the wake flow around twin rudders due to the auto pilot of zigzag maneuver the rudder force changes alternatingly as shown in fig 10 to help understand the hydrodynamic performance of twin propellers and rudders shown in figs 9 and 10 the wake region around twin propellers and rudders on a horizontal plane is shown in fig 11 four typical time instants a b c d as shown in fig 10 are adopted to analyze the results it is obvious that the inflow for twin propellers show much difference at different time and oblique inflow occurs frequently which lead to the highly difference for the thrust and torque variation for the rudder forces it is found that at instant a and b the flow around the port side rudder obviously is much more complex than that on the starboard side this well explains the larger resistance and lateral force from instant a to b for port side rudder as for instant c and d the flow field shows the opposite features and the starboard side rudder experiences larger resistance and lateral force the flow visualization can give a general description of the hydrodynamic behavior for twin propellers and rudders 4 3 zigzag maneuver in waves the simulation of free running zigzag maneuver in waves mainly involves two parts first is the same wave steepness with three different wave lengths which follows the same conditions as in the experiments the other one is the same wave height with three different wave lengths as shown in table 2 the former case is simulated to investigate the effect of different wave length on the free running ship maneuver and to validate the cfd results by comparing with the available experimental data the latter one is conducted to study the influences of the wave height on the maneuvering performances this section firstly presents the motion performances of the zigzag maneuver in different waves where time histories of ship motions speeds yaw rate and rudder deflection are discussed in detail then the forces during the maneuvering simulation is used to investigate the hydrodynamic performances for free running ship maneuver in waves where the ship resistance the propulsion performance thrust and torque and the forces on twin rudders in different waves are presented finally detailed flow visualizations e g wave elevation wake profiles and vortical structures are given to further explain the hydrodynamic effects on ship maneuvering performance under different incident wave conditions 4 3 1 motions figs 12 14 show the time histories of yaw and rudder angle in different incident waves with the same wave steepness of 0 02 the cfd results show an overall agreement to the experiment measurements for all wave conditions though some discrepancies are observed for both yaw and rudder angle same as in the calm water case the predicted period to complete one zigzag turn is slightly overestimated for all the three wave conditions detailed quantities such as overshoot angles osa and period of a standard zigzag maneuver are listed in table 5 both first 1st and second 2nd overshoot angles are under estimated from 11 9 to 15 8 while the absolute error is small according to the value of yaw at time of overshoot angle 2 1 3 1 fig 15 demonstrates the first and second overshoot angles of three different wave lengths where the total trend matches very well with the measurements the parameters of period to complete one zigzag turn can be accurately predicted with an error varies from 0 56 to 1 54 figs 16 18 show the time histories of ship motions yaw rate instantaneous ship speed and drift angle under different wave conditions the predicted results shown as solid lines are compared with the experimental data represented by circles cfd predictions match well with the measurements except for the large discrepancies at the beginning which have been discussed in the calm water case the high frequency wave induced motions and low frequency maneuvering motion can be observed in the time variation data where the short wave indicates the smallest motion response the wave induced oscillations in longer incident waves λ l w l 1 0 λ l w l 1 2 are significant for the heave pitch drift yaw rate and ship instantaneous speed in order to characterize the wave effects on the free running zigzag maneuvers the fourier series fs shen and wan 2013 tezdogan et al 2015 are used to analyze the ship motions and velocities due to waves the peak value of roll motions 1st harmonic fs term of heave and pitch taken as the mean fluctuation amplitude and the mean value of ship speed represented by the 0th harmonic fs term are listed in table 6 in addition the comparison between time histories of ship motions and velocities in calm water and waves are shown in fig 19 as shown in figs 17 and 18 and table 6 the heave and pitch motions quickly reach an apparently periodic wave induced motions after the waves are fully generated in the computational domain the heave and pitch motions under different wave conditions considered in fig 19 are localized to a smaller time scale with the consideration of better understanding the wave length effects on the ship performance the mean amplitude of the oscillations of both heave and pitch motions represented by the 1st harmonic fs shows strong relations with the wave lengths where the amplitudes increase with the increasing of wave length in addition the heave and pitch motions can be enlarged significantly when the wave length is around one ship length for example the mean amplitude of heave in waves of λ l w l 1 0 and λ l w l 1 2 can be increased by 913 6 and 1227 6 respectively the phenomenon can be observed from both the predicted results and the measurements the cfd predictions of roll angle match the total trend with the measurements with the peak values slightly underestimated the drift angle which is defined as the angle between the axis of a ship when turning and the tangent to the path on which it is turning is usually used to characterized the turning quality as shown in the figures the fluctuations of measured drift angle due to the incident waves is larger than that of the cfd results this indicates that the ship model is easier to turn in the experiments than the computations which can explain the under estimation of the overshoot angles shown in table 5 as for the yaw rate the present simulation results are promising compared with the available data where both the low frequency maneuvering rate and the high frequency wave induced rate are accurately resolved the speed loss is a main character for ship advancing in waves and it can be obtained by the ship instantaneous speed shown in figs 16 18 the mean value of the speed is using the 0th harmonic term of fs which is listed in table 6 the speed loss in waves of λ l w l 0 5 λ l w l 1 0 λ l w l 1 2 are 6 76 21 85 and 19 65 respectively the comparisons of time histories of the ship instantaneous speed are shown in fig 19 the case with largest wave length undergoes the largest amplitude of fluctuations while the case with wave length identical to the ship length experiences the largest speed loss the ship instantaneous speed is closely related to the period to complete one zigzag turn hence there is an obvious phase shift for the results of roll yaw yaw rate corresponding to the speed loss the wave conditions of λ l w l 1 0 experiences the longest period 20 0388s compared with 15 7565s of λ l w l 0 5 and 19 4279s of λ l w l 1 2 above all cfd results of ship speeds follow the behavior of efd fairly well even though there is some uncertainty on how accurately the nominal approach speed has been achieved in the experiments apart from the free running zigzag maneuver in waves with the same wave steepness the simulations are also conducted for different wave heights of the three wave lengths described in table 2 these conditions are used to investigate wave height effects on the free running zigzag maneuver fig 20 illustrates heave pitch roll yaw instantaneous ship speeds and yaw rate with different wave heights but the same wave length during the simulation time table 7 summarizes the peak values of roll angle overshoot angles the mean value of the amplitude of heave and pitch as well as the mean value of the ship speeds the amplitudes of heave and pitch motions obtained by the 1st harmonic fs term show consistent growth with the wave height for instance in the short wave cases the wave steepness of 0 04 experiences almost twice than the wave steepness of 0 02 in general the different wave heights for the same wave length means the wave contains different energy therefore when encountering the steeper wave it costs more power for ship to advance forward consequently the mean value of ship speed obtained by the 0th harmonic fs term of instantaneous ship speed is larger with the lower wave height meanwhile the speed loss in short waves are 6 76 and 11 94 for the wave steepness of 0 02 and 0 04 respectively and in waves of λ l w l 1 2 the speed loss are 16 19 and 19 65 with wave steepness of 0 0167 and 0 02 respectively due to the different performance with the speeds the discrepancies shown in the time histories of roll yaw and yaw rate in fig 20 are mainly the time delay under higher wave condition where the wave induced amplitude of oscillations are also larger than that in lower wave case 4 3 2 forces the hydrodynamic loads acting on the fully appended free running ship can directly reflect the motion behavior during the zigzag maneuver in waves at the beginning the forces in the case of the wave length equals ship length are adopted to analyze the hydrodynamic performance fig 21 presents the longitudinal forces on ship hull propeller and rudder where the propeller force or rudder force are the resultant force on the twin propeller or the twin rudder respectively as can be seen from the figure the ship resistance takes the main part of the total resistance and the large fluctuations lead to the oscillations of ship speeds shown in fig 17 to further analyze the propulsion performance the predicted propulsion forces are presented in fig 22 during the simulation time both thrust and torque are evidently related to the ship motions high frequency rudder execution low frequency and wave frequency medium frequency different from the calm water case the thrust and torque curves show significant fluctuations with wave frequency and the mean value increase considerably wave induced fluctuations can be as large as the fluctuation due to low frequency maneuvering motion high frequency fluctuations in thrust and torque that correlate to the blade passage frequency can also be captured which can be seen in the partial enlarged view the thrust and torque curves for both side propellers can give a better description of the propulsion performance during the zigzag maneuver in waves where the local flow around twin propellers and rudders can change a lot due to the rudder deflection and ship maneuvering motion forces acting on twin rudders during zigzag maneuver in waves are depicted in fig 23 compared with the calm water case both rudder resistance and lateral force follow the behavior of the trend while the fluctuations due to the incident waves are remarkable the force amplitude induced by the waves can as large as the force due to rudder execution which indicates that the wave effect is of great importance during the zigzag motion cfd simulations of free running ship maneuver in waves take most of the effects into account such as viscous flow resistance rudder forces propeller loads wave effects etc as a result the present simulations can capture the unsteady behavior of the hydrodynamic loads the detailed information of the forces acting on the twin screw fully append ship presented above can give a better understanding of the hydrodynamic behavior for the free running ship maneuver in waves however the lack of experiment data for forces and moments of ship hull propellers and rudders prevent the validation and so this phenomenon needs further investigations apart from the wave condition of λ l w l 1 0 discussed above the hydrodynamic behavior with different wave lengths are also compared to analyze the wave length effects on the free running zigzag maneuver fig 24 shows the time histories of ship resistance with three different wave lengths but the same wave steepness 0 02 fast fourier transform fft of the time histories of the ship resistance is used to identify the main dominant frequencies associated with the unsteady behavior as can be seen from the results of fft the dominant frequency for all the conditions are the wave encounter frequency a secondary frequency is detected for the waves of λ l w l 1 0 and λ l w l 1 2 in which the crest is most evident for the case of λ l w l 1 0 this phenomenon can also be observed in the time histories of the ship resistance which is mainly due to the nonlinearity of the free running ship in waves as maybe occurred in most occasions the nonlinear effect is caused by the ship motions or so called radiation effects but in this case the frequencies of ship motions are not correlated with the secondary frequency the flow visualizations show that wave breaking occurs when ship bow experiences the wave crest and a second wave crest appears before the incident wave crest this strong nonlinear phenomenon leads to the high frequency effect show in the time histories of ship resistance fig 25 presents the total thrust and rudder resistance in different waves by adding the port side and starboard side value similar to the ship resistance the fluctuation amplitude of total thrust and rudder resistance is larger when the wave length increases the rudder resistance experiences the transition when the rudder executes which has been discussed in the calm water case in order to quantitatively analyze the wave length effects on the hydrodynamic loads on the free running ship maneuver the fs is used for the comparisons for the ship resistance total thrust and rudder resistance shown in table 8 the mean value of the ship resistance and total thrust for waves of λ l w l 1 0 is almost the same with waves of λ l w l 1 2 while the mean amplitude of fluctuations obtained by the 1st harmonic fs term can be enlarged by 80 5 and 66 1 in the longer wave length case apart from the hydrodynamic loads with different wave lengths the time histories of ship resistance with different wave heights are shown in figs 26 and 27 it is clear that the wave height can significantly enlarge the ship resistance which will further lead to the larger speed loss discussed in section 4 3 1 fft analysis is also applied for the time histories of the ship resistance under different wave conditions to identify the main dominant frequencies associated with the unsteady behavior as can be seen from the results of fft fig 26 the dominant frequency is slightly smaller in larger wave height condition it can be concluded that the wave height effects on the free running ship maneuver are the hydrodynamic load amplitude and the dominant frequency 4 3 3 flow visualizations as mentioned in the introduction experiments still play an important role in the research of free running ship maneuver especially in waves nevertheless cfd approaches are becoming more and more attractive with its improvements of the capabilities and the large amount of data which can provide detailed visualization of the flow field fig 28 illustrates the four snapshots of free surface and vortical structures depicted by iso surfaces of q 100 q criterion is the second invariant of the velocity gradient tensor around twin rotating propellers and moving rudders during one encounter wave period with wave length equals ship length the time instants are chosen from 13 95s to 14 67s with respect to the simulation time and the rudder deflection stays constant value of 10 within the range views of the free surface and vortices can directly reflect the ship motion response in one wave period where the ship model bows up after encountering with the wave crest and then the stern goes up when the ship advances from trough to crest it is found that a new wave crest appears just before encountering the crest at t t e 0 75 t e is the encountering period this strong nonlinear phenomena leads to the obviously unsteady behavior shown in the fft results of time histories of ship resistance mentioned in the last section in addition the propellers tip root and hub vortices interacted with the aligned rudders can be clearly observed it can be noticed that the velocity of propeller vortices at t t e 0 25 and t t e 0 50 is lower than that at t t e 0 and t t e 0 75 the ship model in former situations is experiencing the wave trough where the wave velocity is in the opposite direction of ship speed thus the absolute velocity at propeller disk is reduced and further lead to the increase of the propeller load on the contrary the wave velocities are the same with the ship speed at t t e 0 and t t e 0 75 contributing to the reduce of the propeller loads the changes of propeller loads discussed above can also be proven by the time histories of thrust and torque shown in fig 22 moreover the trajectory of hub vortices can reflect the trend of the ship motions fig 29 shows the free surface colored with wave elevation for the standard 10 10 zigzag maneuver at four time instants corresponding to maximum and minimum yaw zero yaw from starboard to port and port to starboard it is clear that at time instant c there is an obvious bow wave crest before encountering the incident wave crest this phenomenon also lead to the nonlinear performance of the ship resistance shown in fig 24 in addition fig 30 presents a closer look at wake flow around twin propellers and rudders colored by vorticity magnitude in the horizontal section at the rotational center during the four time instants mentioned in fig 29 different from the calm water case both side rudders experience much more complex flows and this can explain the large fluctuation during the most simulation time as shown in fig 23 the flow separation of twin rudders is evident and it is strongly affected by the hub vortices of the rotating propellers at time instant a and c the hub vortices of starboard side are disturbed by the aligned rudder and cause violent flows around the rudder on the contrary the port side hub vortices are significantly affected by the rudder at time instant b and d furthermore the existence of the rudders can even affect the tip vortices which can be clearly seen for the port side vortices at time instant a and b the evident flow separations for the twin rudders and its encountering complex flows can play an important role for the ship maneuver in waves the 3d vortical structures around ship hull appendages twin propellers and rudders in one zigzag period are shown in fig 31 the vortices are presented as iso surfaces of q 100 colored by the axial velocity the tip and hub vortices produced by the twin rotating propellers are evident during all the simulation time and the strengths are stronger compared with the vortices separated from the bilge keels or skeg also of notice is the vortices at the root and tip of rudders the rudder root vortices are partially caused by the artificial gap to gain enough interpolation cells and when the rudder deflects there is angle between the rudder and rudder root which may cause the vortices the rudder tip vortices are remarkable at time instant a and c where the ship model meets the maximum and minimum yaw moreover the rudder tip vortices are joined together with the hub vortices generated by the twin rotating propellers this phenomenon is mainly caused by the ship motions especially the pitch motion where the vortices follow the ship trajectory while the near field vortices are redirected another feature of the vortical structures is the strong interaction between the propeller vortices and the aligned rudder when the rudders turn to a different direction or the ship moving toward a different course the disturbance may be the tip vortices or the hub vortices besides free surface elevations for the shorter wave and longer wave with the same wave steepness of 0 02 are shown in figs 32 and 33 compared with the previous case of wave length equals the ship length the short wave case experience higher encountering frequency and the diffraction wave extends to a smaller region it can also be observed that the wave patterns show strong relation with the maneuvering motion of the ship especially at time instant b and d where the ship hull is experiencing zero yaw angle the highly difference of the wave distribution around ship hull also contributes to the lateral force and turning moment acting on the maneuvering ship it can also be noticed that the ship bow meets the wave crest for all the four instants fig 33 shows the free surface elevations around free running ship in longer incident waves of λ l w l 1 2 the mid ship meets the wave crest for the time instant of a and c where the ship is experiencing the maximum and minimum yaw angle a similar phenomenon appears at time instant b where a new wave crest forms before the ship bow experiences the wave crest compared with fig 32 the diffraction wave extends to a larger range and the ship wave making especially for the stern wave is relatively small compared to the incident waves this can also explains the large wave induced oscillations of ship motions and velocities discussed in section 4 3 1 5 conclusions and future work this paper presents the direct simulations of free running zigzag maneuver in both calm water and waves by using the cfd solver naoe foam sjtu coupled with dynamic overset grid technique open source toolbox waves2foam is utilized to generate the desired wave environment with the moving computational domain twin screw fully appended onr tumblehome ship model is used for all the numerical simulations with the capability of dynamic overset grids the full 6dof motion solver with maneuvering control is successfully applied to simulate the standard 10 10 zigzag maneuver with actual rotating propellers and rudders in various wave environments grid convergence study for open water calculations and maneuvering in calm water is firstly performed to validate the cfd approach with the consideration of its simplicity compared with the wave conditions next three wave lengths i e λ l w l 0 5 λ l w l 1 0 λ l w l 1 2 are used in the simulations to investigate the wave length effects on the free running zigzag maneuver the predicted ship motions for all the cases show remarkable good agreement with the free running tests which further indicates the reliability and feasibility of the present cfd approach with dynamic overset grid the main wave length effect is the speed loss and period to complete one zigzag turn where the wave of λ l w l 1 0 meets the largest speed loss of 21 85 and longest period of 20 0388s wave induced motions are enlarged significantly when increasing the wave length where the wave of λ l w l 1 2 experiences the largest wave induced oscillations of ship motions including speeds and yaw rate in addition different wave heights are also taken into account to study how the wave height affect the performance of free running ship maneuver with the same wave length larger wave height causes larger hydrodynamic loads larger motion response as well as larger speed loss the wave induced motion is almost proportional to the wave height since the cfd simulations can take most of the effects into account strong unsteady and nonlinear behavior is found in the hydrodynamic loads acting on the hull twin propellers and rudders propulsion forces and the rudder forces are also presented to illustrate the hydrodynamic performance during free running zigzag maneuver in waves flow visualizations such as wave elevations wake flow around twin propellers and rudder and vortical structures are presented to give a better description of the flow variation during the free running zigzag maneuver in waves the main conclusion of the present work is that the present cfd solver naoe foam sjtu can be effectively used to handle problems with free running zigzag maneuver in various wave conditions future work includes simulations of turning circle maneuver in waves in order to study the wave effects on the trajectory and the course which are other important characteristic parameters for evaluating
