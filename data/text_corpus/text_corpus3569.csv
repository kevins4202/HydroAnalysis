17845,a long lasting challenge in eliminating the worldwide impact of geogenic arsenic as contaminated groundwater is the development of efficient in situ treatment technologies that are applicable in decentralized and rural areas here we present a managed aquifer rehabilitation mar approach based on the in situ creation of fe oxide scavengers for remediating as contaminated groundwater the fe oxide coatings on sediment surfaces were generated via periodic injection of fe2 and clo solutions into an as affected sandy aquifer at the datong basin northern china for 25 days this treatment prompted the buildup of weakly alkaline circumneutral and oxidizing conditions to enhance as iii oxidation in the target aquifer dissolved as concentrations decreased from the initial average 78 0 to 9 8 μg l over the 25 d amendment sediment imaging by scanning electron microscope x ray energy dispersive spectroscopy confirms the deposition of fe rich precipitates on sediment surfaces with the simultaneous retention of as and high density electrical tomography suggests the occurrence of such a process throughout the target zone further x ray diffraction analysis and sequential chemical extraction reveal that the neo formed fe minerals comprised both poorly crystalline e g ferrihydrite and better crystalline e g goethite fe oxides the process based reactive transport modeling for the variations of as species in the treated groundwater supports that the new fe oxide minerals most probably goethite acted as efficient removers of aqueous as the low as level of 10 μg l was maintained during the following 215 d monitoring demonstrating the long effectiveness of the mar approach this study highlights the feasibility of as immobilization by manipulating in situ fe oxide coating on sandy sediments at the pilot scale the mar technology may be applicable for as affected aquifers with controlled oxidizing conditions in the datong basin and likely other high as regions with similar hydrogeochemical settings graphical abstract image 1 keywords arsenic enhanced fe ii oxidation in situ remediation electrical tomography groundwater contamination 1 introduction geogenic high arsenic as 10 μg lwho 2011 groundwater occurs worldwide ravenscroft et al 2009 long term consumption of high as groundwater unconsciously has caused severe endemic arseniasis in many parts of the world fendorf et al 2010 and over one hundred million people are still under high risk of as exposure ravenscroft et al 2009 intensive research over the past two decades provides us with an insightful understanding of the mechanisms responsible for as enrichment in the groundwater huyen et al 2019 neidhardt et al 2018 sø et al 2018b van geen et al 2013 wang et al 2019 but at the same time poses a huge challenge to eliminating this threat natural attenuation seems not to be efficient at least within short terms because of sluggish water flow and hydrogeochemical evolution in those as affected aquifers hafeznezami et al 2017 jia et al 2014 pi et al 2016 sø et al 2018b consequently it remains imperative to develop accommodative intervening technologies for remediating the as contaminated groundwater especially in decentralized and rural areas kumar et al 2019 sharma et al 2014 ex situ treatment techniques such as the pump and treat technology have been widely developed and even applied practically at the community scale sharma et al 2014 zouboulis and katsoyiannis 2005 the treatment procedure which employs surface adsorption co precipitation ion exchange membrane separation and or biological processing is able to decrease as concentrations from hundreds of μg l to levels below the who guideline alam and mcphedran 2019 bakshi et al 2018 kalaruban et al 2019 mondal et al 2013 montalvo et al 2018 schmidt et al 2016 major drawbacks to prevent the wide commercial application of this method could be the immaturity of specific treatment technology the high cost for material replacement and system maintenance the need of professional operation and the difficulty of disposing as rich wastes clancy et al 2013 kumar et al 2019 as an alternative in situ treatment of geogenic high as groundwater has attracted growing attention recently due to its promising advantages in cost effectiveness system flexibility environmental friendliness and user acceptability pi et al 2017a rathi et al 2017 van halem et al 2010 xie et al 2015 one straightforward approach of in situ as sequestration is supplying oxidants e g oxygen into fe ii rich groundwater to facilitate the generation of fe iii hydr oxides for as adsorption and co precipitation brunsting and mcbean 2014 prommer et al 2018 van halem et al 2010 further adsorption of fe ii onto the mineral surfaces is able to promote the formation of crystalline fe oxide minerals that are more stable than the original amorphous precipitates thus contributing to the long term existence of the fe oxide scavengers in the subsurface sun et al 2018 yang et al 2010 in addition the oxidation of as iii to as v assists in as immobilization due to the greater affinity of as v for the fe oxide minerals under certain ph conditions mondal et al 2013 sharma and sohn 2009 manipulating the heterogeneous oxidation of fe ii can significantly remove as from the groundwater in particular within aquifers rich in dissolved fe ii brunsting and mcbean 2014 van halem et al 2010 however the practical applicability of this approach was questioned by the possibility of aquifer blocking during treatment yet such a problem seemed insignificant either in years of pilot scale operation on the fe ii rich aquifers in central europe appelo et al 1999 or in a short term field trial of in situ as immobilization at the datong basin northern china xie et al 2016 the accelerated groundwater flow by artificial pumping can drive progressive spread out of fe precipitates to further distances and the aging of amorphous fe iii hydr oxides to crystalline fe oxide minerals of smaller size helps to avoid fe iii accumulation around the production well mettler et al 2001 another concern is related to fe ii deficient aquifers such as those from the red river delta and the datong basin where groundwater fe ii concentrations are generally less than 0 3 mg l pi et al 2016 postma et al 2007 the aeration methods could be inefficient for immobilizing as with concentrations up to 3000 μg l in the low fe ii groundwater sharma et al 2014 welch et al 2008 a potential solution to this problem is the periodic introduction of appropriate fe2 solute and efficient oxidants e g clo to enhance the oxidation of both fe ii and as iii in situ singer et al 2013 xie et al 2015 this idea had been proven feasible in concept by laboratory column experiments xie et al 2015 and in small scale field test xie et al 2016 however there are two critical remaining concerns prior to the practical applications namely the potential interferences of aquifer environments e g shift of ph and redox conditions at the large scale and the viability of this method for the various types of as affected aquifers chanpiwat et al 2017 yuan et al 2018 in addition knowledge about the hydrogeochemical processes controlling the in situ as immobilization remains not well available which consequently weakens the theoretical basis for the wide applicability of such kinds of in situ treatment methods in this study we attempted to explore an in situ remediation method based on the strategy of managed aquifer rehabilitation mar pi et al 2016 wang et al 2014 similarly the mar approach involves the enhanced oxidation process of fe2 delivered in succession with the clo oxidant into the as affected aquifer xie et al 2016 nonetheless a key difference from previous conceptual trails is that mar lays more emphasis on learning from the nature of the target aquifer to design the remediation procedure and on understanding the responses of hydrogeochemical conditions to the treatment process at the pilot scale and over a long time the results thus potentially contribute to the improvement of remediation technology for geogenic as contaminated groundwater with important implications for the engineering demonstration and practical applications 2 materials and methods 2 1 pilot scale field experiment the experimental site ca 75 75 m2 is located at a known as affected village in the central part of the datong basin northern china dy site fig 1 a the target aquifer zone with depths between 20 and 22 5 m below land surface is confined by an overlying layer of silts clays and is mainly composed of sandy sediments see supplementary material for more details the mar system consisted of four injection wells dia 4 5 cm at the upper stream one pumping well dia 25 cm at the downstream and four major monitoring wells in between fig 1b the screening tubes of all the wells crossed the whole aquifer layer after the buildup of a local steady groundwater flow regime by pumping 5 mmol l feso4 30 8 l immediately followed by anoxic water 14 7 l and 2 51 mmol l naclo 30 8 l immediately followed by anoxic water 14 7 l were alternately injected from the four injection wells at a rate of 7 7 l h every 2 h for a total duration of 25 days this procedure was designed to facilitate the transport of introduced agents and avoid the clogging of fe iii precipitates near the injection wells during and after the field experiment hydrochemical parameters e g ec ph eh redox sensitive components e g fe ii as iii as v and other aqueous constituents were measured on site or sampled periodically for laboratory assay pi et al 2017b prior to and 30 days after the field experiment sediment samples were retrieved from the target aquifer at three locations fig 1b and different depths table 1 to analyze the changes in mineral compositions and solid phase as and fe pools 2 2 geophysical monitoring during the period of field experiment the high density electrical tomography method was also used to monitor the transport of injected agents and the generation of fe iii precipitates within the aquifer zone the remediation procedure was able to cause variations in the apparent resistivity ρ s of the aquifer materials over time which can be traced by comparing with the background value at the steady local flow regime fu et al 2011 on the ground of the experimental site 7 measuring cables gl1 gl7 each of which had a total length of 240 m and an electrode spacing of 4 m were deployed equidistantly between iw1 and iw4 to form the high density monitoring network fig 1b the α type wenner device wdzj 3 chongqing benteng digital control technical institute was employed to collect the apparent resistivity signal of the target aquifer zone as a function of time the collected data were inversed and interpreted using the res2dinv software in combination with the hydrogeological observations 2 3 analytical methods major cations and anions in the water samples were analyzed by inductively coupled plasma optical omission spectrometry icp oes icap6300 thermo scientific and ion chromatography ic metrohm 761 compact ic respectively both icp oes and ic had detection limits of 0 01 mg l for the components of interest trace elements were determined by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry icp ms perkinelmer elan drc e with detection limits of 1 μg l the as iii and as v species that had been separated on site with lc sax anion exchange resin cartridges sigma aldrich le et al 2000 and the total as concentrations in water samples were determined by hydride generation atomic fluorescence spectrometry hg afs afs 820 titan with a detection limit of 0 5 μg l standards and sample replicates were routinely tested generating analytical errors within 5 unless otherwise stated aliquots of fresh sediment samples were wet digested to determine total as and fe contents by icp ms and icp oes respectively pi et al 2016 sequential chemical extraction on subsamples obtained from freeze dried cores and subsequent measurements of as and fe by hg afs and icp oes respectively were performed to quantify changes in various solid phase as and fe pools keon et al 2001 see supplementary material parallel sediment samples were freeze dried coated with pure gold and then imaged for morphology and elemental components using ultra high resolution field emission scanning electron microscope fe sem hitachi su8010 and x ray energy dispersive spectroscopy eds ametek edax appollo xp dark brown layered materials on the surfaces of the collected sandy sediments were scratched ground using an agate mortar and then analyzed by x ray diffraction xrd bruker axs d8 focus with a cukα x ray radiation wavelength of 0 15406 nm and a lynxeye detector 2 4 hydrogeochemical modeling in calculating the speciation of aqueous components including as species with phreeqc 3 parkhurst and appelo 2013 the default database wateq4f dat was updated with as equilibrium reactions based on the compilation by couture et al 2010 the eh ph diagram for the as fe s system at 25 c and 1 bar was also produced to illustrate the changes in as speciation during the treatment process instead of using a complex three dimensional model to describe the whole aquifer this study focused on the hydrogeochemical changes in the pumping well and used a reactive transport model built in phreeqc 3 to identify key processes and limiting factors controlling as immobilization this model assumed that the flow path from the injection wells to the pumping well could be represented by 10 cells with a cell length of 5 m the initial hydrochemical components of all cells were considered to be same as the average background hydrochemistry of the target aquifer table s1 the model simulated the cycles of fe2 and clo injections by alternating the composition of the input solution first order kinetic formulations through fitting the observational data were used to describe the oxidation of fe ii and as iii within the aquifer zone markelova et al 2018 according to the sediment analytical results ferrihydrite and goethite were considered as the proxies of poorly crystalline and crystalline fe oxides respectively and also the main sinks for as in line with the up to date approximations jessen et al 2012 sø et al 2018a stollenwerk et al 2007 stolze et al 2019 the diffuse double layer ddl model dzombak and morel 1990 and the charge distribution multisite ion complexation cd music model hiemstra and vanriemsdijk 1996 were used to describe the adsorption of as species on ferrihydrite and goethite respectively besides other competing components including carbonate sulfate fe ii and si species were included in these surface complexation models table s2 s3 see supplementary material for model details 3 results and discussion 3 1 hydrogeochemical shifts as a result of the 25 d amendment the ph drop following the increase within the early 3 5 days was accompanied with significant almost simultaneous decrease in eh value in the monitoring wells mw2 and mw3 and in the pumping well pw1 respectively fig 2 a 2b generally the responses of ph and eh shifts in the monitoring wells took place sequentially depending on their distances to the injection well iw3 the second remarkable ph decrease occurred along with the gradual increase of eh value up to nearly 0 mv in these wells during the next 5 10 days suggesting the buildup of circumneutral and oxidizing conditions in the target aquifer zone fig 2a 2b regardless of significant fluctuations during the early stage of treatment the ph and eh values tended to stabilize by the end and exhibited no further remarkable variations during the 215 d monitoring period following the remediation procedure one of the reasons for ph decrease is proton release as a consequence of fe2 oxidative precipitation eq 1 the ph decline occurring sequentially in wells along the groundwater flow path over time fig 2a thus indicates the progressive influence of the introduced fe2 under the controlled groundwater flow another reason could be the adsorption of fe2 on the surfaces of neo formed fe iii phases that also released protons into the groundwater eq 2 van halem et al 2010 however ph variation was likely to trigger the quick response of carbonate dissolution precipitation equilibrium and the strong buffering capacity of dissolved bicarbonate av 469 mg l could partially counteract the released proton eq 3 thereby contributing to the ph stabilization at the end of field experiment appelo and postma 2005 1 2 fe 2 clo 3 h 2 o 2 feooh s cl 4 h 2 feooh s fe 2 h 2 o feoofeoh s 2 h 3 co 2 h 2 o h 2 co 3 hco 3 h co 3 2 2 h the amendment also resulted in gradual increase of dissolved fe ii concentrations in the monitoring wells and pumping well during the first 20 days fig 2c however significant decreases were observed during a short period of following 2 3 days these changes thus reflect the oxidation of fe2 by the subsequent oxidant clo xie et al 2016 the further slow decrease in dissolved fe ii concentrations after the remediation procedure likely implies the accumulation of fe ii on the surfaces of produced fe iii hydro oxides eq 2 and resultant fe ii catalyzed transformation of the fe precipitates van halem et al 2010 xie et al 2015 dissolved sulfide concentrations in the groundwater were below 5 μg l throughout the field experiment and during the following monitoring period 3 2 groundwater arsenic variations according to the results from the monitoring wells dissolved as concentrations in the target aquifer decreased gradually from an initial average value of 78 0 μg l to 9 8 μg l at the end of the 25 d amendment with an estimated as removal rate of 87 for the groundwater being treated fig s1 next 215 d monitoring indicates that groundwater as concentrations slightly fluctuated between 10 and 15 μg l after the amendment and then maintained the level of about 10 μg l in most of the wells significant decrease in groundwater as concentrations firstly occurred near the injection wells and the as retention front appeared to move forward along the groundwater flow from the injection wells to the pumping well fig s1 these results clearly indicate that as in the groundwater of the target aquifer had been scavenged successfully likewise dissolved as concentration in the pumping well pw1 decreased from initial 80 2 to 11 9 μg l at the end of field experiment fig 3 simultaneously the dissolved as v to total as as v ast ratio increased from 26 5 to 68 5 demonstrating the shift from as iii dominance before the amendment to growing prevalence of as v species in the groundwater over time this shift suggests that the oxidation of as iii to as v may have occurred as well upon the injection of clo eq 4 4 2 feoofeoh s 4 h 3 aso 3 5 cio 4 feoh 2 aso 4 s 5 ci 3 h 2 o the decrease of dissolved as iii concentration in parallel with that of total as implies that the as iii oxidation process should contribute to the removal of as from the groundwater the inference is based on the finding that the oxidized as v has a greater affinity for fe oxide minerals and fe containing sediments than as iii under the weakly alkaline and circumneutral conditions jessen et al 2005 nguyen et al 2014 sø et al 2018a consequently both as iii and as v in the treated groundwater from the pumping well were kept below 10 μg l and the as v ast ratio remained at approximately 70 during the following monitoring period fig 3 the evolved oxidizing conditions within the target aquifer could also favor the existence of oxidized as v either in the groundwater or on the sediment surfaces brunsting and mcbean 2014 zhang et al 2017 3 3 changes in sedimental iron and arsenic pools the sem eds analyses discerned no apparent fe oxide minerals in the sediment sample collected from the site cs1 at the depth of 21 3 m cs1 2 prior to the amendment fig 4 a and as content was below the detection limit 0 5 wt of eds measurement fig 4b our previous investigations suggested that fe oxide minerals acted as the major host of as in the aquifers of the dy site but they seemed to exist as relatively minor components compared to the silicate minerals in the sediments pi et al 2016 2017b by contrast after the field experiment sediment surfaces were coated with relatively large size fe rich particles cs1 2 fig 4c and the associated as contents increased to 5 6 0 4 wt in three similar particles these observations support that the remediation procedure had successfully led to the deposition of fe precipitates on sediments and the concurrent sequestration of as identifying mineral types with xrd indicates that as opposed to undisturbed sediment samples that mainly comprised quartz and phyllosilicates background fig 5 sediments collected after the amendment contained remarkable amounts of various fe oxide minerals ferrihydrite possibly in the 6 l form as identified one primary type of fe iii hydroxides produced from fe ii oxidative precipitation johnston et al 2011 was detected in all of the sediment samples after treatment although the intensities of its characteristic peaks were not very strong presumably due to the poor crystallinity fig 5 the xrd data clearly indicate the formation of goethite α form most probably in the target aquifer as well particularly in sample cs1 2 which is close to the injection well iw3 fig 5 the better crystalline goethite was likely produced from the aging of ferrihydrite upon the surface adsorption of fe ii as it could catalyze the mineral phase transformation pedersen et al 2005 the chemical extraction results show significant net increases in total fe and as contents in the sediment samples collected 30 days after the field experiment with an incremental range of 1 17 7 51 g kg and 0 47 5 87 mg kg respectively table 1 these results are in accordance with the enhanced signals of fe and as detected in the eds measurement fig 4d notably phosphate extractable as increased by 0 18 3 77 mg kg in post treatment sediments except in sample cs3 1 which exhibited a slight decrease table 1 such changes suggest that a large part of as removed from the groundwater was most probably adsorbed onto the neo formed fe oxide minerals substantial increases in fe contents were observed in both the poorly crystalline and crystalline fe oxide fractions but greater net increments mostly occurred in the crystalline fe oxide pool with an average of 3 44 g kg correspondingly the crystalline fe oxide associated as increased to larger extents av 1 08 mg kg than as in the poorly crystalline fe pool av 0 02 mg kg thus the crystalline fe oxides may be an important sink for as agreeing with our laboratory experimental observations xie et al 2015 3 4 tracing of remediation by geophysical signals shown in fig 6 is the difference δρ s between the apparent resistivity measured at various days of the experimental period and the background value for the middle depth of the target aquifer zone the horizontal contour maps fig 6a e illustrate that the range of observed δρ s expanded with the proceeding of the field experiment suggesting enlarging coverage in the target aquifer by the treatment process over time in particular there were substantial increases in the ρ s values at areas between the injection wells iw3 iw4 and the pumping well pw1 generally by 0 3 1 0 ω m at the end of the field experiment under the experimental conditions these differences could be ascribed to the injection of amending agents and the formation of fe oxide coatings on the surfaces of sediment particles campanella and weemees 1990 slater et al 2000 compared to the background value the appreciable decreases in ρ s values during the early 10 days of the field experiment e g fig 6f 6g could be due to the introduction of external solutes including so4 2 and na into the groundwater that increased the specific conductivity of the aquifer materials however the precipitation of fe iii hydro oxides on the sediment surfaces probably increased the apparent resistivity of the aquifer materials as reflected by the rising ρ s values during the next 15 days fig 6f 6g in other words the observed ρ s changes as represented by the expanding red clouds that covered most of the aquifer area at the end of the experiment fig 6e could be indicative of the regional impact of the remediation procedure the not very homogeneous distribution of the red clouds on the other hand indicates that the fe oxide coatings may be not uniformly produced in the target zone presumably due to the variable groundwater flow and deposition effectiveness at different places of the target aquifer pi et al 2016 the increasing trend of the ρ s value at the point adjacent to the pumping well x 49 5 m y 37 5 m fig 6g for the middle depth of the aquifer zone was comparable to that of fe ii concentration in the pumping well pw1 over time fig 2c an increasing aqueous fe ii concentration may favor a higher possibility of enhanced production of fe iii hydro oxides from the fe ii oxidation by clo and thus a stronger response in the δρ s value such similarity is probably the further clue that the transport of fe ii along the controlled groundwater flow and subsequent formation of fe oxide coatings on the sediment surfaces had been successfully traced by the variations in the apparent resistivity signals 3 5 modeling insights into arsenic immobilization scattering the data from all the monitoring wells on the eh ph diagram of the as fe s system suggests that the as species were distributed along the boundary of haso4 2 h3aso3 under the reducing and alkaline conditions of the undisturbed aquifer red dots fig 7 as measured the groundwater as species was originally a mixing of as iii and as v whilst in some monitoring wells the as iii species dominated table s1 in accordance with the increase of eh and decrease of ph values as a result of the amendment aqueous fe ii including the injected parts tended to transform into the fe iii hydr oxides and haso4 2 became the preferably stable major as species in the treated groundwater black arrow fig 7 these shifts help the strong adsorption of as v on the neo formed fe oxide minerals feoh2aso4 in fig 7 and contribute to as removal from the groundwater blue dots fig 7 brunsting and mcbean 2014 van halem et al 2010 the relatively significant drop in ph values of some water samples however increased the potential of h3aso3 occurrence at the higher eh values even after treatment green dots fig 7 this tendency may partly explain why a small amount of as iii was still detected in the groundwater from the pumping well even though the total as concentration had been rather low fig 3 the thermodynamic analysis overall supports the inference that the hydrogeochemical changes have facilitated the immobilization of as from the groundwater despite the simplified assumption on the hydrogeological conditions of the target aquifer the reactive transport modeling well captured the decreasing trend of total as concentration in the groundwater from the pumping well fig 3 the exponential attenuation of dissolved as iii concentration as simulated with a rate constant of 0 122 d 1 contributed to the production of as v in the groundwater however because of the simultaneous formation of new fe oxide minerals providing more adsorption sites for as v over time the as v concentration was predicted to rise only slightly in the early 6 days and then decrease during the later period of the remediation procedure fig 3 with the ddl model the simulated surface complex distribution indicates that as v only occupied 1 of ferrihydrite surface sites and as iii adsorption was nearly negligible at the end of the field experiment major competing components toward as species for the adsorption on ferrihydrite seemed to be h4sio4 and co3 2 which accounted for 68 and 27 of the surface sites respectively previous studies using the ddl model for either synthesized minerals or natural sediments in as affected aquifers also found that as v and as iii were not substantially adsorbed on ferrihydrite in the presence of these two competing components appelo et al 2002 gao et al 2013 jessen et al 2012 while as iii was still little bound to the produced goethite as v complexes as estimated by the cd music model jessen et al 2012 kanematsu et al 2013 possibly occupied 15 of the binding sites on the goethite surfaces by contrast h4sio4 and co3 2 surface complexes only accounted for 9 6 and 10 of the binding sites respectively thus exhibiting much weaker competitive effects toward the as species similarly other studies revealed that under similar ph conditions as v showed a stronger adsorption capacity than as iii for sediments in which crystalline fe oxides e g goethite were the major fe minerals neidhardt et al 2018 nguyen et al 2014 postma et al 2007 the substantial as v adsorption may have majorly contributed to the immobilization of as v and thus the removal of as from the groundwater no further significant drop in total as concentration after the cease of the remediation procedure could be partially attributed to the slackened oxidation processes of fe ii and as iii fig 3 moreover the partitioning equilibrium for as species between the solid and aqueous phases may be maintained and the competitive adsorption of other dissolved components e g h4sio4 and co3 2 could still play a part pi et al 2018 postma et al 2016 stollenwerk et al 2007 the modeling results additionally estimate that the not completely removable but rather low as level in the groundwater from the pumping well would likely be sustained for a period of few years if no other perturbations occur fig s2 whilst it remains to be verified by successive monitoring 3 6 implications for managed aquifer rehabilitation in natural reducing aquifers the reductive dissolution of as bound fe oxide minerals has been considered one of the major processes responsible for the occurrence of high as groundwater fendorf et al 2010 mcarthur et al 2001 stüben et al 2003 wang et al 2019 the managed immobilization of as in this study is like an inverse process of as mobilization in those aquifers the apparent inverse relationship between dissolved fe ii and as concentrations in the pumping well fig s3 suggests that as removal was primarily controlled by the supply of fe2 the increased abundance of as in the fe coatings on amended sediments fig 4 and table 1 manifests that the fe oxide minerals produced from fe ii oxidative precipitation may have served as a powerful scavenger for groundwater as van halem et al 2010 xie et al 2015 the induced shifts in the hydrogeochemical conditions turned out to be conducive to the oxidation of as iii to as v and the enhanced sequestration of as v omoregie et al 2013 singer et al 2013 welch et al 2008 besides the buildup of oxidizing conditions is not only able to hinder the reductive dissolution of natural fe containing minerals but also to assist in the long persistence of the neo formed fe oxide mineral phases the maintained low as levels during the 215 d monitoring period suggest that the fe coatings have been taking effect after terminating the supply of oxidant meanwhile neither quick drop in eh values nor significant increase in dissolved fe ii concentrations was observed fig 2 implying that fe oxide reduction did not resume the injection of clo might have also sterilized the indigenous microorganisms and thus suppressed the microbial activities that mediate the reduction processes yoo 2018 water quality problems related to chlorohydrocarbon secondary pollution did not arise either therefore the pilot scale field experiment demonstrates that the mar based method can be a beneficial alternative for in situ high as groundwater remediation in particular its major advantage lies in geogenic non point source high as groundwater that is difficult to remediate by the pump and treat and the permeable reactive barrier methods gibert et al 2010 maier et al 2017 wilkin et al 2009 zouboulis and katsoyiannis 2005 while the as removal efficiency in different cases is linked to the groundwater types the original as concentrations and the cycles of treatment the overall as removal rate of 87 over the 25 d amendment shows competitiveness toward those 50 90 of ex situ treatment system schmidt et al 2016 chemically enhanced natural attenuation hafeznezami et al 2017 and in situ fe assisted aeration methods appelo et al 1999 van halem et al 2010 compared to the ex situ methods sharma et al 2014 this mar based in situ remediation has the potential to meet explicit requirements of operational safety with low health risks low technical maintenance end user convenience and no disposal of as enriched wastes it is however worth noting that the redox condition plays a critical role in regulating the geochemical processes responsible for as immobilization fig 7 results of the present study infer that the mar approach based on the enhanced fe ii oxidation is more suitable for weakly reducing to oxidizing aquifers that can be hydrogeochemically regulated via the supply of oxidants concerns on the re occurring of as bound fe oxide reduction remain to be dispelled by longer monitoring and such a problem may shorten the service life of this technology zhang et al 2017 the formation of goethite in the aquifer zone is potentially conducive to long term as immobilization since the better crystalline fe oxide minerals could be more resistant to abiotic or microbial reduction singer et al 2013 sun et al 2018 this study also warrants future larger scale field demonstration of the mar technology for aquifers with different particularly higher groundwater as concentrations to examine its wide applicability and contingent treatment efficiency 4 conclusions the pilot scale field experiment aiming to in situ remediate high as groundwater based on the managed aquifer rehabilitation was successfully implemented on a sandy aquifer at the datong basin dissolved as in the target aquifer was effectively sequestered by coatings of new fe oxide minerals on sediment surfaces that were produced from the periodical supply of fe2 and clo transport of dissolved fe2 along the controlled groundwater flow and occupation of fe2 exchange sites by neo formed fe iii hydr oxides on sediment surfaces may help fe oxide precipitation taking place throughout the target aquifer to establish a remediation zone and also to avoid aquifer blocking groundwater as concentration dropped from an initial average of 78 0 to 9 8 μg l over the 25 d amendment with an overall as removal rate of 87 the sustained low levels of around 10 μg l as over the 215 d monitoring period after the field experiment indicate the long term effectiveness of the enhanced fe ii oxidation method the hydrogeochemical shifts from moderately alkaline and reducing to circumneutral and oxidizing conditions as a result of the amendment are conducive to the formation of fe oxide minerals and the oxidation of as iii which leads to the production and immobilization of as v most probably via strong adsorption on as well as co precipitation with the new fe oxide minerals the transformation of ferrihydrite into better crystalline goethite may be favorable for the efficient in situ as sequestration and stabilization of immobilized as in the sediments this mar approach has the potential to be applied practically in weakly reducing aquifers in the datong basin and likely other as affected regions with similar hydrogeochemical settings such as the fe ii deficient aquifers in south and southeast asia declaration of

17845,a long lasting challenge in eliminating the worldwide impact of geogenic arsenic as contaminated groundwater is the development of efficient in situ treatment technologies that are applicable in decentralized and rural areas here we present a managed aquifer rehabilitation mar approach based on the in situ creation of fe oxide scavengers for remediating as contaminated groundwater the fe oxide coatings on sediment surfaces were generated via periodic injection of fe2 and clo solutions into an as affected sandy aquifer at the datong basin northern china for 25 days this treatment prompted the buildup of weakly alkaline circumneutral and oxidizing conditions to enhance as iii oxidation in the target aquifer dissolved as concentrations decreased from the initial average 78 0 to 9 8 μg l over the 25 d amendment sediment imaging by scanning electron microscope x ray energy dispersive spectroscopy confirms the deposition of fe rich precipitates on sediment surfaces with the simultaneous retention of as and high density electrical tomography suggests the occurrence of such a process throughout the target zone further x ray diffraction analysis and sequential chemical extraction reveal that the neo formed fe minerals comprised both poorly crystalline e g ferrihydrite and better crystalline e g goethite fe oxides the process based reactive transport modeling for the variations of as species in the treated groundwater supports that the new fe oxide minerals most probably goethite acted as efficient removers of aqueous as the low as level of 10 μg l was maintained during the following 215 d monitoring demonstrating the long effectiveness of the mar approach this study highlights the feasibility of as immobilization by manipulating in situ fe oxide coating on sandy sediments at the pilot scale the mar technology may be applicable for as affected aquifers with controlled oxidizing conditions in the datong basin and likely other high as regions with similar

as 10 μg lwho 2011 groundwater occurs worldwide ravenscroft et al 2009 long term consumption of high as groundwater unconsciously has caused severe endemic arseniasis in many parts of the world fendorf et al 2010 and over one hundred million people are still under high risk of as exposure ravenscroft et al 2009 intensive research over the past two decades provides us with an insightful understanding of the mechanisms responsible for as enrichment in the groundwater huyen et al 2019 neidhardt et al 2018 sø et al 2018b van geen et al 2013 wang et al 2019 but at the same time poses a huge challenge to eliminating this threat natural attenuation seems not to be efficient at least within short terms because of sluggish water flow and hydrogeochemical evolution in those as affected aquifers hafeznezami et al 2017 jia et al 2014 pi et al 2016 sø et al 2018b consequently it remains imperative to develop accommodative intervening technologies for remediating the as contaminated groundwater especially in decentralized and rural areas kumar et al 2019 sharma et al 2014 ex situ treatment techniques such as the pump and treat technology have been widely developed and even applied practically at the community scale sharma et al 2014 zouboulis and katsoyiannis 2005 the treatment procedure which employs surface adsorption co precipitation ion exchange membrane separation and or biological processing is able to decrease as concentrations from hundreds of μg l to levels below the who guideline alam and mcphedran 2019 bakshi et al 2018 kalaruban et al 2019 mondal et al 2013 montalvo et al 2018 schmidt et al 2016 major drawbacks to prevent the wide commercial application of this method could be the immaturity of specific treatment technology the high cost for material replacement and system maintenance the need of professional operation and the difficulty of disposing as rich wastes clancy et al 2013 kumar et al 2019 as an alternative in situ treatment of geogenic high as groundwater has attracted growing attention recently due to its promising advantages in cost effectiveness system flexibility environmental friendliness and user acceptability pi et al 2017a rathi et al 2017 van halem et al 2010 xie et al 2015 one straightforward approach of in situ as sequestration is supplying oxidants e g oxygen into fe ii rich groundwater to facilitate the generation of fe iii hydr oxides for as adsorption and co precipitation brunsting and mcbean 2014 prommer et al 2018 van halem et al 2010 further adsorption of fe ii onto the mineral surfaces is able to promote the formation of crystalline fe oxide minerals that are more stable than the original amorphous precipitates thus contributing to the long term existence of the fe oxide scavengers in the subsurface sun et al 2018 yang et al 2010 in addition the oxidation of as iii to as v assists in as immobilization due to the greater affinity of as v for the fe oxide minerals under certain ph conditions mondal et al 2013 sharma and sohn 2009 manipulating the heterogeneous oxidation of fe ii can significantly remove as from the groundwater in particular within aquifers rich in dissolved fe ii brunsting and mcbean 2014 van halem et al 2010 however the practical applicability of this approach was questioned by the possibility of aquifer blocking during treatment yet such a problem seemed insignificant either in years of pilot scale operation on the fe ii rich aquifers in central europe appelo et al 1999 or in a short term field trial of in situ as immobilization at the datong basin northern china xie et al 2016 the accelerated groundwater flow by artificial pumping can drive progressive spread out of fe precipitates to further distances and the aging of amorphous fe iii hydr oxides to crystalline fe oxide minerals of smaller size helps to avoid fe iii accumulation around the production well mettler et al 2001 another concern is related to fe ii deficient aquifers such as those from the red river delta and the datong basin where groundwater fe ii concentrations are generally less than 0 3 mg l pi et al 2016 postma et al 2007 the aeration methods could be inefficient for immobilizing as with concentrations up to 3000 μg l in the low fe ii groundwater sharma et al 2014 welch et al 2008 a potential solution to this problem is the periodic introduction of appropriate fe2 solute and efficient oxidants e g clo to enhance the oxidation of both fe ii and as iii in situ singer et al 2013 xie et al 2015 this idea had been proven feasible in concept by laboratory column experiments xie et al 2015 and in small scale field test xie et al 2016 however there are two critical remaining concerns prior to the practical applications namely the potential interferences of aquifer environments e g shift of ph and redox conditions at the large scale and the viability of this method for the various types of as affected aquifers chanpiwat et al 2017 yuan et al 2018 in addition knowledge about the hydrogeochemical processes controlling the in situ as immobilization remains not well available which consequently weakens the theoretical basis for the wide applicability of such kinds of in situ treatment methods in this study we attempted to explore an in situ remediation method based on the strategy of managed aquifer rehabilitation mar pi et al 2016 wang et al 2014 similarly the mar approach involves the enhanced oxidation process of fe2 delivered in succession with the clo oxidant into the as affected aquifer xie et al 2016 nonetheless a key difference from previous conceptual trails is that mar lays more emphasis on learning from the nature of the target aquifer to design the remediation procedure and on understanding the responses of hydrogeochemical conditions to the treatment process at the pilot scale and over a long time the results thus potentially contribute to the improvement of remediation technology for geogenic as contaminated groundwater with important implications for the engineering demonstration and practical applications 2 materials and methods 2 1 pilot scale field experiment the experimental site ca 75 75 m2 is located at a known as affected village in the central part of the datong basin northern china dy site fig 1 a the target aquifer zone with depths between 20 and 22 5 m below land surface is confined by an overlying layer of silts clays and is mainly composed of sandy sediments see supplementary material for more details the mar system consisted of four injection wells dia 4 5 cm at the upper stream one pumping well dia 25 cm at the downstream and four major monitoring wells in between fig 1b the screening tubes of all the wells crossed the whole aquifer layer after the buildup of a local steady groundwater flow regime by pumping 5 mmol l feso4 30 8 l immediately followed by anoxic water 14 7 l and 2 51 mmol l naclo 30 8 l immediately followed by anoxic water 14 7 l were alternately injected from the four injection wells at a rate of 7 7 l h every 2 h for a total duration of 25 days this procedure was designed to facilitate the transport of introduced agents and avoid the clogging of fe iii precipitates near the injection wells during and after the field experiment hydrochemical parameters e g ec ph eh redox sensitive components e g fe ii as iii as v and other aqueous constituents were measured on site or sampled periodically for laboratory assay pi et al 2017b prior to and 30 days after the field experiment sediment samples were retrieved from the target aquifer at three locations fig 1b and different depths table 1 to analyze the changes in mineral compositions and solid phase as and fe pools 2 2 geophysical monitoring during the period of field experiment the high density electrical tomography method was also used to monitor the transport of injected agents and the generation of fe iii precipitates within the aquifer zone the remediation procedure was able to cause variations in the apparent resistivity ρ s of the aquifer materials over time which can be traced by comparing with the background value at the steady local flow regime fu et al 2011 on the ground of the experimental site 7 measuring cables gl1 gl7 each of which had a total length of 240 m and an electrode spacing of 4 m were deployed equidistantly between iw1 and iw4 to form the high density monitoring network fig 1b the α type wenner device wdzj 3 chongqing benteng digital control technical institute was employed to collect the apparent resistivity signal of the target aquifer zone as a function of time the collected data were inversed and interpreted using the res2dinv software in combination with the hydrogeological observations 2 3 analytical methods major cations and anions in the water samples were analyzed by inductively coupled plasma optical omission spectrometry icp oes icap6300 thermo scientific and ion chromatography ic metrohm 761 compact ic respectively both icp oes and ic had detection limits of 0 01 mg l for the components of interest trace elements were determined by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry icp ms perkinelmer elan drc e with detection limits of 1 μg l the as iii and as v species that had been separated on site with lc sax anion exchange resin cartridges sigma aldrich le et al 2000 and the total as concentrations in water samples were determined by hydride generation atomic fluorescence spectrometry hg afs afs 820 titan with a detection limit of 0 5 μg l standards and sample replicates were routinely tested generating analytical errors within 5 unless otherwise stated aliquots of fresh sediment samples were wet digested to determine total as and fe contents by icp ms and icp oes respectively pi et al 2016 sequential chemical extraction on subsamples obtained from freeze dried cores and subsequent measurements of as and fe by hg afs and icp oes respectively were performed to quantify changes in various solid phase as and fe pools keon et al 2001 see supplementary material parallel sediment samples were freeze dried coated with pure gold and then imaged for morphology and elemental components using ultra high resolution field emission scanning electron microscope fe sem hitachi su8010 and x ray energy dispersive spectroscopy eds ametek edax appollo xp dark brown layered materials on the surfaces of the collected sandy sediments were scratched ground using an agate mortar and then analyzed by x ray diffraction xrd bruker axs d8 focus with a cukα x ray radiation wavelength of 0 15406 nm and a lynxeye detector 2 4 hydrogeochemical modeling in calculating the speciation of aqueous components including as species with phreeqc 3 parkhurst and appelo 2013 the default database wateq4f dat was updated with as equilibrium reactions based on the compilation by couture et al 2010 the eh ph diagram for the as fe s system at 25 c and 1 bar was also produced to illustrate the changes in as speciation during the treatment process instead of using a complex three dimensional model to describe the whole aquifer this study focused on the hydrogeochemical changes in the pumping well and used a reactive transport model built in phreeqc 3 to identify key processes and limiting factors controlling as immobilization this model assumed that the flow path from the injection wells to the pumping well could be represented by 10 cells with a cell length of 5 m the initial hydrochemical components of all cells were considered to be same as the average background hydrochemistry of the target aquifer table s1 the model simulated the cycles of fe2 and clo injections by alternating the composition of the input solution first order kinetic formulations through fitting the observational data were used to describe the oxidation of fe ii and as iii within the aquifer zone markelova et al 2018 according to the sediment analytical results ferrihydrite and goethite were considered as the proxies of poorly crystalline and crystalline fe oxides respectively and also the main sinks for as in line with the up to date approximations jessen et al 2012 sø et al 2018a stollenwerk et al 2007 stolze et al 2019 the diffuse double layer ddl model dzombak and morel 1990 and the charge distribution multisite ion complexation cd music model hiemstra and vanriemsdijk 1996 were used to describe the adsorption of as species on ferrihydrite and goethite respectively besides other competing components including carbonate sulfate fe ii and si species were included in these surface complexation models table s2 s3 see supplementary material for model details 3 results and discussion 3 1 hydrogeochemical shifts as a result of the 25 d amendment the ph drop following the increase within the early 3 5 days was accompanied with significant almost simultaneous decrease in eh value in the monitoring wells mw2 and mw3 and in the pumping well pw1 respectively fig 2 a 2b generally the responses of ph and eh shifts in the monitoring wells took place sequentially depending on their distances to the injection well iw3 the second remarkable ph decrease occurred along with the gradual increase of eh value up to nearly 0 mv in these wells during the next 5 10 days suggesting the buildup of circumneutral and oxidizing conditions in the target aquifer zone fig 2a 2b regardless of significant fluctuations during the early stage of treatment the ph and eh values tended to stabilize by the end and exhibited no further remarkable variations during the 215 d monitoring period following the remediation procedure one of the reasons for ph decrease is proton release as a consequence of fe2 oxidative precipitation eq 1 the ph decline occurring sequentially in wells along the groundwater flow path over time fig 2a thus indicates the progressive influence of the introduced fe2 under the controlled groundwater flow another reason could be the adsorption of fe2 on the surfaces of neo formed fe iii phases that also released protons into the groundwater eq 2 van halem et al 2010 however ph variation was likely to trigger the quick response of carbonate dissolution precipitation equilibrium and the strong buffering capacity of dissolved bicarbonate av 469 mg l could partially counteract the released proton eq 3 thereby contributing to the ph stabilization at the end of field experiment appelo and postma 2005 1 2 fe 2 clo 3 h 2 o 2 feooh s cl 4 h 2 feooh s fe 2 h 2 o feoofeoh s 2 h 3 co 2 h 2 o h 2 co 3 hco 3 h co 3 2 2 h the amendment also resulted in gradual increase of dissolved fe ii concentrations in the monitoring wells and pumping well during the first 20 days fig 2c however significant decreases were observed during a short period of following 2 3 days these changes thus reflect the oxidation of fe2 by the subsequent oxidant clo xie et al 2016 the further slow decrease in dissolved fe ii concentrations after the remediation procedure likely implies the accumulation of fe ii on the surfaces of produced fe iii hydro oxides eq 2 and resultant fe ii catalyzed transformation of the fe precipitates van halem et al 2010 xie et al 2015 dissolved sulfide concentrations in the groundwater were below 5 μg l throughout the field experiment and during the following monitoring period 3 2 groundwater arsenic variations according to the results from the monitoring wells dissolved as concentrations in the target aquifer decreased gradually from an initial average value of 78 0 μg l to 9 8 μg l at the end of the 25 d amendment with an estimated as removal rate of 87 for the groundwater being treated fig s1 next 215 d monitoring indicates that groundwater as concentrations slightly fluctuated between 10 and 15 μg l after the amendment and then maintained the level of about 10 μg l in most of the wells significant decrease in groundwater as concentrations firstly occurred near the injection wells and the as retention front appeared to move forward along the groundwater flow from the injection wells to the pumping well fig s1 these results clearly indicate that as in the groundwater of the target aquifer had been scavenged successfully likewise dissolved as concentration in the pumping well pw1 decreased from initial 80 2 to 11 9 μg l at the end of field experiment fig 3 simultaneously the dissolved as v to total as as v ast ratio increased from 26 5 to 68 5 demonstrating the shift from as iii dominance before the amendment to growing prevalence of as v species in the groundwater over time this shift suggests that the oxidation of as iii to as v may have occurred as well upon the injection of clo eq 4 4 2 feoofeoh s 4 h 3 aso 3 5 cio 4 feoh 2 aso 4 s 5 ci 3 h 2 o the decrease of dissolved as iii concentration in parallel with that of total as implies that the as iii oxidation process should contribute to the removal of as from the groundwater the inference is based on the finding that the oxidized as v has a greater affinity for fe oxide minerals and fe containing sediments than as iii under the weakly alkaline and circumneutral conditions jessen et al 2005 nguyen et al 2014 sø et al 2018a consequently both as iii and as v in the treated groundwater from the pumping well were kept below 10 μg l and the as v ast ratio remained at approximately 70 during the following monitoring period fig 3 the evolved oxidizing conditions within the target aquifer could also favor the existence of oxidized as v either in the groundwater or on the sediment surfaces brunsting and mcbean 2014 zhang et al 2017 3 3 changes in sedimental iron and arsenic pools the sem eds analyses discerned no apparent fe oxide minerals in the sediment sample collected from the site cs1 at the depth of 21 3 m cs1 2 prior to the amendment fig 4 a and as content was below the detection limit 0 5 wt of eds measurement fig 4b our previous investigations suggested that fe oxide minerals acted as the major host of as in the aquifers of the dy site but they seemed to exist as relatively minor components compared to the silicate minerals in the sediments pi et al 2016 2017b by contrast after the field experiment sediment surfaces were coated with relatively large size fe rich particles cs1 2 fig 4c and the associated as contents increased to 5 6 0 4 wt in three similar particles these observations support that the remediation procedure had successfully led to the deposition of fe precipitates on sediments and the concurrent sequestration of as identifying mineral types with xrd indicates that as opposed to undisturbed sediment samples that mainly comprised quartz and phyllosilicates background fig 5 sediments collected after the amendment contained remarkable amounts of various fe oxide minerals ferrihydrite possibly in the 6 l form as identified one primary type of fe iii hydroxides produced from fe ii oxidative precipitation johnston et al 2011 was detected in all of the sediment samples after treatment although the intensities of its characteristic peaks were not very strong presumably due to the poor crystallinity fig 5 the xrd data clearly indicate the formation of goethite α form most probably in the target aquifer as well particularly in sample cs1 2 which is close to the injection well iw3 fig 5 the better crystalline goethite was likely produced from the aging of ferrihydrite upon the surface adsorption of fe ii as it could catalyze the mineral phase transformation pedersen et al 2005 the chemical extraction results show significant net increases in total fe and as contents in the sediment samples collected 30 days after the field experiment with an incremental range of 1 17 7 51 g kg and 0 47 5 87 mg kg respectively table 1 these results are in accordance with the enhanced signals of fe and as detected in the eds measurement fig 4d notably phosphate extractable as increased by 0 18 3 77 mg kg in post treatment sediments except in sample cs3 1 which exhibited a slight decrease table 1 such changes suggest that a large part of as removed from the groundwater was most probably adsorbed onto the neo formed fe oxide minerals substantial increases in fe contents were observed in both the poorly crystalline and crystalline fe oxide fractions but greater net increments mostly occurred in the crystalline fe oxide pool with an average of 3 44 g kg correspondingly the crystalline fe oxide associated as increased to larger extents av 1 08 mg kg than as in the poorly crystalline fe pool av 0 02 mg kg thus the crystalline fe oxides may be an important sink for as agreeing with our laboratory experimental observations xie et al 2015 3 4 tracing of remediation by geophysical signals shown in fig 6 is the difference δρ s between the apparent resistivity measured at various days of the experimental period and the background value for the middle depth of the target aquifer zone the horizontal contour maps fig 6a e illustrate that the range of observed δρ s expanded with the proceeding of the field experiment suggesting enlarging coverage in the target aquifer by the treatment process over time in particular there were substantial increases in the ρ s values at areas between the injection wells iw3 iw4 and the pumping well pw1 generally by 0 3 1 0 ω m at the end of the field experiment under the experimental conditions these differences could be ascribed to the injection of amending agents and the formation of fe oxide coatings on the surfaces of sediment particles campanella and weemees 1990 slater et al 2000 compared to the background value the appreciable decreases in ρ s values during the early 10 days of the field experiment e g fig 6f 6g could be due to the introduction of external solutes including so4 2 and na into the groundwater that increased the specific conductivity of the aquifer materials however the precipitation of fe iii hydro oxides on the sediment surfaces probably increased the apparent resistivity of the aquifer materials as reflected by the rising ρ s values during the next 15 days fig 6f 6g in other words the observed ρ s changes as represented by the expanding red clouds that covered most of the aquifer area at the end of the experiment fig 6e could be indicative of the regional impact of the remediation procedure the not very homogeneous distribution of the red clouds on the other hand indicates that the fe oxide coatings may be not uniformly produced in the target zone presumably due to the variable groundwater flow and deposition effectiveness at different places of the target aquifer pi et al 2016 the increasing trend of the ρ s value at the point adjacent to the pumping well x 49 5 m y 37 5 m fig 6g for the middle depth of the aquifer zone was comparable to that of fe ii concentration in the pumping well pw1 over time fig 2c an increasing aqueous fe ii concentration may favor a higher possibility of enhanced production of fe iii hydro oxides from the fe ii oxidation by clo and thus a stronger response in the δρ s value such similarity is probably the further clue that the transport of fe ii along the controlled groundwater flow and subsequent formation of fe oxide coatings on the sediment surfaces had been successfully traced by the variations in the apparent resistivity signals 3 5 modeling insights into arsenic immobilization scattering the data from all the monitoring wells on the eh ph diagram of the as fe s system suggests that the as species were distributed along the boundary of haso4 2 h3aso3 under the reducing and alkaline conditions of the undisturbed aquifer red dots fig 7 as measured the groundwater as species was originally a mixing of as iii and as v whilst in some monitoring wells the as iii species dominated table s1 in accordance with the increase of eh and decrease of ph values as a result of the amendment aqueous fe ii including the injected parts tended to transform into the fe iii hydr oxides and haso4 2 became the preferably stable major as species in the treated groundwater black arrow fig 7 these shifts help the strong adsorption of as v on the neo formed fe oxide minerals feoh2aso4 in fig 7 and contribute to as removal from the groundwater blue dots fig 7 brunsting and mcbean 2014 van halem et al 2010 the relatively significant drop in ph values of some water samples however increased the potential of h3aso3 occurrence at the higher eh values even after treatment green dots fig 7 this tendency may partly explain why a small amount of as iii was still detected in the groundwater from the pumping well even though the total as concentration had been rather low fig 3 the thermodynamic analysis overall supports the inference that the hydrogeochemical changes have facilitated the immobilization of as from the groundwater despite the simplified assumption on the hydrogeological conditions of the target aquifer the reactive transport modeling well captured the decreasing trend of total as concentration in the groundwater from the pumping well fig 3 the exponential attenuation of dissolved as iii concentration as simulated with a rate constant of 0 122 d 1 contributed to the production of as v in the groundwater however because of the simultaneous formation of new fe oxide minerals providing more adsorption sites for as v over time the as v concentration was predicted to rise only slightly in the early 6 days and then decrease during the later period of the remediation procedure fig 3 with the ddl model the simulated surface complex distribution indicates that as v only occupied 1 of ferrihydrite surface sites and as iii adsorption was nearly negligible at the end of the field experiment major competing components toward as species for the adsorption on ferrihydrite seemed to be h4sio4 and co3 2 which accounted for 68 and 27 of the surface sites respectively previous studies using the ddl model for either synthesized minerals or natural sediments in as affected aquifers also found that as v and as iii were not substantially adsorbed on ferrihydrite in the presence of these two competing components appelo et al 2002 gao et al 2013 jessen et al 2012 while as iii was still little bound to the produced goethite as v complexes as estimated by the cd music model jessen et al 2012 kanematsu et al 2013 possibly occupied 15 of the binding sites on the goethite surfaces by contrast h4sio4 and co3 2 surface complexes only accounted for 9 6 and 10 of the binding sites respectively thus exhibiting much weaker competitive effects toward the as species similarly other studies revealed that under similar ph conditions as v showed a stronger adsorption capacity than as iii for sediments in which crystalline fe oxides e g goethite were the major fe minerals neidhardt et al 2018 nguyen et al 2014 postma et al 2007 the substantial as v adsorption may have majorly contributed to the immobilization of as v and thus the removal of as from the groundwater no further significant drop in total as concentration after the cease of the remediation procedure could be partially attributed to the slackened oxidation processes of fe ii and as iii fig 3 moreover the partitioning equilibrium for as species between the solid and aqueous phases may be maintained and the competitive adsorption of other dissolved components e g h4sio4 and co3 2 could still play a part pi et al 2018 postma et al 2016 stollenwerk et al 2007 the modeling results additionally estimate that the not completely removable but rather low as level in the groundwater from the pumping well would likely be sustained for a period of few years if no other perturbations occur fig s2 whilst it remains to be verified by successive monitoring 3 6 implications for managed aquifer rehabilitation in natural reducing aquifers the reductive dissolution of as bound fe oxide minerals has been considered one of the major processes responsible for the occurrence of high as groundwater fendorf et al 2010 mcarthur et al 2001 stüben et al 2003 wang et al 2019 the managed immobilization of as in this study is like an inverse process of as mobilization in those aquifers the apparent inverse relationship between dissolved fe ii and as concentrations in the pumping well fig s3 suggests that as removal was primarily controlled by the supply of fe2 the increased abundance of as in the fe coatings on amended sediments fig 4 and table 1 manifests that the fe oxide minerals produced from fe ii oxidative precipitation may have served as a powerful scavenger for groundwater as van halem et al 2010 xie et al 2015 the induced shifts in the hydrogeochemical conditions turned out to be conducive to the oxidation of as iii to as v and the enhanced sequestration of as v omoregie et al 2013 singer et al 2013 welch et al 2008 besides the buildup of oxidizing conditions is not only able to hinder the reductive dissolution of natural fe containing minerals but also to assist in the long persistence of the neo formed fe oxide mineral phases the maintained low as levels during the 215 d monitoring period suggest that the fe coatings have been taking effect after terminating the supply of oxidant meanwhile neither quick drop in eh values nor significant increase in dissolved fe ii concentrations was observed fig 2 implying that fe oxide reduction did not resume the injection of clo might have also sterilized the indigenous microorganisms and thus suppressed the microbial activities that mediate the reduction processes yoo 2018 water quality problems related to chlorohydrocarbon secondary pollution did not arise either therefore the pilot scale field experiment demonstrates that the mar based method can be a beneficial alternative for in situ high as groundwater remediation in particular its major advantage lies in geogenic non point source high as groundwater that is difficult to remediate by the pump and treat and the permeable reactive barrier methods gibert et al 2010 maier et al 2017 wilkin et al 2009 zouboulis and katsoyiannis 2005 while the as removal efficiency in different cases is linked to the groundwater types the original as concentrations and the cycles of treatment the overall as removal rate of 87 over the 25 d amendment shows competitiveness toward those 50 90 of ex situ treatment system schmidt et al 2016 chemically enhanced natural attenuation hafeznezami et al 2017 and in situ fe assisted aeration methods appelo et al 1999 van halem et al 2010 compared to the ex situ methods sharma et al 2014 this mar based in situ remediation has the potential to meet explicit requirements of operational safety with low health risks low technical maintenance end user convenience and no disposal of as enriched wastes it is however worth noting that the redox condition plays a critical role in regulating the geochemical processes responsible for as immobilization fig 7 results of the present study infer that the mar approach based on the enhanced fe ii oxidation is more suitable for weakly reducing to oxidizing aquifers that can be hydrogeochemically regulated via the supply of oxidants concerns on the re occurring of as bound fe oxide reduction remain to be dispelled by longer monitoring and such a problem may shorten the service life of this technology zhang et al 2017 the formation of goethite in the aquifer zone is potentially conducive to long term as immobilization since the better crystalline fe oxide minerals could be more resistant to abiotic or microbial reduction singer et al 2013 sun et al 2018 this study also warrants future larger scale field demonstration of the mar technology for aquifers with different particularly higher groundwater as concentrations to examine its wide applicability and contingent treatment efficiency 4 conclusions the pilot scale field experiment aiming to in situ remediate high as groundwater based on the managed aquifer rehabilitation was successfully implemented on a sandy aquifer at the datong basin dissolved as in the target aquifer was effectively sequestered by coatings of new fe oxide minerals on sediment surfaces that were produced from the periodical supply of fe2 and clo transport of dissolved fe2 along the controlled groundwater flow and occupation of fe2 exchange sites by neo formed fe iii hydr oxides on sediment surfaces may help fe oxide precipitation taking place throughout the target aquifer to establish a remediation zone and also to avoid aquifer blocking groundwater as concentration dropped from an initial average of 78 0 to 9 8 μg l over the 25 d amendment with an overall as removal rate of 87 the sustained low levels of around 10 μg l as over the 215 d monitoring period after the field experiment indicate the long term effectiveness of the enhanced fe ii oxidation method the hydrogeochemical shifts from moderately alkaline and reducing to circumneutral and oxidizing conditions as a result of the amendment are conducive to the formation of fe oxide minerals and the oxidation of as iii which leads to the production and immobilization of as v most probably via strong adsorption on as well as co precipitation with the new fe oxide minerals the transformation of ferrihydrite into better crystalline goethite may be favorable for the efficient in situ as sequestration and stabilization of immobilized as in the sediments this mar approach has the potential to be applied practically in weakly reducing aquifers in the datong basin and likely other as affected regions with similar hydrogeochemical settings such as the fe ii deficient aquifers in south and southeast asia declaration of

more than 60 of potable water is sourced from forested areas smith et al 2011 stein et al 2005 with rapid population growth and a changing climate these vital water sources are vulnerable to both natural and human made disturbances for example forest fires are of particular concern because they rapidly consume biomass convert forest vegetation into pyrogenic organic matter pyom and change the physical and chemical properties of upper soil layers goforth et al 2005 oliveira filho et al 2018 santín et al 2015 vergnoux et al 2011 wang et al 2016 consequently surface run off regimes that strongly affect the quantity and quality of water exported from forested catchments are markedly altered ellis et al 2004 knoepp et al 2008 furthermore forested watersheds in arid and semi arid regions worldwide are expected to experience higher temperatures and extended droughts resulting in more frequent intense and massive wildfires bowman et al 2009 mehran et al 2017 smith et al 2011 williams et al 2019 pyom materials create hydrophobic soil properties and foster the formation of surface crust resulting in increased water repellency and reduced infiltration into soil profiles goforth et al 2005 as a result increased water yields or even flash floods debris flows commonly originate from burned watersheds during post fire rainstorms mahat et al 2016 malvar et al 2015 further bare soil conditions accelerate soil erosion transporting sediments and nutrients to source waters belillas et al 1993 lane et al 2008 malmon et al 2007 sheridan et al 2007 stevens 2013 additionally elevated levels of turbidity and suspended solids hohner et al 2017 mast et al 2016 murphy et al 2012 and metals abraham et al 2017 are frequently reported in the post wildfire runoff fire temperature and oxygen availability during a wildfire are the principal factors affecting the consumption of detrital biomass and the formation of pyom in wildfire ash thus fire characteristics have a substantial effect on the quality and quantity of terrestrially derived dissolved organic matter dom exported from burned watersheds hohner et al 2016 wang et al 2015 2016 higher fire temperature is expected to increase detritus pyro mineralization gray and dighton 2006 therefore the amount of water leachable dom expressed as dissolved organic carbon doc and dissolved organic nitrogen don concentrations might be expected to be lower in pyom than in the unburned organic matter from which it originated wang et al 2016 however higher doc and don concentrations are frequently reported in stream waters following wildfires hohner et al 2016 revchuk and suffet 2014 writer et al 2014 such discrepancies can be related to enhanced mobility and flushing of dom especially during intense post wildfire precipitation events bladon et al 2008 emelko et al 2011 hohner et al 2016 inamdar and mitchell 2007 murphy et al 2015 stevens 2013 in terms of health related adverse effects from wildfires the occurrence of disinfection by products dbps is one of the main concerns in treated drinking water carbonaceous c dbps trihalomethanes thms and haloacetic acids haas are regulated in drinking water in the us usepa 2006 however recent studies have demonstrated that commonly applied secondary disinfection practices such as chlorination are shifting to chloramination li 2011 which is related to the formation of nitrogenous n nitrosodimethylamine ndma a dbp with more significant health risks than those associated with regulated thms and haas bond et al 2011 plewa et al 2002 richardson et al 2007 since fires have the potential to change the chemical characteristics and release of dom from forest materials the reactivity of dbp precursors originating from wildfires is expected to differ in stream runoff after wildfire events hohner et al 2016 2017 revchuk and suffet 2014 writer et al 2014 previous studies showed post fire increases in doc leaching from burned areas that can augment the levels of precursors for thm revchuk and suffet 2014 and haa writer et al 2014 precursor levels following post wildfire rainstorms nitrogenous n dbp precursors including ndma were high cawley et al 2016 hohner et al 2016 wang et al 2015 while previous studies demonstrated changes in dom and various water quality parameters after wildfires most of these studies were either conducted under controlled laboratory conditions or based on stream water sampling campaigns that did not fully achieve their purpose due to environmental and logistical restrictions currently no study has systematically evaluated the first and second year responses of different watershed conditions i e headwater vs higher order and complete vs partially burned watersheds on post wildfire runoff and their implications for dom release and reactivity of dbp precursors in this study we collected water samples from wildfire impacted watersheds in northern california during all major post fire runoff events covering two consecutive rainy seasons 2016 and 2017 we captured short first year response including initial and subsequent flushes and medium term second year response effects on stream water from two separate burned watersheds and one reference i e unburned watershed the specific objectives of this study were to evaluate the temporal changes in post fire surface water quality with a focus on changes in dom release characterization and reactivity as dbp precursors in burned vs unburned watersheds the results of this study provide valuable information to drinking water providers for assessing potential risks that wildfires pose to drinking water safety 2 materials and methods 2 1 wildfires and site description in july august 2015 the rocky fire jerusalem fire and wragg fire in the northern california coastal ranges consumed 281 km2 102 km2 and 33 km2 of wildlands respectively fig 1 the rocky and jerusalem fires started as two separate fires but eventually merged into a single fire thus to avoid confusion we referred them collectively as the rocky fire geographic information system gis calculations and site observations indicated that the burn area affecting sampling stream was 20 of upper cache watershed hydrological unit code 8 huc 18020116 but exclude the downstream area of sampling point and 90 of the second order watershed a small portion of the huc12 180201620503 mccune creek putah creek in addition based on a previous study wang et al 2020 and the visual indicators i e consumed duff generally dark colored ash and blackened dead standing trees united states department of agriculture usda 2020 these fires can be characterized as medium severity pre burn vegetation was a mixture of oak savanna and woodlands including blue oak quercus douglasii interior live oak quercus wislizenii and scrub oak quercus dumosa chaparral including buckbrush ceanothus cuneatus chamise adenostoma fasciculatum california buckeye aesculus californica toyon heteromeles arbutifolia and manzanita arctostaphylos spec and annual grasslands dominant soils were inceptisols and alfisols formed on mixed sedimentary parent materials watersheds were dominated by moderate 15 to steeply 45 sloping topography resulting in high water erosion potential the area has a mediterranean climate characterized by hot dry summers and mild rainy winters with the majority of the precipitation occurring between november and march records for the berryessa dam fig s1 located adjacent to the cold creek watershed indicated that the area received 431 and 1029 mm of total precipitation during the first rainy season jan 5 and april 10 2016 and the second rainy season dec 15 2016 and march 31 2017 intense rainy seasons respectively department of water resources dwr 2017 rainfall patterns were identical between the reference and wragg fire watershed as they were located within a few km of each other winter rainfall events in northern california are large storms originating in the pacific ocean that affect large land areas unlike classic thunderstorms these storms do not show large differences in precipitation at small spatial scales thus we assumed that all three watersheds in this study received rainfall from the same storms although the total rainfall amounts might not differ significantly among watersheds 2 2 water sample collection three sampling locations outlets of watersheds fig 1 were established to assess the effects postfire rainstorms on water quality at the watershed scale samples from the wragg fire were collected from the outlet of cold creek 38 30 43 31 n 122 5 50 02 w which drains the significant part of a burned watershed the quality of water samples collected from the burned watershed was compared to the quality of water samples collected from an adjacent reference watershed that was not affected by wildfire miller canyon creek 8 27 4 94 n 122 3 22 97 w the two watersheds have similar geology soils topography and vegetation importantly the wragg fire did not burn any of the land areas within the reference watershed therefore the reference watershed served as a burned vs unburned watershed comparison for the wragg fire streamflow from the cold creek and miller canyon creek was intermittent with flow only during the rainy season thus the sampling frequency was governed by weather conditions fig s1 during the first year s sampling there were six sixteen and seventeen reference rocky and wragg fire samples collected across the sampling period respectively but no reference sample for the very first flushes due to a hydrologic lag that resulted from the vegetated landscape nonetheless we didn t miss the collection of the early reference samples it was a function of the hydrologic lag in generating streamflow during the second year s sampling there were sixteen samples for reference and rocky fire and seventeen samples for wragg fire regarding flow regimes there were two distinct rainfall periods in the first rainy season jan 5 and april 10 2016 because of the lack of rainfall during february 2016 we defined the runoff from these two periods as season 1 initial flushes s1 if jan 5 22 2016 and season 1 subsequent flushes s1 sf mar 5 apr 10 2016 in the second rainy season dec 15 2016 mar 31 2017 rainfall was more continuous after the onset of the rainy season and we labeled this period as season 2 flushes s2 f fig s1 for the wragg fire flows we measured instantaneous discharge from the water velocity cross sectional area when the flows were below 0 14 m3 s for the flow 0 14 m3 s we determined the flow as the difference between putah creek flow about 1 6 km downstream of wragg input usgs station 11454000 minus dam release berryessa from immediately upstream of the wragg fire stream the calculations were acceptable until feb 16 2017 when the spillway overflowed and there were no reliable measurements for water releases from berryessa reservoir fig s2a in terms of the geology and soil characteristics the reference watershed 78 km2 does not represent the larger cache creek watershed 3017 km2 in which the rocky fire took place however its topography and vegetation were like those of the reference watershed samples from the rocky fire were collected from cache creek at a location 38 55 24 83 n 122 19 35 32 w that captured the burned watershed area below clear lake in general the water in cache creek mainly originated from the watershed area below clear lake shown in fig 1 as the water was impounded in the winter for subsequent release for spring summer irrigation grab samples were collected from a well mixed stream section for selected storm events and base flow conditions representative flow data were available from usgs gauging station 11451800 located downstream of the water quality sampling point fig s2b the difference in flow between the clear lake outflow usgs station 11451800 and the downstream flow station was used to calculate flow generated from the watershed area containing the wildfire flow data indicated that the water sampling point mainly received runoff from the burned watershed area the ratio of the lake discharge sampling point flow was 0 5 during initial flushes of the first rainy season fig s2c therefore the proportion of burned areas below clear lake contributing to the sampling point was 40 during the initial flushes however the averaged contribution of water released from the lake was 26 and 48 during the sampling periods corresponding to the subsequent flushes and the second rainy season s flushes respectively consequently the impact of the rocky fire was attenuated by dilution especially during the later portion of each annual water collection period 2 3 analytical methods 2 3

maximum minimum 90th 75th median 25th and 10th quartile metrics fig s3 3 results and discussion 3 1 release of suspended solids post fire rainstorms resulted in the release of high amounts of eroded particles from barren soils of the burned areas during the first rainy season in the unburned reference watershed measured values average std were 36 47 ntu 362 478 pt co and 96 158 mg l for turbidity apparent color and total suspended solids tss respectively figs s4a b and c in contrast burned areas saw significantly higher p 0 05 values 871 747 and 4478 6720 ntu 6014 6098 and 28316 40248 pt co and 613 626 and 4795 6237 mg l for the rocky and wragg fires respectively during the first rainy season initial flushes but decreasing trends 1337 1775 and 137 138 ntu 6522 8266 and 3399 4272 pt co and 1066 1303 and 700 1127 mg l for the rocky and wragg fires respectively during the first rainy season s subsequent flushes especially for the wragg fire tss vs turbidity and apparent color showed strong positive linear correlations r2 0 9 for all watersheds table s2 during the second rainy season s flushes measured values for all three constituents increased p 0 05 in the reference site figs s4a b and c higher precipitation 431 vs 1029 mm in the second rainy season likely caused higher erosion and particle transport in the reference watershed for the rocky fire values turbidity color and tss were comparable between the first and second years as only a portion of the cache creek watershed was burned by the rocky fire the water quality response was not as strong as that found in the wragg watershed which was more extensively burned 90 second year values for the wragg fire showed a remarkable decrease with values like the reference site the sharp decrease in suspended sediments resulted from rapid erosion of the ash layer in the first year followed by decreased erosion due to rapid re vegetation of the burned watershed by stump sprouting shrubs and annual grasses in the second year these findings are consistent with other studies that show distinct flushing of sediments color and tss during the initial storm events following wildfires emelko et al 2011 hohner et al 2018 2016 mast et al 2016 murphy et al 2015 2012 son et al 2015 writer et al 2014 quick mobilization of fire generated particles into the watershed increased concentrations of suspended solid related parameters particularly during the initial storm events on the other hand the first post fire rainy season had total dissolved solids tds calculated by subtracting tss concentrations from total solids ts averaged values 96 156 262 109 and 329 456 mg l in the reference rocky and wragg fire samples respectively fig s4d however all averaged values were lower than the epa secondary drinking water standard of 500 mg l usepa 2012 the tds ts ratios in the rocky 24 and wragg fire 10 samples were significantly lower p 0 05 than those in the samples from the reference watershed 73 table s3 indicating higher erosion rates in burned watersheds for the first post fire rainy season during the second post fire rainy season the averaged tds ts decreased in the reference watershed from 73 to 24 p 0 05 however the tds ts ratios in reference 24 samples were lower compared to those in the rocky 43 and wragg fire 37 samples these data indicate increased erosion in the reference watershed and quick mobilization of fire generated suspended solids during the first rainy season especially in the more extensively 90 burned watershed 3 2 release of aromatic carbon during the first post fire rainy season doc concentrations were not statistically different p 0 05 in reference 5 4 2 6 mg l vs rocky fire samples 4 9 1 6 mg l fig 2 a however the wragg fire samples had significantly higher p 0 05 doc concentration 9 0 2 2 mg l during the first rainy season s initial flushes compared to the reference and rocky fire samples it has been indicated that the production of mg carbon g detritus materials is highly dependent on fire severity wang et al 2015 therefore we may expect a significant decrease in the release of doc after high severity fires however the release of doc from wragg fire was higher than that released from the reference during the initial flushes this is consistent with the predominantly medium severity of wragg fire that resulted in higher doc release and mobility from the more mobile ash derived carbon pools generated from the burned watersheds during the initial flushes during subsequent rain events the doc concentration in the reference and rocky fire samples did not change significantly p 0 05 4 9 3 0 mg l vs 4 9 1 6 mg l however significant decreases p 0 05 were observed from an average of 9 0 to 4 9 mg l compared to those of initial flushes in the wragg fire samples this observation indicates that fires can increase the release of doc but the response will be more apparent as the percentage of the burned watershed area increases during the second rainy season the averaged doc values decreased to 3 8 4 2 mg l across all watersheds fig 2a this observation is consistent with previous findings where recently generated ash had higher doc leaching potential than did weathered leached ash wang et al 2016 overall these findings indicate that while fires consume large amounts of litter vegetation they can generate more mobile doc that is quickly flushed 1 year from the burned watersheds in the post fire runoff for the first rainy season in general the average suva254 did not change significantly p 0 05 and overlapped for all sample groups fig 2b during the initial flushes the suva254 values were 3 2 0 4 and 3 3 0 7 l mg m for the reference and the rocky fire samples respectively however the wragg fire samples only showed 31 17 higher 4 5 0 6 l mg m values that decreased to 3 1 0 5 l mg m similar to reference and rocky fire over subsequent rain events higher suva254 values suggest greater aromaticity of the dom fraction weishaar et al 2003 during the initial flushes previous research found that ash materials abraham et al 2017 and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon pah structures form during wildfires vila escalé et al 2007 and these newly generated compounds can increase the hydrophobicity of water and soil materials moreover wang et al 2015 showed that the suva254 values of the water leachate of ash materials follow the order white ash high temperature unburned detritus black ash cooler temperature thus the higher p 0 05 suva254 in the wragg fire samples during the first rainy season s initial flushes may be related to the newly generated white ash and pahs that reach peak concentration in recently burned sites tsibart et al 2014 and decrease over time with precipitation and leaching olivella et al 2006 vila escalé et al 2007 thus the decreasing trend in aromaticity of the wragg fire samples during the first rainy season s subsequent flushes may be related to the rapid removal by erosion leaching of these newly generated aromatic hydrophobic compounds by the second rainy season the average suva254 values for the reference and burned watersheds were comparable 3 2 0 7 2 8 0 7 and 3 3 0 8 l mg m for reference rocky and wragg fire samples respectively fig 2b this confirms that the fire generated aromatic compounds flushed quickly from burned watersheds and there were no significant seasonal changes in leaching of those newly generated materials soil ph increases after wildfire due to the mineralization and release of acidic volatiles certini 2005 wang et al 2015 2016 and the concentration of ca2 mg2 k and na as oxides hydroxides and carbonates certini 2005 especially in newly burned organic matter revchuk and suffet 2014 therefore post fire stream runoff may increase the ph of downstream surface waters son et al 2015 possibly resulting in a higher solubility of dom however the length of ph enhancement was variable up to 3 years certini 2005 granged et al 2011 oliver et al 2012 wang et al 2015 in our study average stream water ph values were not significantly different p 0 05 for burned vs reference samples ph range 7 91 8 33 fig s5 findings from our study indicate that several factors e g burning severity mobility of newly generated dom soil buffering capacity weathering conditions play a role in regulating the ph of stream water in burned watersheds 3 3 fire affects the nitrogen cycle nitrogen plays a vital role for all watershed organisms wilhelm 2009 but increased nutrients i e n p in downstream water bodies can cause adverse effects such as eutrophication and harmful algal blooms bladon et al 2014 emelko et al 2016 santín et al 2018 during the first post fire rainy season tdn consisted mainly 98 92 and 90 in the reference rocky and wragg fire samples respectively of organic nitrogen in the reference samples average tdn data not shown don and nh4 n concentrations were 0 38 0 33 0 05 mg l respectively however those values were significantly higher p 0 05 in the fire impacted samples fig 3 a and b in contrast the no2 data not shown and no3 fig 3c concentrations were generally lower than the mrls presented in si in all watersheds notably the don concentrations in the wragg fire samples were significantly higher than those in the rocky fire samples this likely reflects the higher percentage of burned areas occurring in the wragg fire watershed despite lower tdn and don leaching capacities from ash wang et al 2016 and soil samples homann et al 2011 found in some studies elevated concentrations of tdn don and nh4 have been reported by others in stream waters following wildfires bladon et al 2008 hohner et al 2016 murphy et al 2015 son et al 2015 these nitrogen forms tend to accumulate in the ashy materials following release by pyromineralization of vegetation litter and are quickly mobilized and transported via surface runoff erosion following wildfires knicker 2010 knicker et al 2005 mast et al 2016 neary et al 2005 additionally the doc don ratio was significantly lower p 0 05 in the rocky 5 0 1 63 and wragg fires 4 9 1 85 samples compared to reference 17 4 5 87 fig s6 this lower doc don ratio from burned watershed samples is consistent with a laboratory study where a lower doc don ratio resulted from wildfire ash leachates compared to a control hohner et al 2016 ranalli 2004 wang et al 2015 in the second year post fire both the tdn data not shown and don concentrations decreased in all samples compared to the first rainy season most likely as a result of dilution due to much higher precipitation in year two however both the tdn and don concentrations remained higher in the burned watersheds relative to the reference watershed this indicates that tdn and don continued to leach from the burned sites for extended periods 1 year the average no3 concentrations were highest for the second rainy season fig 3c consistent with several previous studies koyama et al 2010 mast et al 2016 murphy et al 2015 smith et al 2011 a lower doc don ratio fig s6 and mineralization of organic matter from the ash soil leads to the accumulation of nh4 as plant uptake is attenuated following the fire these conditions provide a favorable environment for nitrifying microorganisms to thrive and generate no3 which is highly mobile and susceptible to leaching given the slow growth of nitrifying microorganisms under the cold winter conditions no3 generation and leaching were hindered in the burned areas in the first year following wildfire acea and carballas 1996 in summary in the first year following wildfire there was a decrease in the doc don ratio and an increase in the release in nh4 and don which made up the majority of tdn these conditions probably stimulated nitrification which in turn resulted in delayed transport of no3 from the watershed in the second year following the wildfire this was consistent with a recent study where the nitrate level was an order of magnitude higher in burned catchment stream water compared to unburned catchment stream water rhoades et al 2019 3 4 changes in dom composition following wildfire eem regions and fluorescence indices provide information about dom sources chemical characteristics and dynamics in aquatic ecosystems fellman et al 2010 and wildfire can alter the eem fluoresce regions of dom revchuk and suffet 2014 wang et al 2015 considering the potential interference of metals e g iron on optical measurements such as suva254 and fluorescence measurements poulin et al 2014 weishaar et al 2003 we analyzed only samples having iron concentrations 0 03 mg l thus the number of measurements n 2 for the reference watershed for the first rainy season was limited as a result it was not possible to apply statistical analysis between reference and burned watershed samples which limits a definitive conclusion although the doc content and sample collection periods 4 1 and 8 4 mg l for initial flushes and subsequent flushes respectively were different for those two samples dom characteristics were similar table 1 considering also a minimal variability of the second year measurements n 6 we concluded that the dom character did not significantly change in the reference samples therefore we interpreted our results accordingly results showed that eem region contributions for the reference samples were dominated by humic acid like dom 56 during the first post fire rainy season in contrast the rocky and wragg fire samples were distinctly different from reference samples for the first runoff event for the rocky fire n 3 for the wragg fire n 4 during the first rainy season s initial flushes humic like and fulvic like components contributed 31 33 of dom while tryptophan like and tyrosine like components contributed 16 and 2 4 of dom in the burned watershed samples after 3 4 flushes for the percentage of humic like dom came to a level comparable to the level in the reference this process was rapid compared 2 years to a previous study revchuk and suffet 2014 also dom from burned watersheds had significantly higher p 0 05 fulvic acid and protein like components as well as lower soluble microbial by product like smp compositions this suggests the formation release of fulvic like dom and protein like dom fellman et al 2010 as well as lower molecular weight mw microbial dom sources resulting from the fire and or post fire biological activity revchuk and suffet 2014 higher tyrosine like and especially tryptophan like regions indicated that amino acids and aromatic proteins mainly intact proteins and less degraded peptides were generated by post fire biological activity chen et al 2003 fellman et al 2010 however these compounds were likely flushed from the watershed during the initial 3 4 flushes contributing to the higher don exported from the burned watersheds fig 3a averaged fluorescence index fi values for the reference and rocky fire samples were similar 1 55 0 01 n 2 and 1 57 0 03 n 7 respectively however the wragg fire samples had higher values 1 70 0 04 n 8 during the first flush table 1 unlike previous work hohner et al 2016 our results suggest extensive wildfires can increase fi value the humification index hix and freshness index β α for the reference samples were 8 43 1 90 and 0 65 0 01 n 2 respectively in contrast the rocky and wragg fire samples had higher hix and β α values during the initial flushes for rocky 10 22 3 02 and 0 81 0 02 n 3 for the wragg 24 35 7 50 and 0 89 0 01 n 4 these elevated values decreased slowly with subsequent rainfall runoff events considering the change in the dom composition these observations indicate that wildfires can consume much of the terrestrial dom sources and enhanced microbial activity from residuals may generate lower mw of dom in the burned watersheds revchuk and suffet 2014 tsai et al 2017 valenca et al 2020 wang et al 2015 in addition the newly formed dom is likely more mobile resulting in its rapid flushing from the watershed for the second rainy season the eem average humic like region 78 increased significantly across all watersheds and fi hix and β α values were similar across burned and reference watersheds thus the dom spectroscopic properties indicate that wildfire has a pronounced short term 1 year effect on dom quality but dom quickly reverts to characteristics like the reference watershed in the second year post fire 3 5 doc governs thm and haa precursor concentrations during the first post fire rainy season average thm haa and ch fp concentrations in the reference and the rocky fire samples were 540 339 355 208 and 73 52 μg l and 504 236 360 223 and 45 34 μg l respectively notably the wragg fire samples had higher average thm and haa concentrations of 687 279 and 616 421 μg l respectively fig 4 a b and c but similar values for ch fps 68 43 μg l compared to both the reference and rocky fire samples correlations for doc vs thm and haa fps were strongly positive r2 0 7 while doc vs ch fp correlations was moderately positive 0 5 r2 0 7 table s4 rumsey 2016 therefore the higher thm and haa fps were associated with higher doc concentrations 40 in the wragg fire samples fig 2a doc normalized concentrations were further calculated to examine the reactivity of dbp precursors per unit of carbon results showed that the carbon normalized average reactivity and variability of thm and haa precursors were within a similar range for all samples thm fp doc 99 18 μg mg c haa fp doc 70 27 μg mg c these data are consistent with previous studies that showed that the carbon normalized reactivity of c dbp precursors was not significantly affected by wildfire hohner et al 2016 writer et al 2014 therefore the increase in c dbp precursor concentrations cawley et al 2016 revchuk and suffet 2014 was due mainly to the enhanced mobility of doc especially during the first post fire runoff events in contrast carbon normalized ch fp values decreased 30 in the rocky and wragg fire samples compared to the reference samples previously wang et al 2016 showed that doc and ch fp yields μg g detritus for wildfire ash samples were lower compared to their unburned source materials thus alteration of doc quantity and quality both appear to affect the reactivity of ch precursors results further showed that ndma fp values 27 8 6 and 28 16 0 ng l for rocky and wragg fire samples respectively were significantly p 0 05 higher in the burned watershed samples compared to reference samples 18 5 9 ng l fig 4d these results are consistent with studies by wang et al 2015 2016 that showed ash sample leachates had relatively higher ndma fp compared to their unburned source materials since ndma fp did not correlate with don or tdn uzun et al 2015 and several known precursors are anthropogenic derived ruecker et al 2017 uzun et al 2017 2015 such an increase may be explained by the use of human made compounds such as fire suppressants during the fire or the release of some of the ndma precursors by high temperature burns also carbon normalized ndma fp values were higher p 0 05 in the rocky fire samples 5 8 2 4 ng mg c compared to wragg fire samples 3 9 1 07 ng mg c during the first rainy season this may be related to more anthropogenic activity in the cache creek watershed rocky fire in addition correlations between ndma fps and nitrogen species don and inorganic nitrogen were weak r2 0 5 during the second post fire rainy season significant decreases were observed in thm and haa fps in all watersheds as well as carbon normalized reactivity values were similar across both burned and unburned samples indicating that the wildfire effects were short term ch fp levels were similar to those in samples from the previous rainy season considering doc trends and linear correlations between docs and c dbps table s4 the lower thm and haa fps could be due to lower doc concentrations resulting from the greater rainfall amounts dilution in the second year however the decrease in normalized carbon values cannot be explained by dilution suggesting that some changes in dom characteristics ratio changes especially for fulvic acid like vs humic acid like dom which caused lower dbp yields as well the ndma fp levels were similar between years for all watersheds but the normalized carbon values were relatively higher in the second year considering the lower doc levels in the second year this finding further confirms that doc is not a good proxy for ndma precursors bond et al 2011 uzun et al 2015 yang et al 2015 3 6 formation of more toxic brominated thms and haas in this section bromine incorporation factors bifs are calculated krasner et al 2008 and discussed for thms and haas we present the concentrations for the bromide doc thm and haa fps in molar units bromide concentrations in the reference samples were significantly lower 0 16 0 15 μm n 6 fig 3d than those found in the rocky fire 1 35 0 9 μm 2 96 1 81 n 9 initial nine flushes and 0 54 0 26 n 7 subsequent seven flushes and wragg fire samples 1 67 2 29 μm 4 05 3 56 n 9 initial nine flushes and 0 65 0 64 μm n 8 subsequent eight flushes fig 5 wang et al 2015 showed that increased fire severity enhanced the yield of br from ash leachates as a higher degree of pyromineralization concentrates br salts in the ash materials however other studies reported low 0 125 μm br concentration in samples collected from burned regions hohner et al 2018 2016 the main differences between these studies may be related to geology and proximity to the ocean the primary source affecting precipitation chemistry our study site in northern california is located near the ocean and the geologic materials are derived from marine sedimentary rocks presumably containing relatively high br concentrations during the second rainy season br concentrations were mrl 0 125 μm 0 26 0 13 and 0 40 0 46 μm in the reference rocky fire and wragg fire samples respectively fig 5 the decreased br concentrations reflect dilution from the higher precipitation amounts in the second season as well as leaching of br ion from the ash layer therefore we concluded that the br release from burned watersheds could be high during initial post fire runoff events and could slowly decline to background levels with subsequent runoff leaching events during the first post fire rainy season trichloromethane tcm and chlorinated haa species chloro c trichloro tc and dichloro dc acetic acids aa accounted for 95 of total thm and haa fps on a molar basis in the reference site fig 5 however in parallel with br trends thms and haas showed changes in their distribution of chlorinated and brominated species in burned watersheds in the rocky fire samples for initial jan 5 22 2016 vs subsequent flushes mar 5 apr 10 2016 tcm and chlorinated haas species consisted of 72 vs 89 and 89 vs 94 of total thm and haa fps respectively similarly in the wragg fire samples tcm and chlorinated haa species consisted of 83 vs 89 and 88 vs 94 of total thm and haa fps these results indicate that brominated species were more predominant in the first rainy season s initial flushes having higher br concentrations fig 5 bif increased due to higher br content in the rocky and wragg fire samples for both thm and haa fps figs s7a and b similar to br trends for the second rainy season s flushes bif values in the burned watersheds remained higher compared to those in the reference site but overall the concentration of brominated species was diminished as br concentrations decreased these results show that bif could increase following wildfires wang et al 2015 and the effect can persist for multiple years chow et al 2019 however this observation requires further using leachate water of unburned vs burned materials with low vs high bromide content laboratory tests 4 conclusion wildfires can cause rapid and severe impairments in water quality during post fire runoff events our study showed that the proportion of the watershed burned significantly increase the detrimental effects of downstream water quality in the short term 1 year significantly higher turbidity color and suspended particles might be expected and the degree of impairment is proportional to the amount of watershed area burned further increased concentrations of doc in the short term 1 year tdn don and nh4 are expected to be prevalent in the first year runoff along with changes in dom chemical properties over the short to medium term up to 2 years no3 concentration could be negligible in the first year runoff but appreciably higher concentrations are expected during the following year s post fire runoff events possibly due to delayed nitrification c dbp precursor concentrations can be considerably higher due to the release of more mobile and more aromatic doc from the catchment in the short term 1 year but the c normalized reactivity of dbp precursors is not expected to be altered significantly by wildfire elevated br concentrations can be found especially in burned watersheds located in coastal regions thus more effective treatment processes applications may be required to limit the formation of more toxic brominated dbp in fire impacted treated drinking water therefore chloramination can be considered as a secondary disinfection process to treat fire impacted raw water if the water utility is using high doc content source waters and its typical thm and haa levels are close to the limits in their distribution systems finally utilities must be prepared for elevated levels of suspended solids relatively higher doc unusual nitrogen different speciation and relatively higher bromide content in their raw waters declaration of competing interest the authors declare

17846,we investigated the effects of two california wildfires rocky and wragg fires 2015 compared to an unburned reference watershed on water quality dissolved organic matter dom and precursors of disinfection by products dbps for two years post fire the two burned watersheds both experienced wildfires but differed in the proportion of burned watershed areas burned watersheds showed rapid water quality degradation from elevated levels of turbidity color and suspended solids with greater degradation in the more extensively burned watershed during the first year s initial flushes concentrations of dissolved organic carbon doc dissolved organic nitrogen don ammonium nh4 nh3 and specific ultraviolet absorbance suva254 were significantly higher 67 40 418 125 192 120 and 31 17 respectively in the more extensively burned watershed compared to the reference watershed these elevated values gradually declined and finally returned to levels like the reference watershed in the second year nitrate concentrations were near detection limits 0 01 mg n l in the first year but showed a large increase in fire impacted streams during the second rainy season possibly due to delayed nitrification changes in dom composition especially during the initial storm events indicated that fires can attenuate humic like and soluble microbial by product like smp dom while increasing the proportion of fulvic like tryptophan like and tyrosine like compounds elevated bromide br concentrations up to 8 7 μm caused a shift in speciation of trihalomethanes thms and haloacetic acids haas to brominated species for extended periods up to 2 years wildfire also resulted in elevated concentrations of n nitrosodimethylamine ndma precursors such changes in thm haa and ndma precursors following wildfires pose a potential treatability challenge for drinking water treatment but the effects are relatively short term 1 year graphical abstract image 1 keywords wildfires drinking water quality nitrogen cycle dom properties dbp fps 1 introduction forested watersheds are a principal source of drinking water around the world costanza et al 1997 considering the united states us as an example more than 60 of potable water is sourced from forested areas smith et al 2011 stein et al 2005 with rapid population growth and a changing climate these vital water sources are vulnerable to both natural and human made disturbances for example forest fires are of particular concern because they rapidly consume biomass convert forest vegetation into pyrogenic organic matter pyom and change the physical and chemical properties of upper soil layers goforth et al 2005 oliveira filho et al 2018 santín et al 2015 vergnoux et al 2011 wang et al 2016 consequently surface run off regimes that strongly affect the quantity and quality of water exported from forested catchments are markedly altered ellis et al 2004 knoepp et al 2008 furthermore forested watersheds in arid and semi arid regions worldwide are expected to experience higher temperatures and extended droughts resulting in more frequent intense and massive wildfires bowman et al 2009 mehran et al 2017 smith et al 2011 williams et al 2019 pyom materials create hydrophobic soil properties and foster the formation of surface crust resulting in increased water repellency and reduced infiltration into soil profiles goforth et al 2005 as a result increased water yields or even flash floods debris flows commonly originate from burned watersheds during post fire rainstorms mahat et al 2016 malvar et al 2015 further bare soil conditions accelerate soil erosion transporting sediments and nutrients to source waters belillas et al 1993 lane et al 2008 malmon et al 2007 sheridan et al 2007 stevens 2013 additionally elevated levels of turbidity and suspended solids hohner et al 2017 mast et al 2016 murphy et al 2012 and metals abraham et al 2017 are frequently reported in the post wildfire runoff fire temperature and oxygen availability during a wildfire are the principal factors affecting the consumption of detrital biomass and the formation of pyom in wildfire ash thus fire characteristics have a substantial effect on the quality and quantity of terrestrially derived dissolved organic matter dom exported from burned watersheds hohner et al 2016 wang et al 2015 2016 higher fire temperature is expected to increase detritus pyro mineralization gray and dighton 2006 therefore the amount of water leachable dom expressed as dissolved organic carbon doc and dissolved organic nitrogen don concentrations might be expected to be lower in pyom than in the unburned organic matter from which it originated wang et al 2016 however higher doc and don concentrations are frequently reported in stream waters following wildfires hohner et al 2016 revchuk and suffet 2014 writer et al 2014 such discrepancies can be related to enhanced mobility and flushing of dom especially during intense post wildfire precipitation events bladon et al 2008 emelko et al 2011 hohner et al 2016 inamdar and mitchell 2007 murphy et al 2015 stevens 2013 in terms of health related adverse effects from wildfires the occurrence of disinfection by products dbps is one of the main concerns in treated drinking water carbonaceous c dbps trihalomethanes thms and haloacetic acids haas are regulated in drinking water in the us usepa 2006 however recent studies have demonstrated that commonly applied secondary disinfection practices such as chlorination are shifting to chloramination li 2011 which is related to the formation of nitrogenous n nitrosodimethylamine ndma a dbp with more significant health risks than those associated with regulated thms and haas bond et al 2011 plewa et al 2002 richardson et al 2007 since fires have the potential to change the chemical characteristics and release of dom from forest materials the reactivity of dbp precursors originating from wildfires is expected to differ in stream runoff after wildfire events hohner et al 2016 2017 revchuk and suffet 2014 writer et al 2014 previous studies showed post fire increases in doc leaching from burned areas that can augment the levels of precursors for thm revchuk and suffet 2014 and haa writer et al 2014 precursor levels following post wildfire rainstorms nitrogenous n dbp precursors including ndma were high cawley et al 2016 hohner et al 2016 wang et al 2015 while previous studies demonstrated changes in dom and various water quality parameters after wildfires most of these studies were either conducted under controlled laboratory conditions or based on stream water sampling campaigns that did not fully achieve their purpose due to environmental and logistical restrictions currently no study has systematically evaluated the first and second year responses of different watershed conditions i e headwater vs higher order and complete vs partially burned watersheds on post wildfire runoff and their implications for dom release and reactivity of dbp precursors in this study we collected water samples from wildfire impacted watersheds in northern california during all major post fire runoff events covering two consecutive rainy seasons 2016 and 2017 we captured short first year response including initial and subsequent flushes and medium term second year response effects on stream water from two separate burned watersheds and one reference i e unburned watershed the specific objectives of this study were to evaluate the temporal changes in post fire surface water quality with a focus on changes in dom release characterization and reactivity as dbp precursors in burned vs unburned watersheds the results of this study provide valuable information to drinking water providers for assessing potential risks that wildfires pose to drinking water safety 2 materials and methods 2 1 wildfires and site description in july august 2015 the rocky fire jerusalem fire and wragg fire in the northern california coastal ranges consumed 281 km2 102 km2 and 33 km2 of wildlands respectively fig 1 the rocky and jerusalem fires started as two separate fires but eventually merged into a single fire thus to avoid confusion we referred them collectively as the rocky fire geographic information system gis calculations and site observations indicated that the burn area affecting sampling stream was 20 of upper cache watershed hydrological unit code 8 huc 18020116 but exclude the downstream area of sampling point and 90 of the second order watershed a small portion of the huc12 180201620503 mccune creek putah creek in addition based on a previous study wang et al 2020 and the visual indicators i e consumed duff generally dark colored ash and blackened dead standing trees united states department of agriculture usda 2020 these fires can be characterized as medium severity pre burn vegetation was a mixture of oak savanna and woodlands including blue oak quercus douglasii interior live oak quercus wislizenii and scrub oak quercus dumosa chaparral including buckbrush ceanothus cuneatus chamise adenostoma fasciculatum california buckeye aesculus californica toyon heteromeles arbutifolia and manzanita arctostaphylos spec and annual grasslands dominant soils were inceptisols and alfisols formed on mixed sedimentary parent materials watersheds were dominated by moderate 15 to steeply 45 sloping topography resulting in high water erosion potential the area has a mediterranean climate characterized by hot dry summers and mild rainy winters with the majority of the precipitation occurring between november and march records for the berryessa dam fig s1 located adjacent to the cold creek watershed indicated that the area received 431 and 1029 mm of total precipitation during the first rainy season jan 5 and april 10 2016 and the second rainy season dec 15 2016 and march 31 2017 intense rainy seasons respectively department of water resources dwr 2017 rainfall patterns were identical between the reference and wragg fire watershed as they were located within a few km of each other winter rainfall events in northern california are large storms originating in the pacific ocean that affect large land areas unlike classic thunderstorms these storms do not show large differences in precipitation at small spatial scales thus we assumed that all three watersheds in this study received rainfall from the same storms although the total rainfall amounts might not differ significantly among watersheds 2 2 water sample collection three sampling locations outlets of watersheds fig 1 were established to assess the effects postfire rainstorms on water quality at the watershed scale samples from the wragg fire were collected from the outlet of cold creek 38 30 43 31 n 122 5 50 02 w which drains the significant part of a burned watershed the quality of water samples collected from the burned watershed was compared to the quality of water samples collected from an adjacent reference watershed that was not affected by wildfire miller canyon creek 8 27 4 94 n 122 3 22 97 w the two watersheds have similar geology soils topography and vegetation importantly the wragg fire did not burn any of the land areas within the reference watershed therefore the reference watershed served as a burned vs unburned watershed comparison for the wragg fire streamflow from the cold creek and miller canyon creek was intermittent with flow only during the rainy season thus the sampling frequency was governed by weather conditions fig s1 during the first year s sampling there were six sixteen and seventeen reference rocky and wragg fire samples collected across the sampling period respectively but no reference sample for the very first flushes due to a hydrologic lag that resulted from the vegetated landscape nonetheless we didn t miss the collection of the early reference samples it was a function of the hydrologic lag in generating streamflow during the second year s sampling there were sixteen samples for reference and rocky fire and seventeen samples for wragg fire regarding flow regimes there were two distinct rainfall periods in the first rainy season jan 5 and april 10 2016 because of the lack of rainfall during february 2016 we defined the runoff from these two periods as season 1 initial flushes s1 if jan 5 22 2016 and season 1 subsequent flushes s1 sf mar 5 apr 10 2016 in the second rainy season dec 15 2016 mar 31 2017 rainfall was more continuous after the onset of the rainy season and we labeled this period as season 2 flushes s2 f fig s1 for the wragg fire flows we measured instantaneous discharge from the water velocity cross sectional area when the flows were below 0 14 m3 s for the flow 0 14 m3 s we determined the flow as the difference between putah creek flow about 1 6 km downstream of wragg input usgs station 11454000 minus dam release berryessa from immediately upstream of the wragg fire stream the calculations were acceptable until feb 16 2017 when the spillway overflowed and there were no reliable measurements for water releases from berryessa reservoir fig s2a in terms of the geology and soil characteristics the reference watershed 78 km2 does not represent the larger cache creek watershed 3017 km2 in which the rocky fire took place however its topography and vegetation were like those of the reference watershed samples from the rocky fire were collected from cache creek at a location 38 55 24 83 n 122 19 35 32 w that captured the burned watershed area below clear lake in general the water in cache creek mainly originated from the watershed area below clear lake shown in fig 1 as the water was impounded in the winter for subsequent release for spring summer irrigation grab samples were collected from a well mixed stream section for selected storm events and base flow conditions representative flow data were available from usgs gauging station 11451800 located downstream of the water quality sampling point fig s2b the difference in flow between the clear lake outflow usgs station 11451800 and the downstream flow station was used to calculate flow generated from the watershed area containing the wildfire flow data indicated that the water sampling point mainly received runoff from the burned watershed area the ratio of the lake discharge sampling point flow was 0 5 during initial flushes of the first rainy season fig s2c therefore the proportion of burned areas below clear lake contributing to the sampling point was 40 during the initial flushes however the averaged contribution of water released from the lake was 26 and 48 during the sampling periods corresponding to the subsequent flushes and the second rainy season s flushes respectively consequently the impact of the rocky fire was attenuated by dilution especially during the later portion of each annual water collection period 2 3 analytical methods 2 3

maximum minimum 90th 75th median 25th and 10th quartile metrics fig s3 3 results and discussion 3 1 release of suspended solids post fire rainstorms resulted in the release of high amounts of eroded particles from barren soils of the burned areas during the first rainy season in the unburned reference watershed measured values average std were 36 47 ntu 362 478 pt co and 96 158 mg l for turbidity apparent color and total suspended solids tss respectively figs s4a b and c in contrast burned areas saw significantly higher p 0 05 values 871 747 and 4478 6720 ntu 6014 6098 and 28316 40248 pt co and 613 626 and 4795 6237 mg l for the rocky and wragg fires respectively during the first rainy season initial flushes but decreasing trends 1337 1775 and 137 138 ntu 6522 8266 and 3399 4272 pt co and 1066 1303 and 700 1127 mg l for the rocky and wragg fires respectively during the first rainy season s subsequent flushes especially for the wragg fire tss vs turbidity and apparent color showed strong positive linear correlations r2 0 9 for all watersheds table s2 during the second rainy season s flushes measured values for all three constituents increased p 0 05 in the reference site figs s4a b and c higher precipitation 431 vs 1029 mm in the second rainy season likely caused higher erosion and particle transport in the reference watershed for the rocky fire values turbidity color and tss were comparable between the first and second years as only a portion of the cache creek watershed was burned by the rocky fire the water quality response was not as strong as that found in the wragg watershed which was more extensively burned 90 second year values for the wragg fire showed a remarkable decrease with values like the reference site the sharp decrease in suspended sediments resulted from rapid erosion of the ash layer in the first year followed by decreased erosion due to rapid re vegetation of the burned watershed by stump sprouting shrubs and annual grasses in the second year these findings are consistent with other studies that show distinct flushing of sediments color and tss during the initial storm events following wildfires emelko et al 2011 hohner et al 2018 2016 mast et al 2016 murphy et al 2015 2012 son et al 2015 writer et al 2014 quick mobilization of fire generated particles into the watershed increased concentrations of suspended solid related parameters particularly during the initial storm events on the other hand the first post fire rainy season had total dissolved solids tds calculated by subtracting tss concentrations from total solids ts averaged values 96 156 262 109 and 329 456 mg l in the reference rocky and wragg fire samples respectively fig s4d however all averaged values were lower than the epa secondary drinking water standard of 500 mg l usepa 2012 the tds ts ratios in the rocky 24 and wragg fire 10 samples were significantly lower p 0 05 than those in the samples from the reference watershed 73 table s3 indicating higher erosion rates in burned watersheds for the first post fire rainy season during the second post fire rainy season the averaged tds ts decreased in the reference watershed from 73 to 24 p 0 05 however the tds ts ratios in reference 24 samples were lower compared to those in the rocky 43 and wragg fire 37 samples these data indicate increased erosion in the reference watershed and quick mobilization of fire generated suspended solids during the first rainy season especially in the more extensively 90 burned watershed 3 2 release of aromatic carbon during the first post fire rainy season doc concentrations were not statistically different p 0 05 in reference 5 4 2 6 mg l vs rocky fire samples 4 9 1 6 mg l fig 2 a however the wragg fire samples had significantly higher p 0 05 doc concentration 9 0 2 2 mg l during the first rainy season s initial flushes compared to the reference and rocky fire samples it has been indicated that the production of mg carbon g detritus materials is highly dependent on fire severity wang et al 2015 therefore we may expect a significant decrease in the release of doc after high severity fires however the release of doc from wragg fire was higher than that released from the reference during the initial flushes this is consistent with the predominantly medium severity of wragg fire that resulted in higher doc release and mobility from the more mobile ash derived carbon pools generated from the burned watersheds during the initial flushes during subsequent rain events the doc concentration in the reference and rocky fire samples did not change significantly p 0 05 4 9 3 0 mg l vs 4 9 1 6 mg l however significant decreases p 0 05 were observed from an average of 9 0 to 4 9 mg l compared to those of initial flushes in the wragg fire samples this observation indicates that fires can increase the release of doc but the response will be more apparent as the percentage of the burned watershed area increases during the second rainy season the averaged doc values decreased to 3 8 4 2 mg l across all watersheds fig 2a this observation is consistent with previous findings where recently generated ash had higher doc leaching potential than did weathered leached ash wang et al 2016 overall these findings indicate that while fires consume large amounts of litter vegetation they can generate more mobile doc that is quickly flushed 1 year from the burned watersheds in the post fire runoff for the first rainy season in general the average suva254 did not change significantly p 0 05 and overlapped for all sample groups fig 2b during the initial flushes the suva254 values were 3 2 0 4 and 3 3 0 7 l mg m for the reference and the rocky fire samples respectively however the wragg fire samples only showed 31 17 higher 4 5 0 6 l mg m values that decreased to 3 1 0 5 l mg m similar to reference and rocky fire over subsequent rain events higher suva254 values suggest greater aromaticity of the dom fraction weishaar et al 2003 during the initial flushes previous research found that ash materials abraham et al 2017 and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon pah structures form during wildfires vila escalé et al 2007 and these newly generated compounds can increase the hydrophobicity of water and soil materials moreover wang et al 2015 showed that the suva254 values of the water leachate of ash materials follow the order white ash high temperature unburned detritus black ash cooler temperature thus the higher p 0 05 suva254 in the wragg fire samples during the first rainy season s initial flushes may be related to the newly generated white ash and pahs that reach peak concentration in recently burned sites tsibart et al 2014 and decrease over time with precipitation and leaching olivella et al 2006 vila escalé et al 2007 thus the decreasing trend in aromaticity of the wragg fire samples during the first rainy season s subsequent flushes may be related to the rapid removal by erosion leaching of these newly generated aromatic hydrophobic compounds by the second rainy season the average suva254 values for the reference and burned watersheds were comparable 3 2 0 7 2 8 0 7 and 3 3 0 8 l mg m for reference rocky and wragg fire samples respectively fig 2b this confirms that the fire generated aromatic compounds flushed quickly from burned watersheds and there were no significant seasonal changes in leaching of those newly generated materials soil ph increases after wildfire due to the mineralization and release of acidic volatiles certini 2005 wang et al 2015 2016 and the concentration of ca2 mg2 k and na as oxides hydroxides and carbonates certini 2005 especially in newly burned organic matter revchuk and suffet 2014 therefore post fire stream runoff may increase the ph of downstream surface waters son et al 2015 possibly resulting in a higher solubility of dom however the length of ph enhancement was variable up to 3 years certini 2005 granged et al 2011 oliver et al 2012 wang et al 2015 in our study average stream water ph values were not significantly different p 0 05 for burned vs reference samples ph range 7 91 8 33 fig s5 findings from our study indicate that several factors e g burning severity mobility of newly generated dom soil buffering capacity weathering conditions play a role in regulating the ph of stream water in burned watersheds 3 3 fire affects the nitrogen cycle nitrogen plays a vital role for all watershed organisms wilhelm 2009 but increased nutrients i e n p in downstream water bodies can cause adverse effects such as eutrophication and harmful algal blooms bladon et al 2014 emelko et al 2016 santín et al 2018 during the first post fire rainy season tdn consisted mainly 98 92 and 90 in the reference rocky and wragg fire samples respectively of organic nitrogen in the reference samples average tdn data not shown don and nh4 n concentrations were 0 38 0 33 0 05 mg l respectively however those values were significantly higher p 0 05 in the fire impacted samples fig 3 a and b in contrast the no2 data not shown and no3 fig 3c concentrations were generally lower than the mrls presented in si in all watersheds notably the don concentrations in the wragg fire samples were significantly higher than those in the rocky fire samples this likely reflects the higher percentage of burned areas occurring in the wragg fire watershed despite lower tdn and don leaching capacities from ash wang et al 2016 and soil samples homann et al 2011 found in some studies elevated concentrations of tdn don and nh4 have been reported by others in stream waters following wildfires bladon et al 2008 hohner et al 2016 murphy et al 2015 son et al 2015 these nitrogen forms tend to accumulate in the ashy materials following release by pyromineralization of vegetation litter and are quickly mobilized and transported via surface runoff erosion following wildfires knicker 2010 knicker et al 2005 mast et al 2016 neary et al 2005 additionally the doc don ratio was significantly lower p 0 05 in the rocky 5 0 1 63 and wragg fires 4 9 1 85 samples compared to reference 17 4 5 87 fig s6 this lower doc don ratio from burned watershed samples is consistent with a laboratory study where a lower doc don ratio resulted from wildfire ash leachates compared to a control hohner et al 2016 ranalli 2004 wang et al 2015 in the second year post fire both the tdn data not shown and don concentrations decreased in all samples compared to the first rainy season most likely as a result of dilution due to much higher precipitation in year two however both the tdn and don concentrations remained higher in the burned watersheds relative to the reference watershed this indicates that tdn and don continued to leach from the burned sites for extended periods 1 year the average no3 concentrations were highest for the second rainy season fig 3c consistent with several previous studies koyama et al 2010 mast et al 2016 murphy et al 2015 smith et al 2011 a lower doc don ratio fig s6 and mineralization of organic matter from the ash soil leads to the accumulation of nh4 as plant uptake is attenuated following the fire these conditions provide a favorable environment for nitrifying microorganisms to thrive and generate no3 which is highly mobile and susceptible to leaching given the slow growth of nitrifying microorganisms under the cold winter conditions no3 generation and leaching were hindered in the burned areas in the first year following wildfire acea and carballas 1996 in summary in the first year following wildfire there was a decrease in the doc don ratio and an increase in the release in nh4 and don which made up the majority of tdn these conditions probably stimulated nitrification which in turn resulted in delayed transport of no3 from the watershed in the second year following the wildfire this was consistent with a recent study where the nitrate level was an order of magnitude higher in burned catchment stream water compared to unburned catchment stream water rhoades et al 2019 3 4 changes in dom composition following wildfire eem regions and fluorescence indices provide information about dom sources chemical characteristics and dynamics in aquatic ecosystems fellman et al 2010 and wildfire can alter the eem fluoresce regions of dom revchuk and suffet 2014 wang et al 2015 considering the potential interference of metals e g iron on optical measurements such as suva254 and fluorescence measurements poulin et al 2014 weishaar et al 2003 we analyzed only samples having iron concentrations 0 03 mg l thus the number of measurements n 2 for the reference watershed for the first rainy season was limited as a result it was not possible to apply statistical analysis between reference and burned watershed samples which limits a definitive conclusion although the doc content and sample collection periods 4 1 and 8 4 mg l for initial flushes and subsequent flushes respectively were different for those two samples dom characteristics were similar table 1 considering also a minimal variability of the second year measurements n 6 we concluded that the dom character did not significantly change in the reference samples therefore we interpreted our results accordingly results showed that eem region contributions for the reference samples were dominated by humic acid like dom 56 during the first post fire rainy season in contrast the rocky and wragg fire samples were distinctly different from reference samples for the first runoff event for the rocky fire n 3 for the wragg fire n 4 during the first rainy season s initial flushes humic like and fulvic like components contributed 31 33 of dom while tryptophan like and tyrosine like components contributed 16 and 2 4 of dom in the burned watershed samples after 3 4 flushes for the percentage of humic like dom came to a level comparable to the level in the reference this process was rapid compared 2 years to a previous study revchuk and suffet 2014 also dom from burned watersheds had significantly higher p 0 05 fulvic acid and protein like components as well as lower soluble microbial by product like smp compositions this suggests the formation release of fulvic like dom and protein like dom fellman et al 2010 as well as lower molecular weight mw microbial dom sources resulting from the fire and or post fire biological activity revchuk and suffet 2014 higher tyrosine like and especially tryptophan like regions indicated that amino acids and aromatic proteins mainly intact proteins and less degraded peptides were generated by post fire biological activity chen et al 2003 fellman et al 2010 however these compounds were likely flushed from the watershed during the initial 3 4 flushes contributing to the higher don exported from the burned watersheds fig 3a averaged fluorescence index fi values for the reference and rocky fire samples were similar 1 55 0 01 n 2 and 1 57 0 03 n 7 respectively however the wragg fire samples had higher values 1 70 0 04 n 8 during the first flush table 1 unlike previous work hohner et al 2016 our results suggest extensive wildfires can increase fi value the humification index hix and freshness index β α for the reference samples were 8 43 1 90 and 0 65 0 01 n 2 respectively in contrast the rocky and wragg fire samples had higher hix and β α values during the initial flushes for rocky 10 22 3 02 and 0 81 0 02 n 3 for the wragg 24 35 7 50 and 0 89 0 01 n 4 these elevated values decreased slowly with subsequent rainfall runoff events considering the change in the dom composition these observations indicate that wildfires can consume much of the terrestrial dom sources and enhanced microbial activity from residuals may generate lower mw of dom in the burned watersheds revchuk and suffet 2014 tsai et al 2017 valenca et al 2020 wang et al 2015 in addition the newly formed dom is likely more mobile resulting in its rapid flushing from the watershed for the second rainy season the eem average humic like region 78 increased significantly across all watersheds and fi hix and β α values were similar across burned and reference watersheds thus the dom spectroscopic properties indicate that wildfire has a pronounced short term 1 year effect on dom quality but dom quickly reverts to characteristics like the reference watershed in the second year post fire 3 5 doc governs thm and haa precursor concentrations during the first post fire rainy season average thm haa and ch fp concentrations in the reference and the rocky fire samples were 540 339 355 208 and 73 52 μg l and 504 236 360 223 and 45 34 μg l respectively notably the wragg fire samples had higher average thm and haa concentrations of 687 279 and 616 421 μg l respectively fig 4 a b and c but similar values for ch fps 68 43 μg l compared to both the reference and rocky fire samples correlations for doc vs thm and haa fps were strongly positive r2 0 7 while doc vs ch fp correlations was moderately positive 0 5 r2 0 7 table s4 rumsey 2016 therefore the higher thm and haa fps were associated with higher doc concentrations 40 in the wragg fire samples fig 2a doc normalized concentrations were further calculated to examine the reactivity of dbp precursors per unit of carbon results showed that the carbon normalized average reactivity and variability of thm and haa precursors were within a similar range for all samples thm fp doc 99 18 μg mg c haa fp doc 70 27 μg mg c these data are consistent with previous studies that showed that the carbon normalized reactivity of c dbp precursors was not significantly affected by wildfire hohner et al 2016 writer et al 2014 therefore the increase in c dbp precursor concentrations cawley et al 2016 revchuk and suffet 2014 was due mainly to the enhanced mobility of doc especially during the first post fire runoff events in contrast carbon normalized ch fp values decreased 30 in the rocky and wragg fire samples compared to the reference samples previously wang et al 2016 showed that doc and ch fp yields μg g detritus for wildfire ash samples were lower compared to their unburned source materials thus alteration of doc quantity and quality both appear to affect the reactivity of ch precursors results further showed that ndma fp values 27 8 6 and 28 16 0 ng l for rocky and wragg fire samples respectively were significantly p 0 05 higher in the burned watershed samples compared to reference samples 18 5 9 ng l fig 4d these results are consistent with studies by wang et al 2015 2016 that showed ash sample leachates had relatively higher ndma fp compared to their unburned source materials since ndma fp did not correlate with don or tdn uzun et al 2015 and several known precursors are anthropogenic derived ruecker et al 2017 uzun et al 2017 2015 such an increase may be explained by the use of human made compounds such as fire suppressants during the fire or the release of some of the ndma precursors by high temperature burns also carbon normalized ndma fp values were higher p 0 05 in the rocky fire samples 5 8 2 4 ng mg c compared to wragg fire samples 3 9 1 07 ng mg c during the first rainy season this may be related to more anthropogenic activity in the cache creek watershed rocky fire in addition correlations between ndma fps and nitrogen species don and inorganic nitrogen were weak r2 0 5 during the second post fire rainy season significant decreases were observed in thm and haa fps in all watersheds as well as carbon normalized reactivity values were similar across both burned and unburned samples indicating that the wildfire effects were short term ch fp levels were similar to those in samples from the previous rainy season considering doc trends and linear correlations between docs and c dbps table s4 the lower thm and haa fps could be due to lower doc concentrations resulting from the greater rainfall amounts dilution in the second year however the decrease in normalized carbon values cannot be explained by dilution suggesting that some changes in dom characteristics ratio changes especially for fulvic acid like vs humic acid like dom which caused lower dbp yields as well the ndma fp levels were similar between years for all watersheds but the normalized carbon values were relatively higher in the second year considering the lower doc levels in the second year this finding further confirms that doc is not a good proxy for ndma precursors bond et al 2011 uzun et al 2015 yang et al 2015 3 6 formation of more toxic brominated thms and haas in this section bromine incorporation factors bifs are calculated krasner et al 2008 and discussed for thms and haas we present the concentrations for the bromide doc thm and haa fps in molar units bromide concentrations in the reference samples were significantly lower 0 16 0 15 μm n 6 fig 3d than those found in the rocky fire 1 35 0 9 μm 2 96 1 81 n 9 initial nine flushes and 0 54 0 26 n 7 subsequent seven flushes and wragg fire samples 1 67 2 29 μm 4 05 3 56 n 9 initial nine flushes and 0 65 0 64 μm n 8 subsequent eight flushes fig 5 wang et al 2015 showed that increased fire severity enhanced the yield of br from ash leachates as a higher degree of pyromineralization concentrates br salts in the ash materials however other studies reported low 0 125 μm br concentration in samples collected from burned regions hohner et al 2018 2016 the main differences between these studies may be related to geology and proximity to the ocean the primary source affecting precipitation chemistry our study site in northern california is located near the ocean and the geologic materials are derived from marine sedimentary rocks presumably containing relatively high br concentrations during the second rainy season br concentrations were mrl 0 125 μm 0 26 0 13 and 0 40 0 46 μm in the reference rocky fire and wragg fire samples respectively fig 5 the decreased br concentrations reflect dilution from the higher precipitation amounts in the second season as well as leaching of br ion from the ash layer therefore we concluded that the br release from burned watersheds could be high during initial post fire runoff events and could slowly decline to background levels with subsequent runoff leaching events during the first post fire rainy season trichloromethane tcm and chlorinated haa species chloro c trichloro tc and dichloro dc acetic acids aa accounted for 95 of total thm and haa fps on a molar basis in the reference site fig 5 however in parallel with br trends thms and haas showed changes in their distribution of chlorinated and brominated species in burned watersheds in the rocky fire samples for initial jan 5 22 2016 vs subsequent flushes mar 5 apr 10 2016 tcm and chlorinated haas species consisted of 72 vs 89 and 89 vs 94 of total thm and haa fps respectively similarly in the wragg fire samples tcm and chlorinated haa species consisted of 83 vs 89 and 88 vs 94 of total thm and haa fps these results indicate that brominated species were more predominant in the first rainy season s initial flushes having higher br concentrations fig 5 bif increased due to higher br content in the rocky and wragg fire samples for both thm and haa fps figs s7a and b similar to br trends for the second rainy season s flushes bif values in the burned watersheds remained higher compared to those in the reference site but overall the concentration of brominated species was diminished as br concentrations decreased these results show that bif could increase following wildfires wang et al 2015 and the effect can persist for multiple years chow et al 2019 however this observation requires further using leachate water of unburned vs burned materials with low vs high bromide content laboratory tests 4 conclusion wildfires can cause rapid and severe impairments in water quality during post fire runoff events our study showed that the proportion of the watershed burned significantly increase the detrimental effects of downstream water quality in the short term 1 year significantly higher turbidity color and suspended particles might be expected and the degree of impairment is proportional to the amount of watershed area burned further increased concentrations of doc in the short term 1 year tdn don and nh4 are expected to be prevalent in the first year runoff along with changes in dom chemical properties over the short to medium term up to 2 years no3 concentration could be negligible in the first year runoff but appreciably higher concentrations are expected during the following year s post fire runoff events possibly due to delayed nitrification c dbp precursor concentrations can be considerably higher due to the release of more mobile and more aromatic doc from the catchment in the short term 1 year but the c normalized reactivity of dbp precursors is not expected to be altered significantly by wildfire elevated br concentrations can be found especially in burned watersheds located in coastal regions thus more effective treatment processes applications may be required to limit the formation of more toxic brominated dbp in fire impacted treated drinking water therefore chloramination can be considered as a secondary disinfection process to treat fire impacted raw water if the water utility is using high doc content source waters and its typical thm and haa levels are close to the limits in their distribution systems finally utilities must be prepared for elevated levels of suspended solids relatively higher doc unusual nitrogen different speciation and relatively higher bromide content in their raw waters declaration of competing interest the authors declare

17847,this study investigated the efficiency of intensive membrane cleaning for membrane bioreactors mbrs using a combination of mechanical scouring with granules and chemically enhanced backwashing ceb the implementation of such intensive cleaning was possible with ceramic flat sheet membranes experiments were carried out using bench scale mbrs at an existing wastewater treatment plant first ceb with naclo was investigated in terms of the ceb frequency duration and concentration of the chemical reagent ceb carried out for 60 min every 6 h with 50 ppm of naclo was found to be effective and it enabled an mbr to operate at 50 lmh two to three times higher than the flux of full scale mbrs however these ceb conditions were insufficient when the temperature was low i e in winter when an adhesive gel layer formed on the membrane surface its high resistance to cleaning might be explained by the increased levels of soluble microbial products and or the presence of algal cells alkaline assisted ceb with naclo ph 12 and an increase in the volume of granules in the membrane tank solved this problem with the modified cleaning method the fouling could be almost perfectly controlled at low temperature conditions such as 13 c mbrs may be regarded as fouling free mbrs when the proposed cleaning method is used with ceramic flat sheet membranes most real world mbr operations operate with lower fluxes than the flux examined in this study and at higher temperatures graphical abstract image 1 keywords fouling free mbr granular scouring chemically enhanced backwash gel layer naclo 1 introduction membrane bioreactors mbrs have many advantages over systems using the conventional activated sludge process such as high quality of effluent small footprint and easy operation yamamoto et al 1988 stephenson et al 2000 however the decline of membrane permeability during long term operation i e membrane fouling remains a major limitation of mbr technology membrane fouling increases both operational and capital costs of mbrs preventing them from becoming the mainstream technology for wastewater treatment krzeminski et al 2017 meng et al 2017 generally the membrane tank requires intensive aeration to mitigate membrane fouling in mbrs this has been identified as a major reason for the high operational cost of mbrs fenu et al 2010 xiao et al 2019 furthermore to avoid increases in membrane fouling in mbrs membrane flux is often set to low values operation under sub critical flux is preferred ognier et al 2004 however this requires an increase of the membrane area which directly increases the capital cost of mbrs fouled membranes eventually need off line chemical cleaning to restore their permeability meng et al 2017 which also increases the operational cost of mbrs thus control of membrane fouling is important for the widespread use of mbr technology meng et al 2017 problems associated with membrane fouling might be addressed by effective membrane cleaning using aeration to circulate scouring agents in the mbr tank is a viable option for intensive physical cleaning in mbrs aslam et al 2017 in our previous study cleaning with granular materials was so effective that complete removal of the cake gel layer was observed kurita et al 2014 using mechanical scouring in mbrs substantially reduces the aeration intensity required to maintain sufficient cleaning efficiency kurita et al 2014 2015 however excessive contact between the granular materials and the membrane surface causes significant damage to polymeric membranes kurita et al 2015 using physically robust membranes can solve this problem recently flat sheet ceramic membranes have become commercially available and have been used for mbrs niwa et al 2016 xue et al 2016 li et al 2018 mbrs equipped with ceramic flat sheet membranes should be effectively cleaned with granular scouring the use of ceramic membranes also facilitates the implementation of intensive chemically enhanced backwash ceb where chemical reagents are added to the backwash solution and foulants that have accumulated in micropores are effectively removed it was reported that ceb was also effective for mbrs zsirai et al 2012 ceb can control irreversible internal fouling whereas reversible external fouling can be controlled through granular scouring as mentioned above thus mbrs equipped with ceramic flat sheet membranes in which both intensive ceb and mechanical scouring can be carried out could be used as fouling free mbrs sodium hypochlorite naclo is commonly used for maintenance cleaning or recovery cleaning of membranes shi et al 2014 wang et al 2014 han et al 2016 and is also thought to be effective in ceb of mbrs however when naclo is used for ceb of an mbr and its concentration in the backwash solution is high it can damage the biomass in the reactor which may accelerate fouling cai et al 2016 sun et al 2018a our previous study which examined the use of naclo and granular scouring for ceb in mbrs equipped with flat sheet ceramic membranes kimura and uchida 2019 showed that excessively intense ceb can accelerate membrane fouling via release of soluble microbial products many previous studies have identified soluble microbial products as key players in the evolution of membrane fouling in mbrs rosenberger et al 2006 kimura et al 2009 tian et al 2013 zhang et al 2016 teng et al 2019 our previous study also suggested that evolution of membrane fouling in an mbr equipped with ceramic flat sheet membranes could be almost completely controlled by combining mechanical cleaning using granular materials with ceb of an adequate intensity however those experiments were carried out using synthetic wastewater under controlled room temperature conditions kimura and uchida 2019 additionally membrane flux was set to relatively low values 18 8 30 1 l h m2 lmh thus the practical feasibility of our proposal a combination of granular scouring and ceb for mbr membrane cleaning needs to be verified in a more realistic situation in the present study based on the results of our previous experiment kimura and uchida 2019 mbrs equipped with ceramic flat sheet membranes were examined at an existing wastewater treatment plant that receives domestic wastewater collected via a combined sewer system intensive mechanical scouring using granules was carried out along with ceb using naclo which enabled mbrs to be operated with a very high membrane flux such as 50 lmh this is two to three times higher than the membrane flux of a full scale mbr judd 2016 as described later fouling in the mbrs became severe when the reactors were operated in winter however by modifying the cleaning method the mbr operated stably in winter with a membrane flux of 50 lmh and no membrane fouling details of the fouling were also investigated in this study 2 materials and methods 2 1 bench scale mbrs three identical bench scale mbrs were installed at an existing municipal wastewater treatment plant in sapporo japan the mbrs contained flat sheet ceramic membranes with a nominal pore size of 0 1 μm meidensha tokyo japan the effective volume of the bench scale mbr was 7 5 l the membrane area available in the tank was 0 04 m2 aeration was conducted throughout the operation via porous air diffusers installed at the bottom of the reactor the aeration rate was fixed at 0 012 nm3 min 1 in all experiments described in this study membrane flux was set at 50 lmh and intermittent filtration 1 min pause for every 11 min of filtration was conducted throughout the operation four continuous experiments runs 1 4 were conducted as well as several operations of the mbr with relevant cleaning conditions to obtain samples of mixed liquor suspensions and fouled membranes microorganisms in mbrs can be adversely affected by the chemical reagents used in ceb kimura and uchida 2019 when this occurs it may be a long time before the reactor performance returns to stability to avoid this problem and facilitate multiple experiments in a short period the seed biomass for the bench scale mbrs was directly transferred from a pilot scale mbr installed at the same wastewater treatment plant the bench scale and pilot scale mbrs shared the same feed wastewater the influent to the primary sedimentation basin of the plant and were operated with the same srt of 30 days therefore it was assumed that the biomass transferred to the bench scale mbrs did not need acclimatization each run was initiated immediately after transferring the seed biomass throughout all the experiments in this study stable biological treatment was confirmed a low concentration of total organic carbon 5 mgl 1 in the permeate and complete nitrification were observed the concentration of mixed liquor suspended solids mlss in the mbrs varied between 5 and 7 gl 1 the detailed operational conditions of each run are described in the next section 2 2 intensive membrane cleaning for high flux operation the purpose of each run and their conditions are summarized in table 1 granular materials polyethylene glycol 4 mm cylindrical were introduced into the membrane tank to remove the cake gel layer from the membrane surface the granular materials can move freely in the tank and scratch the membrane surface in each experiment an apparent volume of 375 ml corresponding to 5 of the effective volume of the reactor of the granular materials was introduced into the reactor in run 4 the volume of granules was increased ceb entailed sodium hypochlorite naclo at various concentrations with a constant backwashing flux of 8 lmh the purpose of run 1 was to investigate the impacts of ceb with different frequencies and different concentrations of naclo in run 1 the same amount of naclo was used for ceb in each of the three mbrs run 2 was conducted to verify the importance of ceb duration as described later in winter it was difficult to control fouling in the mbrs by the method established in runs 1 and 2 therefore in run 3 the composition of ceb chemical reagents was modified naoh was added to the ceb solution to increase the ph to 12 in the absence of naoh the naclo solution had a ph of approximately 9 in run 4 to enhance the physical cleaning efficiency larger volumes of granules were placed in the reactors prior to the initiation of each run the permeabilities of the membranes were completely restored by soaking them overnight in 1000 ppm naclo at room temperature 2 3 assessment of the distribution of filtration resistance membrane filtration resistance is often analysed using the following equations 1 r t δ p j μ 2 r t r m r r r i r here j is the permeate flux m3m 2s 1 δp is the trans membrane pressure tmp pa μ is the viscosity of the permeate pa s r t is the total membrane filtration resistance m 1 r m is the intrinsic membrane filtration resistance m 1 r r is the reversible fouling resistance m 1 and r ir is the irreversible fouling resistance m 1 r r is defined as the resistance that can be removed by physical membrane cleaning whereas r ir is defined as the resistance that can be removed by chemical membrane cleaning kurita et al 2014 at the termination of a continuous operation the distribution of filtration resistance was assessed based on those definitions fouled membranes were taken out of the tanks and deposited cake gel was removed from the surfaces of the membranes to thoroughly remove the cake gel layer from the membrane surface plastic brushes polybutylene terephthalate were used ceramic membranes should be tolerant to this harsh physical membrane cleaning membranes were rinsed with tap water after being cleaned with a brush based on visual inspection complete removal of the cake gel layer was always achieved by this method pure water permeability of the fouled membranes was measured before and after the physical cleaning and the recovery of permeability reflected the degree of reversible fouling the degree of irreversible fouling was assessed by comparing the pure water permeability of a fouled membrane after physical cleaning with that of a new membrane 2 4 analysis the concentrations of total organic carbon toc and dissolved organic carbon doc were determined using a toc analyser toc vcsh shimadzu kyoto japan samples containing suspended solids were subjected to toc analysis after sonication for 3

ions were measured using ion chromatography dionex ics 90 thermofisher scientific waltham usa concentrations of mlss mlvss were determined by following the standard method apha et al 2017 liquid chromatography with an organic carbon detection lc ocd system model 8 doc labor dr huber germany was used for size based fractionation of organic matter kimura et al 2018 before performing lc ocd analyses the samples were filtered using 0 45 μm filters made from ptfe advantec tokyo japan for ftir studies kbr pellets containing 0 25 of a sample were prepared and examined with an ftir spectrophotometer ir 7500s shimadzu kyoto japan at a resolution of 4 cm 1 the surfaces of fouled membranes were observed using scanning electron microscopy sem jsm 6510la jeol ltd japan to fix the surface morphology of the fouled membranes they were broken into small pieces about 1 cm2 using a needle and hammer immersed in 2 glutaraldehyde with 0 1 m phosphate buffer ph 7 2 and left overnight at 5 c the treated samples were then fixed with 1 osmium tetroxide with 0 1 m phosphate buffer at room temperature for 2 h the fixed samples were dehydrated with a series of different concentrations of ethanol after dehydration the samples were immersed twice in isoamyl acetate solution for 15 min each time the samples were dried using a critical point drying apparatus hcp 1 hitachi japan to prevent deformation of the fouled membrane surface morphology the dried samples were coated with platinum to prevent accumulation of a static electric charge during observations the distribution of inorganic elements on the fouled membrane was also investigated using x ray energy dispersive spectroscopy eds with the sem instrument 3 results and discussion 3 1 effects of ceb frequency and reagent concentration on cleaning efficiency fig 1 shows increases in tmp in run 1 which investigated the effects of ceb frequency and naclo concentration on cleaning efficiency in mbr 1 ceb was conducted with a low frequency every 5 days and a high naclo concentration 1000 ppm and there was a significant increase in tmp in contrast mbr 3 operated with a high ceb frequency every 6 h and a low naclo concentration 50 ppm and showed almost no increase in tmp mbr 2 operated with a moderate ceb frequency every 24 h and a moderate naclo concentration 200 ppm and the increase in tmp was between those of the other two mbrs the results clearly indicate that combining high frequency ceb with a low concentration of the chemical reagent is more effective than low frequency ceb combined with a high concentration of the chemical reagent it should be noted that the amounts of naclo used for each condition were the same in the three mbrs operated in run 1 removal of foulants is easier when only a limited amount of foulant has accumulated in on the membranes and low concentrations of a chemical are sufficient to remove them in contrast when the amounts of foulants exceed a certain level in a long term operation e g 5 days in run 1 it is difficult to remove them by ceb even with a high concentration of naclo based on the data shown in fig 1 it is recommended that ceb is conducted with a high frequency and a low concentration of the chemical reagent to confirm that cleaning with such a low concentration of naclo was effective for controlling fouling in mbrs and to discount the possibility that frequent hydraulic backwashing was sufficient to control the fouling another experiment was carried out using two mbrs the first mbr was operated with the ceb regime used in run 1 in mbr 3 i e every 6 h with 50 ppm of naclo and the second mbr was operated with hydraulic backwashing using tap water no chemicals the hydraulic backwashing was carried out every 6 h with the same backwash flux and duration as those of ceb the increase in tmp was significantly less in the first mbr with ceb as shown in fig s1 in supporting information whereas the mbr operated with hydraulic backwashing suffered from severe membrane fouling in this operation the first mbr actually exhibited a moderate increase in tmp although almost perfect control of membrane fouling was seen in run 1 under the same ceb conditions this was probably due to the difference in reactor temperatures in the two experiments in run 1 the reactor temperature was approximately 19 c fig 1 whereas the later experiment was conducted at approximately 15 c fig s1 the influence of lower temperatures on the evolution of fouling and the ways of addressing this problem are proposed and discussed later in this paper it should be noted that the introduction of granular materials was very effective for fouling control and indispensable for continuous operation under the test conditions when the mbrs were operated with ceb but without granules rapid fouling was always observed see fig s2 using high concentrations of chemicals for ceb might induce the release of soluble microbial products in mixed liquor suspensions in mbrs leading to acceleration of membrane fouling fig 2 shows the molecular weight distributions of dissolved organic matter in the three mbrs operated in run 1 biopolymers which are defined as hydrophilic organic macromolecules with molecular weights of 10 000 da have been identified as major players in the evolution of membrane fouling in both mbrs sun et al 2011 and low pressure membranes used for drinking water production kennedy et al 2008 kimura et al 2015 in fig 2 the intensity of the peaks representing biopolymers increased with an increase in the naclo concentration similar results were obtained in a study using synthetic wastewater kimura and uchida 2019 and in a study in which ozone was used for ceb sun et al 2018b biomass suspension in mbrs would release soluble microbial products when they come into contact with high concentrations of chemicals in this study a high concentration of naclo 1000 ppm was accompanied by release of biopolymers with molecular weights 1 mda this fraction of biopolymers might have a higher potential for membrane fouling kimura et al 2018 when naclo was used with a concentration of 1000 ppm a peak in the molecular weight distribution appeared at the retention time of 78 min both uv absorbance and nitrogen signals were negligible at that retention time thus the peak at 78 min is assigned to polysaccharides according to a previous study huber et al 2011 peaks appearing after biopolymers in lc ocd analysis at 100 and 110 min in this study represent humic substances and building blocks respectively 3 2 importance of ceb duration in run 1 the duration of ceb was set to 60 min which is in accordance with the previous study kimura and uchida 2019 reducing the duration of ceb would increase the economic feasibility of the proposed method as it would directly increase production rates volumes of treated water and decrease the amount of chemical reagents required therefore the cleaning efficiency of ceb with shorter durations 15 min and 30 min was also examined to this end fouled membranes were prepared by operating the mbrs for 24 h under the same conditions as those in run 1 but without any backwashing after filtration for 24 h ceb was conducted for various durations and the restoration of permeability was assessed as can be seen in fig 3 15 min ceb resulted in a very limited recovery of membrane permeability even with the highest concentration of naclo 1000 ppm extension of the duration of ceb resulted in a significant recovery of membrane permeability indicating the importance of ceb duration for sufficient cleaning of membranes in mbrs with the extension of reaction time better removal of foulants from the used membrane is expected as seen in fig 3 recovery of membrane permeability with 50 ppm of naclo was limited even when ceb was conducted for 60 min however when such ceb was carried out with a high frequency e g 6 h it would effectively control membrane fouling in mbrs see fig 1 the importance of ceb duration for cleaning efficiency was also confirmed in a continuous and parallel operation of the three mbrs run 2 fig 4 shows the increases in tmp in the three mbrs operated with ceb of different durations 10 min 30 min and 60 min the concentration of naclo in the ceb solution was fixed at 50 ppm in run 2 it should also be noted that the frequency of ceb every 6 h was the same in all three mbrs the effects of extending the ceb duration were obvious in run 2 an almost complete control of membrane fouling was achieved with a longer ceb duration of 60 min although the mbr was operated with a very high membrane flux of 50 lmh when ceb was conducted with a short duration 10 min the increase in tmp in each cycle was remarkable indicating the development of reversible fouling i e formation of a cake layer on the membrane surface formation of a cake layer on the membrane surface is facilitated when the membrane surface is conditioned ognier et al 2004 if ceb is conducted with a sufficient duration it can remove such conditioning agents and control reversible fouling a short duration of ceb was not sufficient to remove the conditioning agents for the formation of a cake layer 3 3 control of low temperature fouling 3 3 1 increase in biopolymers in winter as mentioned in the previous sections conducting ceb with a high frequency every 6 h and a low naclo concentration 50 ppm was found to be an effective method of controlling fouling in mbrs operated with granular scouring however when the temperature was as low as 15 c this method was insufficient as shown in fig s1 and other experiments see fig s3 in contrast at a high temperature such as 25 c the cleaning allowed for very stable operation of the mbr with a higher membrane flux of 60 lmh see fig s4 this difference is partly attributed to biopolymers in mixed liquor suspensions when the temperature was low the presence of biopolymers in the mixed liquor suspension in mbrs became significant fig 5 shows lc ocd chromatograms for biomass suspensions collected from the bench scale mbrs operated with appropriate cleaning conditions i e with granular scouring and ceb being conducted every 6 h with 50 ppm naclo at different temperatures as the temperature decreased the peak assigned to biopolymers gradually became significant the link between low temperatures and fouling in mbrs has been shown in many previous studies arévalo et al 2014 gao et al 2013 gurung et al 2017 ma et al 2013 remy et al 2011 sun et al 2014 van den brink et al 2011 zhang et al 2014 the reason for this is still unclear biopolymers detected by lc ocd might play a critical role in membrane fouling in mbrs operated at a low temperature as described later the major cause of membrane fouling in this study was the gel layer formed on the membrane the gel layer was mainly composed of hydrophilic organic matter biopolymers detected by lc ocd were probably the source of the gel layer in fig 5 the peak at 120 min also became significant with a decrease in temperature this peak is assigned to low molecular weight acids and neutrals huber et al 2011 which were much smaller than the micropores of the membrane 0 1 μm it was thought that the contribution of this fraction to membrane fouling was minimal huang et al 2019 yin et al 2019 3 3 2 gel layer formed in winter as stated in the previous sections when the temperature was low and the concentration of biopolymers was high the proposed cleaning method was insufficient for controlling membrane fouling in the mbrs operated with a high flux such as 50 lmh the distribution of reversible fouling and irreversible fouling was investigated and reversible fouling was found to be dominant when the temperature was low see fig s5 high frequency ceb every 6 h with a low naclo concentration 50 ppm was still effective for controlling irreversible fouling even at low temperatures when the temperature was low the formation of a transparent gel layer on the membrane became significant removal of this gel layer is necessary to control the fouling in an mbr operated at a low temperature details of the gel layer were therefore investigated sem images of the gel layers formed in summer and winter are shown in fig 6 scale bars in the images represent 5 μm to obtain sem images one of the mbrs was operated with the relevant cleaning granular scouring and 60 min of ceb every 6 h using 50 ppm naclo in summer and winter and the fouled membranes were observed it should be noted that the flux in the mbr was set to 60 lmh for the preparation of fouled membranes used in sem observation the cleaning was effective in summer and the amount of the gel layer available for analysis was very small when the flux was set at 50 lmh as mentioned before even with a high flux of 60 lmh the mbr could be stably operated in summer fig s4 but formation of a gel layer was observed to compare the gel layer formed in summer with that formed in winter the mbr was operated with a flux of 60 lmh in winter and the fouled membrane was observed by sem the increase in tmp was very rapid in winter with a flux of 60 lmh see fig s6 in both the summer and winter samples very few aggregated bacteria were observed the gel layer did not have the features of a typical biofilm dense aggregates of bacteria in the images of the winter sample dispersed sphere like particles were seen eds analysis suggested that the particles were organic matter it is unlikely that they were bacteria which tend to aggregate in a wastewater treatment system raszka et al 2006 sheng et al 2010 but rather it is postulated that they were algal cells although there is no concrete evidence at present algal cells have been reported with similar shapes and sizes herrera et al 2019 kong et al 2019 ma et al 2012 wang et al 2016 zou et al 2006 the results of ftir analysis support this postulation fig 7 shows ftir spectra of the gel layer samples collected in summer and winter peaks at wavenumbers of 1045 3400 cm 1 and 1560 1650 cm 1 suggest the presence of polysaccharides and proteins in the gel layer respectively leenheer 2009 the gel layer was mainly composed of this hydrophilic organic matter which probably originated from biopolymers figs 2 and 5 in the mixed liquor suspension peaks at wavenumbers of 1720 cm 1 and 2960 cm 1 in the winter sample spectrum were assigned to lipids leenheer 2009 however those peaks were not significant in the spectrum of the summer gel layer lipids are found in algal cells and are a major component of algae uggetti et al 2014 wang et al 2012 in contrast the amount of lipids in bacteria is generally small rittmann and mccarty 2001 a high phosphorus content of the sphere like particles was suggested by eds analysis data not shown also supporting the postulation that the particles were algal cells those algal cells and increased soluble microbial products suggested by lc ocd fig 5 may have synergistically formed the adhesive gel layer that was very resistant to the cleaning method proposed in this study the source of algal cells in winter is not clear the wastewater treatment plant where this study was conducted was connected to a combined sewer system there might be a source of algal cells in the sewer system martins et al 2011 from a comparison of the ftir spectra of gel layers formed in summer and winter it is reasonable to conclude that the nature of the gel layer differs depending on the season the gel layer that formed in winter had unique features which increased its resistance to the proposed cleaning method modification of the cleaning method was necessary to remove the gel layer formed in winter 3 3 3 control of fouling occurring in winter while it is possible to increase the intensity of ceb by increasing the concentration of naclo an increase tends to cause a release of soluble microbial products which leads to membrane fouling as discussed above and should therefore be avoided wang et al 2018 reported that the effectiveness of chemical membrane cleaning using naclo could be enhanced under alkaline conditions wang et al 2018 which was explained by enhanced diffusion of naclo in the fouling layer naclo cleaning under strong alkaline conditions might also be effective for breaking down the adhesive gel layer mentioned above thus the ceb conditions were modified slightly and examined at low temperatures run 3 fig 8 shows the increases in tmp in run 3 three mbrs were operated with different ceb conditions at low temperatures about 16 c in the mbr operated with the control ceb conditions 50 ppm naclo every 6 h control of membrane fouling became difficult after 7 days of operation in contrast the operation of the mbr with the modified ceb conditions 50 ppm of naclo at ph 12 was very stable indicating the effectiveness of the modified ceb naclo seemed to diffuse easily in the gel layer under alkaline conditions and this aided removal of the gel layer by granules alkaline ceb without naclo also enabled efficient control of fouling in run 3 however after 8 days of operation there was a significant difference in the increase in tmp compared to that observed during alkaline assisted naclo ceb at even lower temperatures e g 13 c the modified ceb method was found to be insufficient for control of fouling another approach might be enhancing the physical cleaning increasing the volume of granules introduced would directly increase the frequency of contact between the granules and fouled membranes leading to a better removal of the gel layer in run 4 the volume of granules was therefore increased from 5 of the reactor volume to 20 of the reactor volume and continuous operation was conducted at a lower temperature of 13 c this is close to the lowest temperature at the treatment plant where this study was conducted fig 9 shows increases in tmp in run 4 at 13 c the cleaning method tested in run 3 alkaline assisted naclo ceb combined with 5 granules could not control membrane fouling development of reversible fouling was significant in each filtration cycle and gradually became more severe this clearly indicated the necessity for enhanced physical cleaning after increasing the volume of granules to 20 of the reactor volume v v almost perfect control of fouling was observed it should be noted that the operation in run 4 was conducted at very difficult conditions low temperature and a high membrane flux however the modified cleaning method was still effective it can be assumed that an mbr equipped with ceramic flat sheet membranes can be operated without membrane fouling when the proposed cleaning is carried out the temperature of most real world cases is higher than that tested in this study while membrane flux is generally set to a lower value than in this study as a reference one mbr mbr 3 was operated with 20 v v granules and without ceb and showed a very rapid increase of tmp clearly indicating the importance of ceb 4 conclusion in this study ceramic flat sheet membranes were used in mbrs to examine the effectiveness of intensive membrane cleaning the tests were conducted under challenging conditions high membrane flux of 50 lmh and temperatures as low as 13 c mechanical scouring with granular materials was used for intensive physical cleaning and ceb with naclo was used for intensive chemical cleaning both are effective methods of controlling membrane fouling in mbrs the ceb duration was found to be important and was set at 60 min in this study however to properly control the fouling occurring under the challenging test conditions the two methods were combined and modified it was found that a unique adhesive gel layer formed at low temperatures when the temperature is as low as 13 c it is recommended that a higher volume of granules be added to the reactor as high as 20 v v and that naclo be mixed with alkali when mbrs are operated under mild conditions i e high temperature and low flux the addition of alkali and an increase in the volume of granules is not necessary based on the results obtained in this study under very challenging conditions using real domestic wastewater it is likely that the proposed mbr can be used as a fouling free mbr in most cases declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no

17847,this study investigated the efficiency of intensive membrane cleaning for membrane bioreactors mbrs using a combination of mechanical scouring with granules and chemically enhanced backwashing ceb the implementation of such intensive cleaning was possible with ceramic flat sheet membranes experiments were carried out using bench scale mbrs at an existing wastewater treatment plant first ceb with naclo was investigated in terms of the ceb frequency duration and concentration of the chemical reagent ceb carried out for 60 min every 6 h with 50 ppm of naclo was found to be effective and it enabled an mbr to operate at 50 lmh two to three times higher than the flux of full scale mbrs however these ceb conditions were insufficient when the temperature was low i e in winter when an adhesive gel layer formed on the membrane surface its high resistance to cleaning might be explained by the increased levels of soluble microbial products and or the presence of algal cells alkaline assisted ceb with naclo ph 12 and an increase in the volume of granules in the membrane tank solved this problem with the modified cleaning method the fouling could be almost perfectly controlled at low temperature conditions such as 13 c mbrs may be regarded as fouling free mbrs when the proposed cleaning method is used with ceramic flat sheet membranes most real world mbr operations operate with lower fluxes than the flux examined in this study and at higher temperatures graphical abstract image 1 keywords fouling free mbr granular scouring chemically enhanced backwash gel layer naclo 1 introduction membrane bioreactors mbrs have many advantages over systems using the conventional activated sludge process such as high quality of effluent small footprint and easy operation yamamoto et al 1988 stephenson et al 2000 however the decline of membrane permeability during long term operation i e membrane fouling remains a major limitation of mbr technology membrane fouling increases both operational and capital costs of mbrs preventing them from becoming the mainstream technology for wastewater treatment krzeminski et al 2017 meng et al 2017 generally the membrane tank requires intensive aeration to mitigate membrane fouling in mbrs this has been identified as a major reason for the high operational cost of mbrs fenu et al 2010 xiao et al 2019 furthermore to avoid increases in membrane fouling in mbrs membrane flux is often set to low values operation under sub critical flux is preferred ognier et al 2004 however this requires an increase of the membrane area which directly increases the capital cost of mbrs fouled membranes eventually need off line chemical cleaning to restore their permeability meng et al 2017 which also increases the operational cost of mbrs thus control of membrane fouling is important for the widespread use of mbr technology meng et al 2017 problems associated with membrane fouling might be addressed by effective membrane cleaning using aeration to circulate scouring agents in the mbr tank is a viable option for intensive physical cleaning in mbrs aslam et al 2017 in our previous study cleaning with granular materials was so effective that complete removal of the cake gel layer was observed kurita et al 2014 using mechanical scouring in mbrs substantially reduces the aeration intensity required to maintain sufficient cleaning efficiency kurita et al 2014 2015 however excessive contact between the granular materials and the membrane surface causes significant damage to polymeric membranes kurita et al 2015 using physically robust membranes can solve this problem recently flat sheet ceramic membranes have become commercially available and have been used for mbrs niwa et al 2016 xue et al 2016 li et al 2018 mbrs equipped with ceramic flat sheet membranes should be effectively cleaned with granular scouring the use of ceramic membranes also facilitates the implementation of intensive chemically enhanced backwash ceb where chemical reagents are added to the backwash solution and foulants that have accumulated in micropores are effectively removed it was reported that ceb was also effective for mbrs zsirai et al 2012 ceb can control irreversible internal fouling whereas reversible external fouling can be controlled through granular scouring as mentioned above thus mbrs equipped with ceramic flat sheet membranes in which both intensive ceb and mechanical scouring can be carried out could be used as fouling free mbrs sodium hypochlorite naclo is commonly used for maintenance cleaning or recovery cleaning of membranes shi et al 2014 wang et al 2014 han et al 2016 and is also thought to be effective in ceb of mbrs however when naclo is used for ceb of an mbr and its concentration in the backwash solution is high it can damage the biomass in the reactor which may accelerate fouling cai et al 2016 sun et al 2018a our previous study which examined the use of naclo and granular scouring for ceb in mbrs equipped with flat sheet ceramic membranes kimura and uchida 2019 showed that excessively intense ceb can accelerate membrane fouling via release of soluble microbial products many previous studies have identified soluble microbial products as key players in the evolution of membrane fouling in mbrs rosenberger et al 2006 kimura et al 2009 tian et al 2013 zhang et al 2016 teng et al 2019 our previous study also suggested that evolution of membrane fouling in an mbr equipped with ceramic flat sheet membranes could be almost completely controlled by combining mechanical cleaning using granular materials with ceb of an adequate intensity however those experiments were carried out using synthetic wastewater under controlled room temperature conditions kimura and uchida 2019 additionally membrane flux was set to relatively low values 18 8 30 1 l h m2 lmh thus the practical feasibility of our proposal a combination of granular scouring and ceb for mbr membrane cleaning needs to be verified in a more realistic situation in the present study based on the results of our previous experiment kimura and uchida 2019 mbrs equipped with ceramic flat sheet membranes were examined at an existing wastewater treatment plant that receives domestic wastewater collected via a combined sewer system intensive mechanical scouring using granules was carried out along with ceb using naclo which enabled mbrs to be operated with a very high membrane flux such as 50 lmh this is two to three times higher than the membrane flux of a full scale mbr judd 2016 as described later fouling in the mbrs became severe when the reactors were operated in winter however by modifying the cleaning method the mbr operated stably in winter with a membrane flux of 50 lmh and no membrane fouling details of the fouling were also investigated in this study 2 materials and methods 2 1 bench scale mbrs three identical bench scale mbrs were installed at an existing municipal wastewater treatment plant in sapporo japan the mbrs contained flat sheet ceramic membranes with a nominal pore size of 0 1 μm meidensha tokyo japan the effective volume of the bench scale mbr was 7 5 l the membrane area available in the tank was 0 04 m2 aeration was conducted throughout the operation via porous air diffusers installed at the bottom of the reactor the aeration rate was fixed at 0 012 nm3 min 1 in all experiments described in this study membrane flux was set at 50 lmh and intermittent filtration 1 min pause for every 11 min of filtration was conducted throughout the operation four continuous experiments runs 1 4 were conducted as well as several operations of the mbr with relevant cleaning conditions to obtain samples of mixed liquor suspensions and fouled membranes microorganisms in mbrs can be adversely affected by the chemical reagents used in ceb kimura and uchida 2019 when this occurs it may be a long time before the reactor performance returns to stability to avoid this problem and facilitate multiple experiments in a short period the seed biomass for the bench scale mbrs was directly transferred from a pilot scale mbr installed at the same wastewater treatment plant the bench scale and pilot scale mbrs shared the same feed wastewater the influent to the primary sedimentation basin of the plant and were operated with the same srt of 30 days therefore it was assumed that the biomass transferred to the bench scale mbrs did not need acclimatization each run was initiated immediately after transferring the seed biomass throughout all the experiments in this study stable biological treatment was confirmed a low concentration of total organic carbon 5 mgl 1 in the permeate and complete nitrification were observed the concentration of mixed liquor suspended solids mlss in the mbrs varied between 5 and 7 gl 1 the detailed operational conditions of each run are described in the next section 2 2 intensive membrane cleaning for high flux operation the purpose of each run and their conditions are summarized in table 1 granular materials polyethylene glycol 4 mm cylindrical were introduced into the membrane tank to remove the cake gel layer from the membrane surface the granular materials can move freely in the tank and scratch the membrane surface in each experiment an apparent volume of 375 ml corresponding to 5 of the effective volume of the reactor of the granular materials was introduced into the reactor in run 4 the volume of granules was increased ceb entailed sodium hypochlorite naclo at various concentrations with a constant backwashing flux of 8 lmh the purpose of run 1 was to investigate the impacts of ceb with different frequencies and different concentrations of naclo in run 1 the same amount of naclo was used for ceb in each of the three mbrs run 2 was conducted to verify the importance of ceb duration as described later in winter it was difficult to control fouling in the mbrs by the method established in runs 1 and 2 therefore in run 3 the composition of ceb chemical reagents was modified naoh was added to the ceb solution to increase the ph to 12 in the absence of naoh the naclo solution had a ph of approximately 9 in run 4 to enhance the physical cleaning efficiency larger volumes of granules were placed in the reactors prior to the initiation of each run the permeabilities of the membranes were completely restored by soaking them overnight in 1000 ppm naclo at room temperature 2 3 assessment of the distribution of filtration resistance membrane filtration resistance is often analysed using the following equations 1 r t δ p j μ 2 r t r m r r r i r here j is the permeate flux m3m 2s 1 δp is the trans membrane pressure tmp pa μ is the viscosity of the permeate pa s r t is the total membrane filtration resistance m 1 r m is the intrinsic membrane filtration resistance m 1 r r is the reversible fouling resistance m 1 and r ir is the irreversible fouling resistance m 1 r r is defined as the resistance that can be removed by physical membrane cleaning whereas r ir is defined as the resistance that can be removed by chemical membrane cleaning kurita et al 2014 at the termination of a continuous operation the distribution of filtration resistance was assessed based on those definitions fouled membranes were taken out of the tanks and deposited cake gel was removed from the surfaces of the membranes to thoroughly remove the cake gel layer from the membrane surface plastic brushes polybutylene terephthalate were used ceramic membranes should be tolerant to this harsh physical membrane cleaning membranes were rinsed with tap water after being cleaned with a brush based on visual inspection complete removal of the cake gel layer was always achieved by this method pure water permeability of the fouled membranes was measured before and after the physical cleaning and the recovery of permeability reflected the degree of reversible fouling the degree of irreversible fouling was assessed by comparing the pure water permeability of a fouled membrane after physical cleaning with that of a new membrane 2 4 analysis the concentrations of total organic carbon toc and dissolved organic carbon doc were determined using a toc analyser toc vcsh shimadzu kyoto japan samples containing suspended solids were subjected to toc analysis after sonication for 3

chromatography with an organic carbon detection lc ocd system model 8 doc labor dr huber germany was used for size based fractionation of organic matter kimura et al 2018 before performing lc ocd analyses the samples were filtered using 0 45 μm filters made from ptfe advantec tokyo japan for ftir studies kbr pellets containing 0 25 of a sample were prepared and examined with an ftir spectrophotometer ir 7500s shimadzu kyoto japan at a resolution of 4 cm 1 the surfaces of fouled membranes were observed using scanning electron microscopy sem jsm 6510la jeol ltd japan to fix the surface morphology of the fouled membranes they were broken into small pieces about 1 cm2 using a needle and hammer immersed in 2 glutaraldehyde with 0 1 m phosphate buffer ph 7 2 and left overnight at 5 c the treated samples were then fixed with 1 osmium tetroxide with 0 1 m phosphate buffer at room temperature for 2 h the fixed samples were dehydrated with a series of different concentrations of ethanol after dehydration the samples were immersed twice in isoamyl acetate solution for 15 min each time the samples were dried using a critical point drying apparatus hcp 1 hitachi japan to prevent deformation of the fouled membrane surface morphology the dried samples were coated with platinum to prevent accumulation of a static electric charge during observations the distribution of inorganic elements on the fouled membrane was also investigated using x ray energy dispersive spectroscopy eds with the sem instrument 3 results and discussion 3 1 effects of ceb frequency and reagent concentration on cleaning efficiency fig 1 shows increases in tmp in run 1 which investigated the effects of ceb frequency and naclo concentration on cleaning efficiency in mbr 1 ceb was conducted with a low frequency every 5 days and a high naclo concentration 1000 ppm and there was a significant increase in tmp in contrast mbr 3 operated with a high ceb frequency every 6 h and a low naclo concentration 50 ppm and showed almost no increase in tmp mbr 2 operated with a moderate ceb frequency every 24 h and a moderate naclo concentration 200 ppm and the increase in tmp was between those of the other two mbrs the results clearly indicate that combining high frequency ceb with a low concentration of the chemical reagent is more effective than low frequency ceb combined with a high concentration of the chemical reagent it should be noted that the amounts of naclo used for each condition were the same in the three mbrs operated in run 1 removal of foulants is easier when only a limited amount of foulant has accumulated in on the membranes and low concentrations of a chemical are sufficient to remove them in contrast when the amounts of foulants exceed a certain level in a long term operation e g 5 days in run 1 it is difficult to remove them by ceb even with a high concentration of naclo based on the data shown in fig 1 it is recommended that ceb is conducted with a high frequency and a low concentration of the chemical reagent to confirm that cleaning with such a low concentration of naclo was effective for controlling fouling in mbrs and to discount the possibility that frequent hydraulic backwashing was sufficient to control the fouling another experiment was carried out using two mbrs the first mbr was operated with the ceb regime used in run 1 in mbr 3 i e every 6 h with 50 ppm of naclo and the second mbr was operated with hydraulic backwashing using tap water no chemicals the hydraulic backwashing was carried out every 6 h with the same backwash flux and duration as those of ceb the increase in tmp was significantly less in the first mbr with ceb as shown in fig s1 in supporting information whereas the mbr operated with hydraulic backwashing suffered from severe membrane fouling in this operation the first mbr actually exhibited a moderate increase in tmp although almost perfect control of membrane fouling was seen in run 1 under the same ceb conditions this was probably due to the difference in reactor temperatures in the two experiments in run 1 the reactor temperature was approximately 19 c fig 1 whereas the later experiment was conducted at approximately 15 c fig s1 the influence of lower temperatures on the evolution of fouling and the ways of addressing this problem are proposed and discussed later in this paper it should be noted that the introduction of granular materials was very effective for fouling control and indispensable for continuous operation under the test conditions when the mbrs were operated with ceb but without granules rapid fouling was always observed see fig s2 using high concentrations of chemicals for ceb might induce the release of soluble microbial products in mixed liquor suspensions in mbrs leading to acceleration of membrane fouling fig 2 shows the molecular weight distributions of dissolved organic matter in the three mbrs operated in run 1 biopolymers which are defined as hydrophilic organic macromolecules with molecular weights of 10 000 da have been identified as major players in the evolution of membrane fouling in both mbrs sun et al 2011 and low pressure membranes used for drinking water production kennedy et al 2008 kimura et al 2015 in fig 2 the intensity of the peaks representing biopolymers increased with an increase in the naclo concentration similar results were obtained in a study using synthetic wastewater kimura and uchida 2019 and in a study in which ozone was used for ceb sun et al 2018b biomass suspension in mbrs would release soluble microbial products when they come into contact with high concentrations of chemicals in this study a high concentration of naclo 1000 ppm was accompanied by release of biopolymers with molecular weights 1 mda this fraction of biopolymers might have a higher potential for membrane fouling kimura et al 2018 when naclo was used with a concentration of 1000 ppm a peak in the molecular weight distribution appeared at the retention time of 78 min both uv absorbance and nitrogen signals were negligible at that retention time thus the peak at 78 min is assigned to polysaccharides according to a previous study huber et al 2011 peaks appearing after biopolymers in lc ocd analysis at 100 and 110 min in this study represent humic substances and building blocks respectively 3 2 importance of ceb duration in run 1 the duration of ceb was set to 60 min which is in accordance with the previous study kimura and uchida 2019 reducing the duration of ceb would increase the economic feasibility of the proposed method as it would directly increase production rates volumes of treated water and decrease the amount of chemical reagents required therefore the cleaning efficiency of ceb with shorter durations 15 min and 30 min was also examined to this end fouled membranes were prepared by operating the mbrs for 24 h under the same conditions as those in run 1 but without any backwashing after filtration for 24 h ceb was conducted for various durations and the restoration of permeability was assessed as can be seen in fig 3 15 min ceb resulted in a very limited recovery of membrane permeability even with the highest concentration of naclo 1000 ppm extension of the duration of ceb resulted in a significant recovery of membrane permeability indicating the importance of ceb duration for sufficient cleaning of membranes in mbrs with the extension of reaction time better removal of foulants from the used membrane is expected as seen in fig 3 recovery of membrane permeability with 50 ppm of naclo was limited even when ceb was conducted for 60 min however when such ceb was carried out with a high frequency e g 6 h it would effectively control membrane fouling in mbrs see fig 1 the importance of ceb duration for cleaning efficiency was also confirmed in a continuous and parallel operation of the three mbrs run 2 fig 4 shows the increases in tmp in the three mbrs operated with ceb of different durations 10 min 30 min and 60 min the concentration of naclo in the ceb solution was fixed at 50 ppm in run 2 it should also be noted that the frequency of ceb every 6 h was the same in all three mbrs the effects of extending the ceb duration were obvious in run 2 an almost complete control of membrane fouling was achieved with a longer ceb duration of 60 min although the mbr was operated with a very high membrane flux of 50 lmh when ceb was conducted with a short duration 10 min the increase in tmp in each cycle was remarkable indicating the development of reversible fouling i e formation of a cake layer on the membrane surface formation of a cake layer on the membrane surface is facilitated when the membrane surface is conditioned ognier et al 2004 if ceb is conducted with a sufficient duration it can remove such conditioning agents and control reversible fouling a short duration of ceb was not sufficient to remove the conditioning agents for the formation of a cake layer 3 3 control of low temperature fouling 3 3 1 increase in biopolymers in winter as mentioned in the previous sections conducting ceb with a high frequency every 6 h and a low naclo concentration 50 ppm was found to be an effective method of controlling fouling in mbrs operated with granular scouring however when the temperature was as low as 15 c this method was insufficient as shown in fig s1 and other experiments see fig s3 in contrast at a high temperature such as 25 c the cleaning allowed for very stable operation of the mbr with a higher membrane flux of 60 lmh see fig s4 this difference is partly attributed to biopolymers in mixed liquor suspensions when the temperature was low the presence of biopolymers in the mixed liquor suspension in mbrs became significant fig 5 shows lc ocd chromatograms for biomass suspensions collected from the bench scale mbrs operated with appropriate cleaning conditions i e with granular scouring and ceb being conducted every 6 h with 50 ppm naclo at different temperatures as the temperature decreased the peak assigned to biopolymers gradually became significant the link between low temperatures and fouling in mbrs has been shown in many previous studies arévalo et al 2014 gao et al 2013 gurung et al 2017 ma et al 2013 remy et al 2011 sun et al 2014 van den brink et al 2011 zhang et al 2014 the reason for this is still unclear biopolymers detected by lc ocd might play a critical role in membrane fouling in mbrs operated at a low temperature as described later the major cause of membrane fouling in this study was the gel layer formed on the membrane the gel layer was mainly composed of hydrophilic organic matter biopolymers detected by lc ocd were probably the source of the gel layer in fig 5 the peak at 120 min also became significant with a decrease in temperature this peak is assigned to low molecular weight acids and neutrals huber et al 2011 which were much smaller than the micropores of the membrane 0 1 μm it was thought that the contribution of this fraction to membrane fouling was minimal huang et al 2019 yin et al 2019 3 3 2 gel layer formed in winter as stated in the previous sections when the temperature was low and the concentration of biopolymers was high the proposed cleaning method was insufficient for controlling membrane fouling in the mbrs operated with a high flux such as 50 lmh the distribution of reversible fouling and irreversible fouling was investigated and reversible fouling was found to be dominant when the temperature was low see fig s5 high frequency ceb every 6 h with a low naclo concentration 50 ppm was still effective for controlling irreversible fouling even at low temperatures when the temperature was low the formation of a transparent gel layer on the membrane became significant removal of this gel layer is necessary to control the fouling in an mbr operated at a low temperature details of the gel layer were therefore investigated sem images of the gel layers formed in summer and winter are shown in fig 6 scale bars in the images represent 5 μm to obtain sem images one of the mbrs was operated with the relevant cleaning granular scouring and 60 min of ceb every 6 h using 50 ppm naclo in summer and winter and the fouled membranes were observed it should be noted that the flux in the mbr was set to 60 lmh for the preparation of fouled membranes used in sem observation the cleaning was effective in summer and the amount of the gel layer available for analysis was very small when the flux was set at 50 lmh as mentioned before even with a high flux of 60 lmh the mbr could be stably operated in summer fig s4 but formation of a gel layer was observed to compare the gel layer formed in summer with that formed in winter the mbr was operated with a flux of 60 lmh in winter and the fouled membrane was observed by sem the increase in tmp was very rapid in winter with a flux of 60 lmh see fig s6 in both the summer and winter samples very few aggregated bacteria were observed the gel layer did not have the features of a typical biofilm dense aggregates of bacteria in the images of the winter sample dispersed sphere like particles were seen eds analysis suggested that the particles were organic matter it is unlikely that they were bacteria which tend to aggregate in a wastewater treatment system raszka et al 2006 sheng et al 2010 but rather it is postulated that they were algal cells although there is no concrete evidence at present algal cells have been reported with similar shapes and sizes herrera et al 2019 kong et al 2019 ma et al 2012 wang et al 2016 zou et al 2006 the results of ftir analysis support this postulation fig 7 shows ftir spectra of the gel layer samples collected in summer and winter peaks at wavenumbers of 1045 3400 cm 1 and 1560 1650 cm 1 suggest the presence of polysaccharides and proteins in the gel layer respectively leenheer 2009 the gel layer was mainly composed of this hydrophilic organic matter which probably originated from biopolymers figs 2 and 5 in the mixed liquor suspension peaks at wavenumbers of 1720 cm 1 and 2960 cm 1 in the winter sample spectrum were assigned to lipids leenheer 2009 however those peaks were not significant in the spectrum of the summer gel layer lipids are found in algal cells and are a major component of algae uggetti et al 2014 wang et al 2012 in contrast the amount of lipids in bacteria is generally small rittmann and mccarty 2001 a high phosphorus content of the sphere like particles was suggested by eds analysis data not shown also supporting the postulation that the particles were algal cells those algal cells and increased soluble microbial products suggested by lc ocd fig 5 may have synergistically formed the adhesive gel layer that was very resistant to the cleaning method proposed in this study the source of algal cells in winter is not clear the wastewater treatment plant where this study was conducted was connected to a combined sewer system there might be a source of algal cells in the sewer system martins et al 2011 from a comparison of the ftir spectra of gel layers formed in summer and winter it is reasonable to conclude that the nature of the gel layer differs depending on the season the gel layer that formed in winter had unique features which increased its resistance to the proposed cleaning method modification of the cleaning method was necessary to remove the gel layer formed in winter 3 3 3 control of fouling occurring in winter while it is possible to increase the intensity of ceb by increasing the concentration of naclo an increase tends to cause a release of soluble microbial products which leads to membrane fouling as discussed above and should therefore be avoided wang et al 2018 reported that the effectiveness of chemical membrane cleaning using naclo could be enhanced under alkaline conditions wang et al 2018 which was explained by enhanced diffusion of naclo in the fouling layer naclo cleaning under strong alkaline conditions might also be effective for breaking down the adhesive gel layer mentioned above thus the ceb conditions were modified slightly and examined at low temperatures run 3 fig 8 shows the increases in tmp in run 3 three mbrs were operated with different ceb conditions at low temperatures about 16 c in the mbr operated with the control ceb conditions 50 ppm naclo every 6 h control of membrane fouling became difficult after 7 days of operation in contrast the operation of the mbr with the modified ceb conditions 50 ppm of naclo at ph 12 was very stable indicating the effectiveness of the modified ceb naclo seemed to diffuse easily in the gel layer under alkaline conditions and this aided removal of the gel layer by granules alkaline ceb without naclo also enabled efficient control of fouling in run 3 however after 8 days of operation there was a significant difference in the increase in tmp compared to that observed during alkaline assisted naclo ceb at even lower temperatures e g 13 c the modified ceb method was found to be insufficient for control of fouling another approach might be enhancing the physical cleaning increasing the volume of granules introduced would directly increase the frequency of contact between the granules and fouled membranes leading to a better removal of the gel layer in run 4 the volume of granules was therefore increased from 5 of the reactor volume to 20 of the reactor volume and continuous operation was conducted at a lower temperature of 13 c this is close to the lowest temperature at the treatment plant where this study was conducted fig 9 shows increases in tmp in run 4 at 13 c the cleaning method tested in run 3 alkaline assisted naclo ceb combined with 5 granules could not control membrane fouling development of reversible fouling was significant in each filtration cycle and gradually became more severe this clearly indicated the necessity for enhanced physical cleaning after increasing the volume of granules to 20 of the reactor volume v v almost perfect control of fouling was observed it should be noted that the operation in run 4 was conducted at very difficult conditions low temperature and a high membrane flux however the modified cleaning method was still effective it can be assumed that an mbr equipped with ceramic flat sheet membranes can be operated without membrane fouling when the proposed cleaning is carried out the temperature of most real world cases is higher than that tested in this study while membrane flux is generally set to a lower value than in this study as a reference one mbr mbr 3 was operated with 20 v v granules and without ceb and showed a very rapid increase of tmp clearly indicating the importance of ceb 4 conclusion in this study ceramic flat sheet membranes were used in mbrs to examine the effectiveness of intensive membrane cleaning the tests were conducted under challenging conditions high membrane flux of 50 lmh and temperatures as low as 13 c mechanical scouring with granular materials was used for intensive physical cleaning and ceb with naclo was used for intensive chemical cleaning both are effective methods of controlling membrane fouling in mbrs the ceb duration was found to be important and was set at 60 min in this study however to properly control the fouling occurring under the challenging test conditions the two methods were combined and modified it was found that a unique adhesive gel layer formed at low temperatures when the temperature is as low as 13 c it is recommended that a higher volume of granules be added to the reactor as high as 20 v v and that naclo be mixed with alkali when mbrs are operated under mild conditions i e high temperature and low flux the addition of alkali and an increase in the volume of granules is not necessary based on the results obtained in this study under very challenging conditions using real domestic wastewater it is likely that the proposed mbr can be used as a fouling free mbr in most cases declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no

17848,harmful algal blooms habs can have dire repercussions on aquatic wildlife and human health and may negatively affect recreational uses aesthetics taste and odor in drinking water the factors that influence the occurrence and magnitude of harmful algal blooms and toxin production remain poorly understood and can vary in space and time it is within this context that we use machine learning ml and two 14 year 2005 2018 data sets on water quality and meteorological conditions of china s lakes and reservoirs to shed light on the magnitude and associated drivers of hab events general regression neural network grnn models are developed to predict chlorophyll a concentrations for each lake and reservoir during two study periods 2005 2010 and 2011 2018 the developed models with an acceptable model fit are then analyzed by two indices to determine the areal hab magnitudes and associated drivers our national assessment suggests that hab magnitudes for china s lakes and reservoirs displayed a decreasing trend from 2006 1363 3 km2 to 2013 665 2 km2 and a slightly increasing trend from 2013 to 2018 775 4 km2 among the 142 studied lakes and reservoirs most severe habs were found in lakes taihu dianchi and chaohu with their contribution to the total hab magnitude varying from 89 2 2013 to 62 6 2018 habs in lakes taihu and chaohu were strongly associated with both total phosphorus and nitrogen concentrations while our results were inconclusive with respect to the predominant environmental factors shaping the eutrophication phenomena in lake dianchi the present study provides evidence that effective hab mitigation may require both nitrogen and phosphorus reductions and longer recovery times especially in view of the current climate change projections ml represents a robust strategy to elucidate water quality patterns in lakes where the available information is sufficient to train the constructed algorithms our mapping of hab magnitudes and associated environmental meteorological drivers can help managers to delineate hot spots at a national scale and comprehensively design the best management practices for mitigating the eutrophication severity in china s lakes and reservoirs keywords general regression neural network chlorophyll a risk analysis harmful algal blooms eutrophication 1 introduction harmful algal blooms habs have been showing a rising trend in freshwater ecosystems worldwide and represent one of the most challenging environmental problems huisman et al 2018 often manifested as dense surface scums habs may have significant environmental and socioeconomic implications particularly due to the production of cyanotoxins which can adversely impact the health of those utilizing surface waters for drinking water and recreational activities carmichael and boyer 2016 watson et al 2016 in a survey of 2058 water bodies worldwide in 2012 63 1 of the total number and 30 5 of the total surface area were found to be eutrophic and were mainly concentrated in central africa eastern asia mid northern and southeast north america wang et al 2018 the magnitude frequency and duration of habs appear to be increasing at a global scale especially in inland waters brooks et al 2016 ho et al 2019 severe habs have been reported in many large lakes around the globe such as lake erie in the laurentian great lakes watson et al 2016 lake winnipeg in canada ulrich et al 2016 lake taihu qin et al 2019 chaohu huang et al 2018 and dianchi wu et al 2017 in china see table s1 in supporting information remedial measures in order to mitigate hab severity typically include the reduction of external nutrient loading increasing hydraulic loading to induce faster flushing rates and chemical or biological treatment strategies huisman et al 2018 nonetheless hab incidences are likely to continue over the next decades and may be further accentuated by the advent of climate change chapra et al 2017 sinha et al 2017 like other rapidly industrializing nations china has been severely threatened by lake eutrophication and frequent hab events during the past decade in 2017 16 3 of the polluted water in china s freshwater lakes and reservoirs was attributed to eutrophication huang et al 2019 while another recent nationwide assessment revealed that 29 of the total 107 surveyed lakes experienced eutrophication problems ministry of ecology and environment 2019 indicative of the growing interest worldwide is the increasing number of case studies that have been conducted to quantify hab magnitudes to identify the suite of the underlying causal factors and to investigate the potential control strategies qin et al 2019 according to our recent search in the elsevier database 23 april 2020 the number of publications with the term algal bloom in the title or abstract increased from 34 in 2000 to 361 in 2019 notwithstanding all the active research the causal relationships and mechanisms leading to hab events have not been adequately investigated harris and graham 2017 scholz et al 2017 given that the dynamic response of phytoplankton to changes in environmental conditions results in blooms that are highly variable in space and time hab events typically co vary with a multitude of ambient conditions alone or in combination such as elevated chlorophyll a and nutrient concentrations warmer water temperature reduced wind speed increased water column stability and reduced grazing pressure among others burford et al 2020 conley et al 2009 francy et al 2016 paerl et al 2016a 2019 shimoda and arhonditsis 2016 wood et al 2017 wurtsbaugh et al 2019 likewise the total nitrogen to total phosphorus n p ratio and precipitation patterns have been identified as regulatory factors jacoby et al 2015 orihel et al 2012 paerl et al 2016a scott et al 2013 and so has the relative abundance of different nitrogen n species that may also modulate the toxicity of hab events kelly et al 2019 monchamp et al 2014 scott et al 2014 in many instances the design of lake specific management strategies without the consideration of water quality in other neighbouring lakes has been proven to be flawed because many lakes and reservoirs within a given region in china are connected to each other via a complex river network shi et al 2020 wang et al 2019 for example there are more than 10 000 reservoirs in the upstream areas of lake poyang and therefore water quality in those lakes reservoirs can profoundly influence the ambient conditions of china s largest freshwater lake dong et al 2019 thus the design of effective regional management strategies may require the characterization of inter system differences at a larger spatial scale several studies attempted to investigate eutrophication patterns across lakes huang et al 2019 wang et al 2018 but hab magnitudes and drivers at a larger spatial e g national or global scale have been scarcely investigated probably due to the lack of adequate datasets or flexible eutrophication modelling tools with general applicability janssen et al 2019 such investigation is urgently needed in water management practice due to its potential usefulness in supporting best management practices for hab mitigation to this end both data driven and process based models have offered useful tools to investigate hab magnitudes and influential drivers shimoda and arhonditsis 2016 vinçon leite and casenave 2019 arhonditsis et al 2019a b process based models are founded upon our best mechanistic understanding of the ecosystem functioning that ultimately shapes hab dynamics frassl et al 2019 janssen et al 2017 while they can be presumably used for extrapolative tasks they do require extensive input data e g external or internal forcing functions which may not be available for most lakes at the other end of the complexity spectrum data driven models aim to establish simple empirical relationships between habs and underlying causal factors that can be used to draw predictions within the domain of the data used vinçon leite and casenave 2019 among the data driven strategies machine learning ml represents a promising way to elucidate the complex non linear processes typically associated with habs jordan and mitchell 2015 reichstein et al 2019 in this regard the aim of the present study is to quantify trends in hab magnitudes and identify drivers for china s lakes and reservoirs at a national scale for this purpose we used two comprehensive 14 year 2005 2018 datasets comprising monthly water quality data from 142 lakes and reservoirs and daily meteorological records from 699 stations we established the relationship between habs and environmental factors for each lake or reservoir using a novel ml technique of general regression neural network grnn modelling we also developed two new indices that are used to characterize the spatial trends of hab magnitudes and critical regulatory factors our study is a novel attempt to create a synoptic map of hab patterns for china s lakes and reservoirs and to pinpoint hot spots that require special attention when designing restoration strategies at a national scale 2 material and methods 2 1 study area and datasets in china there are 2693 lakes with a surface area larger than 1 km2 and 89 700 reservoirs covering 26 870 km2 ma et al 2011 yang and lu 2014 for our modelling exercise we compiled the following two national datasets i water quality dataset to capture water quality trends in china s lakes a year round monthly sampling program was conducted in 142 lakes and reservoirs by the chinese national environmental monitoring centre http www cnemc cn resulting in a large dataset covering a 14 year 2005 2018 period fig 1 this dataset includes chlorophyll a chla μg l 1 along with 24 water quality variables listed as china s environmental quality standards for surface waters no gb 3838 2002 such as total nitrogen tn mg l 1 total phosphorus tp mg l 1 ammonia nitrogen nh3 n mg l 1 and eight heavy metals copper zinc selenium arsenic mercury cadmium chromium and lead ii meteorological dataset to account for the prevailing meteorological conditions in china s lakes and reservoirs we used daily records from 699 national weather stations across china since 1951 http data cma cn locations of the national weather stations are given in fig s1 with nine variables considered including pressure pa air temperature oc relative humidity precipitation mm evaporation mm daily sunshine hours h ground temperature oc wind speed m s 1 and direction o meteorological conditions for each lake were represented by the station with a minimum distance to its centre based on the two national data sets 58 lakes and reservoirs with a total of 21 325 sampling records were selected having more than 50 records over the course of the study period fig 1 among the studied lakes and reservoirs five large lakes lakes poyang dongting taihu hongze and chaohu and lakes dianchi and erhai have been identified as china s critical lakes by the government see guidelines on strengthening water environmental protection for critical lakes released in 2008 these seven critical lakes covering a total surface area of 11 338 km2 were intensively monitored with more than 1000 sampling records for each lake and a total of 12 089 sampling records during the 2005 2018 period chla was the water quality variable that was used as a surrogate to represent habs while the potential predictors comprised temperature t daily sunshine hours sr tn tp nh3 n and n p ratios scatter plots for the three ambient nutrient tn tp and nh3 n concentrations revealed that there is no collinearity problem fig s2 2 2 modelling framework our modelling framework comprised four steps whereby we predicted occurrences evaluated risks quantified magnitudes and identified drivers of habs in china s lakes and reservoirs fig 2 grnn modelling was used to characterize the complex relationships between chla and the surrounding environmental conditions the models with an acceptable model fit were subsequently used to determine hab magnitudes with a quantitative index and identify the critical drivers for each lake through sensitivity analysis based on non linear regression theory grnn is an one pass supervised learning algorithm consisting of a four layer feed forward neural network namely the input pattern summation and output layers specht 1991 the number of neurons in the input and output layer corresponds to the number of input and output variables and the number of neuron patterns is equal to the number of data patterns antanasijević et al 2014 grnn was selected because it has been demonstrated to provide robust water quality predictions antanasijević et al 2014 csábrági et al 2017 the development of grnn models was implemented in the python library of neupy with a computational backend of google s deep learning framework tensorflow https www tensorflow org for the 58 selected lakes and reservoirs fig 1 two grnn models were developed to predict chla during the 2005 2010 and 2011 2018 periods respectively the separation of study periods is due to a regime shift of water quality in china lakes and reservoirs after 2010 huang et al 2019 based on the available data 19 and 57 grnn models were developed for the periods of 2005 2010 and 2011 2018 respectively all these grnn models included the input variables of t sr tn tp n p and nh3 n see fig s3 for a schematic representation for each lake 80 and 20 of their sampling records were used for model training and testing respectively 2 2 1 development of a hab risk index we used two surrogate variables to emulate the likelihood of prevalence of favourable conditions for hab formation namely chla and wind speed ws m s 1 the former variable represented the available phytoplankton biomass as the collective output of the eutrophication processes within a given system while the latter was used as a proxy for water column stability that in turn allows algal cells to be retained within the surface layer of the water column cao et al 2006 hu et al 2016 based on this mechanistic explanation we formulated a hab risk index r i h a b i calculated from each water sample i as follows r i h a b i max c h l a i c h l a h a b c h l a h a b 100 max 0 1 w s i 2 w s h a b 100 the equation includes two input variables of chl a i and w s i and two associated empirical parameters c h l a h a b and w s h a b that are used to assess the likelihood of hab formation thus according to our mathematical expression r i h a b is an index that provides non zero values only if chla concentrations are greater than a threshold level c h l a i c h l a h a b and wind speed is lower than a critical value w s i 2 w s h a b whereby the standing phytoplankton biomass and reduced vertical mixing gradually leads to hab manifestation although several c h l a h a b values have been reported in the literature the vast majority of the proposed chla concentrations suggest an approximate value of 10 μg l 1 as the cut off point to mark the gradual establishment of habs ho and michalak 2015 kelly et al 2019 wu and xu 2011 and was therefore selected as the empirical c h l a h a b threshold for our analysis likewise a critical value of 3 0 m s 1 has been proposed as the maximum wind speed that still allows surface accumulation of phytoplankton wu et al 2010 nonetheless existing evidence suggests that hab formation can still occur under windier conditions binding et al 2018 cao et al 2006 zhang et al 2012 and we thus included a multiplier 2 in the denominator of the second term of our r i h a b i index to ensure non zero values even when relatively high ws conditions prevail we also evaluated the sensitivity of r i h a b i to the values assigned to the two thresholds and found that the interplay between ws conditions and chla can be more influential on the r i h a b i values than each of the predictor variables alone fig s4 based on the proposed risk index r i h a b i the daily likelihood for hab events in each lake can be calculated from the predicted chl a i from the grnn models section 2 2 and wind speed 2 2 2 development of a hab magnitude index hab magnitude can be quantified by peak algal biomass hab area or duration in this study we evaluated hab magnitude based on the areal extent high hab risk daily conditions were identified as those with r i h a b i greater than 10 which in turn approximately corresponds to chla and ws values of 30 μg l 1 and 3 m s 1 respectively therefore high hab risk areas within a given lake can be quantified from the hab magnitude index m h a b km2 as follows duan et al 2017 m h a b i 1 365 j 1 n s i j 365 where s i j represents the area km2 with high hab risk r i h a b 10 that corresponds to the water sample j collected on the ith day the area of each lake was divided by the number of sampling stations n and the individual water samples j collected from the sampling stations within a given date are collectively used to estimate the total lake area with high hab risk thus m h a b represents the daily average area with high hab risk that may lead to harmful impacts over the course of a year a synoptic map of hab patterns can then be derived in arcgis software based on the calculated hab magnitude index values for each of the 58 selected lakes and reservoirs fig 1 overall our aim was to create a modelling tool that can depict the temporal evolution of the average spatial extent of habs over the course of our study period we used the series of water quality snapshots from the monitoring of each system to establish the optimal relationships between areal hab magnitude and frequently used limnological environmental predictor variables regardless of their causal or correlative nature these relationships are effectively capturing the linkages among common predictor variables which are then used to draw daily estimates of the hab magnitude in every single lake of our dataset in other words this modelling framework is designed to derive the big picture of hab severity at a national level in china 2 2 3 global warming phosphorus management and hab risks we evaluated the potential changes of hab magnitudes in china s lakes and reservoirs induced by the on going p abatement from non point sources under the prospect of a warmer climate to evaluate the potential benefits from reducing ambient tp we examined two scenarios i e 20 tp reduction and no change in the measured values future air temperatures across china were emulated based on the projections from the global climate model gcm of beijing climate centre climate system model version 2 bcc csm2 mr of the coupled model intercomparison project cmip6 wu et al 2019 three shared socioeconomic pathways ssps i e ssp1 2 6 ssp2 4 5 and ssp5 8 5 were selected to represent scenarios of future global emissions and land use changes o neill et al 2016 ssp5 8 5 represents continuously increasing greenhouse gas emissions with a radiative forcing level of 8 5 w m2 in the year 2100 in ssp1 2 6 global annual greenhouse gas emissions peak between 2010 and 2020 with emissions declining substantially thereafter and the radiative forcing set at the level of 2 6 w m2 emissions with ssp2 4 5 peak around 2040 and then decline with a radiation level of 4 5 w m2 these future air temperature data used in this study were downloaded from https pcmdi llnl gov cmip6 2 2 4 identifying the relative importance of hab drivers critical hab drivers for each lake were identified through sensitivity analysis of the corresponding validated grnn models each driver was increased decreased by 5 while all other predictors were kept fixed the one at a time method was used to quantify the influence of each input variable on the magnitude of habs norton 2015 s i x i 1 n f i v 1 v x δ v m f i v 1 v x v m 2 n f i v 1 v x v m δ v x f i v 1 v x δ v m f i v 1 v x v m 2 n f i v 1 v x v m δ v x where s i x is the sensitivity index of the testing predictor x f i v 1 v x v m is the predicted chla of sample i 1 2 n from the base model application in each lake f i v 1 v x δ v m and f i v 1 v x δ v m are the predicted chla of sample i after increasing decreasing the value of the causal driver x v x by δ 0 1 v x respectively a larger s i x implies that habs are more sensitive to the driver x on the top of the s i x index calculation we conducted monte carlo mc simulations of the validated grnn models to capture the nature of the relationship between chla and the individual predictors for each testing driver input water quality variable 1000 simulations were carried out with its values uniformly sampled from the lake specific ranges 3 results 3 1 grnn model performance during the training phase all 19 and 57 grnn models for the periods of 2005 2010 and 2011 2018 see section 2 2 achieved an excellent fit against the measured data p 0 001 with an average r 2 value higher than 0 95 fig 3 a and c on the other hand among the 19 developed grnn models for 2005 2010 only 16 models achieved a satisfactory fit p 0 05 during the testing or validation period with an average r 2 value of 0 46 fig 3b three models failed to predict chla dynamics in lakes bosten qiandao and kunming displaying an unacceptable model fit p 0 1 likewise among the 57 developed grnn models for 2011 2018 45 achieved acceptable model fit p 0 1 with an average r 2 value of 0 45 fig 3d importantly a satisfactory model fit was achieved between predicted and measured chla concentrations for the seven critical lakes with large data sets 1000 sampling records p 0 05 fig s5 the list of lake models as well as their input data information and model performance are provided in table s2 3 2 hab magnitudes in china s lakes and reservoirs the year to year variability of hab magnitudes fig 4 in china s lakes and reservoirs has been predominantly shaped by the contribution of three lakes lakes taihu dianchi and chaohu throughout the 2005 2018 period fig 4 according to our analysis hab magnitudes displayed a non monotonic pattern which was characterized by a peak value of 1363 3 km2 in 2006 decreased down to 671 5 km2 in 2013 and a slightly increasing trend thereafter it is also worth noting that the number of studied lakes and reservoirs has apparently a limited impact on this result as the higher number of samples in 2012 and 2016 did not lead to an increase of our hab magnitude estimates fig 4 lakes taihu dianchi and chaohu collectively contribute a significant fraction of the overall hab magnitude which in turn decreased from 89 2 2013 to 62 6 2018 in 2018 china s lakes and reservoirs were still severely threatened by habs with a magnitude as high as 775 4 km2 and 37 4 of this estimate or 289 8 km2 occurred in lakes other than lakes taihu dianchi and chaohu our hab magnitude results are comparable with those reported from the national eutrophication assessment for china s lakes by the ministry of ecology and environment 2019 which highlighted the eutrophic state of lakes taihu dianchi and chaohu the derived hab magnitude temporal trend is on par with the water quality patterns presented by huang et al 2019 in that both are suggestive of a promising trajectory during the first decade of the 2000s followed by an establishment of steady state or even a slight deterioration thereafter consistent with the spatial distribution of china s population density the resulting map of hab magnitudes suggests that the majority of the most impacted lakes m h a b 10 km 2 were located in eastern china in 2018 fig 5 lakes dianchi and taihu had the highest hab magnitude estimates with m h a b values of 208 6 and 196 4 km2 which corresponded to 67 5 and 8 4 of their surface areas respectively moreover 9 lakes lakes chaohu luoma longgan songhua gaoyou liangzi poyang wabu baiyangdian were classified into a medium range with m h a b values varying from 10 to 100 km2 while 14 lakes displayed low hab magnitude with m h a b values 10 km2 to gain further insights into the hab dynamics of the seven critical lakes in china their inter annual variability in hab risks and magnitudes is provided in fig 5a g consistent the aforementioned national pattern lakes taihu and chaohu showed peak values in 2006 decreased significantly between 2006 and 2013 and appear to have reached an equilibrium with values of 200 and 70 km2 between 2014 and 2018 fig 5c and e the temporal pattern projected for lake chaohu is consistent with the findings from satellite images reported by duan et al 2017 reinforcing the notion that the occurrence of severe habs in 2008 was succeeded by the establishment of a steady state in terms of the prevailing water quality conditions by contrast our estimated hab magnitude for lake taihu in 2017 323 7 km2 was lower compared with the satellite based value of 460 0 km2 by qin et al 2019 which is not surprising given that satellite images tend to overestimate the actual hab magnitudes during low wind speed conditions huang et al 2012 interestingly nearly 25 of the daily predicted hab risk r i h a b values for lakes taihu and chaohu were 10 in 2018 fig 5c and e habs in lake dianchi were extremely severe with a magnitude as high as 250 km2 throughout the 2005 2017 period while close to 95 of the derived r i h a b values were 10 fig 5f hab magnitude estimates displayed a decreasing trend in lake erhai fig 5g but were characterized by an increasing trend in lakes poyang and hongze with relatively high r i h a b values in 2018 fig 5a and d except from the predicted high hab risks and magnitudes in 2007 2010 lake dongting showed the most satisfactory water quality conditions among the seven intensively studied chinese lakes fig 5b 3 3 global warming tp mitigation scenarios and hab magnitudes the projected hab magnitudes in 20 50 and 80 years suggest that global warming will likely negate any potential benefits from the tp mitigation strategies in the surrounding watershed fig 6 without any tp reduction strategies in place the scenario of high greenhouse gas concentration levels ssp5 8 5 is suggestive of a 12 3 increase of the hab magnitude index from 775 4 2018 to 870 9 2098 km2 fig 6c even though global warming is predicted to be the predominant factor reducing tp concentration by 20 can partly alleviate the increase of hab magnitudes especially in lake dianchi fig 6c forced with the scenarios of low and medium greenhouse gas concentration levels ssp1 2 6 and ssp2 4 5 the projected hab magnitudes in china s lakes and reservoirs appear to be relatively stable without a discernible increasing pattern except from lakes taihu and dianchi fig 6a and b 3 4 identification of hab drivers in china s lakes and reservoirs the spatial patterns of the sensitivity index si values for six environmental factors t sr tn tp n p and nh3 n were drawn to delineate their influence on chla concentrations during the two study periods 2005 2010 and 2011 2018 fig 7 an interesting result from our analysis was that the predicted chla concentrations were more sensitive to t and sr in eastern china s lakes and reservoirs than those in the western part of the country during the 2005 2010 period chla dynamics were more sensitive to tp relative to tn with average si values of 0 42 and 0 37 fig 7c and d whereas the corresponding si values during the 2011 2018 period were approximately equal to 0 18 and 0 15 respectively fig 7i j regarding the seven critical chinese lakes the si value for tn decreased significantly by a value of 1 47 between 2005 and 2010 1 84 and 2011 2018 0 37 in lake dianchi presumably indicating a weaker relationship between chla and tn levels by contrast si values for tn in chaohu from 0 12 to 0 73 and poyang from 0 05 to 0 37 increased on average by a value of 0 46 regarding the ambient tp levels si values in lakes taihu from 1 26 to 0 86 dianchi from 1 02 to 0 76 chaohu from 0 92 to 0 37 and erhai from 0 41 to 0 12 decreased on average by a value of 0 33 but increased by a factor of 0 29 in lake poyang in a similar context we generated frequency histograms to pinpoint the ranges of six environmental factors that could have been responsible for excessively high chla 30 μg l 1 levels in three lakes lakes taihu dianchi and chaohu with the most severe habs among china s lakes and reservoirs during the 2011 2018 fig 8 and 2005 2010 periods fig s6 for lake taihu high chla concentrations occurred when high ambient tp along with high sr and t conditions prevailed which suggests that severe habs were more likely to occur in the summer table s1 interestingly according to our sensitivity analysis the hab formation in lake taihu also occurred when lower tn nh3 n and n p ratios prevailed for lake chaohu high chla concentrations generally coincided with high tn and tp levels but low sr and t values which likely suggests higher hab risks during the spring and autumn table s1 the latter finding is consistent with previous reports indicating that distinct habs frequently occur in lake chaohu between october to december even though temperature and solar radiation lie in low and presumably limiting levels duan et al 2017 high chla levels were insensitive to all the examined environmental variables sr t tn tp n p and nh3 n in lake dianchi this result probably reflects the prevalence of high chla throughout the annual cycle regardless of the seasonal variability of the environmental factors considered 4 discussion consistent with the trends recorded in other developing nations china has been experiencing severe water pollution problems that could be responsible for a shortage of up to 40 billion tons of useable water on an annual basis tao and xin 2014 in particular the reported incidences of habs have risen considerably over the past two decades and while it is generally understood that nutrient loading is the primary regulatory factor the degree to which the severity of bloom conditions is modulated by other interacting stressors is still uncertain ho et al 2019 sinha et al 2019 our analysis suggests that china s lakes and reservoirs are still severely threatened by habs with a magnitude as high as 775 4 km2 while more than 35 of this estimate represents the collective contribution of lakes other than the eutrophic lakes taihu dianchi and chaohu of equal importance is that the temporal trend registered with respect to the hab areal extent reinforces the finding of our recent work of a declining trajectory during the first decade of the 2000s followed by the establishment of an equilibrium state or even a slight deterioration thereafter huang et al 2019 while the fundamental assumption of our analysis is that chlorophyll a concentrations is not only an indicator of phytoplankton standing biomass but also a proxy of hab incidences in freshwater systems it is important to recognize that it includes all toxic and non toxic cyanobacteria and other algal taxa notwithstanding this assumption empirical evidence suggests that chla tends to be positively correlated with algal toxin levels rinta kanto et al 2009 and could be a significant predictor of microcystin violations harris and graham 2017 otten et al 2012 taranu et al 2017 likewise several attempts to identify chla thresholds that may be associated with a higher likelihood of exceedance of selected health advisory toxin levels render support to our approach although the identified critical values can display considerable site specificity hollister and kreakie 2016 kelly et al 2019 yuan et al 2014 understanding of the mechanisms that underlie hab formation is an essential step for designing effective remediation strategies that can alleviate their extent and severity in the foreseeable future whereas past studies synthesizing information on the large scale trends in phytoplankton blooms of china s lakes and reservoirs have been limited by data availability the year round monthly sampling program conducted by the chinese national environmental monitoring centre has gradually produced a comprehensive dataset to gain insights into the abiotic variables that display a statistically significant covariance with the prevalence of habs the role of cultural eutrophication in favouring hab proliferation in lakes and reservoirs is well established and therefore tp reduction is widely used as the primary strategy to mitigate hab severity heisler et al 2008 pick 2016 interestingly our study found that tp concentrations have generally declined in all the major lakes in china fig 9 a and in fact three of these lakes lakes taihu dianchi and chaohu appear to be less sensitive to tp from 2005 to 2010 to 2011 2018 fig 9b while this result presumably suggests that the relationship between chla and tp has weakened in the latter period we believe that it should be interpreted with caution for two basic reasons i although tp concentrations have decreased in most studied system they still remain at fairly high levels 50 140 μg l 1 and thus the ambient conditions are far from being prohibitive for hab formation ii there were instances lakes dianchi and hongze where the tp decline was actually accompanied by an increase in the chla concentrations likely implying that other abiotic factors may also drive the registered trends in china s lakes and reservoirs the availability of various forms of n could also be responsible for hab formation and production of n rich toxins gobler et al 2016 elevated n levels have been associated with higher cellular quotas of microcystin in the non diazotrophs microcystis and planktothrix and thus n enrichment may increase algal toxin production donald et al 2011 for example taranu et al 2017 found that tn concentrations 650 μg l 1 were associated with higher likelihood of exceedance of the world health organization who drinking water standards for microcystin 1 5 2 0 μg l 1 similarly when paired with low tn concentrations 570 μg l 1 yuan et al 2014 found a 10 probability of exceedance of the drinking water standards for microcystin when chla concentrations were 37 μg l 1 and the same probability level held true with a much lower chla threshold 3 μg l 1 and elevated tn concentrations 1100 μg l 1 see their fig 3 our analysis suggests that the median tn levels in all the major chinese lakes are still high 800 μg l 1 and thus distinct water quality improvements will not be realized unless additional remedial efforts are implemented xu et al 2010 characteristic examples are lakes taihu and chaohu where habs are still widely experienced in recent years even though the median values of both nutrients and chla decreased from 2005 to 2010 to 2011 2018 duan et al 2017 qin et al 2019 several studies have attempted to elucidate the seasonal nutrient limitation patterns in lake taihu and found that n can play a key role as a growth limiting factor for the proliferation and maintenance of toxic microcystis spp blooms in the summer specifically p limitation can be more prevalent during the initiation of the spring bloom n and p co limitation typically occurs in early summer followed by a stronger n limitation later in summer and fall paerl et al 2011 2015 xu et al 2010 by contrast lakes poyang and dongting have relatively high nutrient levels compared with other eutrophic lakes e g lake taihu but hab severity is not particularly troublesome fig 5 likely due to their large hydraulic loading causing short retention time 20 days while nutrient over enrichment stemming from the processes of cultural eutrophication promotes habs climate change provides an additional catalyst for their increased frequency and spatial proliferation owing to their ability to adapt to hot conditions and capacity to achieve maximum growth rates at relatively high temperatures toxic cyanobacterial blooms have apparent causal linkages with increasing water temperature jacoby et al 2000 wood et al 2017 for example the cyanobacterium microcystis has been found to out compete other phytoplankton species at or above 25 c paerl and paul 2012 while the number of genes or transcripts associated with microcystin production increase with water temperature davis et al 2009 thus there is growing concern that increases in temperature due to global climate change will increase the frequency and magnitude of habs and promote the growth of toxic strains of cyanobacteria kosten et al 2012 paerl and otten 2013 our analysis indeed showed that global warming could negate the anticipated benefits from tp mitigation strategies especially when our grnn models were tested against the scenario of high greenhouse gas concentration levels ssp5 8 5 interestingly lake taihu is projected to be particularly sensitive to the warming trends in that hab magnitudes are expected to increase even under the scenarios of low and medium greenhouse gas concentration levels ssp1 2 6 and ssp2 4 5 the latter prediction is on par with the total phytoplankton biomass increase registered in lake taihu between 2015 and 2017 which was primarily attributed to the improved light availability and rising air temperatures guo et al 2019 increasing air and in turn lake surface temperature typically strengthen the vertical stratification as a result of the density difference between the warm surface layer and the cold water beneath arhonditsis et al 2004 woolway and merchant 2019 this pattern could be further reinforced by a reduced wind speed over lakes which in turn reduces the degree of vertical mixing and consequently the amount of heat that is being transferred from the surface to greater depths magee and wu 2017 woolway et al 2017 the latter mechanism is likely to have had an increasing impact on the thermal lake dynamics across the world owing to the decrease of near surface 10 m terrestrial wind speed observed in recent decades also known as atmospheric stilling mcvicar et al 2012 roderick et al 2007 the same pattern holds true for the majority of the designated critical lakes in china fig s7 especially in lake taihu where the wind speed declined continuously after 2000 0 9 m s 1 with broader consequences for the interplay between chemical and biological variables guo et al 2019 prolonged conditions of increased water column stability can favor the dominance of bloom forming cyanobacteria due to their ability to regulate their buoyancy and consequently their vertical position in the water column whereby they can capitalize upon optimal nutrient light micro environments and gain a competitive advantage over other eukaryotic phytoplankton watson et al 2016 thus in light of the potentially large decrease in wind mixing energy as a result of atmospheric stilling the relative importance of the causal linkage between wind speed and frequency of hab events warrants further investigation in order to shed light on the broader implications of climate change for the water quality in china s lakes and reservoirs deng et al 2018 several recent studies have signified the regulatory role of precipitation wet versus dry years on hab magnitudes paerl et al 2016a 2019 in this study we found a weak relationship between annual precipitation and the corresponding hab magnitude estimates in china s seven critical lakes during the 2005 2018 period fig s8 notwithstanding the lack of strong evidence here it is a plausible hypothesis to examine whether excessively wet years and heavy rainfall events can shape hab dynamics specifically the effects of episodic events have been a recurring theme in aquatic research in lakes abrupt changes in physical chemical and or biological parameters that are distinct from background levels are often driven by sudden changes in weather and in particular precipitation extremes the increasing frequency of such events is also viewed under the prism of a lurking threat for the system resilience that can induce catastrophic shifts to undesirable states shimoda et al 2011 this ominous prospect depends on the direction of climate change at a given location as well as on the lake and catchment characteristics but a popular notion in lake management also suggests that maintaining the resilience of desired states requires a focus on factors that can be controlled e g nutrient loading and appear to be particularly influential on ecosystem stability one plausible hypothesis is that these abrupt abiotic changes associated with extreme precipitation events can trigger changes in biotic ecosystem components e g primary productivity composition of plankton assemblages but the magnitude and duration of these shifts is predominantly modulated by the lake trophic status as well as fundamental system attributes e g fetch depth water levels wind regimes shimoda and arhonditsis 2016 while all these are important issues to consider they do not fall within the scope of the present study our national assessment results suggest that china s efforts in controlling point source pollution were successful in alleviating habs during the 2005 2013 period especially in lakes taihu and chaohu during the same period more than 2000 wastewater treatment plants were built in china and reduced considerably the nutrient loading into lakes and reservoirs huang et al 2019 however our analysis also showed that these efforts have not been sufficient to further reduce hab frequency and spatial extent during the 2013 2018 period we contend this is probably due to nutrient loading from non point sources e g fertilization and aquaculture which has not been adequately controlled han et al 2016 hou et al 2018 wu and chen 2013 despite the fact that farming in china has achieved yields close to the highest attainable for most crops mueller et al 2012 a recent characterization of p pathways across china underscored the severity of p fertilizer over application for crop production with an average input intensity of 80 kg p ha more than twice the amount that crops can generally assimilate liu et al 2016 the excessive p accumulation in soils can be subjected to a suite of hydrological and transformation mechanisms that can modulate the delivery rate of dissolved reactive phosphorus loading downstream we thus believe that the capping of fertilizer application along with the design of best management practices to control the transport of legacy p represent one of the imperatives of the on going eutrophication mitigation efforts in china huang et al 2018 zhu et al 2018 of equal importance is the presence of an active feedback loop internal loading in many lakes and reservoirs reflecting their rich content in nutrients and the intense replenishment of the overlying waters due to active sediment diagenesis processes janssen et al 2017 wu et al 2017 our analysis also signified the role of n in determining hab magnitudes and risks in several lakes and reservoirs this finding could be evidence that the p only paradigm may not be the most effective strategy for hab control paerl et al 2016b and thus opting for a dual nitrogen and phosphorus reduction could maximize the benefits from restoration efforts as shown for wuli lake chen et al 2013 generally our ml modelling exercise highlighted the substantial spatial variability in the relative importance of the drivers of water quality conditions while this result on its own may not be surprising zhang et al 2019 it does suggest that hab drivers and their threshold values may be significantly different among these lakes and reservoirs in this regard the present mapping of hab risks and associated sensitivities could help managers to identify hot spots and critical regulatory factors and in so doing it may shape the national policy making process to determine restoration measures in lakes and reservoirs peak chla values are a particular concern in limnology due to their close link to habs the water quality data set from the monitoring program operated by the chinese national environmental monitoring centre comprised individual water quality snapshots obtained from monthly samplings which collectively depict the diurnal seasonal and year to year variability of the studied systems our machine learning technique has been used to study these dynamics by linking temporally varying features i e phytoplankton variability with contemporaneous water quality and meteorological covariates relative to mechanistic or semi empirical modelling approaches our grnn models with one hidden layer were able to filter out noise and effectively reconstruct the chla time series which can then be used to evaluate the frequency of peaks if certain selected predictors display desirable or undesirable non stationary patterns e g lower ambient nutrient levels climate warming notwithstanding the success of our ml exercise there are several caveats that should be recognized before we can advocate the wider adoption of the existing models for extrapolative tasks such as sampling or other data biases ignorance of confounding factors and interpretation of statistical associations as causal relationships reichstein et al 2019 for example the counterintuitively negative signs of regression parameters representing the relationship between nutrients and phytoplankton e g tn and chla in lake taihu do not mean that low nutrient concentrations cause high phytoplankton biomass but rather that the elevated uptake can be responsible for low ambient nutrient levels or that phytoplankton cannot capitalize upon the high nutrient availability due to other physical limitations within a given period of the year paerl et al 2015 xu et al 2010 the same reasoning holds true for the registered negative relationships between temperature or solar radiation and chla concentrations in lake chaohu which simply reflect that the usual timing of habs in that system may not follow the conventional distinction between growing and non growing season to overcome this potential pitfall of our grnn models we believe that expert knowledge should be an integral component of the ml modelling practice to elucidate the nature of the derived cause effect relationships regarding the model performance the vast majority of the developed grnn models achieved a nearly perfect and acceptable fit during the training and testing periods respectively importantly our models for the seven critical lakes displayed an acceptable performance because these systems are fairly intensively studied sample size 1000 we can infer that the acquired information was adequate to train the corresponding models and achieve satisfactory performance in the validation domain by contrast we had cases of lakes where the datasets used for the data training were limited 50 100 and thus the available knowledge was not sufficient to tease out robust patterns and properly characterize the relationships between chla and environmental meteorological factors consequently these models were prone to over parameterization i e high model fit during the training period followed by an unacceptable performance during the validation period this problem will be overcome in the near future by selectively increasing the sampling intensity in such systems including the consideration of high frequency 4 hr increments data from more than 100 automatic monitoring stations currently operated across china another pointer for future improvement is the accommodation of the large spatial heterogeneity within individual lakes our study developed one grnn models for each lake postulating that phytoplankton dynamics respond to environmental meteorological forcing in an identical manner across the entire system however there is abundant empirical evidence that this assumption may not hold true in many large lakes and should be revisited such as the lake taihu where the phytoplankton dominated northern area coexists with the macrophyte dominated southeastern area guo et al 2019 5 conclusions a national investigation of hab magnitudes and associated drivers in china s lakes and reservoirs was conducted using ml modelling and two 14 year 2005 2018 national data sets our analysis suggests that the hab areal extent in china s lakes and reservoirs displayed a declining trajectory during the first decade of the 2000s followed by the establishment of an equilibrium state or even a slight deterioration ever since nonetheless the prevailing water quality conditions have not reached acceptable conditions and the majority of the studied systems are still severely threatened by habs with a total magnitude as high as 775 4 km2 more than 60 of this areal estimate represents the collective contribution of lakes taihu dianchi and chaohu where the on going restoration efforts should be further intensified our analysis provides evidence the effective mitigation of habs may require dual nitrogen and phosphorus reduction and longer recovery times especially in view of the current climate change scenarios the present study demonstrated that ml represents a robust approach to elucidate water quality patterns in intensively monitored system i e sample sizes are sufficient to train the ml algorithms and characterize magnitudes and drivers at a large scale thereby improving our fundamental understanding of hab dynamics the resulting mapping of hab magnitudes and associated environmental meteorological predictors can help managers to delineate hot spots at a national level determine lakes that need to be more intensively monitored and comprehensively design the best management

17848,harmful algal blooms habs can have dire repercussions on aquatic wildlife and human health and may negatively affect recreational uses aesthetics taste and odor in drinking water the factors that influence the occurrence and magnitude of harmful algal blooms and toxin production remain poorly understood and can vary in space and time it is within this context that we use machine learning ml and two 14 year 2005 2018 data sets on water quality and meteorological conditions of china s lakes and reservoirs to shed light on the magnitude and associated drivers of hab events general regression neural network grnn models are developed to predict chlorophyll a concentrations for each lake and reservoir during two study periods 2005 2010 and 2011 2018 the developed models with an acceptable model fit are then analyzed by two indices to determine the areal hab magnitudes and associated drivers our national assessment suggests that hab magnitudes for china s lakes and reservoirs displayed a decreasing trend from 2006 1363 3 km2 to 2013 665 2 km2 and a slightly increasing trend from 2013 to 2018 775 4 km2 among the 142 studied lakes and reservoirs most severe habs were found in lakes taihu dianchi and chaohu with their contribution to the total hab magnitude varying from 89 2 2013 to 62 6 2018 habs in lakes taihu and chaohu were strongly associated with both total phosphorus and nitrogen concentrations while our results were inconclusive with respect to the predominant environmental factors shaping the eutrophication phenomena in lake dianchi the present study provides evidence that effective hab mitigation may require both nitrogen and phosphorus reductions and longer recovery times especially in view of the current climate change projections ml represents a robust strategy to elucidate water quality patterns in lakes where the available information is sufficient to train the constructed algorithms our mapping of hab magnitudes and associated environmental meteorological drivers can help managers to delineate hot spots at a national scale and comprehensively design the best management practices for mitigating the eutrophication severity in china s lakes and reservoirs keywords general regression neural network chlorophyll a risk analysis harmful algal blooms eutrophication 1 introduction harmful algal blooms habs have been showing a rising trend in freshwater ecosystems worldwide and represent one of the most challenging environmental problems huisman et al 2018 often manifested as dense surface scums habs may have significant environmental and socioeconomic implications particularly due to the production of cyanotoxins which can adversely impact the health of those utilizing surface waters for drinking water and recreational activities carmichael and boyer 2016 watson et al 2016 in a survey of 2058 water bodies worldwide in 2012 63 1 of the total number and 30 5 of the total surface area were found to be eutrophic and were mainly concentrated in central africa eastern asia mid northern and southeast north america wang et al 2018 the magnitude frequency and duration of habs appear to be increasing at a global scale especially in inland waters brooks et al 2016 ho et al 2019 severe habs have been reported in many large lakes around the globe such as lake erie in the laurentian great lakes watson et al 2016 lake winnipeg in canada ulrich et al 2016 lake taihu qin et al 2019 chaohu huang et al 2018 and dianchi wu et al 2017 in china see table s1 in supporting information remedial measures in order to mitigate hab severity typically include the reduction of external nutrient loading increasing hydraulic loading to induce faster flushing rates and chemical or biological treatment strategies huisman et al 2018 nonetheless hab incidences are likely to continue over the next decades and may be further accentuated by the advent of climate change chapra et al 2017 sinha et al 2017 like other rapidly industrializing nations china has been severely threatened by lake eutrophication and frequent hab events during the past decade in 2017 16 3 of the polluted water in china s freshwater lakes and reservoirs was attributed to eutrophication huang et al 2019 while another recent nationwide assessment revealed that 29 of the total 107 surveyed lakes experienced eutrophication problems ministry of ecology and environment 2019 indicative of the growing interest worldwide is the increasing number of case studies that have been conducted to quantify hab magnitudes to identify the suite of the underlying causal factors and to investigate the potential control strategies qin et al 2019 according to our recent search in the elsevier database 23 april 2020 the number of publications with the term algal bloom in the title or abstract increased from 34 in 2000 to 361 in 2019 notwithstanding all the active research the causal relationships and mechanisms leading to hab events have not been adequately investigated harris and graham 2017 scholz et al 2017 given that the dynamic response of phytoplankton to changes in environmental conditions results in blooms that are highly variable in space and time hab events typically co vary with a multitude of ambient conditions alone or in combination such as elevated chlorophyll a and nutrient concentrations warmer water temperature reduced wind speed increased water column stability and reduced grazing pressure among others burford et al 2020 conley et al 2009 francy et al 2016 paerl et al 2016a 2019 shimoda and arhonditsis 2016 wood et al 2017 wurtsbaugh et al 2019 likewise the total nitrogen to total phosphorus n p ratio and precipitation patterns have been identified as regulatory factors jacoby et al 2015 orihel et al 2012 paerl et al 2016a scott et al 2013 and so has the relative abundance of different nitrogen n species that may also modulate the toxicity of hab events kelly et al 2019 monchamp et al 2014 scott et al 2014 in many instances the design of lake specific management strategies without the consideration of water quality in other neighbouring lakes has been proven to be flawed because many lakes and reservoirs within a given region in china are connected to each other via a complex river network shi et al 2020 wang et al 2019 for example there are more than 10 000 reservoirs in the upstream areas of lake poyang and therefore water quality in those lakes reservoirs can profoundly influence the ambient conditions of china s largest freshwater lake dong et al 2019 thus the design of effective regional management strategies may require the characterization of inter system differences at a larger spatial scale several studies attempted to investigate eutrophication patterns across lakes huang et al 2019 wang et al 2018 but hab magnitudes and drivers at a larger spatial e g national or global scale have been scarcely investigated probably due to the lack of adequate datasets or flexible eutrophication modelling tools with general applicability janssen et al 2019 such investigation is urgently needed in water management practice due to its potential usefulness in supporting best management practices for hab mitigation to this end both data driven and process based models have offered useful tools to investigate hab magnitudes and influential drivers shimoda and arhonditsis 2016 vinçon leite and casenave 2019 arhonditsis et al 2019a b process based models are founded upon our best mechanistic understanding of the ecosystem functioning that ultimately shapes hab dynamics frassl et al 2019 janssen et al 2017 while they can be presumably used for extrapolative tasks they do require extensive input data e g external or internal forcing functions which may not be available for most lakes at the other end of the complexity spectrum data driven models aim to establish simple empirical relationships between habs and underlying causal factors that can be used to draw predictions within the domain of the data used vinçon leite and casenave 2019 among the data driven strategies machine learning ml represents a promising way to elucidate the complex non linear processes typically associated with habs jordan and mitchell 2015 reichstein et al 2019 in this regard the aim of the present study is to quantify trends in hab magnitudes and identify drivers for china s lakes and reservoirs at a national scale for this purpose we used two comprehensive 14 year 2005 2018 datasets comprising monthly water quality data from 142 lakes and reservoirs and daily meteorological records from 699 stations we established the relationship between habs and environmental factors for each lake or reservoir using a novel ml technique of general regression neural network grnn modelling we also developed two new indices that are used to characterize the spatial trends of hab magnitudes and critical regulatory factors our study is a novel attempt to create a synoptic map of hab patterns for china s lakes and reservoirs and to pinpoint hot spots that require special attention when designing restoration strategies at a national scale 2 material and methods 2 1 study area and datasets in china there are 2693 lakes with a surface area larger than 1 km2 and 89 700 reservoirs covering 26 870 km2 ma et al 2011 yang and lu 2014 for our modelling exercise we compiled the following two national datasets i water quality dataset to capture water quality trends in china s lakes a year round monthly sampling program was conducted in 142 lakes and reservoirs by the chinese national environmental monitoring centre http www cnemc cn resulting in a large dataset covering a 14 year 2005 2018 period fig 1 this dataset includes chlorophyll a chla μg l 1 along with 24 water quality variables listed as china s environmental quality standards for surface waters no gb 3838 2002 such as total nitrogen tn mg l 1 total phosphorus tp mg l 1 ammonia nitrogen nh3 n mg l 1 and eight heavy metals copper zinc selenium arsenic mercury cadmium chromium and lead ii meteorological dataset to account for the prevailing meteorological conditions in china s lakes and reservoirs we used daily records from 699 national weather stations across china since 1951 http data cma cn locations of the national weather stations are given in fig s1 with nine variables considered including pressure pa air temperature oc relative humidity precipitation mm evaporation mm daily sunshine hours h ground temperature oc wind speed m s 1 and direction o meteorological conditions for each lake were represented by the station with a minimum distance to its centre based on the two national data sets 58 lakes and reservoirs with a total of 21 325 sampling records were selected having more than 50 records over the course of the study period fig 1 among the studied lakes and reservoirs five large lakes lakes poyang dongting taihu hongze and chaohu and lakes dianchi and erhai have been identified as china s critical lakes by the government see guidelines on strengthening water environmental protection for critical lakes released in 2008 these seven critical lakes covering a total surface area of 11 338 km2 were intensively monitored with more than 1000 sampling records for each lake and a total of 12 089 sampling records during the 2005 2018 period chla was the water quality variable that was used as a surrogate to represent habs while the potential predictors comprised temperature t daily sunshine hours sr tn tp nh3 n and n p ratios scatter plots for the three ambient nutrient tn tp and nh3 n concentrations revealed that there is no collinearity problem fig s2 2 2 modelling framework our modelling framework comprised four steps whereby we predicted occurrences evaluated risks quantified magnitudes and identified drivers of habs in china s lakes and reservoirs fig 2 grnn modelling was used to characterize the complex relationships between chla and the surrounding environmental conditions the models with an acceptable model fit were subsequently used to determine hab magnitudes with a quantitative index and identify the critical drivers for each lake through sensitivity analysis based on non linear regression theory grnn is an one pass supervised learning algorithm consisting of a four layer feed forward neural network namely the input pattern summation and output layers specht 1991 the number of neurons in the input and output layer corresponds to the number of input and output variables and the number of neuron patterns is equal to the number of data patterns antanasijević et al 2014 grnn was selected because it has been demonstrated to provide robust water quality predictions antanasijević et al 2014 csábrági et al 2017 the development of grnn models was implemented in the python library of neupy with a computational backend of google s deep learning framework tensorflow https www tensorflow org for the 58 selected lakes and reservoirs fig 1 two grnn models were developed to predict chla during the 2005 2010 and 2011 2018 periods respectively the separation of study periods is due to a regime shift of water quality in china lakes and reservoirs after 2010 huang et al 2019 based on the available data 19 and 57 grnn models were developed for the periods of 2005 2010 and 2011 2018 respectively all these grnn models included the input variables of t sr tn tp n p and nh3 n see fig s3 for a schematic representation for each lake 80 and 20 of their sampling records were used for model training and testing respectively 2 2 1 development of a hab risk index we used two surrogate variables to emulate the likelihood of prevalence of favourable conditions for hab formation namely chla and wind speed ws m s 1 the former variable represented the available phytoplankton biomass as the collective output of the eutrophication processes within a given system while the latter was used as a proxy for water column stability that in turn allows algal cells to be retained within the surface layer of the water column cao et al 2006 hu et al 2016 based on this mechanistic explanation we formulated a hab risk index r i h a b i calculated from each water sample i as follows r i h a b i max c h l a i c h l a h a b c h l a h a b 100 max 0 1 w s i 2 w s h a b 100 the equation includes two input variables of chl a i and w s i and two associated empirical parameters c h l a h a b and w s h a b that are used to assess the likelihood of hab formation thus according to our mathematical expression r i h a b is an index that provides non zero values only if chla concentrations are greater than a threshold level c h l a i c h l a h a b and wind speed is lower than a critical value w s i 2 w s h a b whereby the standing phytoplankton biomass and reduced vertical mixing gradually leads to hab manifestation although several c h l a h a b values have been reported in the literature the vast majority of the proposed chla concentrations suggest an approximate value of 10 μg l 1 as the cut off point to mark the gradual establishment of habs ho and michalak 2015 kelly et al 2019 wu and xu 2011 and was therefore selected as the empirical c h l a h a b threshold for our analysis likewise a critical value of 3 0 m s 1 has been proposed as the maximum wind speed that still allows surface accumulation of phytoplankton wu et al 2010 nonetheless existing evidence suggests that hab formation can still occur under windier conditions binding et al 2018 cao et al 2006 zhang et al 2012 and we thus included a multiplier 2 in the denominator of the second term of our r i h a b i index to ensure non zero values even when relatively high ws conditions prevail we also evaluated the sensitivity of r i h a b i to the values assigned to the two thresholds and found that the interplay between ws conditions and chla can be more influential on the r i h a b i values than each of the predictor variables alone fig s4 based on the proposed risk index r i h a b i the daily likelihood for hab events in each lake can be calculated from the predicted chl a i from the grnn models section 2 2 and wind speed 2 2 2 development of a hab magnitude index hab magnitude can be quantified by peak algal biomass hab area or duration in this study we evaluated hab magnitude based on the areal extent high hab risk daily conditions were identified as those with r i h a b i greater than 10 which in turn approximately corresponds to chla and ws values of 30 μg l 1 and 3 m s 1 respectively therefore high hab risk areas within a given lake can be quantified from the hab magnitude index m h a b km2 as follows duan et al 2017 m h a b i 1 365 j 1 n s i j 365 where s i j represents the area km2 with high hab risk r i h a b 10 that corresponds to the water sample j collected on the ith day the area of each lake was divided by the number of sampling stations n and the individual water samples j collected from the sampling stations within a given date are collectively used to estimate the total lake area with high hab risk thus m h a b represents the daily average area with high hab risk that may lead to harmful impacts over the course of a year a synoptic map of hab patterns can then be derived in arcgis software based on the calculated hab magnitude index values for each of the 58 selected lakes and reservoirs fig 1 overall our aim was to create a modelling tool that can depict the temporal evolution of the average spatial extent of habs over the course of our study period we used the series of water quality snapshots from the monitoring of each system to establish the optimal relationships between areal hab magnitude and frequently used limnological environmental predictor variables regardless of their causal or correlative nature these relationships are effectively capturing the linkages among common predictor variables which are then used to draw daily estimates of the hab magnitude in every single lake of our dataset in other words this modelling framework is designed to derive the big picture of hab severity at a national level in china 2 2 3 global warming phosphorus management and hab risks we evaluated the potential changes of hab magnitudes in china s lakes and reservoirs induced by the on going p abatement from non point sources under the prospect of a warmer climate to evaluate the potential benefits from reducing ambient tp we examined two scenarios i e 20 tp reduction and no change in the measured values future air temperatures across china were emulated based on the projections from the global climate model gcm of beijing climate centre climate system model version 2 bcc csm2 mr of the coupled model intercomparison project cmip6 wu et al 2019 three shared socioeconomic pathways ssps i e ssp1 2 6 ssp2 4 5 and ssp5 8 5 were selected to represent scenarios of future global emissions and land use changes o neill et al 2016 ssp5 8 5 represents continuously increasing greenhouse gas emissions with a radiative forcing level of 8 5 w m2 in the year 2100 in ssp1 2 6 global annual greenhouse gas emissions peak between 2010 and 2020 with emissions declining substantially thereafter and the radiative forcing set at the level of 2 6 w m2 emissions with ssp2 4 5 peak around 2040 and then decline with a radiation level of 4 5 w m2 these future air temperature data used in this study were downloaded from https pcmdi llnl gov cmip6 2 2 4 identifying the relative importance of hab drivers critical hab drivers for each lake were identified through sensitivity analysis of the corresponding validated grnn models each driver was increased decreased by 5 while all other predictors were kept fixed the one at a time method was used to quantify the influence of each input variable on the magnitude of habs norton 2015 s i x i 1 n f i v 1 v x δ v m f i v 1 v x v m 2 n f i v 1 v x v m δ v x f i v 1 v x δ v m f i v 1 v x v m 2 n f i v 1 v x v m δ v x where s i x is the sensitivity index of the testing predictor x f i v 1 v x v m is the predicted chla of sample i 1 2 n from the base model application in each lake f i v 1 v x δ v m and f i v 1 v x δ v m are the predicted chla of sample i after increasing decreasing the value of the causal driver x v x by δ 0 1 v x respectively a larger s i x implies that habs are more sensitive to the driver x on the top of the s i x index calculation we conducted monte carlo mc simulations of the validated grnn models to capture the nature of the relationship between chla and the individual predictors for each testing driver input water quality variable 1000 simulations were carried out with its values uniformly sampled from the lake specific ranges 3 results 3 1 grnn model performance during the training phase all 19 and 57 grnn models for the periods of 2005 2010 and 2011 2018 see section 2 2 achieved an excellent fit against the measured data p 0 001 with an average r 2 value higher than 0 95 fig 3 a and c on the other hand among the 19 developed grnn models for 2005 2010 only 16 models achieved a satisfactory fit p 0 05 during the testing or validation period with an average r 2 value of 0 46 fig 3b three models failed to predict chla dynamics in lakes bosten qiandao and kunming displaying an unacceptable model fit p 0 1 likewise among the 57 developed grnn models for 2011 2018 45 achieved acceptable model fit p 0 1 with an average r 2 value of 0 45 fig 3d importantly a satisfactory model fit was achieved between predicted and measured chla concentrations for the seven critical lakes with large data sets 1000 sampling records p 0 05 fig s5 the list of lake models as well as their input data information and model performance are provided in table s2 3 2 hab magnitudes in china s lakes and reservoirs the year to year variability of hab magnitudes fig 4 in china s lakes and reservoirs has been predominantly shaped by the contribution of three lakes lakes taihu dianchi and chaohu throughout the 2005 2018 period fig 4 according to our analysis hab magnitudes displayed a non monotonic pattern which was characterized by a peak value of 1363 3 km2 in 2006 decreased down to 671 5 km2 in 2013 and a slightly increasing trend thereafter it is also worth noting that the number of studied lakes and reservoirs has apparently a limited impact on this result as the higher number of samples in 2012 and 2016 did not lead to an increase of our hab magnitude estimates fig 4 lakes taihu dianchi and chaohu collectively contribute a significant fraction of the overall hab magnitude which in turn decreased from 89 2 2013 to 62 6 2018 in 2018 china s lakes and reservoirs were still severely threatened by habs with a magnitude as high as 775 4 km2 and 37 4 of this estimate or 289 8 km2 occurred in lakes other than lakes taihu dianchi and chaohu our hab magnitude results are comparable with those reported from the national eutrophication assessment for china s lakes by the ministry of ecology and environment 2019 which highlighted the eutrophic state of lakes taihu dianchi and chaohu the derived hab magnitude temporal trend is on par with the water quality patterns presented by huang et al 2019 in that both are suggestive of a promising trajectory during the first decade of the 2000s followed by an establishment of steady state or even a slight deterioration thereafter consistent with the spatial distribution of china s population density the resulting map of hab magnitudes suggests that the majority of the most impacted lakes m h a b 10 km 2 were located in eastern china in 2018 fig 5 lakes dianchi and taihu had the highest hab magnitude estimates with m h a b values of 208 6 and 196 4 km2 which corresponded to 67 5 and 8 4 of their surface areas respectively moreover 9 lakes lakes chaohu luoma longgan songhua gaoyou liangzi poyang wabu baiyangdian were classified into a medium range with m h a b values varying from 10 to 100 km2 while 14 lakes displayed low hab magnitude with m h a b values 10 km2 to gain further insights into the hab dynamics of the seven critical lakes in china their inter annual variability in hab risks and magnitudes is provided in fig 5a g consistent the aforementioned national pattern lakes taihu and chaohu showed peak values in 2006 decreased significantly between 2006 and 2013 and appear to have reached an equilibrium with values of 200 and 70 km2 between 2014 and 2018 fig 5c and e the temporal pattern projected for lake chaohu is consistent with the findings from satellite images reported by duan et al 2017 reinforcing the notion that the occurrence of severe habs in 2008 was succeeded by the establishment of a steady state in terms of the prevailing water quality conditions by contrast our estimated hab magnitude for lake taihu in 2017 323 7 km2 was lower compared with the satellite based value of 460 0 km2 by qin et al 2019 which is not surprising given that satellite images tend to overestimate the actual hab magnitudes during low wind speed conditions huang et al 2012 interestingly nearly 25 of the daily predicted hab risk r i h a b values for lakes taihu and chaohu were 10 in 2018 fig 5c and e habs in lake dianchi were extremely severe with a magnitude as high as 250 km2 throughout the 2005 2017 period while close to 95 of the derived r i h a b values were 10 fig 5f hab magnitude estimates displayed a decreasing trend in lake erhai fig 5g but were characterized by an increasing trend in lakes poyang and hongze with relatively high r i h a b values in 2018 fig 5a and d except from the predicted high hab risks and magnitudes in 2007 2010 lake dongting showed the most satisfactory water quality conditions among the seven intensively studied chinese lakes fig 5b 3 3 global warming tp mitigation scenarios and hab magnitudes the projected hab magnitudes in 20 50 and 80 years suggest that global warming will likely negate any potential benefits from the tp mitigation strategies in the surrounding watershed fig 6 without any tp reduction strategies in place the scenario of high greenhouse gas concentration levels ssp5 8 5 is suggestive of a 12 3 increase of the hab magnitude index from 775 4 2018 to 870 9 2098 km2 fig 6c even though global warming is predicted to be the predominant factor reducing tp concentration by 20 can partly alleviate the increase of hab magnitudes especially in lake dianchi fig 6c forced with the scenarios of low and medium greenhouse gas concentration levels ssp1 2 6 and ssp2 4 5 the projected hab magnitudes in china s lakes and reservoirs appear to be relatively stable without a discernible increasing pattern except from lakes taihu and dianchi fig 6a and b 3 4 identification of hab drivers in china s lakes and reservoirs the spatial patterns of the sensitivity index si values for six environmental factors t sr tn tp n p and nh3 n were drawn to delineate their influence on chla concentrations during the two study periods 2005 2010 and 2011 2018 fig 7 an interesting result from our analysis was that the predicted chla concentrations were more sensitive to t and sr in eastern china s lakes and reservoirs than those in the western part of the country during the 2005 2010 period chla dynamics were more sensitive to tp relative to tn with average si values of 0 42 and 0 37 fig 7c and d whereas the corresponding si values during the 2011 2018 period were approximately equal to 0 18 and 0 15 respectively fig 7i j regarding the seven critical chinese lakes the si value for tn decreased significantly by a value of 1 47 between 2005 and 2010 1 84 and 2011 2018 0 37 in lake dianchi presumably indicating a weaker relationship between chla and tn levels by contrast si values for tn in chaohu from 0 12 to 0 73 and poyang from 0 05 to 0 37 increased on average by a value of 0 46 regarding the ambient tp levels si values in lakes taihu from 1 26 to 0 86 dianchi from 1 02 to 0 76 chaohu from 0 92 to 0 37 and erhai from 0 41 to 0 12 decreased on average by a value of 0 33 but increased by a factor of 0 29 in lake poyang in a similar context we generated frequency histograms to pinpoint the ranges of six environmental factors that could have been responsible for excessively high chla 30 μg l 1 levels in three lakes lakes taihu dianchi and chaohu with the most severe habs among china s lakes and reservoirs during the 2011 2018 fig 8 and 2005 2010 periods fig s6 for lake taihu high chla concentrations occurred when high ambient tp along with high sr and t conditions prevailed which suggests that severe habs were more likely to occur in the summer table s1 interestingly according to our sensitivity analysis the hab formation in lake taihu also occurred when lower tn nh3 n and n p ratios prevailed for lake chaohu high chla concentrations generally coincided with high tn and tp levels but low sr and t values which likely suggests higher hab risks during the spring and autumn table s1 the latter finding is consistent with previous reports indicating that distinct habs frequently occur in lake chaohu between october to december even though temperature and solar radiation lie in low and presumably limiting levels duan et al 2017 high chla levels were insensitive to all the examined environmental variables sr t tn tp n p and nh3 n in lake dianchi this result probably reflects the prevalence of high chla throughout the annual cycle regardless of the seasonal variability of the environmental factors considered 4 discussion consistent with the trends recorded in other developing nations china has been experiencing severe water pollution problems that could be responsible for a shortage of up to 40 billion tons of useable water on an annual basis tao and xin 2014 in particular the reported incidences of habs have risen considerably over the past two decades and while it is generally understood that nutrient loading is the primary regulatory factor the degree to which the severity of bloom conditions is modulated by other interacting stressors is still uncertain ho et al 2019 sinha et al 2019 our analysis suggests that china s lakes and reservoirs are still severely threatened by habs with a magnitude as high as 775 4 km2 while more than 35 of this estimate represents the collective contribution of lakes other than the eutrophic lakes taihu dianchi and chaohu of equal importance is that the temporal trend registered with respect to the hab areal extent reinforces the finding of our recent work of a declining trajectory during the first decade of the 2000s followed by the establishment of an equilibrium state or even a slight deterioration thereafter huang et al 2019 while the fundamental assumption of our analysis is that chlorophyll a concentrations is not only an indicator of phytoplankton standing biomass but also a proxy of hab incidences in freshwater systems it is important to recognize that it includes all toxic and non toxic cyanobacteria and other algal taxa notwithstanding this assumption empirical evidence suggests that chla tends to be positively correlated with algal toxin levels rinta kanto et al 2009 and could be a significant predictor of microcystin violations harris and graham 2017 otten et al 2012 taranu et al 2017 likewise several attempts to identify chla thresholds that may be associated with a higher likelihood of exceedance of selected health advisory toxin levels render support to our approach although the identified critical values can display considerable site specificity hollister and kreakie 2016 kelly et al 2019 yuan et al 2014 understanding of the mechanisms that underlie hab formation is an essential step for designing effective remediation strategies that can alleviate their extent and severity in the foreseeable future whereas past studies synthesizing information on the large scale trends in phytoplankton blooms of china s lakes and reservoirs have been limited by data availability the year round monthly sampling program conducted by the chinese national environmental monitoring centre has gradually produced a comprehensive dataset to gain insights into the abiotic variables that display a statistically significant covariance with the prevalence of habs the role of cultural eutrophication in favouring hab proliferation in lakes and reservoirs is well established and therefore tp reduction is widely used as the primary strategy to mitigate hab severity heisler et al 2008 pick 2016 interestingly our study found that tp concentrations have generally declined in all the major lakes in china fig 9 a and in fact three of these lakes lakes taihu dianchi and chaohu appear to be less sensitive to tp from 2005 to 2010 to 2011 2018 fig 9b while this result presumably suggests that the relationship between chla and tp has weakened in the latter period we believe that it should be interpreted with caution for two basic reasons i although tp concentrations have decreased in most studied system they still remain at fairly high levels 50 140 μg l 1 and thus the ambient conditions are far from being prohibitive for hab formation ii there were instances lakes dianchi and hongze where the tp decline was actually accompanied by an increase in the chla concentrations likely implying that other abiotic factors may also drive the registered trends in china s lakes and reservoirs the availability of various forms of n could also be responsible for hab formation and production of n rich toxins gobler et al 2016 elevated n levels have been associated with higher cellular quotas of microcystin in the non diazotrophs microcystis and planktothrix and thus n enrichment may increase algal toxin production donald et al 2011 for example taranu et al 2017 found that tn concentrations 650 μg l 1 were associated with higher likelihood of exceedance of the world health organization who drinking water standards for microcystin 1 5 2 0 μg l 1 similarly when paired with low tn concentrations 570 μg l 1 yuan et al 2014 found a 10 probability of exceedance of the drinking water standards for microcystin when chla concentrations were 37 μg l 1 and the same probability level held true with a much lower chla threshold 3 μg l 1 and elevated tn concentrations 1100 μg l 1 see their fig 3 our analysis suggests that the median tn levels in all the major chinese lakes are still high 800 μg l 1 and thus distinct water quality improvements will not be realized unless additional remedial efforts are implemented xu et al 2010 characteristic examples are lakes taihu and chaohu where habs are still widely experienced in recent years even though the median values of both nutrients and chla decreased from 2005 to 2010 to 2011 2018 duan et al 2017 qin et al 2019 several studies have attempted to elucidate the seasonal nutrient limitation patterns in lake taihu and found that n can play a key role as a growth limiting factor for the proliferation and maintenance of toxic microcystis spp blooms in the summer specifically p limitation can be more prevalent during the initiation of the spring bloom n and p co limitation typically occurs in early summer followed by a stronger n limitation later in summer and fall paerl et al 2011 2015 xu et al 2010 by contrast lakes poyang and dongting have relatively high nutrient levels compared with other eutrophic lakes e g lake taihu but hab severity is not particularly troublesome fig 5 likely due to their large hydraulic loading causing short retention time 20 days while nutrient over enrichment stemming from the processes of cultural eutrophication promotes habs climate change provides an additional catalyst for their increased frequency and spatial proliferation owing to their ability to adapt to hot conditions and capacity to achieve maximum growth rates at relatively high temperatures toxic cyanobacterial blooms have apparent causal linkages with increasing water temperature jacoby et al 2000 wood et al 2017 for example the cyanobacterium microcystis has been found to out compete other phytoplankton species at or above 25 c paerl and paul 2012 while the number of genes or transcripts associated with microcystin production increase with water temperature davis et al 2009 thus there is growing concern that increases in temperature due to global climate change will increase the frequency and magnitude of habs and promote the growth of toxic strains of cyanobacteria kosten et al 2012 paerl and otten 2013 our analysis indeed showed that global warming could negate the anticipated benefits from tp mitigation strategies especially when our grnn models were tested against the scenario of high greenhouse gas concentration levels ssp5 8 5 interestingly lake taihu is projected to be particularly sensitive to the warming trends in that hab magnitudes are expected to increase even under the scenarios of low and medium greenhouse gas concentration levels ssp1 2 6 and ssp2 4 5 the latter prediction is on par with the total phytoplankton biomass increase registered in lake taihu between 2015 and 2017 which was primarily attributed to the improved light availability and rising air temperatures guo et al 2019 increasing air and in turn lake surface temperature typically strengthen the vertical stratification as a result of the density difference between the warm surface layer and the cold water beneath arhonditsis et al 2004 woolway and merchant 2019 this pattern could be further reinforced by a reduced wind speed over lakes which in turn reduces the degree of vertical mixing and consequently the amount of heat that is being transferred from the surface to greater depths magee and wu 2017 woolway et al 2017 the latter mechanism is likely to have had an increasing impact on the thermal lake dynamics across the world owing to the decrease of near surface 10 m terrestrial wind speed observed in recent decades also known as atmospheric stilling mcvicar et al 2012 roderick et al 2007 the same pattern holds true for the majority of the designated critical lakes in china fig s7 especially in lake taihu where the wind speed declined continuously after 2000 0 9 m s 1 with broader consequences for the interplay between chemical and biological variables guo et al 2019 prolonged conditions of increased water column stability can favor the dominance of bloom forming cyanobacteria due to their ability to regulate their buoyancy and consequently their vertical position in the water column whereby they can capitalize upon optimal nutrient light micro environments and gain a competitive advantage over other eukaryotic phytoplankton watson et al 2016 thus in light of the potentially large decrease in wind mixing energy as a result of atmospheric stilling the relative importance of the causal linkage between wind speed and frequency of hab events warrants further investigation in order to shed light on the broader implications of climate change for the water quality in china s lakes and reservoirs deng et al 2018 several recent studies have signified the regulatory role of precipitation wet versus dry years on hab magnitudes paerl et al 2016a 2019 in this study we found a weak relationship between annual precipitation and the corresponding hab magnitude estimates in china s seven critical lakes during the 2005 2018 period fig s8 notwithstanding the lack of strong evidence here it is a plausible hypothesis to examine whether excessively wet years and heavy rainfall events can shape hab dynamics specifically the effects of episodic events have been a recurring theme in aquatic research in lakes abrupt changes in physical chemical and or biological parameters that are distinct from background levels are often driven by sudden changes in weather and in particular precipitation extremes the increasing frequency of such events is also viewed under the prism of a lurking threat for the system resilience that can induce catastrophic shifts to undesirable states shimoda et al 2011 this ominous prospect depends on the direction of climate change at a given location as well as on the lake and catchment characteristics but a popular notion in lake management also suggests that maintaining the resilience of desired states requires a focus on factors that can be controlled e g nutrient loading and appear to be particularly influential on ecosystem stability one plausible hypothesis is that these abrupt abiotic changes associated with extreme precipitation events can trigger changes in biotic ecosystem components e g primary productivity composition of plankton assemblages but the magnitude and duration of these shifts is predominantly modulated by the lake trophic status as well as fundamental system attributes e g fetch depth water levels wind regimes shimoda and arhonditsis 2016 while all these are important issues to consider they do not fall within the scope of the present study our national assessment results suggest that china s efforts in controlling point source pollution were successful in alleviating habs during the 2005 2013 period especially in lakes taihu and chaohu during the same period more than 2000 wastewater treatment plants were built in china and reduced considerably the nutrient loading into lakes and reservoirs huang et al 2019 however our analysis also showed that these efforts have not been sufficient to further reduce hab frequency and spatial extent during the 2013 2018 period we contend this is probably due to nutrient loading from non point sources e g fertilization and aquaculture which has not been adequately controlled han et al 2016 hou et al 2018 wu and chen 2013 despite the fact that farming in china has achieved yields close to the highest attainable for most crops mueller et al 2012 a recent characterization of p pathways across china underscored the severity of p fertilizer over application for crop production with an average input intensity of 80 kg p ha more than twice the amount that crops can generally assimilate liu et al 2016 the excessive p accumulation in soils can be subjected to a suite of hydrological and transformation mechanisms that can modulate the delivery rate of dissolved reactive phosphorus loading downstream we thus believe that the capping of fertilizer application along with the design of best management practices to control the transport of legacy p represent one of the imperatives of the on going eutrophication mitigation efforts in china huang et al 2018 zhu et al 2018 of equal importance is the presence of an active feedback loop internal loading in many lakes and reservoirs reflecting their rich content in nutrients and the intense replenishment of the overlying waters due to active sediment diagenesis processes janssen et al 2017 wu et al 2017 our analysis also signified the role of n in determining hab magnitudes and risks in several lakes and reservoirs this finding could be evidence that the p only paradigm may not be the most effective strategy for hab control paerl et al 2016b and thus opting for a dual nitrogen and phosphorus reduction could maximize the benefits from restoration efforts as shown for wuli lake chen et al 2013 generally our ml modelling exercise highlighted the substantial spatial variability in the relative importance of the drivers of water quality conditions while this result on its own may not be surprising zhang et al 2019 it does suggest that hab drivers and their threshold values may be significantly different among these lakes and reservoirs in this regard the present mapping of hab risks and associated sensitivities could help managers to identify hot spots and critical regulatory factors and in so doing it may shape the national policy making process to determine restoration measures in lakes and reservoirs peak chla values are a particular concern in limnology due to their close link to habs the water quality data set from the monitoring program operated by the chinese national environmental monitoring centre comprised individual water quality snapshots obtained from monthly samplings which collectively depict the diurnal seasonal and year to year variability of the studied systems our machine learning technique has been used to study these dynamics by linking temporally varying features i e phytoplankton variability with contemporaneous water quality and meteorological covariates relative to mechanistic or semi empirical modelling approaches our grnn models with one hidden layer were able to filter out noise and effectively reconstruct the chla time series which can then be used to evaluate the frequency of peaks if certain selected predictors display desirable or undesirable non stationary patterns e g lower ambient nutrient levels climate warming notwithstanding the success of our ml exercise there are several caveats that should be recognized before we can advocate the wider adoption of the existing models for extrapolative tasks such as sampling or other data biases ignorance of confounding factors and interpretation of statistical associations as causal relationships reichstein et al 2019 for example the counterintuitively negative signs of regression parameters representing the relationship between nutrients and phytoplankton e g tn and chla in lake taihu do not mean that low nutrient concentrations cause high phytoplankton biomass but rather that the elevated uptake can be responsible for low ambient nutrient levels or that phytoplankton cannot capitalize upon the high nutrient availability due to other physical limitations within a given period of the year paerl et al 2015 xu et al 2010 the same reasoning holds true for the registered negative relationships between temperature or solar radiation and chla concentrations in lake chaohu which simply reflect that the usual timing of habs in that system may not follow the conventional distinction between growing and non growing season to overcome this potential pitfall of our grnn models we believe that expert knowledge should be an integral component of the ml modelling practice to elucidate the nature of the derived cause effect relationships regarding the model performance the vast majority of the developed grnn models achieved a nearly perfect and acceptable fit during the training and testing periods respectively importantly our models for the seven critical lakes displayed an acceptable performance because these systems are fairly intensively studied sample size 1000 we can infer that the acquired information was adequate to train the corresponding models and achieve satisfactory performance in the validation domain by contrast we had cases of lakes where the datasets used for the data training were limited 50 100 and thus the available knowledge was not sufficient to tease out robust patterns and properly characterize the relationships between chla and environmental meteorological factors consequently these models were prone to over parameterization i e high model fit during the training period followed by an unacceptable performance during the validation period this problem will be overcome in the near future by selectively increasing the sampling intensity in such systems including the consideration of high frequency 4 hr increments data from more than 100 automatic monitoring stations currently operated across china another pointer for future improvement is the accommodation of the large spatial heterogeneity within individual lakes our study developed one grnn models for each lake postulating that phytoplankton dynamics respond to environmental meteorological forcing in an identical manner across the entire system however there is abundant empirical evidence that this assumption may not hold true in many large lakes and should be revisited such as the lake taihu where the phytoplankton dominated northern area coexists with the macrophyte dominated southeastern area guo et al 2019 5 conclusions a national investigation of hab magnitudes and associated drivers in china s lakes and reservoirs was conducted using ml modelling and two 14 year 2005 2018 national data sets our analysis suggests that the hab areal extent in china s lakes and reservoirs displayed a declining trajectory during the first decade of the 2000s followed by the establishment of an equilibrium state or even a slight deterioration ever since nonetheless the prevailing water quality conditions have not reached acceptable conditions and the majority of the studied systems are still severely threatened by habs with a total magnitude as high as 775 4 km2 more than 60 of this areal estimate represents the collective contribution of lakes taihu dianchi and chaohu where the on going restoration efforts should be further intensified our analysis provides evidence the effective mitigation of habs may require dual nitrogen and phosphorus reduction and longer recovery times especially in view of the current climate change scenarios the present study demonstrated that ml represents a robust approach to elucidate water quality patterns in intensively monitored system i e sample sizes are sufficient to train the ml algorithms and characterize magnitudes and drivers at a large scale thereby improving our fundamental understanding of hab dynamics the resulting mapping of hab magnitudes and associated environmental meteorological predictors can help managers to delineate hot spots at a national level determine lakes that need to be more intensively monitored and comprehensively design the best management

17849,to clarify the effect of the hydrophobic hydrophilic polarity of extracellular polymeric substances eps on sludge filterability improvement during s2o8 2 fe2 oxidation waste activated sludge was glucose fed hydrophilic sludge hpi was and sodium acetate fed hydrophobic sludge hpo was samples were cultivated and their dewatering behaviors were individually explored experimental results showed that s2o8 2 oxidation effectively disintegrated the polymeric eps and led to a more significant reduction in the water content for hpo was than for hpi was 12 87 15 23 vs 9 31 12 12 especially regarding the bound water w b content after oxidation as high as 38 88 42 61 of the w b within hpo was samples were declined much higher than the hpi was samples 19 27 29 20 specifically carbohydrates within sludge eps negatively influenced the dewatering process of s2o8 2 fe2 oxidation by contrast abundant existence of humic acids and polymeric proteinaceous components especially those hydrophilic proteins and transitional humic acids within the sludge eps exhibited a converse trend ft ir and eem spectral as well as particle sizes variation for the sludge samples before and after s2o8 2 fe2 oxidation was also evaluated this study provides new insight into the enhancement of s2o8 2 fe2 oxidation for sludge dewatering based on polarity analysis of eps graphical abstract image 1 keywords sludge dewatering s2o8 2 fe2 oxidation eps polarity mechanisms 1 introduction waste activated sludge was is the microbial byproduct of biological wastewater treatment plants wwtps in china the productivity of was has recently increased significantly with the continuous construction of sewage drainage systems and wastewater treatment facilities khursheed and kazmi 2011 wang et al 2013 it is estimated that more than 36 million tons of sewage sludge with an 80 moisture content were produced in china in 2019 due to the abundant existence of toxic heavy metals trace organic pollutants pathogens and typical viruses how to properly and safely dispose of these hazardous was has attracted increasing interest from researchers worldwide chen et al 2015 sludge dewatering the key pretreatment step in sludge volume reduction has been widely used in china as an efficient pretreatment approach before its disposal diak et al 2011 ye et al 2012 traditionally sludge flocs and cells which exhibit a polymeric structure are glued together by xtracellular polymeric substances eps and with a higher water content hence tremendous approaches have attempted to improve the dewatering efficiency of sewage sludge in past decades such as freezing and thawing diak et al 2011 ye et al 2012 hydrothermal treatment feng et al 2009 ye et al 2012 microwave digestion yuan et al 2011 liu et al 2016b ultrasonication feng et al 2009 devlin et al 2011 electrolysis yuan et al 2011 shi et al 2012 advanced oxidation processes aops yang et al 2008 shi et al 2012 etc generally the bound water w b tightly bound to eps or other sludge components through adhesive forces and or chemical bonds is difficult to be dewatered by mechanical forces has been highly concerned cai et al 2018 the typical aop technology of activated persulfate oxidation based on sulfate radicals so4 e0 2 5 3 1 v can decompose sludge organics and destruct the eps structure and has been adv supposed to be a novel advanced sludge conditioning technology yang et al 2008 ren et al 2015 in addition the relatively long lifetime 30 40 μs of the so4 radical guaranteed that sludge organics could be partially destroyed during oxidation even under the moderate reaction conditions of 4 ph 9 ren et al 2015 generally peroxymonosulfate pms or persulfate ps can be activated to generate so4 radicals via proper heating uv irradiation or transition metal fe2 co2 ag activation cai et al 2015 li et al 2015 in which fe2 activation is of particular interest due to its low cost high efficiency and lack of undesired side products cai et al 2015 xiong et al 2018 a recent publication by zhen et al 2012b found that as much as an 88 8 reduction of capillary suction time cst of the sludge could be achieved during 1 min of fe2 ps oxidation accompanied by a decrease in water content w c to 94 9 0 8 wt 1 5 mmol g vs s2o8 2 fe2 moreover the additive fe2 possesses greater promise for sludge dewatering than zero valent iron zvi zhen et al 2018 generally significant disintegration of sludge flocs and destruction of polymeric eps as well as release of extra and intercellular bound water might be the main reasons for the excellent dewatering performance of s2o8 2 fe2 oxidation zhen et al 2018 moreover the low productivity of true colloidal solids 1 μm and elution of soluble and bound eps also improved was filterability during thermally activated peroxydisulfate pds oxidation kim et al 2016 generally the produced so4 radicals are capable of destructing the specific functional groups of sludge related aromatic proteins zhen et al 2012b humic acids he et al 2015 and carbohydrates zhen et al 2018 the subsequent breakdown of the linkages in the polymeric backbone induces the liberation of extracellular intracellular water sludge dewaterability is also closely related to their physicochemical properties wei et al 2018 generally the higher hydrophobicity of the sludge flocs the better dewatering performance of sewage sludge he et al 2015 the recent work of li et al 2019 proven that zvi pds treatment increased the hydrophobicity of anaerobically digested sludge ads from 63 4 1 3 to 70 5 1 97 subsequently induced a significant declining of the water binding 16 9 lower than control test similarly in situ free nitrous acid treatment also reduced the surface negative charge of ads flocs and enhanced their hydrophobicity and finally improved the overall dewaterability li et al 2020 to date most works have focused on identifying the eps destruction degradation roles and molecular size changes of sludge flocs during s2o8 2 fe2 oxidation however seldom literature has been provided a historical perspective on the effect of sludge polarity hydrophobic hydrophilic ratio on the dewatering performance of persulfate oxidation in the presence of fe2 here we cultured two typical sludge samples with different polarities using sodium acetate and glucose as substrates our principal objective was to evaluate which sludge samples hpi or hpo related could preferentially react with so4 and benefit subsequent dewatering then the variation of the bound free water content chemical compositions and molecular sizes of the sludge samples were thoroughly analyzed in addition the dewatering mechanism as well as the spectral variations of the organic components of the eps before and after oxidation were evaluated 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemical characteristics of the was experimental was was obtained from the secondary clarifiers of the taiping wwtp in harbin china location 126 43 22 60 e 45 49 21 05 n with an average ph w c total solids ts volatile suspended solids vs total chemical oxygen demand cod and soluble chemical oxygen demand scod of 7 0 0 1 98 85 9400 300 mg l

hydrophobic hydrophilic defined as hpi was for hydrophilic sludge and hpo was for hydrophobic sludge were cultivated in 2 l sbr reactors with application of glucose and sodium acetate as carbon sources respectively li and yang 2007 ye et al 2011 six lab scale as reactors were used to grow sludges and were maintained at sludge retention times srts of 5 10 and 20 days obtaining g5 g10 and g20 samples for the glucose fed reactors and a5 a10 and a20 samples for the sodium acetate fed reactors the sludge concentration of six sbr reactors was maintained at a mixed liquor suspended solids mlss concentration of approximately 4000 mg l and were fed with synthetic medium according to the basic recipe of the environmental engineering process laboratory manual aeesp excess sludge was separately collected from steady state operated reactors for polarity and compositional analysis of the eps as well as the subsequent s2o8 2 fe2 oxidation the chemical characteristics of the seven sludge samples are listed in table 1 2 3 s2o8 2 fe2 oxidation tests for sludge dewatering the abovementioned was hpi was g5 g10 and g20 and hpo was a5 a10 and a20 samples were thickened to the required solid concentration approximately 15000 mg vs l first then batch tests were conducted in a series of 500 ml glass beakers with 300 ml of typical sludge at its inherent ph the effect of persulfate concentrations on sludge dewatering was studied under various s2o8 2 doses of 0 3 0 6 0 8 0 9 1 2 and 1 5 mmol g vs with an n s2o8 2 n fe2 ratio of 0 9 which was continuously agitated at 120 rpm at 25 c 5 ml sludge was collected at predetermined intervals to measure the cst and w c the effect of the molar ratio of n s2o8 2 n fe2 on sludge dewatering was evaluated at fixed s2o8 2 fe2 ratios of 0 6 0 7 0 8 0 9 1 0 and 1 2 under a s2o8 2 dosage of 1 2 mmol g vs variations in sludge filterability were represented by the reciprocal ratio of cst to its initial value cst0 cst after oxidation 20 min sludge samples were used for water content measurement and fractionation of the eps all experiments were conducted in triplicate and using the was sample without s2o8 2 fe2 additive as a blank 2 4 extraction of sludge eps and hydrophobic hydrophilic characteristic analysis to assess the polarity of the sludge samples the eps of the was hpo was and hpi was samples were first separately extracted using ammonia hydroxide and then fractionated into fractions of hydrophilic substances hpi hydrophobic acidic organic matter hpo a transitional hydrophilic organic acidic substances tpi a hydrophobic neutral organic matter hpo n and transitional hydrophilic neutral organic matter tpi n using xad 4 xad 8 resins according to our previous work outlined by xue et al 2008 and wei et al 2011 2 5 analytical methods the dewaterability of the abovementioned sludge samples was evaluated in terms of cst and w c briefly the cst was measured using a commercial cst instrument model 304b triton uk which was equipped with a φ18 mm funnel and whatman no 17 chromatography grade paper the w c ts and vs of the sludges were detected following standard methods apha 1998 the concentrations of the extracted polysaccharide pc and protein pn of sludge eps and supernatants were determined using anthrone method and modified lowry method frolund et al 1995 1996 humic acids were the organic components that could be precipitated at ph 2 0 using 6 m hcl for 30 min following the procedures by frolund et al 1996 the dissolved organic carbon doc in the eps was detected by a toc analyzer shimadzu toc 5000 was hpi was and hpo was as well as the conditioned sludges were centrifuged for 10 min 2000 rpm to obtain centrifuged sludge cakes and the amount of total and bound water in the above samples was determined by thermogravimetric analysis tga and differential scanning calorimetry briefly tga thermographs of the sludge cakes were recorded by a thermal analyzer netzsch geratebau germany using pure n2 as the carrier gas the weight loss of the sludge as the temperature increased from 30 to 150 c was regarded as the total amount of w c bound water was determined using a q2000 differential scanning calorimetry analyzer ta usa the calculation of the free water w f and w b contents were performed according to vaxelaire and cezac 2004 and detailed information can be found in the supplementary materials excitation emission matrix eem fluorescence and fourier transform infrared ft ir spectroscopy of sludge eps were conducted using a jasco fp 6500 spectrofluorometer tokyo japan and a perkinelmer spectrometer waltham usa respectively the particle size distribution of the different sludge samples was measured with a laser diffraction particle size analyzer mastersizer 3000 malvern instruments ltd uk the apparent molecular weight m w and number average molecular weight m n distribution of extractable sludge eps was characterized by high performance size exclusion chromatography hpsec with uv detection at 254 nm polydispersity d was calculated as d m w m n laguna et al 2001 detailed information has been included in the supporting information 3 results and discussion 3 1 operational factors affecting sludge filterability during s2o8 2 fe2 oxidation operational parameters such as s2o8 2 dose and molar ratio of s2o8 2 fe2 significantly influenced sludge conditioning guan et al 2011 as shown in fig 1 a increasing n s2o8 2 in mmol g vs from 0 0 blank test to 0 3 to 0 8 significantly decreased the cst value of the was and approached a plateau as n s2o8 2 further increased to 0 9 1 2 mmol g vs however further increasing n s2o8 2 to 1 5 mmol g vs deteriorated the sludge filterability the w c value distribution of the was under varied s2o8 2 doses differed significantly from that of cst briefly an inconspicuous increase in the dry solids content dsc of the sludge was observed when the concentration of s2o8 2 in mmol g vs increased from 0 3 to 0 8 more significantly than the blank test without s2o8 2 fe2 additive however the increase in n s2o8 2 to 0 9 and 1 2 mmol g vs improved the filterability and led to a reduction in the w c value to 89 90 and 87 12 respectively subsequent increases in n s2o8 2 to 1 5 mmol g vs deteriorated the sludge dewatering and led to a sharp decrease in dsc to 5 78 in addition experimental results demonstrated that all possible reductions in cst and dsc occurred within 1 min of reaction which was consistent with the previous observations of liu et al 2016a theoretically dosage increasing of the s2o8 2 promoted the formation of the so4 which contributed to the destruction of the polymeric sludge flocs and releasing of internally bound water luo et al 2018 might be the main reason for the enhancement of sludge filterability with increasing of n s2o8 2 dose nevertheless the recent work of liu et al 2016a also demonstrated that an excessively high dose of s2o8 2 would be converted to a sulfate radical quenching agent when n s2o8 2 reached 0 9 mmol g vs which might be the main reason why the deterioration of sludge filterability was observed when the s2o8 2 dose increased to 1 5 mmol g vs finally an optimal s2o8 2 dose of 1 2 mmol g vs was selected for the subsequent experiments the influence of n s2o8 2 n fe2 on s2o8 2 fe2 oxidation for sludge conditioning was evaluated under a 1 2 mmol g vs s2o8 2 dose and inherent ph and the experimental results are listed in fig 1c and d similar to the observations of zhen et al 2012a and liu et al 2016a a gradual increase in the molar ratio of n s2o8 2 n fe2 from 0 6 to 0 9 efficiently improved the dewatering performance as evidenced by the gradual decline in the cst and dry solids content specifically the maximum reduction of the cst of 58 5 a decrease from 154 8 to 64 3 s was observed under an optimal n s2o8 2 n fe2 ratio of 0 9 finally the experimental parameters of a 1 2 mmol g vs s2o8 2 dose and a n s2o8 2 n fe2 molar ratio of 0 9 were chosen for use in the following tests 3 2 polarities of cultured sludge eps and its effect on sludge filterability during s2o8 2 fe2 oxidation sludge dewatering performance is known to be closely relevant to polarity distribution hydrophobic hydrophilic and eps characteristics of sludge wei et al 2018 li et al 2019 2020 thus the effect of the composition of the eps of was hpo was sodium acetate fed and hpi was glucose fed on the dewatering performance after s2o8 2 fe2 oxidation was analyzed 3 3 polarity distribution of was glucose and sodium acetate fed sludges eps within the was hpo was and hpi was samples were separately extracted using nh4oh and their chemical composition was analyzed using xad resin fractionation as shown in fig 2 a as much as 255 8 303 0 and 449 1 mg g vs eps were extracted from the sodium acetate fed sludge samples a5 a10 and a20 respectively correspondingly the obtained eps of g5 g10 and g20 hpi was were 283 7 277 1 and 343 0 mg g vs respectively whereas 373 2 mg g vs was obtained for the extracted eps of was totally the extractable nh4oh representing 64 7 75 3 of total organic carbon within the sludge samples similar to our previous observation wei et al 2010 the was glucose fed and sodium acetate fed sludge samples exhibited very different polarity distributions which exhibited a declined hpo hpi distribution trend of a20 2 26 a5 1 95 a10 1 85 was 1 45 g5 1 33 g10 1 01 g20 0 75 briefly the average percentages of hpi as bulk doc in the sodium acetate fed samples of a5 a10 and a20 were 25 39 26 34 and 21 08 respectively which were much lower than those of the hpi was samples 27 68 for g5 32 58 for g10 and 37 98 for g20 by contrast the fractional percentages of hpo a in a5 a10 and a20 samples were 38 09 37 64 and 35 16 respectively fig 2b which were higher than those of the glucose fed samples g5 25 43 g10 22 78 and g20 19 97 in addition the average hpo n content of the sodium acetate fed sludge samples was 11 74 whereas that of the glucose fed sludge samples was 10 02 thus we concluded that the sludge samples cultured using glucose as a carbon source were more hydrophilic than those cultured with sodium acetate which exhibited higher hydrophobic characteristics 3 4 effect of eps polarity on sludge filterability during s2o8 2 fe2 oxidation dewaterability behaviors of different sludge samples during s2o8 2 fe2 oxidation were significantly affected by their polarities our experimental results shown in fig 3 clearly revealed that the sodium acetate fed sludge samples hpo was exhibited higher cst and w b values than those of the glucose fed sludge samples hpi was the above results were quite consistent with the previous observation that the more hydrophobic the sludge eps was the greater the degree of polymerization of the sludge flocs and thus the higher content of bound water hong et al 2015 once s2o8 2 fe2 oxidation progressed the cst values of the a5 a10 and a20 samples decreased from 432 5 to 113 2 s 333 3 to 98 4 s and 305 4 to 95 1 s fig 3a with average reduction rates of 73 8 70 5 and 68 9 respectively by contrast the corresponding reductions in cst for glucose fed samples 60 9 64 5 was slightly lower than those of the hpo was samples which might be ascribed to the lower cst values of the g5 g10 and g20 samples 142 1 172 4 s similar to the observation of ye et al 2011 the decreasing trend of w c of the abovementioned sludge samples was similar to that of cst fig 3b exhibiting a decreasing trend of a20 15 23 a10 14 07 a5 12 87 g20 12 12 was 11 19 g10 9 93 g5 9 31 after 20 min of s2o8 2 fe2 oxidation specifically s2o8 2 fe2 treatment led to a more notable decrease in the w b value than in w f 19 27 42 61 vs 3 12 6 07 implying that the intracellular and extracellular bound water of sludge samples could be effectively released during s2o8 2 fe2 oxidation moreover the rate of w b reduction was much higher for the sodium acetate fed hpo was samples 38 88 42 61 than for the glucose fed hpi was samples 19 27 29 20 implying that s2o8 2 fe2 oxidation caused more bound water in hpo was being transformed and released than the other cultivated sludges from the above results we could conclude that a higher content of hydrophobic constituents in sludge eps with higher content of bound water benefited s2o8 2 fe2 oxidation for subsequent dewatering quite consistent with the observation of li et al 2019 similar to the observations of kim et al 2016 and xiong et al 2018 who found that difficult to degrade tb eps instead of soluble lb eps were efficiently destroyed during persulfate oxidation moreover prolonging the cultural srt from 5 to 20 d regardless of the substrate utilized also enhanced the sludge filterability especially for the hpo was samples 3 5 variation in nh4oh extractable solid eps organics during s2o8 2 fe2 oxidation 3 5 1 composition variation of solid sludge organics s2o8 2 fe2 oxidation significantly changed the chemical composition of the sludge especially regarding the organic components in solid eps as shown in fig 4 the doc concentrations of the extractable hydrophobic acid fractions of all six sludge samples decreased significantly after s2o8 2 fe2 oxidation as evidenced by the higher doc removal rate of hpo a 29 1 except g20 than that of the other fractions by contrast the corresponding doc value of the hydrophilic fraction hpi related decreased insignificantly for instance the reduction in doc of the hpi fraction of the glucose fed hpi was samples ranged from 3 50 to 20 09 whereas a noticeable increase in doc was observed for the sodium acetate fed sludge samples 13 85 12 39 and 33 73 for a5 a10 and a20 respectively moreover it is interestingly to note that the doc of hpo n fraction of hpi was samples increase significantly after so4 oxidation 31 93 150 53 whereas that of hpo was decreased slightly 1 19 14 58 implying that partial of the carboxylic groups within the hpo a fractions were destructed and converted to neutral ones above results exhibited that after s2o8 2 fe2 oxidation the doc of hydrophobic fraction of hpo was samples was decreased and doc value of the hydrophilic showed opposite trend zhen et al 2012a and mikkelsen and keiding 2002 revealed that radical oxidation and subsequent destruction of sludge flocs were the predominant pathways for s2o8 2 fe2 conditioning therefore the destruction of the hydrophobic fractions especially those hpo a fractions such as breakage of the carboxylic groups led to an efficient releasing of the bound water and thus an enhancement of sludge dewaterability combined with the removal trends of cst and w c listed in fig 3 we concluded that the disintegration of hydrophobic eps after s2o8 2 fe2 oxidation was more responsible for the liberation of w b than reduced cst or w c values the removal trends of tpi a during s2o8 2 fe2 treatment were quite similar to those of hpo a whereas tpi n fractions was to hpi except g5 and g10 thus the disintegration of flocs destruction of hydrophobic and transitional solid organics and subsequent conversion to low molecular weight components also played a great role in sludge filterability improvement during s2o8 2 fe2 oxidation once s2o8 2 fe2 oxidation progressed the hpo hpi ratio of the six sludge samples decreased in the order of g20 1 32 g5 1 27 a5 1 22 a10 1 12 a20 1 01 g10 0 95 in which the sodium acetate fed hpo was samples a5 a10 and a20 exhibited a more noteworthy decrease 37 4 55 3 than that of the glucose fed ones 4 51 43 2 3 5 2 fractional variation of concentration of protein humic acid and carbohydrate the fractional distributions of proteins carbohydrates and humic acids in the organic solid phase of the different sludge samples were extracted and the results are listed in fig 5 since the chemical characteristics of the sludge samples fed using the same substrate were quite similar to each other thus the sludge samples of a10 and g10 were selected as representative samples and are discussed below chemical characteristics of proteins carbohydrates and humic acids within sludge eps varied widely under polarities changes and a summary of some relevant published literatures with the latest important results on their compositions is presented in table s1 overall both proteins and humic acids were the predominant components of the sodium acetate fed a10 sample fig 5b accounting for as much as 44 25 and 31 66 of the bulk extractable eps respectively whereas that of the carbohydrates 56 01 mg g vs was 18 51 similarly the percentage distribution trend of the eps of was 373 2 mg g vs revealed in fig 5a decreased in the order of proteins 35 32 humic acids 28 87 carbohydrates 23 35 by contrast the humic acids 59 06 mg g vs were found to be the lowest proportion of the nh4oh extractable organics of g10 21 31 followed by carbohydrates 33 18 whereas the highest proportion was that of proteins 41 37 theoretically the higher hydrophobic of the sludge eps the more abundant existence of the humic acid like molecules wang et al 2012b cao et al 2017 thus the relatively low percentage distribution of humic acid might be the main reason for the low hydrophobicity of the glucose fed hpi was previous studies also revealed that higher polymeric proteinaceous substrates played a great role in the formation of the aromatic components of sludge eps especially those eps with a complex molecular weight distribution wang et al 2018 zhang et al 2020 which might be the main reason why such a high content of protein was also observed in the a10 sample the above conclusion could also be supported by the experimental results that relatively high protein and humic acid contents were observed for the hpo a fraction of the was and sodium acetate fed hpo was the hpo a fraction of g10 exhibited a relatively higher carbohydrate content compared to that of the proteins and humic acids a lower oxidation rate of the nh4oh extractable carbohydrates was observed for almost all fractions of eps of the was a10 and g10 samples except hpiwas and hpo na10 revealing that those carbohydrates could not be preferentially oxidized by s2o8 2 fe2 on the other hand solid organics of was related hpo n and g10 related hpo a tpi a and tpi n as well as a10 related tpi a exhibited the highest removals of humic acid among all three selected sludge samples removal rate ranged from 20 89 to 40 01 by contrast hpo awas tpi awas tpi nwas hpig10 hpo ng10 hpia10 hpo aa10 hpo na10 and tpi na10 exhibited the highest reductions in protein content 4 74 41 17 reduction it is interesting to note that the efficient destruction of the proteins and humic acids especially hydrophilic proteins and transitional humic acids important and easily ignored components played a great role in sludge organic destruction during s2o8 2 fe2 oxidation 3 5 3 fractional aromaticity variation of solid sludge organics both the sodium acetate and glucose fed sludge samples exhibited a higher aromaticity expressed as a uv 254 value than that of was ranging from 0 4 to 10 6 and 4 7 10 2 for hpo was and hpi was respectively data in supplementary fig s2 moreover prolonging the cultivation hrt led to a slight increase in the aromaticity of sludge eps regardless of the implemented substrate carbon source variation exhibited a significant effect on the percentage based aromatic distribution of the sludge eps as evidenced by the higher fractional uv 254 contribution of the hydrophobic fractions of hpo was than that of hpi was 67 87 69 25 vs 36 30 37 83 the aromaticity of sodium acetate fed hpo was showed a more significant decrease during so4 oxidation than that of the glucose fed hpo was for instance the uv 254 value of the a5 a10 and a20 samples decreased by 27 73 22 70 and 44 80 respectively when s2o8 2 fe2 oxidation progressed whereas that of the glucose fed samples ranged from 12 36 to 17 33 the above results clearly indicated that aromatic polymers of sludge eps such as lignophenols guaiacyl structures pcbs glutamate dehydrogenase and membrane scaffold proteins lignin hydrophobic amino acids unsaturated fatty chains etc especially for the sodium acetate fed hpo was samples could preferentially react with s2o8 2 fe2 regarding the fractions of eps as much as a 21 25 27 78 reduction of uv 254 values in hpo a was observed for the glucose fed hpi was samples which was slightly lower than that of the a5 and a20 sludge samples which decreased by 26 5 and 45 6 respectively by contrast all of the hpi fractions in hpi was samples changed insignificantly 2 90 6 81 in uv 254 value after s2o8 2 fe2 oxidation whereas that of the hpi in a5 and a10 samples exhibited a noteworthy increase 22 49 for a5 and 19 17 for a10 thus we deduced that some of the destroyed aromatic hydrophobic sludge organics were converted to hydrophilic components especially for hpo was similarly the aromatic components within tpi a and hpo n could also disintegrate during so4 oxidation especially for the more hydrophobic hpo was sodium acetate fed samples combined with the obtained dewatering performance results we concluded that the destruction of aromatic polymeric structures especially those of aromatics within the hydrophobic fractions of sludge eps might be the main reason for the efficient release of bound water during s2o8 2 fe2 oxidation 3 6 variation in supernatant organics of sludge during s2o8 2 fe2 oxidation disintegration degree of sludge samples usually calculated as the ratio between the increase in doc and the tdoc in the supernatant has been widely applied to express the was solubilization efficiency zhen et al 2014 as shown in fig 6 the concentration of soluble organics referred to as seps increased significantly as s2o8 2 fe2 treatment progressed as evidenced by the significant increase in doc of 25 7 for was 292 9 368 1 mg l 132 0 for a10 165 9 384 9 mg l and 112 3 for g10 162 3 344 6 mg l thus disintegration of the flocs especially the extracellular intercellular organics led to a significant release of destroyed eps into the sludge supernatant solid phase to liquid phase generally the hydrophilic fraction of hpi exhibited a much lower release of humic acid ranging from 28 2 to 95 0 compared to that of the hydrophobic fraction 48 5 160 3 for hpo a and 65 3 180 2 for hpo n by contrast the concentration of hpi and tpi n related carbohydrates within the so4 oxidized sludge supernatant increased more dramatically than that of the hydrophobic fractions the above results further prove that the hydrophobic humic acids as well as the hydrophilic transitional carbohydrates could be efficiently destroyed after s2o8 2 fe2 treatment although as high as 124 1 and 95 7 concentration increases in hpi related proteins were observed for a10 and g10 supernatant the much higher increase in hpo a related proteins of a10 137 7 and g10 157 1 implied that hydrophobic proteins could be more easily destroyed during so4 oxidation than hydrophilic proteins it is well recognized that polymeric cell wall control the integrity and colloidal stability of sludge flocs and are closely correlated to the binding capacity of bound water kim et al 2016 additionally recent publication of zhou et al 2014 also pointed out that decreasing the protein content in slime and tb eps would improve sludge filterability hence the significant rupture of hydrophobic eps as well as the releasing of extracellular intercellular proteins is the main reason for the improvement of sludge filterability after s2o8 2 fe2 oxidation in addition the rupture of hydrophilic sludge colloidal flocs especially hydrophilic proteins was also essential for the release of interstitial water which was similar to the observation of wu and chai 2016 3 7 variation in particle size molecular weight distribution of sludge organics during s2o8 2 fe2 oxidation according to mikkelsen 2001 and shao et al 2009 the supracolloidal flocs of sludge organics especially with a particle size 10 μm primary particles have been proven to be an important parameter affecting sludge filterability thus the particle size distribution of the colloidal particles of the was glucose and sodium acetate fed sludge samples was examined here and the results are listed in fig 7 the particle size of was exhibited a major peak centered at 5 25 μm fig 7a as well as weak peaks at approximately 1 00 and 0 13 μm and the oxidation of s2o8 2 fe2 significantly changed their distribution for instance the major peak at 5 25 μm was rapidly reduced with evolving new peaks in smaller sizes including downshifted peaks at approximately 0 06 0 28 0 52 and 4 45 μm except for the major peak at approximately 6 12 μm fig 7b the sodium acetate fed a10 sample also exhibited notable peaks at approximately 1 45 0 44 and 0 07 μm larger than in was the above result was in line with the observation of wang et al 2017 who found that the promotion of sludge dewaterability was accompanied by a significant reduction in particle size moreover it is interestingly to note that s2o8 2 fe2 oxidation led to a perceptible downshift of the molecular size of the a10 and was and produced a large quality of colloidal particles smaller than 1 μm which was quite different from the observation of kim et al 2016 by contrast the glucose fed g10 sample exhibited a less significant variation in the particle size after so4 oxidation than that of a10 further proving that the powerful destruction of high molecular weight components and hydrophobic organics liberation of many cells trapped within sludge was attributed to the release of bound water during s2o8 2 fe2 treatment the above results were partially consistent with the observations of zhen et al 2018 and kim et al 2016 which might be the main reason for the enhancement of sludge dewaterability compared to the glucose fed g10 samples in fig 7c the fragmentation rate of the major colloidal group at approximately 6 12 μm was much faster for the a10 sample the molecular weight distribution of the unfractionated eps and the hpo a and hpi fractions of was a10 and g10 were analyzed and the chromatographic data showed multimodal distributions with apparent molecular weight ranging from 17232 93 to 239476 86 da in supporting information of table s2 specifically the chromatogram of organic compounds extracted from the a10 sample exhibited a much broader distribution than that of the was and g10 samples especially for the hpo a fractions for the different sludge samples the hpo a fraction extracted from a10 sodium acetate fed sludge exhibited a much higher m n and polydispersity value than those of was and g10 indicating the relatively condensed polymerized structure of hpo was correspondingly the m n and polydispersity value of the hpi fraction were the lowest when s2o8 2 fe2 oxidation progressed both of the hpo a related fractions of a10 and g10 exhibited a significant decrease in m w from 203497 6 239476 8 da to 38451 5 94359 5 da and polydispersity from 190 2 273 5 to 78 8 190 1 which was consistent with the molecular size variation obtained above because a high m w m n indicated that organics had a broad m w distribution wang et al 2016 the significant increase in the g10 related hpi fraction clearly indicated the new production of low m w hydrophilic organics of hpi was whereas the change in the m w m n of the hpo was sample was less significant 3 8 spectral and zeta potential variations of sludge organics 3 8 1 eem spectral variation to determine the variation in fluorophores of sludge eps the eem spectra of was hpi was and hpo was before and after s2o8 2 fe2 oxidation were analyzed fig s4 there were five principal eem peaks for sludge organics correlating with the regions i v proposed in chen et al 2015 the description of the regional distribution can be found anywhere and is listed in the supporting information the eps extracted from the sodium acetate fed hpo was exhibited noticeable fluorophores in regions ii iv and v fig s4 referring to the existence of aromatic proteins soluble microbial byproducts smps and fulvic acid like organics the intensities of those fluorophores particularly smp and fulvic acid like components sharply declined as s2o8 2 fe2 oxidation progressed implying that those polymeric cell walls were efficiently destroyed similarly the weak fluorophore intensity in region ii for the sodium acetate fed sludge samples also significantly decreased suggesting that the proteins within hpo was could be partially oxidized the eem spectrum of hpi was exhibited an obvious fluorescence peak at 320 380 400 nm demonstrating that aromatic humic acid like organics were also abundant by contrast the relatively low fluorophore intensity observed for glucose fed samples was related to the insignificant fluorescent behaviors of extra intracellular polysaccharides s2o8 2 fe2 oxidation efficiently decreased the fluorescence intensity of hpi was related humic acid like organics implying that those organics in hydrophilic sludges could be readily destroyed 3 8 2 ft ir spectral variation nh4oh extractable sludge organics from was hpo was hpi was exhibited significant absorption bands at 2960 cm 1 c h vibrations 1730 cm 1 carbonyl co vibrations 1410 cm 1 aliphatic c o and c h vibrations and 621 cm 1 especially for sodium acetate fed hpo was which were ascribed to the abundant existence of aromatic hydrophobic humic acid like components wei et al 2019 correspondingly the spectra of the eps related organics of was hpo was and hpi was also showed noticeable peaks at approximately 1640 1560 and 1220 cm 1 corresponding to the amide i ii and iii groups respectively filip et al 2004 specifically amide ii groups were more abundant in hpo was than in hpi was and amide i groups were abundant in both hpi and hpo was in addition the spectral peaks near 3320 cm 1 o h vibrations 1460 cm 1 c h c h2 and c h3 vibrations and 1040 cm 1 c o vibrations could be assigned to hydrocarbon related organics the intensity increase of spectral peak at approximately 1040 cm 1 for all sludge samples demonstrated that the polysaccharides in sludge eps could not be easily oxidized by s2o8 2 fe2 by contrast the significant decrease in the amide i ii and iii groups protein related of hpo was implied that those amide containing sludge organics could be efficiently degraded whereas the corresponding peak intensities in the spectrum of hpi was exhibited a slight increase the intensities of the noticeable peaks at 1730 and 1410 cm 1 humic acid related of the sludge samples especially for the sodium acetate fed a5 a10 and a20 samples decreased slightly after s2o8 2 fe2 oxidation which was related to the preferential destruction of the bonds of co c o and c h within high molecular weight aromatic organics similarly the recent work of wang et al 2019 revealed that the so4 would attack the sludge flocs and cells and finally decomposed them into micromolecule organics and even inorganics thus liberating eps and cell bound water moreover the degradation of the carboxylic co bond might be another reason for the increasing of the percentage of hpo n within the hpi was consistent with the observation of the doc concentration variation of hpo n during s2o8 2 fe2 oxidation section 3 3 1 3 8 3 zeta potential variation zeta potential variations of the different sludge samples pre and post s2o8 2 fe2 oxidation were measured and the results are listed in the supplementary material fig s5 the wide existence of negatively charged groups such as cooh phosphoric so3h nh2 sh etc led to a relatively low observed zeta potentials for all the experimental sludge samples wang et al 2012a treatment with s2o8 2 fe2 oxidation significantly increased the surface charges of sodium acetate fed hpo was and the zeta potentials of a5 a10 and a20 increased from 27 65 26 92 and 23 32 mv to 16 98 mv 16 29 mv and 11 32 mv respectively by contrast a less significant increment of 25 76 for g5 30 96 for g10 and 43 26 for g20 were respectively observed 38 59 51 46 for sodium acetate fed samples the recent work of wu et al 2017 found that protein gels with sludge can lead to a strong ability to store elastic deformation energy and maintain gel elasticity thus the lower zeta potential increase of hpi was than that of hpo was related to the lower disintegration of polymeric humic acids and proteins which contain negatively charged groups 3 9 potential correlation of polarity characteristics of eps and sludge filterability for dewatering via s2o8 2 fe2 oxidation numerous studies have indicated that the polarity of sludge eps can significantly affect the dewatering performance of sewage sludge he et al 2015 zhang et al 2020 thus the linear correlation between the water content variations divided into δw c δw f and δw b and the percentage distribution of organic compositions ratio of pn pc and removed tochpo to toceps were separately analyzed fig 8 regarding w c the percentage of carbohydrates and the pn pc ratio as well as the removed hpo organics correlated well with the rate of w c decrease δw c with relatively high statistical r2 values of 0 8327 0 6807 and 0 7298 respectively overall a negative regression slope of the carbohydrate content to the filterability improvement revealed that the abundant existence of carbohydrates would deteriorate the dewatering performance by contrast the statistical r2 values of δw f and sludge polarity parameters tochpo removed pn pc and percentages of pc and pn were quite low r2 0 1547 except for the percentage distributions of humic acid and hydrophobic organic with r2 values ranging from 0 5485 to 0 6713 implying that the release of free water during so4 oxidation was closely related to the destruction of hydrophobic organics especially humic acids consistent with the previous work of dai et al 2018 for the intracellular and eps captured w b a strong linear relationship between the δw b and all parameters listed above was observed r2 0 5718 except that of the protein content specifically the negative slope of δw b vs carbohydrates 1 2758 more negative than that of δw c vs carbohydrates 0 2943 further demonstrated that increasing the hydrophilic carbohydrate content in sludge samples adversely affected the dewatering of bound water however the disintegration of hydrophobic organics such as humic acid and polymeric proteinaceous substrates benefited s2o8 2 fe2 conditioning in addition increasing pn pc ratio also played a positive role in bound water release based on the above information we strongly recommended using s2o8 2 fe2 oxidation to facilitate the filterability of sludge samples with a relatively high hydrophobic content and pn pc ratio and a low carbohydrate percentage 4 conclusions s2o8 2 fe2 pretreatment efficiently improved sludge filterability especially for sludges with relatively high hydrophobic characteristics the generated sulfate radicals preferentially attacked the hydrophobic proteins and humic acids over carbohydrates more hydrophilic and led to a more significant decrease in bound water than in free water rupturing of sludge flocs and extracellular intercellular sludge organics led to a significant release of the hydrophilic transitional carbohydrates and hydrophobic humic acids into the sludge supernatant as well as proteins regardless of their polarity a perceptible molecular weight downshift was observed for both hpi was and hpo was and a large quantity of colloidal particles smaller than 1 μm were observed after oxidation moreover high content of hydrophilic carbohydrates in sludge samples adversely affected the dewatering of bound water during s2o8 2 fe2 oxidation whereas disintegration of hydrophobic organics such as polymeric proteinaceous substrates and humic acids benefited s2o8 2 fe2 conditioning thus we strongly recommended the use of s2o8 2 fe2 oxidation to facilitate the filterability of sludge with a relatively high hydrophobic content and pn pc ratio but a low carbohydrate percentage declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have

17849,to clarify the effect of the hydrophobic hydrophilic polarity of extracellular polymeric substances eps on sludge filterability improvement during s2o8 2 fe2 oxidation waste activated sludge was glucose fed hydrophilic sludge hpi was and sodium acetate fed hydrophobic sludge hpo was samples were cultivated and their dewatering behaviors were individually explored experimental results showed that s2o8 2 oxidation effectively disintegrated the polymeric eps and led to a more significant reduction in the water content for hpo was than for hpi was 12 87 15 23 vs 9 31 12 12 especially regarding the bound water w b content after oxidation as high as 38 88 42 61 of the w b within hpo was samples were declined much higher than the hpi was samples 19 27 29 20 specifically carbohydrates within sludge eps negatively influenced the dewatering process of s2o8 2 fe2 oxidation by contrast abundant existence of humic acids and polymeric proteinaceous components especially those hydrophilic proteins and transitional humic acids within the sludge eps exhibited a converse trend ft ir and eem spectral as well as particle sizes variation for the sludge samples before and after s2o8 2 fe2 oxidation was also evaluated this study provides new insight into the enhancement of s2o8 2 fe2 oxidation for sludge dewatering based on polarity analysis of eps graphical abstract image 1 keywords sludge dewatering s2o8 2 fe2 oxidation eps polarity mechanisms 1 introduction waste activated sludge was is the microbial byproduct of biological wastewater treatment plants wwtps in china the productivity of was has recently increased significantly with the continuous construction of sewage drainage systems and wastewater treatment facilities khursheed and kazmi 2011 wang et al 2013 it is estimated that more than 36 million tons of sewage sludge with an 80 moisture content were produced in china in 2019 due to the abundant existence of toxic heavy metals trace organic pollutants pathogens and typical viruses how to properly and safely dispose of these hazardous was has attracted increasing interest from researchers worldwide chen et al 2015 sludge dewatering the key pretreatment step in sludge volume reduction has been widely used in china as an efficient pretreatment approach before its disposal diak et al 2011 ye et al 2012 traditionally sludge flocs and cells which exhibit a polymeric structure are glued together by xtracellular polymeric substances eps and with a higher water content hence tremendous approaches have attempted to improve the dewatering efficiency of sewage sludge in past decades such as freezing and thawing diak et al 2011 ye et al 2012 hydrothermal treatment feng et al 2009 ye et al 2012 microwave digestion yuan et al 2011 liu et al 2016b ultrasonication feng et al 2009 devlin et al 2011 electrolysis yuan et al 2011 shi et al 2012 advanced oxidation processes aops yang et al 2008 shi et al 2012 etc generally the bound water w b tightly bound to eps or other sludge components through adhesive forces and or chemical bonds is difficult to be dewatered by mechanical forces has been highly concerned cai et al 2018 the typical aop technology of activated persulfate oxidation based on sulfate radicals so4 e0 2 5 3 1 v can decompose sludge organics and destruct the eps structure and has been adv supposed to be a novel advanced sludge conditioning technology yang et al 2008 ren et al 2015 in addition the relatively long lifetime 30 40 μs of the so4 radical guaranteed that sludge organics could be partially destroyed during oxidation even under the moderate reaction conditions of 4 ph 9 ren et al 2015 generally peroxymonosulfate pms or persulfate ps can be activated to generate so4 radicals via proper heating uv irradiation or transition metal fe2 co2 ag activation cai et al 2015 li et al 2015 in which fe2 activation is of particular interest due to its low cost high efficiency and lack of undesired side products cai et al 2015 xiong et al 2018 a recent publication by zhen et al 2012b found that as much as an 88 8 reduction of capillary suction time cst of the sludge could be achieved during 1 min of fe2 ps oxidation accompanied by a decrease in water content w c to 94 9 0 8 wt 1 5 mmol g vs s2o8 2 fe2 moreover the additive fe2 possesses greater promise for sludge dewatering than zero valent iron zvi zhen et al 2018 generally significant disintegration of sludge flocs and destruction of polymeric eps as well as release of extra and intercellular bound water might be the main reasons for the excellent dewatering performance of s2o8 2 fe2 oxidation zhen et al 2018 moreover the low productivity of true colloidal solids 1 μm and elution of soluble and bound eps also improved was filterability during thermally activated peroxydisulfate pds oxidation kim et al 2016 generally the produced so4 radicals are capable of destructing the specific functional groups of sludge related aromatic proteins zhen et al 2012b humic acids he et al 2015 and carbohydrates zhen et al 2018 the subsequent breakdown of the linkages in the polymeric backbone induces the liberation of extracellular intracellular water sludge dewaterability is also closely related to their physicochemical properties wei et al 2018 generally the higher hydrophobicity of the sludge flocs the better dewatering performance of sewage sludge he et al 2015 the recent work of li et al 2019 proven that zvi pds treatment increased the hydrophobicity of anaerobically digested sludge ads from 63 4 1 3 to 70 5 1 97 subsequently induced a significant declining of the water binding 16 9 lower than control test similarly in situ free nitrous acid treatment also reduced the surface negative charge of ads flocs and enhanced their hydrophobicity and finally improved the overall dewaterability li et al 2020 to date most works have focused on identifying the eps destruction degradation roles and molecular size changes of sludge flocs during s2o8 2 fe2 oxidation however seldom literature has been provided a historical perspective on the effect of sludge polarity hydrophobic hydrophilic ratio on the dewatering performance of persulfate oxidation in the presence of fe2 here we cultured two typical sludge samples with different polarities using sodium acetate and glucose as substrates our principal objective was to evaluate which sludge samples hpi or hpo related could preferentially react with so4 and benefit subsequent dewatering then the variation of the bound free water content chemical compositions and molecular sizes of the sludge samples were thoroughly analyzed in addition the dewatering mechanism as well as the spectral variations of the organic components of the eps before and after oxidation were evaluated 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemical characteristics of the was experimental was was obtained from the secondary clarifiers of the taiping wwtp in harbin china location

hydrophobic hydrophilic defined as hpi was for hydrophilic sludge and hpo was for hydrophobic sludge were cultivated in 2 l sbr reactors with application of glucose and sodium acetate as carbon sources respectively li and yang 2007 ye et al 2011 six lab scale as reactors were used to grow sludges and were maintained at sludge retention times srts of 5 10 and 20 days obtaining g5 g10 and g20 samples for the glucose fed reactors and a5 a10 and a20 samples for the sodium acetate fed reactors the sludge concentration of six sbr reactors was maintained at a mixed liquor suspended solids mlss concentration of approximately 4000 mg l and were fed with synthetic medium according to the basic recipe of the environmental engineering process laboratory manual aeesp excess sludge was separately collected from steady state operated reactors for polarity and compositional analysis of the eps as well as the subsequent s2o8 2 fe2 oxidation the chemical characteristics of the seven sludge samples are listed in table 1 2 3 s2o8 2 fe2 oxidation tests for sludge dewatering the abovementioned was hpi was g5 g10 and g20 and hpo was a5 a10 and a20 samples were thickened to the required solid concentration approximately 15000 mg vs l first then batch tests were conducted in a series of 500 ml glass beakers with 300 ml of typical sludge at its inherent ph the effect of persulfate concentrations on sludge dewatering was studied under various s2o8 2 doses of 0 3 0 6 0 8 0 9 1 2 and 1 5 mmol g vs with an n s2o8 2 n fe2 ratio of 0 9 which was continuously agitated at 120 rpm at 25 c 5 ml sludge was collected at predetermined intervals to measure the cst and w c the effect of the molar ratio of n s2o8 2 n fe2 on sludge dewatering was evaluated at fixed s2o8 2 fe2 ratios of 0 6 0 7 0 8 0 9 1 0 and 1 2 under a s2o8 2 dosage of 1 2 mmol g vs variations in sludge filterability were represented by the reciprocal ratio of cst to its initial value cst0 cst after oxidation 20 min sludge samples were used for water content measurement and fractionation of the eps all experiments were conducted in triplicate and using the was sample without s2o8 2 fe2 additive as a blank 2 4 extraction of sludge eps and hydrophobic hydrophilic characteristic analysis to assess the polarity of the sludge samples the eps of the was hpo was and hpi was samples were first separately extracted using ammonia hydroxide and then fractionated into fractions of hydrophilic substances hpi hydrophobic acidic organic matter hpo a transitional hydrophilic organic acidic substances tpi a hydrophobic neutral organic matter hpo n and transitional hydrophilic neutral organic matter tpi n using xad 4 xad 8 resins according to our previous work outlined by xue et al 2008 and wei et al 2011 2 5 analytical methods the dewaterability of the abovementioned sludge samples was evaluated in terms of cst and w c briefly the cst was measured using a commercial cst instrument model 304b triton uk which was equipped with a φ18 mm funnel and whatman no 17 chromatography grade paper the w c ts and vs of the sludges were detected following standard methods apha 1998 the concentrations of the extracted polysaccharide pc and protein pn of sludge eps and supernatants were determined using anthrone method and modified lowry method frolund et al 1995 1996 humic acids were the organic components that could be precipitated at ph 2 0 using 6 m hcl for 30 min following the procedures by frolund et al 1996 the dissolved organic carbon doc in the eps was detected by a toc analyzer shimadzu toc 5000 was hpi was and hpo was as well as the conditioned sludges were centrifuged for 10 min 2000 rpm to obtain centrifuged sludge cakes and the amount of total and bound water in the above samples was determined by thermogravimetric analysis tga and differential scanning calorimetry briefly tga thermographs of the sludge cakes were recorded by a thermal analyzer netzsch geratebau germany using pure n2 as the carrier gas the weight loss of the sludge as the temperature increased from 30 to 150 c was regarded as the total amount of w c bound water was determined using a q2000 differential scanning calorimetry analyzer ta usa the calculation of the free water w f and w b contents were performed according to vaxelaire and cezac 2004 and detailed information can be found in the supplementary materials excitation emission matrix eem fluorescence and fourier transform infrared ft ir spectroscopy of sludge eps were conducted using a jasco fp 6500 spectrofluorometer tokyo japan and a perkinelmer spectrometer waltham usa respectively the particle size distribution of the different sludge samples was measured with a laser diffraction particle size analyzer mastersizer 3000 malvern instruments ltd uk the apparent molecular weight m w and number average molecular weight m n distribution of extractable sludge eps was characterized by high performance size exclusion chromatography hpsec with uv detection at 254 nm polydispersity d was calculated as d m w m n laguna et al 2001 detailed information has been included in the supporting information 3 results and discussion 3 1 operational factors affecting sludge filterability during s2o8 2 fe2 oxidation operational parameters such as s2o8 2 dose and molar ratio of s2o8 2 fe2 significantly influenced sludge conditioning guan et al 2011 as shown in fig 1 a increasing n s2o8 2 in mmol g vs from 0 0 blank test to 0 3 to 0 8 significantly decreased the cst value of the was and approached a plateau as n s2o8 2 further increased to 0 9 1 2 mmol g vs however further increasing n s2o8 2 to 1 5 mmol g vs deteriorated the sludge filterability the w c value distribution of the was under varied s2o8 2 doses differed significantly from that of cst briefly an inconspicuous increase in the dry solids content dsc of the sludge was observed when the concentration of s2o8 2 in mmol g vs increased from 0 3 to 0 8 more significantly than the blank test without s2o8 2 fe2 additive however the increase in n s2o8 2 to 0 9 and 1 2 mmol g vs improved the filterability and led to a reduction in the w c value to 89 90 and 87 12 respectively subsequent increases in n s2o8 2 to 1 5 mmol g vs deteriorated the sludge dewatering and led to a sharp decrease in dsc to 5 78 in addition experimental results demonstrated that all possible reductions in cst and dsc occurred within 1 min of reaction which was consistent with the previous observations of liu et al 2016a theoretically dosage increasing of the s2o8 2 promoted the formation of the so4 which contributed to the destruction of the polymeric sludge flocs and releasing of internally bound water luo et al 2018 might be the main reason for the enhancement of sludge filterability with increasing of n s2o8 2 dose nevertheless the recent work of liu et al 2016a also demonstrated that an excessively high dose of s2o8 2 would be converted to a sulfate radical quenching agent when n s2o8 2 reached 0 9 mmol g vs which might be the main reason why the deterioration of sludge filterability was observed when the s2o8 2 dose increased to 1 5 mmol g vs finally an optimal s2o8 2 dose of 1 2 mmol g vs was selected for the subsequent experiments the influence of n s2o8 2 n fe2 on s2o8 2 fe2 oxidation for sludge conditioning was evaluated under a 1 2 mmol g vs s2o8 2 dose and inherent ph and the experimental results are listed in fig 1c and d similar to the observations of zhen et al 2012a and liu et al 2016a a gradual increase in the molar ratio of n s2o8 2 n fe2 from 0 6 to 0 9 efficiently improved the dewatering performance as evidenced by the gradual decline in the cst and dry solids content specifically the maximum reduction of the cst of 58 5 a decrease from 154 8 to 64 3 s was observed under an optimal n s2o8 2 n fe2 ratio of 0 9 finally the experimental parameters of a 1 2 mmol g vs s2o8 2 dose and a n s2o8 2 n fe2 molar ratio of 0 9 were chosen for use in the following tests 3 2 polarities of cultured sludge eps and its effect on sludge filterability during s2o8 2 fe2 oxidation sludge dewatering performance is known to be closely relevant to polarity distribution hydrophobic hydrophilic and eps characteristics of sludge wei et al 2018 li et al 2019 2020 thus the effect of the composition of the eps of was hpo was sodium acetate fed and hpi was glucose fed on the dewatering performance after s2o8 2 fe2 oxidation was analyzed 3 3 polarity distribution of was glucose and sodium acetate fed sludges eps within the was hpo was and hpi was samples were separately extracted using nh4oh and their chemical composition was analyzed using xad resin fractionation as shown in fig 2 a as much as 255 8 303 0 and 449 1 mg g vs eps were extracted from the sodium acetate fed sludge samples a5 a10 and a20 respectively correspondingly the obtained eps of g5 g10 and g20 hpi was were 283 7 277 1 and 343 0 mg g vs respectively whereas 373 2 mg g vs was obtained for the extracted eps of was totally the extractable nh4oh representing 64 7 75 3 of total organic carbon within the sludge samples similar to our previous observation wei et al 2010 the was glucose fed and sodium acetate fed sludge samples exhibited very different polarity distributions which exhibited a declined hpo hpi distribution trend of a20 2 26 a5 1 95 a10 1 85 was 1 45 g5 1 33 g10 1 01 g20 0 75 briefly the average percentages of hpi as bulk doc in the sodium acetate fed samples of a5 a10 and a20 were 25 39 26 34 and 21 08 respectively which were much lower than those of the hpi was samples 27 68 for g5 32 58 for g10 and 37 98 for g20 by contrast the fractional percentages of hpo a in a5 a10 and a20 samples were 38 09 37 64 and 35 16 respectively fig 2b which were higher than those of the glucose fed samples g5 25 43 g10 22 78 and g20 19 97 in addition the average hpo n content of the sodium acetate fed sludge samples was 11 74 whereas that of the glucose fed sludge samples was 10 02 thus we concluded that the sludge samples cultured using glucose as a carbon source were more hydrophilic than those cultured with sodium acetate which exhibited higher hydrophobic characteristics 3 4 effect of eps polarity on sludge filterability during s2o8 2 fe2 oxidation dewaterability behaviors of different sludge samples during s2o8 2 fe2 oxidation were significantly affected by their polarities our experimental results shown in fig 3 clearly revealed that the sodium acetate fed sludge samples hpo was exhibited higher cst and w b values than those of the glucose fed sludge samples hpi was the above results were quite consistent with the previous observation that the more hydrophobic the sludge eps was the greater the degree of polymerization of the sludge flocs and thus the higher content of bound water hong et al 2015 once s2o8 2 fe2 oxidation progressed the cst values of the a5 a10 and a20 samples decreased from 432 5 to 113 2 s 333 3 to 98 4 s and 305 4 to 95 1 s fig 3a with average reduction rates of 73 8 70 5 and 68 9 respectively by contrast the corresponding reductions in cst for glucose fed samples 60 9 64 5 was slightly lower than those of the hpo was samples which might be ascribed to the lower cst values of the g5 g10 and g20 samples 142 1 172 4 s similar to the observation of ye et al 2011 the decreasing trend of w c of the abovementioned sludge samples was similar to that of cst fig 3b exhibiting a decreasing trend of a20 15 23 a10 14 07 a5 12 87 g20 12 12 was 11 19 g10 9 93 g5 9 31 after 20 min of s2o8 2 fe2 oxidation specifically s2o8 2 fe2 treatment led to a more notable decrease in the w b value than in w f 19 27 42 61 vs 3 12 6 07 implying that the intracellular and extracellular bound water of sludge samples could be effectively released during s2o8 2 fe2 oxidation moreover the rate of w b reduction was much higher for the sodium acetate fed hpo was samples 38 88 42 61 than for the glucose fed hpi was samples 19 27 29 20 implying that s2o8 2 fe2 oxidation caused more bound water in hpo was being transformed and released than the other cultivated sludges from the above results we could conclude that a higher content of hydrophobic constituents in sludge eps with higher content of bound water benefited s2o8 2 fe2 oxidation for subsequent dewatering quite consistent with the observation of li et al 2019 similar to the observations of kim et al 2016 and xiong et al 2018 who found that difficult to degrade tb eps instead of soluble lb eps were efficiently destroyed during persulfate oxidation moreover prolonging the cultural srt from 5 to 20 d regardless of the substrate utilized also enhanced the sludge filterability especially for the hpo was samples 3 5 variation in nh4oh extractable solid eps organics during s2o8 2 fe2 oxidation 3 5 1 composition variation of solid sludge organics s2o8 2 fe2 oxidation significantly changed the chemical composition of the sludge especially regarding the organic components in solid eps as shown in fig 4 the doc concentrations of the extractable hydrophobic acid fractions of all six sludge samples decreased significantly after s2o8 2 fe2 oxidation as evidenced by the higher doc removal rate of hpo a 29 1 except g20 than that of the other fractions by contrast the corresponding doc value of the hydrophilic fraction hpi related decreased insignificantly for instance the reduction in doc of the hpi fraction of the glucose fed hpi was samples ranged from 3 50 to 20 09 whereas a noticeable increase in doc was observed for the sodium acetate fed sludge samples 13 85 12 39 and 33 73 for a5 a10 and a20 respectively moreover it is interestingly to note that the doc of hpo n fraction of hpi was samples increase significantly after so4 oxidation 31 93 150 53 whereas that of hpo was decreased slightly 1 19 14 58 implying that partial of the carboxylic groups within the hpo a fractions were destructed and converted to neutral ones above results exhibited that after s2o8 2 fe2 oxidation the doc of hydrophobic fraction of hpo was samples was decreased and doc value of the hydrophilic showed opposite trend zhen et al 2012a and mikkelsen and keiding 2002 revealed that radical oxidation and subsequent destruction of sludge flocs were the predominant pathways for s2o8 2 fe2 conditioning therefore the destruction of the hydrophobic fractions especially those hpo a fractions such as breakage of the carboxylic groups led to an efficient releasing of the bound water and thus an enhancement of sludge dewaterability combined with the removal trends of cst and w c listed in fig 3 we concluded that the disintegration of hydrophobic eps after s2o8 2 fe2 oxidation was more responsible for the liberation of w b than reduced cst or w c values the removal trends of tpi a during s2o8 2 fe2 treatment were quite similar to those of hpo a whereas tpi n fractions was to hpi except g5 and g10 thus the disintegration of flocs destruction of hydrophobic and transitional solid organics and subsequent conversion to low molecular weight components also played a great role in sludge filterability improvement during s2o8 2 fe2 oxidation once s2o8 2 fe2 oxidation progressed the hpo hpi ratio of the six sludge samples decreased in the order of g20 1 32 g5 1 27 a5 1 22 a10 1 12 a20 1 01 g10 0 95 in which the sodium acetate fed hpo was samples a5 a10 and a20 exhibited a more noteworthy decrease 37 4 55 3 than that of the glucose fed ones 4 51 43 2 3 5 2 fractional variation of concentration of protein humic acid and carbohydrate the fractional distributions of proteins carbohydrates and humic acids in the organic solid phase of the different sludge samples were extracted and the results are listed in fig 5 since the chemical characteristics of the sludge samples fed using the same substrate were quite similar to each other thus the sludge samples of a10 and g10 were selected as representative samples and are discussed below chemical characteristics of proteins carbohydrates and humic acids within sludge eps varied widely under polarities changes and a summary of some relevant published literatures with the latest important results on their compositions is presented in table s1 overall both proteins and humic acids were the predominant components of the sodium acetate fed a10 sample fig 5b accounting for as much as 44 25 and 31 66 of the bulk extractable eps respectively whereas that of the carbohydrates 56 01 mg g vs was 18 51 similarly the percentage distribution trend of the eps of was 373 2 mg g vs revealed in fig 5a decreased in the order of proteins 35 32 humic acids 28 87 carbohydrates 23 35 by contrast the humic acids 59 06 mg g vs were found to be the lowest proportion of the nh4oh extractable organics of g10 21 31 followed by carbohydrates 33 18 whereas the highest proportion was that of proteins 41 37 theoretically the higher hydrophobic of the sludge eps the more abundant existence of the humic acid like molecules wang et al 2012b cao et al 2017 thus the relatively low percentage distribution of humic acid might be the main reason for the low hydrophobicity of the glucose fed hpi was previous studies also revealed that higher polymeric proteinaceous substrates played a great role in the formation of the aromatic components of sludge eps especially those eps with a complex molecular weight distribution wang et al 2018 zhang et al 2020 which might be the main reason why such a high content of protein was also observed in the a10 sample the above conclusion could also be supported by the experimental results that relatively high protein and humic acid contents were observed for the hpo a fraction of the was and sodium acetate fed hpo was the hpo a fraction of g10 exhibited a relatively higher carbohydrate content compared to that of the proteins and humic acids a lower oxidation rate of the nh4oh extractable carbohydrates was observed for almost all fractions of eps of the was a10 and g10 samples except hpiwas and hpo na10 revealing that those carbohydrates could not be preferentially oxidized by s2o8 2 fe2 on the other hand solid organics of was related hpo n and g10 related hpo a tpi a and tpi n as well as a10 related tpi a exhibited the highest removals of humic acid among all three selected sludge samples removal rate ranged from 20 89 to 40 01 by contrast hpo awas tpi awas tpi nwas hpig10 hpo ng10 hpia10 hpo aa10 hpo na10 and tpi na10 exhibited the highest reductions in protein content 4 74 41 17 reduction it is interesting to note that the efficient destruction of the proteins and humic acids especially hydrophilic proteins and transitional humic acids important and easily ignored components played a great role in sludge organic destruction during s2o8 2 fe2 oxidation 3 5 3 fractional aromaticity variation of solid sludge organics both the sodium acetate and glucose fed sludge samples exhibited a higher aromaticity expressed as a uv 254 value than that of was ranging from 0 4 to 10 6 and 4 7 10 2 for hpo was and hpi was respectively data in supplementary fig s2 moreover prolonging the cultivation hrt led to a slight increase in the aromaticity of sludge eps regardless of the implemented substrate carbon source variation exhibited a significant effect on the percentage based aromatic distribution of the sludge eps as evidenced by the higher fractional uv 254 contribution of the hydrophobic fractions of hpo was than that of hpi was 67 87 69 25 vs 36 30 37 83 the aromaticity of sodium acetate fed hpo was showed a more significant decrease during so4 oxidation than that of the glucose fed hpo was for instance the uv 254 value of the a5 a10 and a20 samples decreased by 27 73 22 70 and 44 80 respectively when s2o8 2 fe2 oxidation progressed whereas that of the glucose fed samples ranged from 12 36 to 17 33 the above results clearly indicated that aromatic polymers of sludge eps such as lignophenols guaiacyl structures pcbs glutamate dehydrogenase and membrane scaffold proteins lignin hydrophobic amino acids unsaturated fatty chains etc especially for the sodium acetate fed hpo was samples could preferentially react with s2o8 2 fe2 regarding the fractions of eps as much as a 21 25 27 78 reduction of uv 254 values in hpo a was observed for the glucose fed hpi was samples which was slightly lower than that of the a5 and a20 sludge samples which decreased by 26 5 and 45 6 respectively by contrast all of the hpi fractions in hpi was samples changed insignificantly 2 90 6 81 in uv 254 value after s2o8 2 fe2 oxidation whereas that of the hpi in a5 and a10 samples exhibited a noteworthy increase 22 49 for a5 and 19 17 for a10 thus we deduced that some of the destroyed aromatic hydrophobic sludge organics were converted to hydrophilic components especially for hpo was similarly the aromatic components within tpi a and hpo n could also disintegrate during so4 oxidation especially for the more hydrophobic hpo was sodium acetate fed samples combined with the obtained dewatering performance results we concluded that the destruction of aromatic polymeric structures especially those of aromatics within the hydrophobic fractions of sludge eps might be the main reason for the efficient release of bound water during s2o8 2 fe2 oxidation 3 6 variation in supernatant organics of sludge during s2o8 2 fe2 oxidation disintegration degree of sludge samples usually calculated as the ratio between the increase in doc and the tdoc in the supernatant has been widely applied to express the was solubilization efficiency zhen et al 2014 as shown in fig 6 the concentration of soluble organics referred to as seps increased significantly as s2o8 2 fe2 treatment progressed as evidenced by the significant increase in doc of 25 7 for was 292 9 368 1 mg l 132 0 for a10 165 9 384 9 mg l and 112 3 for g10 162 3 344 6 mg l thus disintegration of the flocs especially the extracellular intercellular organics led to a significant release of destroyed eps into the sludge supernatant solid phase to liquid phase generally the hydrophilic fraction of hpi exhibited a much lower release of humic acid ranging from 28 2 to 95 0 compared to that of the hydrophobic fraction 48 5 160 3 for hpo a and 65 3 180 2 for hpo n by contrast the concentration of hpi and tpi n related carbohydrates within the so4 oxidized sludge supernatant increased more dramatically than that of the hydrophobic fractions the above results further prove that the hydrophobic humic acids as well as the hydrophilic transitional carbohydrates could be efficiently destroyed after s2o8 2 fe2 treatment although as high as 124 1 and 95 7 concentration increases in hpi related proteins were observed for a10 and g10 supernatant the much higher increase in hpo a related proteins of a10 137 7 and g10 157 1 implied that hydrophobic proteins could be more easily destroyed during so4 oxidation than hydrophilic proteins it is well recognized that polymeric cell wall control the integrity and colloidal stability of sludge flocs and are closely correlated to the binding capacity of bound water kim et al 2016 additionally recent publication of zhou et al 2014 also pointed out that decreasing the protein content in slime and tb eps would improve sludge filterability hence the significant rupture of hydrophobic eps as well as the releasing of extracellular intercellular proteins is the main reason for the improvement of sludge filterability after s2o8 2 fe2 oxidation in addition the rupture of hydrophilic sludge colloidal flocs especially hydrophilic proteins was also essential for the release of interstitial water which was similar to the observation of wu and chai 2016 3 7 variation in particle size molecular weight distribution of sludge organics during s2o8 2 fe2 oxidation according to mikkelsen 2001 and shao et al 2009 the supracolloidal flocs of sludge organics especially with a particle size 10 μm primary particles have been proven to be an important parameter affecting sludge filterability thus the particle size distribution of the colloidal particles of the was glucose and sodium acetate fed sludge samples was examined here and the results are listed in fig 7 the particle size of was exhibited a major peak centered at 5 25 μm fig 7a as well as weak peaks at approximately 1 00 and 0 13 μm and the oxidation of s2o8 2 fe2 significantly changed their distribution for instance the major peak at 5 25 μm was rapidly reduced with evolving new peaks in smaller sizes including downshifted peaks at approximately 0 06 0 28 0 52 and 4 45 μm except for the major peak at approximately 6 12 μm fig 7b the sodium acetate fed a10 sample also exhibited notable peaks at approximately 1 45 0 44 and 0 07 μm larger than in was the above result was in line with the observation of wang et al 2017 who found that the promotion of sludge dewaterability was accompanied by a significant reduction in particle size moreover it is interestingly to note that s2o8 2 fe2 oxidation led to a perceptible downshift of the molecular size of the a10 and was and produced a large quality of colloidal particles smaller than 1 μm which was quite different from the observation of kim et al 2016 by contrast the glucose fed g10 sample exhibited a less significant variation in the particle size after so4 oxidation than that of a10 further proving that the powerful destruction of high molecular weight components and hydrophobic organics liberation of many cells trapped within sludge was attributed to the release of bound water during s2o8 2 fe2 treatment the above results were partially consistent with the observations of zhen et al 2018 and kim et al 2016 which might be the main reason for the enhancement of sludge dewaterability compared to the glucose fed g10 samples in fig 7c the fragmentation rate of the major colloidal group at approximately 6 12 μm was much faster for the a10 sample the molecular weight distribution of the unfractionated eps and the hpo a and hpi fractions of was a10 and g10 were analyzed and the chromatographic data showed multimodal distributions with apparent molecular weight ranging from 17232 93 to 239476 86 da in supporting information of table s2 specifically the chromatogram of organic compounds extracted from the a10 sample exhibited a much broader distribution than that of the was and g10 samples especially for the hpo a fractions for the different sludge samples the hpo a fraction extracted from a10 sodium acetate fed sludge exhibited a much higher m n and polydispersity value than those of was and g10 indicating the relatively condensed polymerized structure of hpo was correspondingly the m n and polydispersity value of the hpi fraction were the lowest when s2o8 2 fe2 oxidation progressed both of the hpo a related fractions of a10 and g10 exhibited a significant decrease in m w from 203497 6 239476 8 da to 38451 5 94359 5 da and polydispersity from 190 2 273 5 to 78 8 190 1 which was consistent with the molecular size variation obtained above because a high m w m n indicated that organics had a broad m w distribution wang et al 2016 the significant increase in the g10 related hpi fraction clearly indicated the new production of low m w hydrophilic organics of hpi was whereas the change in the m w m n of the hpo was sample was less significant 3 8 spectral and zeta potential variations of sludge organics 3 8 1 eem spectral variation to determine the variation in fluorophores of sludge eps the eem spectra of was hpi was and hpo was before and after s2o8 2 fe2 oxidation were analyzed fig s4 there were five principal eem peaks for sludge organics correlating with the regions i v proposed in chen et al 2015 the description of the regional distribution can be found anywhere and is listed in the supporting information the eps extracted from the sodium acetate fed hpo was exhibited noticeable fluorophores in regions ii iv and v fig s4 referring to the existence of aromatic proteins soluble microbial byproducts smps and fulvic acid like organics the intensities of those fluorophores particularly smp and fulvic acid like components sharply declined as s2o8 2 fe2 oxidation progressed implying that those polymeric cell walls were efficiently destroyed similarly the weak fluorophore intensity in region ii for the sodium acetate fed sludge samples also significantly decreased suggesting that the proteins within hpo was could be partially oxidized the eem spectrum of hpi was exhibited an obvious fluorescence peak at 320 380 400 nm demonstrating that aromatic humic acid like organics were also abundant by contrast the relatively low fluorophore intensity observed for glucose fed samples was related to the insignificant fluorescent behaviors of extra intracellular polysaccharides s2o8 2 fe2 oxidation efficiently decreased the fluorescence intensity of hpi was related humic acid like organics implying that those organics in hydrophilic sludges could be readily destroyed 3 8 2 ft ir spectral variation nh4oh extractable sludge organics from was hpo was hpi was exhibited significant absorption bands at 2960 cm 1 c h vibrations 1730 cm 1 carbonyl co vibrations 1410 cm 1 aliphatic c o and c h vibrations and 621 cm 1 especially for sodium acetate fed hpo was which were ascribed to the abundant existence of aromatic hydrophobic humic acid like components wei et al 2019 correspondingly the spectra of the eps related organics of was hpo was and hpi was also showed noticeable peaks at approximately 1640 1560 and 1220 cm 1 corresponding to the amide i ii and iii groups respectively filip et al 2004 specifically amide ii groups were more abundant in hpo was than in hpi was and amide i groups were abundant in both hpi and hpo was in addition the spectral peaks near 3320 cm 1 o h vibrations 1460 cm 1 c h c h2 and c h3 vibrations and 1040 cm 1 c o vibrations could be assigned to hydrocarbon related organics the intensity increase of spectral peak at approximately 1040 cm 1 for all sludge samples demonstrated that the polysaccharides in sludge eps could not be easily oxidized by s2o8 2 fe2 by contrast the significant decrease in the amide i ii and iii groups protein related of hpo was implied that those amide containing sludge organics could be efficiently degraded whereas the corresponding peak intensities in the spectrum of hpi was exhibited a slight increase the intensities of the noticeable peaks at 1730 and 1410 cm 1 humic acid related of the sludge samples especially for the sodium acetate fed a5 a10 and a20 samples decreased slightly after s2o8 2 fe2 oxidation which was related to the preferential destruction of the bonds of co c o and c h within high molecular weight aromatic organics similarly the recent work of wang et al 2019 revealed that the so4 would attack the sludge flocs and cells and finally decomposed them into micromolecule organics and even inorganics thus liberating eps and cell bound water moreover the degradation of the carboxylic co bond might be another reason for the increasing of the percentage of hpo n within the hpi was consistent with the observation of the doc concentration variation of hpo n during s2o8 2 fe2 oxidation section 3 3 1 3 8 3 zeta potential variation zeta potential variations of the different sludge samples pre and post s2o8 2 fe2 oxidation were measured and the results are listed in the supplementary material fig s5 the wide existence of negatively charged groups such as cooh phosphoric so3h nh2 sh etc led to a relatively low observed zeta potentials for all the experimental sludge samples wang et al 2012a treatment with s2o8 2 fe2 oxidation significantly increased the surface charges of sodium acetate fed hpo was and the zeta potentials of a5 a10 and a20 increased from 27 65 26 92 and 23 32 mv to 16 98 mv 16 29 mv and 11 32 mv respectively by contrast a less significant increment of 25 76 for g5 30 96 for g10 and 43 26 for g20 were respectively observed 38 59 51 46 for sodium acetate fed samples the recent work of wu et al 2017 found that protein gels with sludge can lead to a strong ability to store elastic deformation energy and maintain gel elasticity thus the lower zeta potential increase of hpi was than that of hpo was related to the lower disintegration of polymeric humic acids and proteins which contain negatively charged groups 3 9 potential correlation of polarity characteristics of eps and sludge filterability for dewatering via s2o8 2 fe2 oxidation numerous studies have indicated that the polarity of sludge eps can significantly affect the dewatering performance of sewage sludge he et al 2015 zhang et al 2020 thus the linear correlation between the water content variations divided into δw c δw f and δw b and the percentage distribution of organic compositions ratio of pn pc and removed tochpo to toceps were separately analyzed fig 8 regarding w c the percentage of carbohydrates and the pn pc ratio as well as the removed hpo organics correlated well with the rate of w c decrease δw c with relatively high statistical r2 values of 0 8327 0 6807 and 0 7298 respectively overall a negative regression slope of the carbohydrate content to the filterability improvement revealed that the abundant existence of carbohydrates would deteriorate the dewatering performance by contrast the statistical r2 values of δw f and sludge polarity parameters tochpo removed pn pc and percentages of pc and pn were quite low r2 0 1547 except for the percentage distributions of humic acid and hydrophobic organic with r2 values ranging from 0 5485 to 0 6713 implying that the release of free water during so4 oxidation was closely related to the destruction of hydrophobic organics especially humic acids consistent with the previous work of dai et al 2018 for the intracellular and eps captured w b a strong linear relationship between the δw b and all parameters listed above was observed r2 0 5718 except that of the protein content specifically the negative slope of δw b vs carbohydrates 1 2758 more negative than that of δw c vs carbohydrates 0 2943 further demonstrated that increasing the hydrophilic carbohydrate content in sludge samples adversely affected the dewatering of bound water however the disintegration of hydrophobic organics such as humic acid and polymeric proteinaceous substrates benefited s2o8 2 fe2 conditioning in addition increasing pn pc ratio also played a positive role in bound water release based on the above information we strongly recommended using s2o8 2 fe2 oxidation to facilitate the filterability of sludge samples with a relatively high hydrophobic content and pn pc ratio and a low carbohydrate percentage 4 conclusions s2o8 2 fe2 pretreatment efficiently improved sludge filterability especially for sludges with relatively high hydrophobic characteristics the generated sulfate radicals preferentially attacked the hydrophobic proteins and humic acids over carbohydrates more hydrophilic and led to a more significant decrease in bound water than in free water rupturing of sludge flocs and extracellular intercellular sludge organics led to a significant release of the hydrophilic transitional carbohydrates and hydrophobic humic acids into the sludge supernatant as well as proteins regardless of their polarity a perceptible molecular weight downshift was observed for both hpi was and hpo was and a large quantity of colloidal particles smaller than 1 μm were observed after oxidation moreover high content of hydrophilic carbohydrates in sludge samples adversely affected the dewatering of bound water during s2o8 2 fe2 oxidation whereas disintegration of hydrophobic organics such as polymeric proteinaceous substrates and humic acids benefited s2o8 2 fe2 conditioning thus we strongly recommended the use of s2o8 2 fe2 oxidation to facilitate the filterability of sludge with a relatively high hydrophobic content and pn pc ratio but a low carbohydrate percentage declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have
