6885,groundwater overdraft due to extensive irrigation has led to a shallow aquifer depletion crisis in the haihe river basin quantitative simulation of the variations in shallow groundwater and crop yield under different conditions of limited exploitation using a distributed hydrological model is important in the well irrigated plain of this basin based on multiple modeling experiments by a modified soil and water assessment tool swat model three limited irrigation schemes for winter wheat triticum aestivum l were selected as simulation scenarios the simulated results using the swat model showed that under scenario 1 applying two rounds of irrigation corresponding to the jointing and heading stages of winter wheat the average rate of decline in the shallow groundwater table was approximately 2 3 of that under the basic scenario current irrigation schedule but the winter wheat yield decreased by 13 compared with the basic scenario under scenario 2 applying one round of irrigation at the jointing stage of winter wheat the average rate of decline in the shallow groundwater table was approximately 1 4 of that under the basic scenario but the reduction in the winter wheat yield compared with the basic scenario increased to 28 the amount of overexploited shallow groundwater in the cropland area decreased from 17 5 108 m3 a 1 under the basic scenario to 11 0 108 m3 a 1 under scenario 1 and 4 5 108 m3 a 1 under scenario 2 under scenario 3 rain fed conditions during the winter wheat season the regional variation in the shallow groundwater table shifted to a recovery trend with an average rate of 0 22 m a 1 which was equivalent to restoring 3 5 108 m3 a 1 of shallow aquifer storage in the cropland area however the reduction in the winter wheat yield compared with the basic scenario reached 54 under the rain fed scheme considering the trade off between groundwater conservation and crop production under limited exploitation linear programming was used to optimize the irrigation schedule at the subbasin scale as a result to satisfy the constraint of stopping groundwater drawdown the average minimal reduction in the winter wheat yield would be 42 under the optimal irrigation schedule by contrast to satisfy the constraint of restricting the reduction in the crop yield to within the threshold required to maintain winter wheat self sufficiency the minimal rate of decline in the shallow groundwater table would be 0 26 0 52 m a 1 under the optimal irrigation schedule in addition the uncertainty in the simulated shallow groundwater variation in this study was acceptable indicating that the above assessments could provide reasonable references for regional groundwater management keywords shallow groundwater crop yield limited irrigation schedule swat model simulation optimization trade off 1 introduction groundwater a crucial freshwater resource is an important irrigation source for cropland in well irrigated regions maidment 1993 siebert et al 2010 however in recent years groundwater depletion has become a global concern as a result of unsustainable overexploitation wada et al 2012 famiglietti 2014 dalin et al 2017 the problems resulting from groundwater depletion not only include eco environmental crises e g wetland shrinkage land subsidence and land desertification but also involve effects on food security and the grain trade brown 2011 scanlon et al 2012 in particular the haihe river basin in china constitutes one of the most typical regions worldwide that is facing a dilemma between groundwater depletion and crop production demand wada et al 2010 zheng et al 2010 werner et al 2013 in the piedmont plain of mount taihang in hebei province which is located in this basin fig 1 the shallow groundwater table is declining dramatically according to long term monitoring data and assessment results chen 1999 zhang and li 2005 ren et al 2007 cgs 2009 zhang and fei 2009 related studies have indicated that the high demand for irrigation water which is pumped from a shallow aquifer to maintain the production of winter wheat triticum aestivum l is the primary cause of overexploitation in this region zhang et al 2000 ren et al 2007 wang 2010 zhang et al 2016 simulated the spatiotemporal variations of shallow groundwater in this well irrigated plain the results of which showed that the shallow aquifer in this groundwater fed plain may face a depletion crisis within the next 80 years under the current irrigation schedule therefore certain measures to restrict the exploitation intensity of irrigation should be implemented immediately to control the groundwater overdraft trend during the past four years the chinese government has released a series of policies that focus on limiting and reducing the amounts of shallow groundwater exploitation in this well irrigated plain the people s government of hebei province 2014 the state council of the people s republic of china 2015 2016 2017 however the crop yield especially the yield of winter wheat which is strongly dependent on well irrigation would be consequently impacted qiu 2010 the people s government of hebei province 2014 therefore alternative strategies that consider the trade off between groundwater conservation and crop production are of absolute necessity in this region to provide reasonable plans for water management it is essential and critical to quantitatively assess the variations in shallow groundwater and crop yield under different limited exploitation scenarios at the luancheng agro ecosystem experimental station which is located in the northern part of the study area researchers have conducted field experiments on the responses of the yield and water use efficiency wue of winter wheat under different limited irrigation strategies zhang et al 2003 zhang et al 2006 shao et al 2009 chen et al 2014 sun et al 2014 zhang et al 2017 however little research has been devoted to predicting the long term effects of different limited irrigation schemes at the regional scale a distributed hydrological model which could consider the heterogeneity of the underlying surface accounts for the limitations in the spatiotemporal scale of field experiments the soil and water assessment tool swat arnold et al 1998 arnold and fohrer 2005 has been proven an effective hydrological model for assessing irrigation impacts and irrigation best management practice bmp scenarios around the world arnold and allen 1996 gassman et al 2007 luo et al 2008 liu et al 2010 garg et al 2012 sun and ren 2014 this model includes a groundwater module which enables the simulation of the soil plant atmosphere continuum spac in conjunction with the underground hydrology but there is still a lack of applications for modeling long term groundwater table fluctuations changes in aquifer storage and crop yields under limited irrigation scenarios moreover the published studies that focused on deficit irrigation schedules and the critical growth stage at which water is required during the winter wheat growing season were based on crop physiology and aimed to achieve maximum yield or wue wang 2011 li and yang 2017 zhang et al 2017 few studies have compared variations in shallow groundwater under multiple practices of applying irrigation at different growth stages of winter wheat however as one of the most seriously overexploited shallow groundwater regions in the world the well irrigated plain in the haihe river basin is in urgent need of quantitative predictions of groundwater variation as well as crop yield reduction under different irrigation intensities therefore based on a groundwater module enhanced swat model that was established for this well irrigated plain zhang et al 2016 this study was conducted to explore assess and optimize the limited irrigation schemes for winter wheat through quantitative simulations this work constitutes not only an extended application of our modified swat model but also a specific assessment of the variations in shallow groundwater and crop yields under limited irrigation conditions which could be beneficial for current water management practices the objectives of this study are to 1 identify reasonable limited irrigation schemes for winter wheat that could balance groundwater regime and crop yield as modeling scenarios 2 conduct detailed simulations under these selected scenarios to quantitatively assess the extent to which shallow groundwater depletion may decrease and to determine how the winter wheat yield may change under different limited irrigation schemes and 3 explore optimal irrigation schedules for winter wheat considering the trade off between groundwater conservation and crop production to provide alternative plans for sustainable groundwater management 2 materials and methods 2 1 the study area this study focuses on the shallow groundwater fed agricultural region of the haihe river basin this area is a piedmont plain bound by the taihang mountains to the west fig 1 and it includes 48 counties of hebei province with an area of 22 753 km2 which accounts for approximately 18 of the haihe plain cropland is the dominant land use type in this region and the average cultivation ratio has been maintained at 80 since the 1990s hebei provincial bureau of statistics 1995 2014 the winter wheat summer maize zea mays l double cropping system is the predominant planting pattern hebei provincial bureau of statistics 1995 2014 the natural conditions of the study area have resulted in this being a major agricultural production region in hebei province li et al 2014 li and yang 2017 this area features a semi arid semi humid continental monsoon climate with an annual precipitation of 450 550 mm while the precipitation is uneven in space and time over 70 of the rainfall occurs during the summer season june august the estimated evapotranspiration during one winter wheat growing season in the study area is approximately 450 mm far in excess of the average precipitation of 130 mm which indicates that irrigation is quite important for this winter crop zhang et al 2006 during the past 20 years over 90 of the water supply for irrigation has been pumped from the shallow aquifer in this region hebei provincial department of water resources 1990 2012 as a result all croplands in the study area are located in areas with overexploited shallow groundwater the general office of the hebei people s government 2014 limited irrigation schemes will certainly become an important measure to reduce shallow groundwater exploitation and maintain the sustainability of the shallow aquifer in this study we concentrated on the limited irrigation schemes for winter wheat because precipitation is almost sufficient during the summer maize growing season therefore limited irrigation in this study refers specifically to reducing the irrigation frequency and the irrigation quota during the winter wheat growing season 2 2 the established swat model the basic version of swat does not include an equation for simulating the groundwater table depth and thus it cannot be used to directly evaluate the impact of irrigation withdrawals on groundwater table fluctuations hence we modified the shallow groundwater module of swat and applied it to a well irrigated plain in the haihe river basin i e the study area in this paper and the details of this modification are described in zhang et al 2016 this groundwater module enhanced and calibrated swat model was also used to conduct further simulations under different limited irrigation scenarios to devise recommended irrigation strategies in this study similar to the work of zhang et al 2016 the simulation period was set as 1990 2012 the first three years served as the preheating time and the 1993 2012 period was used for the analysis moreover as in zhang et al 2016 the simulation results were calculated relative to two hydrological regions i e the dianxi plain of the daqing river basin dxp and the plain of the ziya river basin zyhp to provide a convenient water management reference the detailed technical processes in this study are shown in fig 2 2 3 modeling experimental design according to the field experiments in the study area the critical growth stages at which water is required during the winter wheat growing season are the overwintering jointing heading and filling stages zhang et al 2003 chen et al 2014 sun et al 2014 zhang et al 2017 in addition according to the historical irrigation schedule which was generalized based on the crop water requirement and precipitation farmers in the study area generally applied irrigation during these four winter wheat growing stages sun and ren 2014 to prioritize these four winter wheat growth stages for irrigation and to select reasonable limited irrigation schemes as the simulation scenarios at the regional scale two sets of modeling experiments using the swat model were designed specifically the first set of modeling experiments involved applying one round of irrigation at one of these four winter wheat growth stages and the irrigation norm was set to 75 mm uniformly i e each round of irrigation involved the same irrigation norm but occurred on different dates based on the results regarding the growth stage priorities for irrigation provided by the first set of modeling experiments the second set of modeling experiments involved zero i0 one i1 two i2 three i3 and four i4 rounds of irrigation during the winter wheat growing season similarly the irrigation norm for each irrigation frequency was also set to 75 mm in addition these two sets of modeling experiments were both conducted during the period of 1993 2012 2 4 simulation scenario settings based on a comparison between the variations in the shallow groundwater and crop yield from the above modeling experiments and in reference to field experiments and national policy the people s government of hebei province 2014 zhang personal communication 2015 specific limited irrigation schemes for winter wheat were selected and established as scenarios in the swat model to conduct detailed simulations the irrigation schemes for summer maize under different scenarios were set to be the same as the current irrigation schedule sun and ren 2014 2 5 optimization of the irrigation schedule both positive and negative effects on groundwater conservation and crop production might be observed if all subbasins adopt the same irrigation scheme throughout the 20 year period therefore we explored an optimized group of multiple winter wheat irrigation schemes under different precipitation conditions to balance the groundwater depletion against crop yield reduction specifically the optimization involved two aspects one assumed that stopping shallow groundwater drawdown was the constraint and that minimizing the reduction in winter wheat yield was the objective the other aspect assumed that restricting the reduction in the winter wheat yield was the constraint and that minimizing the rate of decline in the shallow groundwater table was the objective fig 2 the 0 1 linear programming formulation a classical and robust optimization approach was used to conduct the optimization in each subbasin 3 results and discussion 3 1 results of modeling experiments 3 1 1 prioritizing the winter wheat growth stages in the irrigation scheme the highest winter wheat yield in all 22 subbasins see fig 1 was observed in response to irrigation applied at the jointing stage followed by irrigation applied at the heading stage fig 3 which was in agreement with the results of field experiments and the model ranking of a water sensitivity index zhang et al 2001 pan 2011 for the subbasins in the southern part of the study area irrigation applied at the overwintering stage was more important for the winter wheat yield than irrigation applied at the filling stage because in these subbasins exceptionally low precipitation during the summer maize season was more likely to occur thereby reducing the soil water content at the seeding time of winter wheat under this condition irrigation applied at the overwintering stage of the winter wheat growing season could relieve the water stress to a large extent jia and guo 2009 showed that precipitation during july and august in the southern part of the study area was less than that in the northern region consistent with the above analysis to some extent the yields of summer maize under different winter wheat irrigation treatments were also compared to obtain higher summer maize yields in most of the subbasins the priority ranking of the winter wheat growth stages for irrigation should be the filling stage followed by the heading jointing and overwintering stages fig 3 the reason is that if the irrigation date is closer to the harvest time of winter wheat the soil water content is more beneficial to the growth of summer maize overall considering the crop yield in a double cropping system i e the total yield of winter wheat and summer maize irrigation applied to winter wheat should be prioritized in the following sequence for all subbasins jointing heading filling and overwintering stages fig 3 however if the effects of irrigation pumping on shallow groundwater are considered the lowest decline rate of the groundwater table occurred when irrigation was applied at the overwintering stage followed by the filling stage in all subbasins fig 3 this result indicated that the priority ranking of the winter wheat growth stages for irrigation with the aim of reducing groundwater depletion was the opposite of that with the aim of obtaining a higher crop yield the reason for this result is that if irrigation water is readily taken up by crop roots it contributes more to crop yield and less to groundwater recharge under the condition of the same amount of exploitation a greater depletion of shallow groundwater occurs as a result a contradiction therefore exists between prioritizing the timing of winter wheat irrigation aimed at the groundwater regime and that aimed at the crop yield consequently crop groundwater productivity cgwp which was defined as the ratio of the variation in winter wheat yield between irrigated and rain fed conditions relative to groundwater depletion zhang et al 2016 was used to identify a compromise that could balance the changes in groundwater and crop yield to be specific cgwp1 was defined as the ratio of the variation in winter wheat yield between irrigated and rain fed conditions relative to the change in shallow groundwater table depth and cgwp2 was defined as the ratio of the variation in winter wheat yield between irrigated and rain fed conditions relative to the change in shallow aquifer water storage zhang et al 2016 a higher cgwp indicates that irrigation pumping induced less groundwater depletion and produced a larger increase in crop yield to increase the crop yield by exploiting groundwater to a greater degree winter wheat irrigation should be prioritized sequentially as follows for four of the subbasins dx1 dx2 dx3 and dx9 jointing heading filling and overwintering stages for the other eighteen subbasins winter wheat irrigation should be prioritized sequentially as follows jointing heading overwintering and filling stages fig 3 this spatial difference occurred because the average winter wheat yield under filling stage irrigation was 234 kg ha 1 higher than that under overwintering stage irrigation in the four subbasins in contrast in the other eighteen subbasins the difference in winter wheat yield between irrigation during these two growing stages was on average 64 kg ha 1 comprehensively considering the groundwater and crop yield we chose the sequence of winter wheat growth stages aimed at higher cgwp to design the further modeling experiments with different irrigation frequencies 3 1 2 results of modeling experiments with different irrigation frequencies based on the results in the previous section the second set of modeling experiments was carried out under the following five irrigation schemes of winter wheat treatment i4 applying four rounds of irrigation corresponding to the overwintering jointing heading and filling stages treatment i3 applying three rounds of irrigation corresponding to the overwintering jointing and heading stages or the jointing heading and filling stages treatment i2 applying two rounds of irrigation corresponding to the jointing and heading stages treatment i1 applying one round of irrigation at the jointing stage and treatment i0 rain fed condition the average yields of winter wheat were 2624 kg ha 1 4144 kg ha 1 4986 kg ha 1 5348 kg ha 1 and 5617 kg ha 1 under the i0 i1 i2 i3 and i4 treatments respectively fig 4 the winter wheat yields increased by approximately 60 and 20 from the i0 treatment to the i1 treatment and from the i1 treatment to the i2 treatment respectively in contrast the yields increased by only 7 and 5 from the i2 treatment to the i3 treatment and from the i3 treatment to the i4 treatment respectively based on the field experiments conducted at luancheng station during 2008 2015 zhang et al 2017 showed that the average winter wheat yield improvement associated with the addition of one more irrigation event was 44 7 between i0 and i1 13 1 between i1 and i2 1 8 between i2 and i3 and less than 0 5 between i3 and i4 although the irrigation quota and irrigation date were not exactly the same between zhang et al 2017 and our modeling experiments if the simulated shallow groundwater table exhibited an increasing trend or if the cumulative decline over the 20 year period was less than 1 m groundwater drawdown was assumed to have stopped the results showed that this condition occurred in nineteen subbasins two subbasins and one subbasin under the i0 i1 and i2 treatments respectively however under the i3 and i4 treatments the shallow groundwater in all 22 subbasins still presented a drawdown trend fig 4 additionally in all subbasins the highest cgwp occurred under the i1 treatment followed by the i2 i3 and i4 treatments fig 4 as a whole the i1 and i2 treatments had a relatively high utilization efficiency of shallow groundwater while increasing the winter wheat yield 3 2 scenario analysis comprehensively considering the changes in crop yields the variations in the shallow groundwater table and the differences in the cgwp of the modeling experiments i0 i1 and i2 were selected as the three scenarios for further simulations the detailed scenario settings are listed in table 1 here the basic scenario which is related to the current i e farmers historical cropping system and irrigation schedule see zhang et al 2016 was used to reproduce the spatiotemporal variations of the shallow groundwater and crop yields for the period of 1993 2012 3 2 1 shallow aquifer storage and shallow groundwater table depth according to the abovementioned scenario settings the annual irrigation pumping amounted to 397 22 mm 192 18 mm 117 18 mm and 42 18 mm under the basic scenario and scenarios 1 2 and 3 respectively the simulation results showed that the corresponding annual shallow groundwater recharge under these four scenarios was 237 68 mm 101 58 mm 85 53 mm and 76 52 mm here similar to the work of zhang et al 2016 the precipitation exceedance probability pep for each subbasin during the simulation period was calculated for each crop growing season and civil year using an empirical frequency analysis method see brutsaert 2005 according to the 1970 2012 rainfall data obtained from 22 weather stations fig 1 in this paper based on the pep value of a winter wheat or summer maize growing season the precipitation condition was classified as follows pep 25 indicated a wet season 25 pep 75 indicated a normal season 75 pep 95 indicated a dry season and pep 95 indicated an extremely dry season similarly wet normal dry and extremely dry years in this paper indicated that the pep value of a civil year was within the above four ranges respectively it should be noted that in reference to our previous work sun and ren 2013 2014 zhang et al 2016 which considered the coherence with farmers historical irrigation schedule in the study area see hebei irrigation center experiment station 1988 collaborative group for water demand contour map of major crop in china 1993 the simulated results of wet seasons years in this paper were merged with those of normal seasons years with regard to the statistics and analysis hereinafter fig 5 shows the simulated results of shallow groundwater balance under different precipitation conditions during the 20 years under scenario 1 the average annual change in the shallow aquifer storage was 96 mm which indicated a depletion trend under scenario 2 the regional shallow aquifer storage changed by an average of 15 mm during a normal year this change was approximately 6 mm in the dxp which indicated that the irrigation scheme of this scenario could nearly achieve shallow groundwater equilibrium in most years in this hydrological region however the shallow aquifer storage in the study area changed by an average of 94 mm during a dry or extremely dry year under scenario 2 indicating an overexploitation trend under scenario 3 the regional shallow aquifer storage displayed a recovery trend with an average rate of 30 mm a 1 which would reverse the depletion trend of the shallow aquifer in this well irrigated plain the average decline rates of the shallow groundwater table under the basic scenario and scenarios 1 and 2 were 1 10 m a 1 0 70 m a 1 and 0 28 m a 1 respectively under scenario 1 except for three subbasins that were located in the zyhp all cropland in the study area presented a shallow groundwater table decline rate that was less than 1 0 m a 1 fig 6 b this spatial difference might be caused by the relatively small calibrated specific yield of the shallow aquifer in these three subbasins i e zy2 zy6 and zy7 thus the variations in the shallow groundwater table in these subbasins might be more dramatic than those in other subbasins with the same depletion of shallow aquifer storage a hydrogeological survey in the study area showed that the specific yield of the shallow aquifer in the region of subbasins zy2 zy6 and zy7 was indeed smaller than that of the adjacent area zhang and fei 2009 therefore to minimize groundwater exploitation greater pumping amounts for irrigation in these regions should be reduced to slow the rate of decline in the shallow groundwater table under scenario 2 except for two subbasins the shallow groundwater table in the study area still presented a downward trend but the decline rate was significantly lower than that under the basic scenario a total of sixteen subbasins had a decline rate less than 0 5 m a 1 under scenario 2 which indicated an obvious deceleration in the groundwater drawdown fig 6c under scenario 3 the shallow groundwater table in most of the subbasins presented a recovery trend with an average rate of 0 06 0 71 m a 1 fig 6d however in subbasins dx6 zy2 zy4 and zy7 the shallow groundwater table exhibited a declining trend under this scenario this declining trend was caused by the limited lateral recharge in these subbasins which are far from mount taihang these four subbasins might represent target regions where further measures should be implemented to stop the depletion of shallow groundwater based on the area of well irrigated cropland hebei provincial department of water resources 1990 2012 the shallow aquifer storage changes under different scenarios were converted to volumes zhang et al 2016 indicated that under the basic scenario the cumulative overexploitation rate of shallow groundwater in the study area was 17 5 108 m3 a 1 fig 7 a under scenario 1 approximately 82 of the well irrigated cropland experienced a 10 20 m decline in the groundwater table from 1993 to 2012 leading to overexploitation at a rate of 8 8 108 m3 a 1 and the remaining 18 of the well irrigated cropland exhibited a total overexploitation rate of 2 2 108 m3 a 1 fig 7b under scenario 2 the proportion of well irrigated cropland in which the water table declined by 10 20 m from 1993 to 2012 decreased to only 10 and the corresponding groundwater overexploitation rate decreased to 0 8 108 m3 a 1 under this scenario approximately 88 of the well irrigated cropland experienced a decline of less than 10 m from 1993 to 2012 leading to overexploitation at a rate of 3 7 108 m3 a 1 furthermore 2 area of the well irrigated cropland presented a recovery trend in the water table from 1993 to 2012 leading to a recovery rate of 0 04 108 m3 a 1 fig 7c under scenario 3 approximately 12 of the well irrigated cropland presented a declining trend in the water table leading to overexploitation at a rate of 0 1 108 m3 a 1 and the other 88 of the well irrigated cropland presented a recovery trend in the water table leading to a recovery rate of 3 6 108 m3 a 1 the scenario simulations in this paper were conducted based on a previously established swat model zhang et al 2016 which was calibrated using observational data on the shallow groundwater table however the calibrated parameters in the groundwater module for the best simulation reflected the fluctuations in the shallow groundwater table under current irrigation practices i e the basic scenario when applying these parameters in the limited irrigation scenarios some uncertainties might exist because some parameters might be affected by shallow groundwater variations specifically the following four parameters would theoretically be influenced by changes in the irrigation scenarios the deep aquifer percolation fraction rechrg dp the amount of lateral recharge from mountainous area entering into the aquifer larchrg the groundwater delay time from the lowest depth of the soil profile to the shallow aquifer gw delay and the specific yield of the shallow aquifer gwspyld therefore the uncertainties associated with adopting these calibrated parameters under limited exploitation conditions are preliminarily discussed below according to zhang et al 2016 the percolation of groundwater to the deep aquifer accounted for only 1 of the total recharge under the basic scenario which was in agreement with the groundwater resources assessment results cgs 2009 thus this parameter i e rechrg dp should have little impact on the simulated shallow groundwater table under the changing scenarios the larchrg a new parameter in the groundwater module added by zhang et al 2016 was allocated by the downscaling method i e unit discharge and linear approximation from the regional level according to the assessment results of the haihe river basin ren et al 2007 in ren et al 2007 the lateral recharge was calculated based on darcy s law therefore with the reduction in the rate of the shallow groundwater table decline under limited exploitation conditions the hydraulic gradient decreased on one hand and the thickness of the calculated aquifer cross section increased on the other hand if the average hydraulic conductivity of shallow aquifer was assumed to be invariant from a qualitative or semi quantitative view the larchrg could be considered to change little under the different scenarios in theory the parameter gw delay should be lower in the limited irrigation scenarios than in the basic scenario due to the decrease in the average shallow groundwater table depth during the simulation period however the effects of the decrease in gw delay on the simulated shallow groundwater variations differed depending on the analyzed time scale according to the previously simulated results using the optimal value of calibrated gw delay in zhang et al 2016 the ratio of the average shallow groundwater table depth during the 20 years under the three limited irrigation scenarios to that under the basic scenario was in the range of 50 100 therefore assuming that the relationship between gw delay and the average shallow groundwater table depth was linear a sensitivity analysis with a 50 disturbance in gw delay was carried out to explore the most extreme uncertainties the results showed that although the average relative error re of the simulated shallow groundwater variations associated with a gw delay disturbance of 50 relative to the corresponding results associated with the original gw delay was approximately 10 at the daily scale fig 8 this value changed to approximately 5 at the monthly scale fig 8 according to the calculated results the average res of the simulated shallow groundwater variations with the gw delay before and after a 50 disturbance at the crop growing season scale yearly scale average five year scale average ten year scale and average twenty year scale were 6 95 1 45 0 25 1 40 and 0 07 respectively and the probabilities that the re was in the range from 5 to 5 at these corresponding time scales were 63 66 92 95 and 98 respectively fig 8 in this study the assessments of the shallow groundwater variation were based on the average results of several crop growing seasons several years or even the full 20 year period therefore for the analysis time scale in this study the uncertainties introduced by the gw delay parameter were acceptable indicating that the simulated results provided by this study should be reasonable for practical management practices based on the research of zhang and zhang 1983 the differences between the specific yield and void ratio in shallow groundwater depletion and recovery processes could be neglected therefore the calibrated gwspyld could reflect the comprehensive water storage and release capacity of the shallow aquifer within the groundwater table fluctuation zone over 20 years under the basic scenario in the limited irrigation scenarios the dynamics of the shallow groundwater table were still mostly within the range of this fluctuation zone which implied that the calibrated gwspyld was relatively acceptable in this study 3 2 2 soil water balance and water management response indicators compared with the basic scenario the water balance components of the soil profile 2 m deep changed to different degrees under the three limited irrigation scenarios fig s1 in the supplementary material to quantitatively evaluate the impacts of different water management scenarios on the irrigation performance six water management response indicators wmris derived from related studies singh and singh 1997 van dam and malik 2003 were calculated and compared table 2 the results showed that the reduction in the amount of irrigation pumping during the winter wheat growing season under the three limited irrigation scenarios relative to the basic scenario was over 58 whereas the corresponding reduction in the actual evapotranspiration eta was in the range of 19 51 fig s1 in the supplementary material this implied that winter wheat absorbed more water from the root zone under scenarios 1 2 and 3 as a consequence the soil water storage during the winter wheat growing season changed from a positive balance i e an increase of 3 7 mm under the basic scenario to a negative balance i e decreases of 21 5 mm 44 1 mm and 51 3 mm under scenarios 1 2 and 3 respectively moreover during the winter wheat growing season the percolation index decreased from 0 25 under the basic scenario to 0 02 under scenarios 1 2 and 3 and the transpiration efficiency increased from 0 53 under the basic scenario to 0 85 under scenarios 1 2 and 3 table 2 these changes indicated that the effects of precipitation and irrigation on the growth of winter wheat improved under the three limited irrigation scenarios the limited irrigation schemes for winter wheat would affected the soil water balance during the summer maize growing season the percolation and runoff during the summer maize growing season were 25 51 and 16 31 lower respectively under the limited irrigation schemes than under the basic scenario fig s1 in the supplementary material in addition the soil water storage during the summer maize growing season changed from a negative balance i e a decrease of 5 8 mm under the basic scenario to a positive balance i e increases of 21 1 mm 43 4 mm and 50 5 mm under scenarios 1 2 and 3 respectively these changes were caused by the lower soil water storage during the winter wheat harvesting stage under the limited irrigation scenarios which facilitated the storage of summer precipitation in the soil water reservoir according to the results calculated at the annual scale the change in the soil water storage was close to zero under the three limited irrigation scenarios table 2 implying that the soil profile would not dry out if the selected limited irrigation schemes were implemented in the study area additionally in comparison with the basic scenario the utilization of the soil water reservoir improved under scenarios 1 2 and 3 according to the results of irrigation contribution and rainfall contribution the cropland also made better use of the precipitation for eta under the three limited irrigation scenarios table 2 indicating an important water saving effect for this water scarce region moreover compared with the basic scenario the proportion of percolation relative to the total discharge in the soil water budget decreased from 23 to 8 10 under the three limited irrigation scenarios fig s1 in the supplementary material this finding not only indicated an improvement in crop water use but also implied a reduced risk of non point pollution in shallow groundwater 3 2 3 crop yield and crop water productivity simulated results showed that the regional average yields of winter wheat during the 20 years were 5725 600 kg ha 1 4986 744 kg ha 1 4114 868 kg ha 1 and 2624 918 kg ha 1 under the basic scenario and scenarios 1 2 and 3 respectively in comparison with the basic scenario the reductions in winter wheat yield in scenarios 1 and 2 were less than 40 under all precipitation conditions table 3 however in scenario 3 compared with the basic scenario the yield decreased by more than 50 under all precipitation conditions which indicated that more than half of the winter wheat yield would be lost in this scenario table 3 crop water productivity cwp is defined as crop yield relative to seasonal water use i e eta and it is an important indicator for analyzing the relationship between water and food production droogers and bastiaanssen 2002 kijne et al 2003 van dam et al 2006 compared with the results obtained under the basic scenario the cwp of winter wheat increased by an average of 6 12 and 18 in normal dry and extremely dry seasons respectively under scenario 1 and by 5 11 and 18 under scenario 2 table 3 however under scenario 3 the cwp of winter wheat in normal and dry seasons decreased by 3 7 in comparison with the basic scenario table 3 compared with the basic scenario the changes in the yield of summer maize eta during the summer maize growing season and cwp of summer maize under the three limited irrigation scenarios were less than 2 which could be considered constant to some extent 3 2 4 effects of mitigating groundwater depletion under the limited irrigation scenarios based on the well irrigated area the effects on shallow groundwater drawdown mitigation agricultural water saving and crop yield of the three limited irrigation scenarios were calculated at the hydrological region level for water management purposes table 4 under scenarios 1 2 and 3 the amounts of irrigation pumping in the well irrigated cropland area decreased by approximately 50 70 and 90 respectively compared with the basic scenario additionally under scenarios 1 and 2 the depletion rates of the shallow aquifer storage in the well irrigated cropland area decreased by approximately 37 and 75 respectively in comparison by basic scenario under scenario 3 the shallow aquifer storage changed from a depletion state i e a rate of 17 5 108 m3 a 1 under the basic scenario to a recovery state i e a rate of 3 5 108 m3 a 1 during the 20 year period which implied that the groundwater recession could be not only stopped but also reversed under the scenario involving a rain fed watering strategy during the winter wheat growing season in general the effects of the three limited irrigation scenarios on mitigating groundwater depletion were better in the northern hydrological region table 4 in comparison with the basic scenario the annual eta in the well irrigated cropland under scenarios 1 2 and 3 decreased by 66 mm 118 mm and 185 mm respectively which corresponded to a decrease in water consumption of 10 18 and 29 however as a cost of the water saving effect the average winter wheat yield under scenarios 1 2 and 3 decreased by approximately 13 28 and 54 respectively compared with the basic scenario in comparison with the basic scenario the average changes in the cwp of winter wheat under scenarios 1 2 and 3 were 0 12 kg m 3 0 10 kg m 3 and 0 10 kg m 3 respectively which implied that the efficiency of well irrigation could remain stable under the limited irrigation schemes 3 3 optimal irrigation schedules for winter wheat the decision variables in the 0 1 linear programming formulation are provided in supplementary material section s1 and table s1 3 3 1 under the constraint of stopping groundwater drawdown here it was assumed that if the cumulative decline in the shallow groundwater table during the 20 year period was less than 1 m or if the shallow groundwater table presented a recovery trend the shallow groundwater drawdown had stopped based on the calculation process presented in supplementary material eqs s1 and s2 the irrigation schedules that could minimize winter wheat yield loss under this groundwater constraint were optimized in each subbasin as a result in winter wheat growing seasons with a pep of less than 75 i e normal seasons the rain fed irrigation scheme should be adopted in seventeen subbasins fig 9 additionally in winter wheat growing seasons with a pep exceeding 75 i e dry and extremely dry seasons the optimal irrigation scheme was spatially more diverse fig 9 in particular for subbasins zy2 zy4 and zy7 even if the winter wheat rain fed irrigation scheme was consecutively implemented for 20 years the shallow groundwater still presented a drawdown trend this result indicated that there was no feasible solution to stop shallow groundwater drawdown in these three subbasins the optimal irrigation schedules for the 22 subbasins were incorporated into the swat model to conduct further simulations the results showed that in order to reach shallow groundwater equilibrium the amount of irrigation pumping in dxp and zyhp should be reduced by 75 and 80 respectively compared with the basic scenario these values are equivalent to a reduction in groundwater exploitation of 34 5 108 m3 a 1 in the well irrigated cropland of the whole study area table 5 in comparison with the basic scenario the annual eta under the optimal irrigation schedule decreased by 24 which implied a positive water saving effect compared with the basic scenario the winter wheat yield decreased by an average of 42 10 under the optimal irrigation schedule but in subbasins in the central eastern region of the study area the reduction in the winter wheat yield exceeded 45 fig 9 moreover based on the change in the water stored in the soil profile the soil water storage would not decrease continuously under the optimal irrigation schedule during the 20 year period 3 3 2 under the constraint of restricting crop yield reduction as the study area is one of the most important breadbaskets in northern china an unreasonable crop yield loss might affect the regional food security wang 2010 han 2012 therefore restricting the reduction in the winter wheat yield was another constraint in the optimization based on crop production and consumption in hebei province wang 2010 the tolerable reduction in the winter wheat yield should be in the range of 20 27 considering that most winter wheat in hebei province is consumed by local inhabitants li and zhao 2010 two thresholds of winter wheat yield reduction i e 20 and 30 were set as constraints in the linear programming to identify the optimal irrigation schedule aimed at ensuring food self sufficiency within the studied region based on the calculation process in supplementary material eqs s3 s6 the irrigation schedules that minimized shallow groundwater depletion in each subbasin under these constraints were determined the results show that if the reduction in winter wheat yield is controlled to within 30 all subbasins should adopt the limited irrigation scheme of scenario 2 in winter wheat growing seasons with a pep of less than 75 i e normal seasons fig s2 in the supplementary material if the reduction in winter wheat yield is controlled to within 20 seventeen subbasins should adopt the limited irrigation scheme of scenario 1 during winter wheat growing seasons with a pep of less than 75 i e normal seasons fig s3 in the supplementary material spatial variations in the optimal irrigation schemes for winter wheat growing seasons with a pep exceeding 75 i e dry and extremely dry seasons under these two constraints are shown in supplementary material figs s2 and s3 these optimal irrigation schedules were also incorporated into the swat model to conduct simulations during the 20 year period the simulation results indicated that the regional shallow groundwater table declined at minimal rates of 0 26 0 23 m a 1 and 0 52 0 28 m a 1 based on the optimal irrigation schedules for crop yield reductions restricted to within 30 and within 20 respectively figs s2 and s3 in the supplementary material under the optimal irrigation schedule for a crop yield reduction restricted to within 30 the reductions in the regional shallow groundwater exploitation and overexploitation compared with the basic scenario would be 70 and 80 respectively furthermore the reductions in exploitation and overexploitation would be 58 and 55 respectively under the optimal irrigation schedule for a crop yield reduction restricted to within 20 table 5 additionally in comparison with the basic scenario the reductions in the annual eta i e water consumption would be 19 and 14 under restricted irrigation schemes with 30 and 20 crop yield reductions respectively in addition there would be no risk of a continual decrease in the soil water storage under these two optimal irrigation schedules during the 20 year period 3 4 trade off between groundwater conservation and crop production the variations in the shallow groundwater table and winter wheat yield under the different irrigation strategies are compared to explore the trade off between groundwater conservation and crop production fig 10 under the basic scenario the high yield of winter wheat was supported by drastic shallow groundwater drawdown at an average rate of 1 10 m a 1 thus the pumping amount for irrigation was in urgent need of being limited to realize sustainable groundwater management the simulated results showed that despite the reduction in the irrigation frequency during the winter wheat growing season to either two events i e scenario 1 or one event i e scenario 2 the shallow groundwater still exhibited a depletion trend in the study area however the average rates of decline in the shallow groundwater table under scenarios 1 and 2 decreased to approximately 2 3 and 1 4 of those under the basic scenario respectively furthermore the reductions in the winter wheat yield were less than 30 under these two scenarios which indicated that the self sufficiency of wheat in the study area would not be greatly impacted at the regional scale the rain fed scheme implemented during the winter wheat growing season i e scenario 3 should be an efficient plan to shift the water storage in the shallow aquifer from a depletion trend to a recovery trend however under this scenario the reduction in the winter wheat yield compared with that under the basic scenario would reach an average of 54 which might have an impact on the food self sufficiency in the study area as the shallow groundwater table in the study area presented a declining trend under scenarios 1 and 2 and presented a recovery trend under scenario 3 an irrigation schedule that could satisfy the constraint of stopping shallow groundwater drawdown was developed under this optimal irrigation schedule the minimal reduction in winter wheat yield was 42 thus if shallow groundwater equilibrium was reached in the study area a certain amount of wheat would need to be imported from other regions on the other hand two irrigation schedules that could satisfy the constraint of restricting the reduction in the crop yield to within 20 30 were also developed to provide alternative plans the results showed that under these optimal irrigation schedules the minimal overexploitation in the well irrigated cropland would be 3 7 7 8 108 m3 a 1 thus if the regional self sufficiency of crop production was maintained a certain number of alternative water sources e g surplus water released from reservoirs or the diversion of inter basin water would need to be used for irrigation to cease shallow groundwater drawdown in the study area these assessment results could provide quantitative references for making decisions related to limiting groundwater exploitation in this well irrigated plain 4 conclusions three limited irrigation schemes for winter wheat scenario 1 applying irrigation twice i e once at the jointing stage and once at the heading stage scenario 2 applying irrigation once at the jointing stage and scenario 3 rain fed condition during the winter wheat growing season were selected to conduct the simulations in this study the results showed that under scenarios 1 and 2 the average rates of decline in the shallow groundwater table decreased to approximately 2 3 and 1 4 of those under the basic scenario indicating that these irrigation schemes effectively controlled the dramatic groundwater drawdown in this region however as a cost the average reductions in the winter wheat yield compared with the basic scenario were 13 and 28 under scenarios 1 and 2 respectively under scenario 3 the shallow aquifer shifted from a negative to a positive balance with a recovery rate of 3 5 108 m3 a 1 in the well irrigated cropland area thus if the average 54 reduction in the winter wheat yield was tolerated reliance on the rain fed conditions during the winter wheat growing season could be an effective scheme for shallow aquifer recovery under the three limited irrigation scenarios there would be no risk of a drying trend in the soil profile to satisfy the constraint of stopping shallow groundwater drawdown exploitation in well irrigated cropland would need to be reduced by at least approximately 34 5 108 m3 a 1 compared with the basic scenario under this optimal irrigation schedule the average minimal reduction in winter wheat yield would be 42 on the other hand to satisfy the constraint of restricting the reduction in the crop yield to within the range of 20 30 which could ensure the self sufficiency of regional crop production the shallow groundwater would still present a depletion trend and the minimal overexploitation in well irrigated cropland would be 3 7 7 8 108 m3 a 1 these results could provide alternative strategies for water management practices considering the trade off between groundwater and crop yields in the study area moreover this study represents a recommended approach and a typical case for other regions around the world that have similar problems although the uncertainty analysis showed that the simulated shallow groundwater variations at the spatiotemporal scale of this study were reasonable further work to simultaneous monitor the groundwater table depth and assess groundwater resources should be performed when implementing limited irrigation schedules in the future the results would be improved by reducing the modeling uncertainty by further calibrating parameters in the swat groundwater module using these collected data additionally farmers could take some agronomic measures to reduce the impacts of limited irrigation schemes on crop yields e g changing the sowing density deep plowing and soil moisture conservation cultivation however these practices cannot yet be reflected in our modified swat model hence another improvement would be to collect detailed field experiment data under limited irrigation conditions in the study area to create conditions for further model modification and relevant parameter calibration acknowledgements this work is jointly supported by the special fund for agro scientific research in the public interest of china grant no 201303133 the

6885,groundwater overdraft due to extensive irrigation has led to a shallow aquifer depletion crisis in the haihe river basin quantitative simulation of the variations in shallow groundwater and crop yield under different conditions of limited exploitation using a distributed hydrological model is important in the well irrigated plain of this basin based on multiple modeling experiments by a modified soil and water assessment tool swat model three limited irrigation schemes for winter wheat triticum aestivum l were selected as simulation scenarios the simulated results using the swat model showed that under scenario 1 applying two rounds of irrigation corresponding to the jointing and heading stages of winter wheat the average rate of decline in the shallow groundwater table was approximately 2 3 of that under the basic scenario current irrigation schedule but the winter wheat yield decreased by 13 compared with the basic scenario under scenario 2 applying one round of irrigation at the jointing stage of winter wheat the average rate of decline in the shallow groundwater table was approximately 1 4 of that under the basic scenario but the reduction in the winter wheat yield compared with the basic scenario increased to 28 the amount of overexploited shallow groundwater in the cropland area decreased from 17 5 108 m3 a 1 under the basic scenario to 11 0 108 m3 a 1 under scenario 1 and 4 5 108 m3 a 1 under scenario 2 under scenario 3 rain fed conditions during the winter wheat season the regional variation in the shallow groundwater table shifted to a recovery trend with an average rate of 0 22 m a 1 which was equivalent to restoring 3 5 108 m3 a 1 of shallow aquifer storage in the cropland area however the reduction in the winter wheat yield compared with the basic scenario reached 54 under the rain fed scheme considering the trade off between groundwater conservation and crop production under limited exploitation linear programming was used to optimize the irrigation schedule at the subbasin scale as a result to satisfy the constraint of stopping groundwater drawdown the average minimal reduction in the winter wheat yield would be 42 under the optimal irrigation schedule by contrast to satisfy the constraint of restricting the reduction in the crop yield to within the threshold required to maintain winter wheat self sufficiency the minimal rate of decline in the shallow groundwater table would be 0 26 0 52 m a 1 under the optimal irrigation schedule in addition the uncertainty in the simulated shallow groundwater variation in this study was acceptable indicating that the above assessments could provide reasonable references for regional groundwater management keywords shallow groundwater crop yield limited irrigation schedule swat model simulation optimization trade off 1 introduction groundwater a crucial freshwater resource is an important irrigation source for cropland in well irrigated regions maidment 1993 siebert et al 2010 however in recent years groundwater depletion has become a global concern as a result of unsustainable overexploitation wada et al 2012 famiglietti 2014 dalin et al 2017 the problems resulting from groundwater depletion not only include eco environmental crises e g wetland shrinkage land subsidence and land desertification but also involve effects on food security and the grain trade brown 2011 scanlon et al 2012 in particular the haihe river basin in china constitutes one of the most typical regions worldwide that is facing a dilemma between groundwater depletion and crop production demand wada et al 2010 zheng et al 2010 werner et al 2013 in the piedmont plain of mount taihang in hebei province which is located in this basin fig 1 the shallow groundwater table is declining dramatically according to long term monitoring data and assessment results chen 1999 zhang and li 2005 ren et al 2007 cgs 2009 zhang and fei 2009 related studies have indicated that the high demand for irrigation water which is pumped from a shallow aquifer to maintain the production of winter wheat triticum aestivum l is the primary cause of overexploitation in this region zhang et al 2000 ren et al 2007 wang 2010 zhang et al 2016 simulated the spatiotemporal variations of shallow groundwater in this well irrigated plain the results of which showed that the shallow aquifer in this groundwater fed plain may face a depletion crisis within the next 80 years under the current irrigation schedule therefore certain measures to restrict the exploitation intensity of irrigation should be implemented immediately to control the groundwater overdraft trend during the past four years the chinese government has released a series of policies that focus on limiting and reducing the amounts of shallow groundwater exploitation in this well irrigated plain the people s government of hebei province 2014 the state council of the people s republic of china 2015 2016 2017 however the crop yield especially the yield of winter wheat which is strongly dependent on well irrigation would be consequently impacted qiu 2010 the people s government of hebei province 2014 therefore alternative strategies that consider the trade off between groundwater conservation and crop production are of absolute necessity in this region to provide reasonable plans for water management it is essential and critical to quantitatively assess the variations in shallow groundwater and crop yield under different limited exploitation scenarios at the luancheng agro ecosystem experimental station which is located in the northern part of the study area researchers have conducted field experiments on the responses of the yield and water use efficiency wue of winter wheat under different limited irrigation strategies zhang et al 2003 zhang et al 2006 shao et al 2009 chen et al 2014 sun et al 2014 zhang et al 2017 however little research has been devoted to predicting the long term effects of different limited irrigation schemes at the regional scale a distributed hydrological model which could consider the heterogeneity of the underlying surface accounts for the limitations in the spatiotemporal scale of field experiments the soil and water assessment tool swat arnold et al 1998 arnold and fohrer 2005 has been proven an effective hydrological model for assessing irrigation impacts and irrigation best management practice bmp scenarios around the world arnold and allen 1996 gassman et al 2007 luo et al 2008 liu et al 2010 garg et al 2012 sun and ren 2014 this model includes a groundwater module which enables the simulation of the soil plant atmosphere continuum spac in conjunction with the underground hydrology but there is still a lack of applications for modeling long term groundwater table fluctuations changes in aquifer storage and crop yields under limited irrigation scenarios moreover the published studies that focused on deficit irrigation schedules and the critical growth stage at which water is required during the winter wheat growing season were based on crop physiology and aimed to achieve maximum yield or wue wang 2011 li and yang 2017 zhang et al 2017 few studies have compared variations in shallow groundwater under multiple practices of applying irrigation at different growth stages of winter wheat however as one of the most seriously overexploited shallow groundwater regions in the world the well irrigated plain in the haihe river basin is in urgent need of quantitative predictions of groundwater variation as well as crop yield reduction under different irrigation intensities therefore based on a groundwater module enhanced swat model that was established for this well irrigated plain zhang et al 2016 this study was conducted to explore assess and optimize the limited irrigation schemes for winter wheat through quantitative simulations this work constitutes not only an extended application of our modified swat model but also a specific assessment of the variations in shallow groundwater and crop yields under limited irrigation conditions which could be beneficial for current water management practices the objectives of this study are to 1 identify reasonable limited irrigation schemes for winter wheat that could balance groundwater regime and crop yield as modeling scenarios 2 conduct detailed simulations under these selected scenarios to quantitatively assess the extent to which shallow groundwater depletion may decrease and to determine how the winter wheat yield may change under different limited irrigation schemes and 3 explore optimal irrigation schedules for winter wheat considering the trade off between groundwater conservation and crop production to provide alternative plans for sustainable groundwater management 2 materials and methods 2 1 the study area this study focuses on the shallow groundwater fed agricultural region of the haihe river basin this area is a piedmont plain bound by the taihang mountains to the west fig 1 and it includes 48 counties of hebei province with an area of 22 753 km2 which accounts for approximately 18 of the haihe plain cropland is the dominant land use type in this region and the average cultivation ratio has been maintained at 80 since the 1990s hebei provincial bureau of statistics 1995 2014 the winter wheat summer maize zea mays l double cropping system is the predominant planting pattern hebei provincial bureau of statistics 1995 2014 the natural conditions of the study area have resulted in this being a major agricultural production region in hebei province li et al 2014 li and yang 2017 this area features a semi arid semi humid continental monsoon climate with an annual precipitation of 450 550 mm while the precipitation is uneven in space and time over 70 of the rainfall occurs during the summer season june august the estimated evapotranspiration during one winter wheat growing season in the study area is approximately 450 mm far in excess of the average precipitation of 130 mm which indicates that irrigation is quite important for this winter crop zhang et al 2006 during the past 20 years over 90 of the water supply for irrigation has been pumped from the shallow aquifer in this region hebei provincial department of water resources 1990 2012 as a result all croplands in the study area are located in areas with overexploited shallow groundwater the general office of the hebei people s government 2014 limited irrigation schemes will certainly become an important measure to reduce shallow groundwater exploitation and maintain the sustainability of the shallow aquifer in this study we concentrated on the limited irrigation schemes for winter wheat because precipitation is almost sufficient during the summer maize growing season therefore limited irrigation in this study refers specifically to reducing the irrigation frequency and the irrigation quota during the winter wheat growing season 2 2 the established swat model the basic version of swat does not include an equation for simulating the groundwater table depth and thus it cannot be used to directly evaluate the impact of irrigation withdrawals on groundwater table fluctuations hence we modified the shallow groundwater module of swat and applied it to a well irrigated plain in the haihe river basin i e the study area in this paper and the details of this modification are described in zhang et al 2016 this groundwater module enhanced and calibrated swat model was also used to conduct further simulations under different limited irrigation scenarios to devise recommended irrigation strategies in this study similar to the work of zhang et al 2016 the simulation period was set as 1990 2012 the first three years served as the preheating time and the 1993 2012 period was used for the analysis moreover as in zhang et al 2016 the simulation results were calculated relative to two hydrological regions i e the dianxi plain of the daqing river basin dxp and the plain of the ziya river basin zyhp to provide a convenient water management reference the detailed technical processes in this study are shown in fig 2 2 3 modeling experimental design according to the field experiments in the study area the critical growth stages at which water is required during the winter wheat growing season are the overwintering jointing heading and filling stages zhang et al 2003 chen et al 2014 sun et al 2014 zhang et al 2017 in addition according to the historical irrigation schedule which was generalized based on the crop water requirement and precipitation farmers in the study area generally applied irrigation during these four winter wheat growing stages sun and ren 2014 to prioritize these four winter wheat growth stages for irrigation and to select reasonable limited irrigation schemes as the simulation scenarios at the regional scale two sets of modeling experiments using the swat model were designed specifically the first set of modeling experiments involved applying one round of irrigation at one of these four winter wheat growth stages and the irrigation norm was set to 75 mm uniformly i e each round of irrigation involved the same irrigation norm but occurred on different dates based on the results regarding the growth stage priorities for irrigation provided by the first set of modeling experiments the second set of modeling experiments involved zero i0 one i1 two i2 three i3 and four i4 rounds of irrigation during the winter wheat growing season similarly the irrigation norm for each irrigation frequency was also set to 75 mm in addition these two sets of modeling experiments were both conducted during the period of 1993 2012 2 4 simulation scenario settings based on a comparison between the variations in the shallow groundwater and crop yield from the above modeling experiments and in reference to field experiments and national policy the people s government of hebei province 2014 zhang personal communication 2015 specific limited irrigation schemes for winter wheat were selected and established as scenarios in the swat model to conduct detailed simulations the irrigation schemes for summer maize under different scenarios were set to be the same as the current irrigation schedule sun and ren 2014 2 5 optimization of the irrigation schedule both positive and negative effects on groundwater conservation and crop production might be observed if all subbasins adopt the same irrigation scheme throughout the 20 year period therefore we explored an optimized group of multiple winter wheat irrigation schemes under different precipitation conditions to balance the groundwater depletion against crop yield reduction specifically the optimization involved two aspects one assumed that stopping shallow groundwater drawdown was the constraint and that minimizing the reduction in winter wheat yield was the objective the other aspect assumed that restricting the reduction in the winter wheat yield was the constraint and that minimizing the rate of decline in the shallow groundwater table was the objective fig 2 the 0 1 linear programming formulation a classical and robust optimization approach was used to conduct the optimization in each subbasin 3 results and discussion 3 1 results of modeling experiments 3 1 1 prioritizing the winter wheat growth stages in the irrigation scheme the highest winter wheat yield in all 22 subbasins see fig 1 was observed in response to irrigation applied at the jointing stage followed by irrigation applied at the heading stage fig 3 which was in agreement with the results of field experiments and the model ranking of a water sensitivity index zhang et al 2001 pan 2011 for the subbasins in the southern part of the study area irrigation applied at the overwintering stage was more important for the winter wheat yield than irrigation applied at the filling stage because in these subbasins exceptionally low precipitation during the summer maize season was more likely to occur thereby reducing the soil water content at the seeding time of winter wheat under this condition irrigation applied at the overwintering stage of the winter wheat growing season could relieve the water stress to a large extent jia and guo 2009 showed that precipitation during july and august in the southern part of the study area was less than that in the northern region consistent with the above analysis to some extent the yields of summer maize under different winter wheat irrigation treatments were also compared to obtain higher summer maize yields in most of the subbasins the priority ranking of the winter wheat growth stages for irrigation should be the filling stage followed by the heading jointing and overwintering stages fig 3 the reason is that if the irrigation date is closer to the harvest time of winter wheat the soil water content is more beneficial to the growth of summer maize overall considering the crop yield in a double cropping system i e the total yield of winter wheat and summer maize irrigation applied to winter wheat should be prioritized in the following sequence for all subbasins jointing heading filling and overwintering stages fig 3 however if the effects of irrigation pumping on shallow groundwater are considered the lowest decline rate of the groundwater table occurred when irrigation was applied at the overwintering stage followed by the filling stage in all subbasins fig 3 this result indicated that the priority ranking of the winter wheat growth stages for irrigation with the aim of reducing groundwater depletion was the opposite of that with the aim of obtaining a higher crop yield the reason for this result is that if irrigation water is readily taken up by crop roots it contributes more to crop yield and less to groundwater recharge under the condition of the same amount of exploitation a greater depletion of shallow groundwater occurs as a result a contradiction therefore exists between prioritizing the timing of winter wheat irrigation aimed at the groundwater regime and that aimed at the crop yield consequently crop groundwater productivity cgwp which was defined as the ratio of the variation in winter wheat yield between irrigated and rain fed conditions relative to groundwater depletion zhang et al 2016 was used to identify a compromise that could balance the changes in groundwater and crop yield to be specific cgwp1 was defined as the ratio of the variation in winter wheat yield between irrigated and rain fed conditions relative to the change in shallow groundwater table depth and cgwp2 was defined as the ratio of the variation in winter wheat yield between irrigated and rain fed conditions relative to the change in shallow aquifer water storage zhang et al 2016 a higher cgwp indicates that irrigation pumping induced less groundwater depletion and produced a larger increase in crop yield to increase the crop yield by exploiting groundwater to a greater degree winter wheat irrigation should be prioritized sequentially as follows for four of the subbasins dx1 dx2 dx3 and dx9 jointing heading filling and overwintering stages for the other eighteen subbasins winter wheat irrigation should be prioritized sequentially as follows jointing heading overwintering and filling stages fig 3 this spatial difference occurred because the average winter wheat yield under filling stage irrigation was 234 kg ha 1 higher than that under overwintering stage irrigation in the four subbasins in contrast in the other eighteen subbasins the difference in winter wheat yield between irrigation during these two growing stages was on average 64 kg ha 1 comprehensively considering the groundwater and crop yield we chose the sequence of winter wheat growth stages aimed at higher cgwp to design the further modeling experiments with different irrigation frequencies 3 1 2 results of modeling experiments with different irrigation frequencies based on the results in the previous section the second set of modeling experiments was carried out under the following five irrigation schemes of winter wheat treatment i4 applying four rounds of irrigation corresponding to the overwintering jointing heading and filling stages treatment i3 applying three rounds of irrigation corresponding to the overwintering jointing and heading stages or the jointing heading and filling stages treatment i2 applying two rounds of irrigation corresponding to the jointing and heading stages treatment i1 applying one round of irrigation at the jointing stage and treatment i0 rain fed condition the average yields of winter wheat were 2624 kg ha 1 4144 kg ha 1 4986 kg ha 1 5348 kg ha 1 and 5617 kg ha 1 under the i0 i1 i2 i3 and i4 treatments respectively fig 4 the winter wheat yields increased by approximately 60 and 20 from the i0 treatment to the i1 treatment and from the i1 treatment to the i2 treatment respectively in contrast the yields increased by only 7 and 5 from the i2 treatment to the i3 treatment and from the i3 treatment to the i4 treatment respectively based on the field experiments conducted at luancheng station during 2008 2015 zhang et al 2017 showed that the average winter wheat yield improvement associated with the addition of one more irrigation event was 44 7 between i0 and i1 13 1 between i1 and i2 1 8 between i2 and i3 and less than 0 5 between i3 and i4 although the irrigation quota and irrigation date were not exactly the same between zhang et al 2017 and our modeling experiments if the simulated shallow groundwater table exhibited an increasing trend or if the cumulative decline over the 20 year period was less than 1 m groundwater drawdown was assumed to have stopped the results showed that this condition occurred in nineteen subbasins two subbasins and one subbasin under the i0 i1 and i2 treatments respectively however under the i3 and i4 treatments the shallow groundwater in all 22 subbasins still presented a drawdown trend fig 4 additionally in all subbasins the highest cgwp occurred under the i1 treatment followed by the i2 i3 and i4 treatments fig 4 as a whole the i1 and i2 treatments had a relatively high utilization efficiency of shallow groundwater while increasing the winter wheat yield 3 2 scenario analysis comprehensively considering the changes in crop yields the variations in the shallow groundwater table and the differences in the cgwp of the modeling experiments i0 i1 and i2 were selected as the three scenarios for further simulations the detailed scenario settings are listed in table 1 here the basic scenario which is related to the current i e farmers historical cropping system and irrigation schedule see zhang et al 2016 was used to reproduce the spatiotemporal variations of the shallow groundwater and crop yields for the period of 1993 2012 3 2 1 shallow aquifer storage and shallow groundwater table depth according to the abovementioned scenario settings the annual irrigation pumping amounted to 397 22 mm 192 18 mm 117 18 mm and 42 18 mm under the basic scenario and scenarios 1 2 and 3 respectively the simulation results showed that the corresponding annual shallow groundwater recharge under these four scenarios was 237 68 mm 101 58 mm 85 53 mm and 76 52 mm here similar to the work of zhang et al 2016 the precipitation exceedance probability pep for each subbasin during the simulation period was calculated for each crop growing season and civil year using an empirical frequency analysis method see brutsaert 2005 according to the 1970 2012 rainfall data obtained from 22 weather stations fig 1 in this paper based on the pep value of a winter wheat or summer maize growing season the precipitation condition was classified as follows pep 25 indicated a wet season 25 pep 75 indicated a normal season 75 pep 95 indicated a dry season and pep 95 indicated an extremely dry season similarly wet normal dry and extremely dry years in this paper indicated that the pep value of a civil year was within the above four ranges respectively it should be noted that in reference to our previous work sun and ren 2013 2014 zhang et al 2016 which considered the coherence with farmers historical irrigation schedule in the study area see hebei irrigation center experiment station 1988 collaborative group for water demand contour map of major crop in china 1993 the simulated results of wet seasons years in this paper were merged with those of normal seasons years with regard to the statistics and analysis hereinafter fig 5 shows the simulated results of shallow groundwater balance under different precipitation conditions during the 20 years under scenario 1 the average annual change in the shallow aquifer storage was 96 mm which indicated a depletion trend under scenario 2 the regional shallow aquifer storage changed by an average of 15 mm during a normal year this change was approximately 6 mm in the dxp which indicated that the irrigation scheme of this scenario could nearly achieve shallow groundwater equilibrium in most years in this hydrological region however the shallow aquifer storage in the study area changed by an average of 94 mm during a dry or extremely dry year under scenario 2 indicating an overexploitation trend under scenario 3 the regional shallow aquifer storage displayed a recovery trend with an average rate of 30 mm a 1 which would reverse the depletion trend of the shallow aquifer in this well irrigated plain the average decline rates of the shallow groundwater table under the basic scenario and scenarios 1 and 2 were 1 10 m a 1 0 70 m a 1 and 0 28 m a 1 respectively under scenario 1 except for three subbasins that were located in the zyhp all cropland in the study area presented a shallow groundwater table decline rate that was less than 1 0 m a 1 fig 6 b this spatial difference might be caused by the relatively small calibrated specific yield of the shallow aquifer in these three subbasins i e zy2 zy6 and zy7 thus the variations in the shallow groundwater table in these subbasins might be more dramatic than those in other subbasins with the same depletion of shallow aquifer storage a hydrogeological survey in the study area showed that the specific yield of the shallow aquifer in the region of subbasins zy2 zy6 and zy7 was indeed smaller than that of the adjacent area zhang and fei 2009 therefore to minimize groundwater exploitation greater pumping amounts for irrigation in these regions should be reduced to slow the rate of decline in the shallow groundwater table under scenario 2 except for two subbasins the shallow groundwater table in the study area still presented a downward trend but the decline rate was significantly lower than that under the basic scenario a total of sixteen subbasins had a decline rate less than 0 5 m a 1 under scenario 2 which indicated an obvious deceleration in the groundwater drawdown fig 6c under scenario 3 the shallow groundwater table in most of the subbasins presented a recovery trend with an average rate of 0 06 0 71 m a 1 fig 6d however in subbasins dx6 zy2 zy4 and zy7 the shallow groundwater table exhibited a declining trend under this scenario this declining trend was caused by the limited lateral recharge in these subbasins which are far from mount taihang these four subbasins might represent target regions where further measures should be implemented to stop the depletion of shallow groundwater based on the area of well irrigated cropland hebei provincial department of water resources 1990 2012 the shallow aquifer storage changes under different scenarios were converted to volumes zhang et al 2016 indicated that under the basic scenario the cumulative overexploitation rate of shallow groundwater in the study area was 17 5 108 m3 a 1 fig 7 a under scenario 1 approximately 82 of the well irrigated cropland experienced a 10 20 m decline in the groundwater table from 1993 to 2012 leading to overexploitation at a rate of 8 8 108 m3 a 1 and the remaining 18 of the well irrigated cropland exhibited a total overexploitation rate of 2 2 108 m3 a 1 fig 7b under scenario 2 the proportion of well irrigated cropland in which the water table declined by 10 20 m from 1993 to 2012 decreased to only 10 and the corresponding groundwater overexploitation rate decreased to 0 8 108 m3 a 1 under this scenario approximately 88 of the well irrigated cropland experienced a decline of less than 10 m from 1993 to 2012 leading to overexploitation at a rate of 3 7 108 m3 a 1 furthermore 2 area of the well irrigated cropland presented a recovery trend in the water table from 1993 to 2012 leading to a recovery rate of 0 04 108 m3 a 1 fig 7c under scenario 3 approximately 12 of the well irrigated cropland presented a declining trend in the water table leading to overexploitation at a rate of 0 1 108 m3 a 1 and the other 88 of the well irrigated cropland presented a recovery trend in the water table leading to a recovery rate of 3 6 108 m3 a 1 the scenario simulations in this paper were conducted based on a previously established swat model zhang et al 2016 which was calibrated using observational data on the shallow groundwater table however the calibrated parameters in the groundwater module for the best simulation reflected the fluctuations in the shallow groundwater table under current irrigation practices i e the basic scenario when applying these parameters in the limited irrigation scenarios some uncertainties might exist because some parameters might be affected by shallow groundwater variations specifically the following four parameters would theoretically be influenced by changes in the irrigation scenarios the deep aquifer percolation fraction rechrg dp the amount of lateral recharge from mountainous area entering into the aquifer larchrg the groundwater delay time from the lowest depth of the soil profile to the shallow aquifer gw delay and the specific yield of the shallow aquifer gwspyld therefore the uncertainties associated with adopting these calibrated parameters under limited exploitation conditions are preliminarily discussed below according to zhang et al 2016 the percolation of groundwater to the deep aquifer accounted for only 1 of the total recharge under the basic scenario which was in agreement with the groundwater resources assessment results cgs 2009 thus this parameter i e rechrg dp should have little impact on the simulated shallow groundwater table under the changing scenarios the larchrg a new parameter in the groundwater module added by zhang et al 2016 was allocated by the downscaling method i e unit discharge and linear approximation from the regional level according to the assessment results of the haihe river basin ren et al 2007 in ren et al 2007 the lateral recharge was calculated based on darcy s law therefore with the reduction in the rate of the shallow groundwater table decline under limited exploitation conditions the hydraulic gradient decreased on one hand and the thickness of the calculated aquifer cross section increased on the other hand if the average hydraulic conductivity of shallow aquifer was assumed to be invariant from a qualitative or semi quantitative view the larchrg could be considered to change little under the different scenarios in theory the parameter gw delay should be lower in the limited irrigation scenarios than in the basic scenario due to the decrease in the average shallow groundwater table depth during the simulation period however the effects of the decrease in gw delay on the simulated shallow groundwater variations differed depending on the analyzed time scale according to the previously simulated results using the optimal value of calibrated gw delay in zhang et al 2016 the ratio of the average shallow groundwater table depth during the 20 years under the three limited irrigation scenarios to that under the basic scenario was in the range of 50 100 therefore assuming that the relationship between gw delay and the average shallow groundwater table depth was linear a sensitivity analysis with a 50 disturbance in gw delay was carried out to explore the most extreme uncertainties the results showed that although the average relative error re of the simulated shallow groundwater variations associated with a gw delay disturbance of 50 relative to the corresponding results associated with the original gw delay was approximately 10 at the daily scale fig 8 this value changed to approximately 5 at the monthly scale fig 8 according to the calculated results the average res of the simulated shallow groundwater variations with the gw delay before and after a 50 disturbance at the crop growing season scale yearly scale average five year scale average ten year scale and average twenty year scale were 6 95 1 45 0 25 1 40 and 0 07 respectively and the probabilities that the re was in the range from 5 to 5 at these corresponding time scales were 63 66 92 95 and 98 respectively fig 8 in this study the assessments of the shallow groundwater variation were based on the average results of several crop growing seasons several years or even the full 20 year period therefore for the analysis time scale in this study the uncertainties introduced by the gw delay parameter were acceptable indicating that the simulated results provided by this study should be reasonable for practical management practices based on the research of zhang and zhang 1983 the differences between the specific yield and void ratio in shallow groundwater depletion and recovery processes could be neglected therefore the calibrated gwspyld could reflect the comprehensive water storage and release capacity of the shallow aquifer within the groundwater table fluctuation zone over 20 years under the basic scenario in the limited irrigation scenarios the dynamics of the shallow groundwater table were still mostly within the range of this fluctuation zone which implied that the calibrated gwspyld was relatively acceptable in this study 3 2 2 soil water balance and water management response indicators compared with the basic scenario the water balance components of the soil profile 2 m deep changed to different degrees under the three limited irrigation scenarios fig s1 in the supplementary material to quantitatively evaluate the impacts of different water management scenarios on the irrigation performance six water management response indicators wmris derived from related studies singh and singh 1997 van dam and malik 2003 were calculated and compared table 2 the results showed that the reduction in the amount of irrigation pumping during the winter wheat growing season under the three limited irrigation scenarios relative to the basic scenario was over 58 whereas the corresponding reduction in the actual evapotranspiration eta was in the range of 19 51 fig s1 in the supplementary material this implied that winter wheat absorbed more water from the root zone under scenarios 1 2 and 3 as a consequence the soil water storage during the winter wheat growing season changed from a positive balance i e an increase of 3 7 mm under the basic scenario to a negative balance i e decreases of 21 5 mm 44 1 mm and 51 3 mm under scenarios 1 2 and 3 respectively moreover during the winter wheat growing season the percolation index decreased from 0 25 under the basic scenario to 0 02 under scenarios 1 2 and 3 and the transpiration efficiency increased from 0 53 under the basic scenario to 0 85 under scenarios 1 2 and 3 table 2 these changes indicated that the effects of precipitation and irrigation on the growth of winter wheat improved under the three limited irrigation scenarios the limited irrigation schemes for winter wheat would affected the soil water balance during the summer maize growing season the percolation and runoff during the summer maize growing season were 25 51 and 16 31 lower respectively under the limited irrigation schemes than under the basic scenario fig s1 in the supplementary material in addition the soil water storage during the summer maize growing season changed from a negative balance i e a decrease of 5 8 mm under the basic scenario to a positive balance i e increases of 21 1 mm 43 4 mm and 50 5 mm under scenarios 1 2 and 3 respectively these changes were caused by the lower soil water storage during the winter wheat harvesting stage under the limited irrigation scenarios which facilitated the storage of summer precipitation in the soil water reservoir according to the results calculated at the annual scale the change in the soil water storage was close to zero under the three limited irrigation scenarios table 2 implying that the soil profile would not dry out if the selected limited irrigation schemes were implemented in the study area additionally in comparison with the basic scenario the utilization of the soil water reservoir improved under scenarios 1 2 and 3 according to the results of irrigation contribution and rainfall contribution the cropland also made better use of the precipitation for eta under the three limited irrigation scenarios table 2 indicating an important water saving effect for this water scarce region moreover compared with the basic scenario the proportion of percolation relative to the total discharge in the soil water budget decreased from 23 to 8 10 under the three limited irrigation scenarios fig s1 in the supplementary material this finding not only indicated an improvement in crop water use but also implied a reduced risk of non point pollution in shallow groundwater 3 2 3 crop yield and crop water productivity simulated results showed that the regional average yields of winter wheat during the 20 years were 5725 600 kg ha 1 4986 744 kg ha 1 4114 868 kg ha 1 and 2624 918 kg ha 1 under the basic scenario and scenarios 1 2 and 3 respectively in comparison with the basic scenario the reductions in winter wheat yield in scenarios 1 and 2 were less than 40 under all precipitation conditions table 3 however in scenario 3 compared with the basic scenario the yield decreased by more than 50 under all precipitation conditions which indicated that more than half of the winter wheat yield would be lost in this scenario table 3 crop water productivity cwp is defined as crop yield relative to seasonal water use i e eta and it is an important indicator for analyzing the relationship between water and food production droogers and bastiaanssen 2002 kijne et al 2003 van dam et al 2006 compared with the results obtained under the basic scenario the cwp of winter wheat increased by an average of 6 12 and 18 in normal dry and extremely dry seasons respectively under scenario 1 and by 5 11 and 18 under scenario 2 table 3 however under scenario 3 the cwp of winter wheat in normal and dry seasons decreased by 3 7 in comparison with the basic scenario table 3 compared with the basic scenario the changes in the yield of summer maize eta during the summer maize growing season and cwp of summer maize under the three limited irrigation scenarios were less than 2 which could be considered constant to some extent 3 2 4 effects of mitigating groundwater depletion under the limited irrigation scenarios based on the well irrigated area the effects on shallow groundwater drawdown mitigation agricultural water saving and crop yield of the three limited irrigation scenarios were calculated at the hydrological region level for water management purposes table 4 under scenarios 1 2 and 3 the amounts of irrigation pumping in the well irrigated cropland area decreased by approximately 50 70 and 90 respectively compared with the basic scenario additionally under scenarios 1 and 2 the depletion rates of the shallow aquifer storage in the well irrigated cropland area decreased by approximately 37 and 75 respectively in comparison by basic scenario under scenario 3 the shallow aquifer storage changed from a depletion state i e a rate of 17 5 108 m3 a 1 under the basic scenario to a recovery state i e a rate of 3 5 108 m3 a 1 during the 20 year period which implied that the groundwater recession could be not only stopped but also reversed under the scenario involving a rain fed watering strategy during the winter wheat growing season in general the effects of the three limited irrigation scenarios on mitigating groundwater depletion were better in the northern hydrological region table 4 in comparison with the basic scenario the annual eta in the well irrigated cropland under scenarios 1 2 and 3 decreased by 66 mm 118 mm and 185 mm respectively which corresponded to a decrease in water consumption of 10 18 and 29 however as a cost of the water saving effect the average winter wheat yield under scenarios 1 2 and 3 decreased by approximately 13 28 and 54 respectively compared with the basic scenario in comparison with the basic scenario the average changes in the cwp of winter wheat under scenarios 1 2 and 3 were 0 12 kg m 3 0 10 kg m 3 and 0 10 kg m 3 respectively which implied that the efficiency of well irrigation could remain stable under the limited irrigation schemes 3 3 optimal irrigation schedules for winter wheat the decision variables in the 0 1 linear programming formulation are provided in supplementary material section s1 and table s1 3 3 1 under the constraint of stopping groundwater drawdown here it was assumed that if the cumulative decline in the shallow groundwater table during the 20 year period was less than 1 m or if the shallow groundwater table presented a recovery trend the shallow groundwater drawdown had stopped based on the calculation process presented in supplementary material eqs s1 and s2 the irrigation schedules that could minimize winter wheat yield loss under this groundwater constraint were optimized in each subbasin as a result in winter wheat growing seasons with a pep of less than 75 i e normal seasons the rain fed irrigation scheme should be adopted in seventeen subbasins fig 9 additionally in winter wheat growing seasons with a pep exceeding 75 i e dry and extremely dry seasons the optimal irrigation scheme was spatially more diverse fig 9 in particular for subbasins zy2 zy4 and zy7 even if the winter wheat rain fed irrigation scheme was consecutively implemented for 20 years the shallow groundwater still presented a drawdown trend this result indicated that there was no feasible solution to stop shallow groundwater drawdown in these three subbasins the optimal irrigation schedules for the 22 subbasins were incorporated into the swat model to conduct further simulations the results showed that in order to reach shallow groundwater equilibrium the amount of irrigation pumping in dxp and zyhp should be reduced by 75 and 80 respectively compared with the basic scenario these values are equivalent to a reduction in groundwater exploitation of 34 5 108 m3 a 1 in the well irrigated cropland of the whole study area table 5 in comparison with the basic scenario the annual eta under the optimal irrigation schedule decreased by 24 which implied a positive water saving effect compared with the basic scenario the winter wheat yield decreased by an average of 42 10 under the optimal irrigation schedule but in subbasins in the central eastern region of the study area the reduction in the winter wheat yield exceeded 45 fig 9 moreover based on the change in the water stored in the soil profile the soil water storage would not decrease continuously under the optimal irrigation schedule during the 20 year period 3 3 2 under the constraint of restricting crop yield reduction as the study area is one of the most important breadbaskets in northern china an unreasonable crop yield loss might affect the regional food security wang 2010 han 2012 therefore restricting the reduction in the winter wheat yield was another constraint in the optimization based on crop production and consumption in hebei province wang 2010 the tolerable reduction in the winter wheat yield should be in the range of 20 27 considering that most winter wheat in hebei province is consumed by local inhabitants li and zhao 2010 two thresholds of winter wheat yield reduction i e 20 and 30 were set as constraints in the linear programming to identify the optimal irrigation schedule aimed at ensuring food self sufficiency within the studied region based on the calculation process in supplementary material eqs s3 s6 the irrigation schedules that minimized shallow groundwater depletion in each subbasin under these constraints were determined the results show that if the reduction in winter wheat yield is controlled to within 30 all subbasins should adopt the limited irrigation scheme of scenario 2 in winter wheat growing seasons with a pep of less than 75 i e normal seasons fig s2 in the supplementary material if the reduction in winter wheat yield is controlled to within 20 seventeen subbasins should adopt the limited irrigation scheme of scenario 1 during winter wheat growing seasons with a pep of less than 75 i e normal seasons fig s3 in the supplementary material spatial variations in the optimal irrigation schemes for winter wheat growing seasons with a pep exceeding 75 i e dry and extremely dry seasons under these two constraints are shown in supplementary material figs s2 and s3 these optimal irrigation schedules were also incorporated into the swat model to conduct simulations during the 20 year period the simulation results indicated that the regional shallow groundwater table declined at minimal rates of 0 26 0 23 m a 1 and 0 52 0 28 m a 1 based on the optimal irrigation schedules for crop yield reductions restricted to within 30 and within 20 respectively figs s2 and s3 in the supplementary material under the optimal irrigation schedule for a crop yield reduction restricted to within 30 the reductions in the regional shallow groundwater exploitation and overexploitation compared with the basic scenario would be 70 and 80 respectively furthermore the reductions in exploitation and overexploitation would be 58 and 55 respectively under the optimal irrigation schedule for a crop yield reduction restricted to within 20 table 5 additionally in comparison with the basic scenario the reductions in the annual eta i e water consumption would be 19 and 14 under restricted irrigation schemes with 30 and 20 crop yield reductions respectively in addition there would be no risk of a continual decrease in the soil water storage under these two optimal irrigation schedules during the 20 year period 3 4 trade off between groundwater conservation and crop production the variations in the shallow groundwater table and winter wheat yield under the different irrigation strategies are compared to explore the trade off between groundwater conservation and crop production fig 10 under the basic scenario the high yield of winter wheat was supported by drastic shallow groundwater drawdown at an average rate of 1 10 m a 1 thus the pumping amount for irrigation was in urgent need of being limited to realize sustainable groundwater management the simulated results showed that despite the reduction in the irrigation frequency during the winter wheat growing season to either two events i e scenario 1 or one event i e scenario 2 the shallow groundwater still exhibited a depletion trend in the study area however the average rates of decline in the shallow groundwater table under scenarios 1 and 2 decreased to approximately 2 3 and 1 4 of those under the basic scenario respectively furthermore the reductions in the winter wheat yield were less than 30 under these two scenarios which indicated that the self sufficiency of wheat in the study area would not be greatly impacted at the regional scale the rain fed scheme implemented during the winter wheat growing season i e scenario 3 should be an efficient plan to shift the water storage in the shallow aquifer from a depletion trend to a recovery trend however under this scenario the reduction in the winter wheat yield compared with that under the basic scenario would reach an average of 54 which might have an impact on the food self sufficiency in the study area as the shallow groundwater table in the study area presented a declining trend under scenarios 1 and 2 and presented a recovery trend under scenario 3 an irrigation schedule that could satisfy the constraint of stopping shallow groundwater drawdown was developed under this optimal irrigation schedule the minimal reduction in winter wheat yield was 42 thus if shallow groundwater equilibrium was reached in the study area a certain amount of wheat would need to be imported from other regions on the other hand two irrigation schedules that could satisfy the constraint of restricting the reduction in the crop yield to within 20 30 were also developed to provide alternative plans the results showed that under these optimal irrigation schedules the minimal overexploitation in the well irrigated cropland would be 3 7 7 8 108 m3 a 1 thus if the regional self sufficiency of crop production was maintained a certain number of alternative water sources e g surplus water released from reservoirs or the diversion of inter basin water would need to be used for irrigation to cease shallow groundwater drawdown in the study area these assessment results could provide quantitative references for making decisions related to limiting groundwater exploitation in this well irrigated plain 4 conclusions three limited irrigation schemes for winter wheat scenario 1 applying irrigation twice i e once at the jointing stage and once at the heading stage scenario 2 applying irrigation once at the jointing stage and scenario 3 rain fed condition during the winter wheat growing season were selected to conduct the simulations in this study the results showed that under scenarios 1 and 2 the average rates of decline in the shallow groundwater table decreased to approximately 2 3 and 1 4 of those under the basic scenario indicating that these irrigation schemes effectively controlled the dramatic groundwater drawdown in this region however as a cost the average reductions in the winter wheat yield compared with the basic scenario were 13 and 28 under scenarios 1 and 2 respectively under scenario 3 the shallow aquifer shifted from a negative to a positive balance with a recovery rate of 3 5 108 m3 a 1 in the well irrigated cropland area thus if the average 54 reduction in the winter wheat yield was tolerated reliance on the rain fed conditions during the winter wheat growing season could be an effective scheme for shallow aquifer recovery under the three limited irrigation scenarios there would be no risk of a drying trend in the soil profile to satisfy the constraint of stopping shallow groundwater drawdown exploitation in well irrigated cropland would need to be reduced by at least approximately 34 5 108 m3 a 1 compared with the basic scenario under this optimal irrigation schedule the average minimal reduction in winter wheat yield would be 42 on the other hand to satisfy the constraint of restricting the reduction in the crop yield to within the range of 20 30 which could ensure the self sufficiency of regional crop production the shallow groundwater would still present a depletion trend and the minimal overexploitation in well irrigated cropland would be 3 7 7 8 108 m3 a 1 these results could provide alternative strategies for water management practices considering the trade off between groundwater and crop yields in the study area moreover this study represents a recommended approach and a typical case for other regions around the world that have similar problems although the uncertainty analysis showed that the simulated shallow groundwater variations at the spatiotemporal scale of this study were reasonable further work to simultaneous monitor the groundwater table depth and assess groundwater resources should be performed when implementing limited irrigation schedules in the future the results would be improved by reducing the modeling uncertainty by further calibrating parameters in the swat groundwater module using these collected data additionally farmers could take some agronomic measures to reduce the impacts of limited irrigation schemes on crop yields e g changing the sowing density deep plowing and soil moisture conservation cultivation however these practices cannot yet be reflected in our modified swat model hence another improvement would be to collect detailed field experiment data under limited irrigation conditions in the study area to create conditions for further model modification and relevant parameter calibration acknowledgements this work is jointly supported by the special fund for agro scientific research in the public interest of china grant no 201303133 the

6886,hydrological models represent valuable tools to investigate the impacts of land use changes on water resources most commonly distributed physically based models are applied for land use change impact studies in hydrology however providing a physically based and detailed description of subsurface flows in karst systems is challenging lumped models in contrast are easy to implement and widely used in karst hydrological research albeit not applicable for land use change impact studies to overcome these limitations we developed a new semi distributed model lukars land use change modeling in karst systems that lumps the predominant hydrotopes i e distinct landscape units characterized by homogeneous hydrological properties as a result of similar land use and soil types present in a catchment as independent non linear units flows from each hydrotope represent a specific response of the vadose zone soil epikarst infiltration zone in a defined recharge area the saturated zone consists of a single linear storage unit recharged by each hydrotope independently the main goal of this approach was to investigate land use change impacts in a dolomite karst system exploited for the water supply of the city of waidhofen a d ybbs austria by changing the area covered by each hydrotope here land use changes occured in the form of increasing spaces used for dolomite mining and at the expense of existing forest sites with our parametrized model we were able to reproduce the measured discharge in the largest spring of the waidhofen karst system kerschbaum spring moreover we succeeded in transferring the parametrized hydrotopes to other recharge areas hinterlug and mitterlug and validated the transferability of the modeling approach finally we successfully showed the model s applicability for land use change impact studies by validating the calibrated model in a period in which the space of the dolomite quarries in the kerschbaum recharge area almost doubled the results of our study show that an increase of the dolomite quarries negatively affects the water supply of the city of waidhofen a d ybbs keywords karst aquifer karst modeling rainfall discharge model land use change hydrotope 1 introduction karst aquifers constitute a major worldwide source of freshwater supply delbart et al 2016 hosseini et al 2017 thus special importance is paid to carbonate rock aquifers in hydrological research and water resource management hartmann et al 2014 jin et al 2015 chang et al 2017 filippini et al 2018 a detailed knowledge of hydrological processes i e groundwater recharge storage and discharge as well as of the land use impacts on water quality and availability are of primary interest for sustainable exploitation of any karst aquifer hydrological models therefore serve as important tools to investigate the hydrological functioning of karst systems jourde et al 2015 however hartmann et al 2014 outlined that land use change impact studies have rarely been conducted explicitly for karst catchment areas and they highlighted the necessity of such studies for sustainable water resource management in karstic areas therefore the aim of this work is to present a new conceptual modeling approach that allows for the simulation of land use change impacts on the drinking water supply from karst aquifers black box models labat et al 1999 2000 hu et al 2008 jukić and denić jukić 2008 and lumped conceptual models mangin 1975 arikan 1988 fleury 2005 fleury et al 2007 tritz et al 2011 hartmann et al 2012a chang et al 2017 mazzilli et al 2017 are the most commonly applied modeling approaches in karst hydrological research however black box models can only be considered reliable for the conditions specific to their calibration period hartmann et al 2014 and lumped models assume one single water input time series for the considered system scanlon et al 2002 hartmann et al 2012b these two features make these modeling approaches inappropriate for land use change impact studies hartmann et al 2014 distributed process based models are often used to assess potential impacts of land use changes on hydrological systems chen et al 2017 they aim to consider the spatial variability of hydrological parameters as well as the heterogeneous effects of land use and soil properties in a catchment although reimann et al 2011 and kordilla et al 2012 introduced promising modeling approaches for the distributed simulation of hydrological processes in karst aquifers their application is usually hampered by the high complexity of subsurface systems and a general limitation in data availability jukić and denić jukić 2009 hartmann et al 2014 ladouche et al 2014 to overcome these limitations we hypothesize that the recharge area of a given karst system can be subdivided into distinct units defined as hydrotopes koeck and hochbichler 2012 we define hydrotopes as independent model units described by homogeneous hydrological characteristics in particular infiltration properties resulting from similar land use and soil types therefore we assume homogeneous infiltration properties for a given soil type with the same bedrock due to similar formation conditions of the saprolite i e chemically weathered rock williams 1983 the concept of hydrotopes was successfully applied in former hydrological and ecohydrological studies gurtz et al 1999 krysanova et al 2005 however it was not yet applied in the framework of land use change impact studies in karstic systems therefore our research objectives are i to create a new semi distributed modeling approach that lumps the predominant hydrotopes present in a catchment ii to calibrate and validate the modeling approach for a reference karst system iii to proof our concept by transferring the modeling approach to other karst systems and their related catchments while maintaining the calibrated hydrotope parameters and iv to investigate land use change impacts by changing the area covered by each hydrotope in lukars we apply a non linear transfer function proposed by tritz et al 2011 which is able to simulate the hysteretic behavior of the soil and epikarst storage that results from different water retention potentials during wetting and drying cycles different from tritz et al 2011 we use that function for the implementation of individual hydrotopes constituting the catchment area of a karst spring in this way each hydrotope is characterized by a specific hydrological response which contributes to the total spring discharge the saturated zone consists of a single linear storage unit recharged by each hydrotope independently thus the proposed modeling approach benefits from the advantages of lumped models i e the easy implementation and the low computational power as well as from the characteristics of distributed models i e integration of spatial heterogeneities of soil hydraulic properties to the best of our knowledge such a conceptual modeling approach integrating hydrotopes as lumped non linear storages has not been widely discussed in karst hydrological research sarrazin et al 2018 the paper is structured as follows in section 2 we introduce the main characteristics of our investigated karst region in waidhofen a d ybbs austria in section 3 we present the setup and the governing equations of the hydrotope based modeling approach in section 4 and 5 we present and discuss the results of the model calibration model validation as well as the land use change impacts on the hydrological system finally we conclude our investigations in section 6 2 study area 2 1 catchment description the study area is located 10 km south of the city of waidhofen a d ybbs in lower austria fig 1 this pre alpine region is part of the eastern foothills of the northern calcareous alps with altitudes ranging from 415 to 969 m a s l in this warm moderate regional climate with an annual mean temperature of 8 c mean daily temperatures below freezing occur mainly from december to february annual mean precipitation of 1379 mm was recorded at the weather station hinterlug fig 1b during the period from 1981 to 2014 the annual distribution of precipitation is bimodal with maxima during both the summer june and july and winter months december and january with snowfall dominating precipitation in the winter supplementary material a two small fluvial systems constitute the study area s drainage the waidhofenbach and the lugerbach close to the weather station hinterlug the lugerbach flows into the waidhofenbach which drains most of the study area into the ybbs river in waidhofen the local geology is dominated by a lithologic sequence of dolomitic basement rocks main dolomite triassic age fig 1a and thus typical karst phenomena such as springs dry valleys and caves are present in the study area significant sinkholes are not present in the study area leading to the conclusion that point infiltration plays a minor role for recharge moreover prior investigations revealed that a deep karstified groundwater system exists also below the elevation level of the waidhofenbach valley hacker 2003 considering the specific hydrogeological setting of the area we can assume a well connected network of fractures and conduits the largest springs originating from those karstificable rocks are exploited for the municipal drinking water supply of waidhofen a d ybbs in this work we focus on three distinct springs and their recharge areas namely the kerschbaum 2 5 km2 mitterlug 0 25 km2 and hinterlug 1 8 km2 springs fig 1b the delineation of the respective recharge areas was performed based on tracer tests by hacker 2003 each of these springs is fed by karst aquifers of the main dolomite where the karst system of the hinterlug spring is separated tectonically from the two others by a pronounced strike slip fault that separates the two mountain massifs schnabelberg hinterlug spring in northern part and glashüttenberg kerschbaum and mitterlug spring in southern part even if the kerschbaum and mitterlug springs rise from the same mountain massif prior investigations for the designation of protection areas revealed that the feeding karst aquifers can be considered independent hacker 2003 2 2 hydrotopes in the following we shortly describe the hydrotopes that are dominant in the recharge areas of the three considered springs note that hydrotopes covering less than 1 of the respective recharge areas were not considered assuming that their contribution to the spring discharges is negligible as often done in other hydrological models neitsch et al 2005 and they are merged with the dominant hydrotopes to fill the whole recharge areas a detailed field mapping campaign was carried out by markart et al 2012 following the method by koeck and hochbichler 2012 the result of those field investigations is a detailed classification of the predominant hydrotopes in the study area fig 2 hydrotopes were mapped and classified according to i the overstorey trees as indicators for interception capacities and preferential flow paths in the soil rooting ii the understorey vegetation as an indicator for the hydrological site conditions dry to wet and iii the dominant soil types and respective thicknesses shallow to deep as qualitative parameters for the hydrophysical site properties the soil depths in the study area range from 20 cm to 60 cm markart et al 2012 the spatial share of each hydrotope in all defined recharge areas is shown in table 1 hyd q represents dolomite quarries located in the kerschbaum spring recharge area in 2007 when the orthophoto illustrated in fig 1b was taken the quarries covered 4 of the kerschbaum spring recharge area due to the removal of local vegetation and soil cover the dolomitic basement rocks remained bare in these areas the catchment classifications and the runoff modeling performed according to markart et al 2004 and kohl 2011 revealed that the dolomite quarry surfaces have discharge coefficients of almost 1 and do not contribute to a considerable amount of the recharge in the subsurface karst system instead the quarries are drained by a small creek that flows into the waidhofenbach and thus do not feed the kerschbaum spring fig 1b hyd p indicates pastures located in the mitterlug and hinterlug spring recharge areas hydrotopes b1 b2 b3 and b4 represent the forest type hydrotopes all having beeches fagus sylvatica as the dominant tree species hyd b1 is the bluegrass beech forest hydrotope and is present in the recharge areas of the kerschbaum and mitterlug spring shallow soils with high proportions of coarse fragments and a minor occurrence of fine grained textures are characteristic for that hydrotope the dominance of bluegrass sesleria albicans in the understorey vegetation indicates mostly dry site conditions as a result of low water storage capacities and locations on sun exposed slopes hyd b2 represents the white sedge beech forest type and is the only hydrotope that can be found in every investigated recharge area here the characteristic soil types show more fined grained textures as well as moderate thicknesses thus having an elevated storage capacity and a lower permeability than soils on the hyd b1 sites white sedges carex alba were mapped as the dominant understorey vegetation and indicate moderately fresh site conditions hyd b3 is the christmas rose beech forest type and occurs in the kerschbaum and mitterlug recharge areas moderate to great solum thicknesses of predominantly loam textured soils are characteristic for these sites the incidence of christmas roses helleborus niger points towards fresh site conditions hyd b4 is the wood barley beech forest type and exclusively occurs in the hinterlug recharge area as compared to the former beech forest type hydrotopes hyd b4 soils have the highest loam contents as well as the greatest soil depths permanently moist site conditions are characteristic for hyd b4 and evidenced by the presence of wood barley hordelymus europaeus and woodruff galium odoratum 3 methods 3 1 modeling concept lukars aims to simulate the hydrological processes that take place in each hydrotope to simulate their respective interaction with the saturated groundwater system and finally to reproduce the observed discharge behavior of a spring similar to tritz et al 2011 we consider the hydrotopes to conceptually represent the vadose zone soil epikarst infiltration zone and to be directly connected to the saturated zone in the model all hydrotopes receive an effective precipitation input that depends on the hydrotopes canopy interception evapotranspiration and snow melt retention in winter moreover each hydrotope is characterized by a specific retention capacity therefore the same input signal leads to different reactions of the hydrotopes both under dry emin and wet conditions emax the conceptual model considers that the activation of conduits is faster if infiltration happens faster which is less retained in a thin hydrotope low soil storage than in a thick one high soil storage the basic idea of implementing a series of hydrotopes in a single modeling framework is based on the assumption of a hydrophysical uniqueness of each hydrotope in particular the model aims to reproduce hydrotope specific hysteresis cycles and the hydrological effects of long dry and wet cycles on each hydrotope the temporal state of the catchment storage system i e dry or wet conditions therefore plays an important role for the initialization of different discharge processes tritz et al 2011 mcnamara et al 2011 fig 3 illustrates the structure of lukars and the possible flow processes that are described in the following 1 part of the water is moved out of the catchment once a hydrotope specific threshold esec is exceeded esec l is defined as an activation level for flow processes leading to water losses i e overland flow processes and secondary spring activation mazzilli et al 2017 from a conceptual perspective the flow component qsec l3t 1 integrates the flows that do not arrive at a regarded karst spring and that are transferred outside the investigated recharge area 2 another part of the water stored in a hydrotope is discharged to the outlet of the catchment qhyd 1 to qhyd 4 l3t 1 if the hydrotope specific maximum storage capacity emax l is exceeded this flow is considered a quickflow component occurring in preferential flow paths such as subsurface conduits and is responsible for the fast reaction of a spring discharge to rainfall and snowmelt events blume and van meerveld 2015 the conceptual idea is that the hydrotopes with shallow and coarse grained soils have the highest connectivity to karst conduits e g hyd 2 in fig 3 the quickflow stops once the storage volume drops below the hydrotope specific minimum storage capacity emin l 3 a next part of the water stored in a hydrotope leaks into a lower reservoir b as inter storage flow qis l3t 1 this flow represents the process of groundwater recharge deep and fine textured soils provide a more stable groundwater recharge e g hyd 4 in fig 3 than shallow and coarse textured soils e g hyd 2 in fig 3 4 the last flow component qb l3t 1 represents water transferred from the storage b to the spring this flow to the spring outlet simulates a baseflow contribution from the phreatic aquifer system to the spring discharge 3 2 governing equations the modeling approach we propose to use is based on the application of a non linear storage threshold function similar to what is suggested in tritz et al 2011 in the following the x subscript notation indicates that the respective terms are hydrotope specific lukars solves the following balance equation for each hydrotope 1 d e x dt s x q sec x q is x q hyd x a x if e x 0 0 if e x 0 where ex indicates the water level l in hydrotope x t t is the time whereas sx represents the hydrotope specific sink and source term as a mass balance of precipitation snow melt evapotranspiration and interception lt 1 as detailed in the next section ax l2 is the absolute area covered by the respective hydrotope for the baseflow storage the following balance equation is implemented in the model 2 d e b dt q is q b a if e b 0 0 if e b 0 where eb is the water level l in the baseflow storage and qis l3t 1 stands for the total flow from all hydrotopes to the baseflow storage the variable a l2 represents the whole catchment area eqs 1 and 2 are solved for each time step n using their discretized forms as given in eqs 3 and 4 respectively 3 e x n 1 m a x 0 e x n s x n q sec x n q is x n q hyd x n a x δ t 4 e b n 1 m a x 0 e b n q is n q b n a δ t the discharge terms are computed as follows 5 q hyd x n ε n max 0 e x n e min x e max x e min x α k hyd x l hyd x a x 6 q is x n k is x e x n a x 7 q sec x n k sec x m a x 0 e x n e sec x a x 8 q b n k b e b n a emax x l and emin x l are the upper and lower storage thresholds of the hydrotope and esec x l is the hydrotope specific activation level for a secondary spring discharge following the notation of tritz et al 2011 kis x lt 1 and ksec x lt 1 are the discharge coefficients for qis x l3t 1 and qsec x l3t 1 respectively the discharge coefficient for the quickflow of a hydrotope is represented by khyd x l2t 1 notice that all three discharge coefficients are hydrotope specific in contrast with tritz et al 2011 we consider the term lhyd x l which is the hydrotopes mean distance to the adjacent spring and accounts for the relative location of the same hydrotope types in a specific catchment the ratio between khyd and lhyd represents the discharge coefficient the dimensionless connectivity activation indicator ε specifies whether or not the quickflow component from a hydrotope is active during time step n and is defined as follows 9 ε n 1 0 if ε n 0 e x n 1 e max x or if ε n 1 e x n 1 e min x 10 ε n 1 1 if ε n 0 e x n 1 e max x or if ε n 1 e x n 1 e min x for each time step the total inter storage discharge qis l3t 1 computed as the sum of the inter storage discharge of each hydroptope is added to the underlying linear storage finally the spring discharge qtot l3t 1 is computed as the sum of the quick flow provided by each hydrotope and the baseflow component from the linear storage 11 q tot n q b n x q hyd x n 3 3 sink and source terms interception of solid and liquid precipitation and evapotranspiration losses are computed separately by the model since interception is high in forested sites while evapotranspiration is high from non forest surfaces in our case quarries and pastures moreover we applied a degree day model martinec 1960 to describe snow melt and accumulation in the study area the model first estimates daily losses from interception then it computes snow accumulation and snowmelt finally the removal of evapotranspiration losses is calculated the input term sx lt 1 in eq 1 is calculated as follows 12 s x m d e t d if p 0 and s x p i d m d e t d if p 0 where p represents the daily precipitation lt 1 md lt 1 is the amount of snowmelt in the case of the presence of a snow layer and id lt 1 and etd lt 1 are the daily losses of interception and evapotranspiration as indicated in the dvwk 1996 interception in beech dominated forests increases from 11 in the winter season 21st december to 17 in the summer season 21st june and then decreases again to the winter value the daily id time series was generated via linear interpolation between these two values to avoid unrealistic interception losses during heavy rainfall events percentage losses were limited to a maximum of 5 mmd 1 markart et al 2006 in the non forested hydrotopes id is set to 0 since no interception can occur considering the data availability we used the method proposed by thornthwaite 1948 to calculate potential evapotranspiration etpot based on monthly mean temperatures as follows 13 et pot 16 10 t h r where etpot lt 1 is the monthly potential evapotranspiration t c is the mean monthly temperature and h is the heat index defined as 14 h t 5 1 514 15 r 6 75 e 7 h 3 7 71 e 5 h 2 1 792 e 2 h 0 49239 with exponent r given by the computed sum of monthly etpot represents an estimate for months with a length of 30 days and 12 h of possible sunshine per day for simplicity reasons we considered etpot to be representative estimates for each month and did not further adjust the monthly time series regarding differences in the sum of the days of a month and the latitudinal variability of possible sunshine hours per day thus we divided etpot by the number of days and assumed the resulting etd lt 1 to be representative for the 15th day of a month similar to our interception calculations we interpolated linearly between these values to obtain a characteristic time series of etd the degree day method we applied in lukars is given by 16 m pot f m a x 0 t t f where mpot stands for the potential melt rate in the form of a snow water equivalent lt 1 t is the daily mean temperature c tf represents a threshold temperature c controlling either snow accumulations or melts and f is defined as the degree day factor lt 1 c 1 we assumed the following conditions for snow accumulation ssnow l and actual snowmelt md lt 1 and 17 s snow n s x n if t n t f

the notations used in lukars is further provided in supplementary material b 3 4 estimation of the hydrotope storage thresholds differences in physical soil properties are the most important criteria to differentiate the hydrotopes namely soil texture and soil thickness are the most relevant factors for the internal hydrological behavior of a hydrotope to estimate the storage thresholds emin and emax for each of the considered hydrotopes we used a new hydropedological fieldguide dwa 2018 that was developed to characterize a site of interest in terms of hydrological aspects kohl et al 2016 site mapping with this tool is performed analogous to the german soil classification system ad hoc arbeitsgruppe boden 2005 the tool derives the dominant hydrological processes as well as the storage capacities under the dry and wet conditions of a selected site based on the physical soil catchment and land use information supplementary material c to translate qualitative information about the soil properties of the hydrotopes in our study area into quantitative values i e soil thickness and texture we used the available data for similar sites presented by leitgeb 2013 finally we took the storage capacities for dry and wet conditions as indicated by the hydropedological fieldguide to set emin and emax threshold values for each hydrotope 3 5 calibration and validation process to calibrate the snow module of the model we converted the measured snow depth time series at hinterlug weather station bmnt 2018 in snow water equivalent swe time series using the approach of jonas et al 2009 the temperature thresholds for the three spring catchment areas were chosen according to the main exposition of each recharge area the natural hydrological behavior of the hydrotopes i e groundwater recharge quickflow and storage is predetermined by their physical properties hence the parameters describing the behavior of a hydrotope should be calibrated accordingly and should be consistent with the expected hydrological response of the system this means for example that the hydrotope with the most coarse grained and shallowest soils should have the highest discharge parameter khyd and the lowest range of storage volume emax emin once calibrated khyd remains constant while transferring the hydrotopes to other catchments the discharge coefficient will vary among different catchments according to the spatial distribution of the hydrotopes in the catchment since it depends on the mean distance between the area covered by a hydrotope and the outlet lhyd hence each hydrotope should be transferable to other catchment areas by solely modifying the exponent α esec and ksec in this way different catchment characteristics such as the steepness of the slopes can be included since ksec is the most unknown parameter in our modeling approach we carefully calibrated it so that ksec has a maximum range of two orders of magnitude with regard to all hydrotopes the parameter sets for hyd b1 b2 and b3 were calibrated for the kerschbaum recharge area and hyd p and b4 were calibrated in the hinterlug catchment since we did not have any information about the soil characteristics of hyd p we calibrated this particular hydrotope based on the known pasture properties derived from comparable study areas and determined the storage thresholds with the hydropedological fieldguide dwa 2018 the parameters of hyd b2 were transferred from the kerschbaum to the hinterlug catchment note that the mitterlug spring discharge is not measured directly at the spring itself but at a storage system located behind an overflow basin this leads to the fact that this time series is unusable to quantitatively assess the correctness of the hydrotopes parametrization at mitterlug spring on a daily scale thus we calculated monthly mean values from the daily discharge time series measured at the storage system since neither water leaves nor additional water enters the system before the monitoring point we used the monthly mean discharge for validation we treat this catchment as an ungauged one for which we validate the parameter sets of the hydrotopes as determined for the kerschbaum and hinterlug recharge areas the models were calibrated and validated for the years 2006 and 2007 when the dolomite quarries covered 4 of the kerschbaum recharge area for further model validation as well as to proof its applicability for land use change impact studies we also run lukars for the kerschbaum catchment for the years 2010 2013 when the area covered by the dolomite quarries almost doubled fig 7 at the expense of the area covered by hyd b2 due to the presence of large data gaps in the observed discharge time series from 2010 to 2013 we focused our model validation on three distinct timeframes in 2010 2012 and 2013 for which we have reliable measurements these three validation periods comprise high and low flow conditions to ensure a meaningful evaluation of the model results for different hydrological states of the system more information about the input data used for the model simulations is presented in supplementary material d the implemented model is provided on https github com dbittner87 lukars 4 results 4 1 calibration and validation periods the chosen parameter sets of all hydrotopes the baseflow storages of the three recharge areas as well as the snow model parameters are presented in table 2 the results of the calibration and validation periods of the snow model as well as the simulated and observed hydrographs of the kerschbaum and hinterlug springs are presented in fig 4 we can observe that the snow model overestimates the swe from january 2006 to april 2006 whereas the kerschbaum snow model produces higher swe compared to the hinterlug snow model however the timing of snow retention and the snowmelt of both models fits reasonably well similarly the snow models accurately match the timing of retention and melt during the validation phase the comparison between observed and simulated hydrographs qtot indicates that lukars is able to simulate the observed discharge behavior in the kerschbaum and hinterlug springs accurately a nash sutcliffe efficiency nse nash and sutcliffe 1970 of 0 64 for the kerschbaum spring and a nse of 0 76 for the hinterlug spring highlight an accurate reproduction of the observed discharge table 3 moreover a mae of 0 76 ls 1 for the kerschbaum spring and a mae of 1 72 ls 1 for the hinterlug spring also indicate that there is an acceptable reproduction of the simulated discharge when focusing on the calibration period of the kerschbaum spring the model mostly matches the observed peaks as well as the recession limbs of peak discharges here the model overestimates the peak at the beginning of april 2006 and slightly undershoots the summer peak discharges a similar behavior can be observed for the hinterlug discharge the model is able to reproduce the measured discharge time series but it also fits the peak in april 2006 in contrast the model underestimates the pronounced peak discharge recorded in the hinterlug hydrograph in february 2006 the simulated peak discharges in summer 2006 match the recorded time series reasonably well with respect to the validation period the calibrated kerschbaum model fits the measured hydrograph in 2007 a nse of 0 54 and a mae of 0 77 ls 1 underline a good match between the observed discharge behavior and our simulations similar to the validation of the kerschbaum spring the results for hinterlug show an acceptable match between observed and simulated discharge time series in contrast to the kerschbaum model the hinterlug model underestimates the peak discharges in january april and december 2007 however a nse of 0 77 and a mae of 1 09 ls 1 indicate the ability of the model to reproduce the total discharge and the discharge dynamics recorded in the hinterlug spring table 3 the highest specific quickflow qhyd in the kerschbaum recharge area originates from hyd b1 in response to rainfall or snowmelt events whereas hyd b2 and b3 show weaker quickflow responses fig 5 the variability of qhyd is highest in hyd b1 and lowest in hyd b3 in the recharge area of the hinterlug spring qhyd is highest in hyd p and b2 whereof the later shows the highest variance of the specific discharge however hyd b4 generates the highest qhyd in response to the snowmelt event in april 2006 moreover qhyd of hyd b4 appears to be the most dynamic hydrotope for what concerns the steepness of the recession limbs in the hydrograph qhyd originating from hyd p is less variable as compared to hyd b2 and b4 throughout the calibration and validation period qhyd from hyd q is constantly 0 considering the specific recharge qis the highest flow contributions in the kerschbaum recharge area originate from hyd b1 followed by hyd b2 and b3 fig 5 similar to the quickflow the variability of qis is highest in hyd b1 and lowest in hyd b3 in the hinterlug catchment the most specific qis originates from hyd b2 followed by hyd p the specific qis from hyd b4 can be considered of minor importance compared to the recharge from both other hydrotopes qis from hyd q is constantly 0 4 2 validation of hydrotopes concept in ungauged spring catchments as pointed out in section 3 5 we calculated the monthly means of the mitterlug spring discharge to enable a quantitative comparison between model and measurements this monthly time series and the simulated hydrograph of the mitterlug model are visualized in fig 6 the simulated time series was obtained by carefully calibrating the ksec parameters in the same range in which ksec of the hydrotopes in the other recharge areas are located regarding the north exposition of the whole recharge area we increased tf of the applied snow model to account for the natural delay of spring discharge onset in response to longer snow retention phases an overall fit between the monthly qsim and the monthly qobs can be observed throughout the two simulated years 2006 2007 in 2006 both the modeled annual trend and the total discharge adequately reproduce the observed values in 2007 the simulation results still reproduce the behavior of the aggregated monthly time series however the simulated discharge slightly overshoots the observed time series finally a nse of 0 83 and a mae of 0 49 ls 1 highlight a good match between the monthly means of observed and simulated discharges 4 3 application of lukars for land use change a comparison between the model performances under changed land use conditions is visualized in fig 7 we can observe that the model considering 4 of area covered by quarries leads to higher discharge compared to the model in which we correctly reproduce the increase in the area covered by quarries particularly the simulated low flow discharges deviate most in the two modeled hydrographs when focusing on the three distinct validation periods fig 7a c we see that the simulation results considering a larger share of hyd q better match the observed discharge in contrast the model run with 4 quarries systematically overestimates the measured records the results from the updated model are in good agreement in particular considering the recorded peak flow events during the validation phases in 2010 and 2012 fig 7a and b although the model results obtained considering the occurred land use change underestimate the peak flows during the low flow period in 2013 fig 7c the modeled low flow discharge fits the measured time series reasonably well we can also observe in all validation periods a consistent increase of the nse and a decrease in the mae for the model considering land use change in comparison to the model neglecting the effect of the quarry table 4 5 discussion 5 1 evaluation of the hydrotope based modeling approach lukars regarding the error statistics determined for the simulation runs of the calibration and validation period for the kerschbaum and hinterlug spring we can state that according to the nse and mae table 3 the results of both models accurately match the observed discharges in particular when focusing on the peak discharges in 2006 and 2007 fig 4 the hydrotopes modeling approach fits the temporal dynamics and the total amounts of the karst typical sharp peak discharges in response to both snowmelt and rainfall furthermore the model captures peak discharges in response to rainfall events after precedent wet e g 06 2006 and precedent dry e g 05 2007 periods thus showing its ability to simulate the hydrological response of the soil epikarst system following different antecedent conditions the overall match of the hydrograph recession limbs as a physical indicator for karst conduit depletion and transition from conduit to matrix flow underlines the model s capability to reproduce the temporal internal dynamics of the karst storage system in addition the good agreement of simulated and measured low flow periods highlight that the baseflow can be expressed as the sum of a continuous water supply from the hydrotopes qhyd to the spring and the flow from a collective reservoir qb the largest deviations between qobs and qsim occur when snow processes affect spring discharges in particular the underestimation of qsim at hinterlug in february 2006 and from march to april 2007 and the overestimation during the snow retention phase in winter 2006 2007 at kerschbaum and hinterlug springs in particular for the hinterlug spring these deviations explain the relatively high mae of 1 72 ls 1 during the calibration year 2006 we argue that these discrepancies result from swe over and underestimation since the modeled discharge peaks in response to rainfall events coincide with the monitored discharge although we introduced different tf to account for the different main expositions of each recharge area these inconsistencies of model simulations i e either over or underestimation of snowmelt and retention suggest that the simplicity of the degree day method is insufficient to adequately model snow processes in this pre alpine catchment regarding the qhyd hydrographs of each hydrotope fig 5 the shallowest and most coarse grained hydrotope soils in particular hyd b1 show the fastest and most intense reactions to the rainfall or snowmelt inputs qis behaves similarly due to the low storage capacity and high discharge coefficient kis the low storage capacity further causes qhyd and qis to become 0 during long dry periods e g in july 2006 this behavior complies with the conceptual idea that the connectivity to fast draining conduits to the spring and flow paths feeding the saturated aquifer is highest if the hydrotope soils are shallow with mainly coarse grained sediments the same relation between soil thickness soil texture and discharge behavior also applies for hyd b2 hyd b3 and hyd p and thus meets our hydrotope modeling concept hyd b2 has a lower storage capacity higher discharge parameters kis and khyd and consequently has a more variable specific discharge than hyd b3 in terms of qhyd and qis when comparing the qhyd and qis of hyd b2 in the kerschbaum and hinterlug recharge areas fig 5 both specific discharge time series are more dynamic in the hinterlug recharge area than in the kerschbaum one these differences in the specific discharge behavior are the result of different mean distances from the hyd b2 to the respective spring lhyd and justify the use of lhyd as a location parameter for any hydrotope in a defined recharge area despite the high storage capacity and the low khyd of hyd b4 in the hinterlug recharge area qhyd originating from hyd b4 is strongly dynamic with partially high specific discharge fig 5 since hyd b4 covers 79 of the hinterlug recharge area and with regard to the pronounced peak discharges in qobs at hinterlug spring fig 4 this dynamic contribution of qhyd is of major importance to adequately reproduce qobs by qsim we argue that the quickflow in the hinterlug recharge area is the result of pushing old water from the hydrotope s high storage volume towards the spring once new water enters the system during a rainfall or snowmelt event a process similar to the return flow occurring on steep slopes with layered soil structures this further explains the constantly low specific qis originating from hyd b4 with the chosen hydrotope parameter sets we were able to simulate the assumed variability of qhyd and qis for each hydrotope fig 5 i e higher variability with shallow soils composed of a mainly coarse grained soil texture e g hyd b1 and lower variability with thick and mainly fine textured soils e g hyd 3 hence our calibration approach to decrease khyd and to increase the range between emin and emax in parallel with more fine textured and thicker hydrotope soils leads to plausible hydrological behaviors of each hydrotope moreover the thresholds emin and emax as determined with dwa 2018 constrain the storage capacities of the hydrotopes reasonably well 5 2 model validation in the ungauged mitterlug spring recharge area given the results of the application example for the mitterlug spring we consider the good fit between the monthly qobs and qsim fig 6 as a proof of the concept of lukars since we obtained the results by simply transferring the parameter sets of the present hydrotopes as determined in two distinct recharge areas apart from the parametrization of the hydrotopes the good match between the monthly time series furthermore corroborates the applicability of the distance parameter lhyd as denominator in the discharge coefficient the increased tf and the corresponding delayed onset of snowmelt at mitterlug spring is justified by the north exposition of the whole recharge area however a measured time series of daily discharge would be needed to quantitatively validate the hydrotopes transferability with regard to the peak discharges and recession parts of the daily time series 5 3 model validation for land use change impacts with respect to the model application for the years 2010 2013 to validate its applicability for land use change impact studies a significant improvement of the model results was achieved when increasing hyd q to 7 the systematic overestimation of the model simulations including 4 hyd q results from an overestimated share of area that contributes to the total discharge in the kerschbaum spring when increasing the area of hyd q at the expense of hyd b2 we reduced the total discharge contribution from hyd b2 in the recharge area due to the fact that qis is higher than qhyd in hyd b2 fig 5 this surface reduction primarily leads to a reduction of the baseflow qb the lower baseflow explains why the discharge time series of both model simulations fig 7 deviate most during low flow periods the good fit between the simulated discharge of the updated model and the measured hydrograph during both high flow fig 7a and b and low flow periods fig 7c indicates that the improvements of the model results are not only related to one specific condition of the natural hydrograph the undershot peak discharges during the low flow period in 2013 fig 7c are related to underestimated responses to moderate precipitation events 15 mmd 1 followed by dry periods although the model does not match these peak discharges in 2013 the low flow discharge is properly described by the model results in addition these peak discharge underestimations are the result of a non exceedance of emax in hyd b1 and the related non appearance of qhyd from this hydrotope not shown and thus are not related to the land use change adaptation in the model transferred to our understanding of the karst system this land use change leads to a reduction of groundwater recharge less recharge subsequently causes a reduction of the low flow discharge in the kerschbaum spring 5 4 model uncertainties the proposed model lukars requires as fundamental input data a reliable size for the catchment area and a detailed soil classification for the definition of the hydrotopes both information can be gathered by tailored field campaigns and an inaccurate description of the catchment size or of the hydrotope classification leads to major errors in model output mazzilli et al 2012 for what concerns meteorological input data at the moment the model uses a single time series as input this makes the model suitable for small size catchments typical for water supply systems in alpine regions the extension to larger catchments will require a proper management of meteorological input data in future versions of the model this aspect will be included considering approaches commonly used for semi distributed hydrological models bieger et al 2017 finally although the model aims to be as parsimonious as possible we have a large amount of fitting parameters 24 for the kerschbaum spring 16 for the hinterlug spring and 4 for the mitterlug recharge area and most of them cannot be explicitly derived from independent field observations in this context we point out the importance of performing a rigorous parameter uncertainty analysis and we warmly recommend whenever possible to perform a multi objective model calibration moussu et al 2011 mazzilli et al 2013 tuo et al 2018 to reduce model equifinality the purpose of this work is to show that it is possible to include land use change in a hydrological karst model using hydrotopes as fundamental units therefore we applied a very simple calibration approach based on trial and error and on our expert knowledge about the study area in bittner et al 2018 we illustrate how the model parameters are informed by the spring discharge data an automatic calibration toolbox for lukars is currently under development and will be released for free 6 conclusion in this study we developed a semi distributed conceptual modeling approach lukars that lumps the different hydrotopes as stand alone units in a catchment we were able to proof the applicability and transferability of our modeling concept by applying the calibrated hydrotopes to other recharge areas in which those hydrotopes were mapped furthermore we showed that the presented approach provides a valuable tool for land use change impact studies in karstic systems by validating the calibrated kerschbaum model for a period in which the recharge area suffered from increasing dolomite mining generally the calibrated hydrotopes should be tested in other karst catchments in order to validate their parametrization as well as to investigate the relevance of the calibration parameters for an accurate process representation considering different catchment characteristics an example is hyd b4 which has the highest storage capacity solely regarding its physical properties but only occurs in the hinterlug recharge area with the steepest slopes of all catchments making a further validation of the parametrization indispensable for catchments with less steep slopes since the applicability of lukars in ungauged catchments and for land use change investigations is limited to calibrated hydrotopes that were validated for specific site conditions more investigations are required to parametrize and test more hydrotopes with different soil and land use properties acknowledgement the first author acknowledges funding from tum igsse in the framework of the unmix project

6886,hydrological models represent valuable tools to investigate the impacts of land use changes on water resources most commonly distributed physically based models are applied for land use change impact studies in hydrology however providing a physically based and detailed description of subsurface flows in karst systems is challenging lumped models in contrast are easy to implement and widely used in karst hydrological research albeit not applicable for land use change impact studies to overcome these limitations we developed a new semi distributed model lukars land use change modeling in karst systems that lumps the predominant hydrotopes i e distinct landscape units characterized by homogeneous hydrological properties as a result of similar land use and soil types present in a catchment as independent non linear units flows from each hydrotope represent a specific response of the vadose zone soil epikarst infiltration zone in a defined recharge area the saturated zone consists of a single linear storage unit recharged by each hydrotope independently the main goal of this approach was to investigate land use change impacts in a dolomite karst system exploited for the water supply of the city of waidhofen a d ybbs austria by changing the area covered by each hydrotope here land use changes occured in the form of increasing spaces used for dolomite mining and at the expense of existing forest sites with our parametrized model we were able to reproduce the measured discharge in the largest spring of the waidhofen karst system kerschbaum spring moreover we succeeded in transferring the parametrized hydrotopes to other recharge areas hinterlug and mitterlug and validated the transferability of the modeling approach finally we successfully showed the model s applicability for land use change impact studies by validating the calibrated model in a period in which the space of the dolomite quarries in the kerschbaum recharge area almost doubled the results of our study show that an increase of the dolomite quarries negatively affects the water supply of the city of waidhofen a d ybbs keywords karst aquifer karst modeling rainfall discharge model land use change hydrotope 1 introduction karst aquifers constitute a major worldwide source of freshwater supply delbart et al 2016 hosseini et al 2017 thus special importance is paid to carbonate rock aquifers in hydrological research and water resource management hartmann et al 2014 jin et al 2015 chang et al 2017 filippini et al 2018 a detailed knowledge of hydrological processes i e groundwater recharge storage and discharge as well as of the land use impacts on water quality and availability are of primary interest for sustainable exploitation of any karst aquifer hydrological models therefore serve as important tools to investigate the hydrological functioning of karst systems jourde et al 2015 however hartmann et al 2014 outlined that land use change impact studies have rarely been conducted explicitly for karst catchment areas and they highlighted the necessity of such studies for sustainable water resource management in karstic areas therefore the aim of this work is to present a new conceptual modeling approach that allows for the simulation of land use change impacts on the drinking water supply from karst aquifers black box models labat et al 1999 2000 hu et al 2008 jukić and denić jukić 2008 and lumped conceptual models mangin 1975 arikan 1988 fleury 2005 fleury et al 2007 tritz et al 2011 hartmann et al 2012a chang et al 2017 mazzilli et al 2017 are the most commonly applied modeling approaches in karst hydrological research however black box models can only be considered reliable for the conditions specific to their calibration period hartmann et al 2014 and lumped models assume one single water input time series for the considered system scanlon et al 2002 hartmann et al 2012b these two features make these modeling approaches inappropriate for land use change impact studies hartmann et al 2014 distributed process based models are often used to assess potential impacts of land use changes on hydrological systems chen et al 2017 they aim to consider the spatial variability of hydrological parameters as well as the heterogeneous effects of land use and soil properties in a catchment although reimann et al 2011 and kordilla et al 2012 introduced promising modeling approaches for the distributed simulation of hydrological processes in karst aquifers their application is usually hampered by the high complexity of subsurface systems and a general limitation in data availability jukić and denić jukić 2009 hartmann et al 2014 ladouche et al 2014 to overcome these limitations we hypothesize that the recharge area of a given karst system can be subdivided into distinct units defined as hydrotopes koeck and hochbichler 2012 we define hydrotopes as independent model units described by homogeneous hydrological characteristics in particular infiltration properties resulting from similar land use and soil types therefore we assume homogeneous infiltration properties for a given soil type with the same bedrock due to similar formation conditions of the saprolite i e chemically weathered rock williams 1983 the concept of hydrotopes was successfully applied in former hydrological and ecohydrological studies gurtz et al 1999 krysanova et al 2005 however it was not yet applied in the framework of land use change impact studies in karstic systems therefore our research objectives are i to create a new semi distributed modeling approach that lumps the predominant hydrotopes present in a catchment ii to calibrate and validate the modeling approach for a reference karst system iii to proof our concept by transferring the modeling approach to other karst systems and their related catchments while maintaining the calibrated hydrotope parameters and iv to investigate land use change impacts by changing the area covered by each hydrotope in lukars we apply a non linear transfer function proposed by tritz et al 2011 which is able to simulate the hysteretic behavior of the soil and epikarst storage that results from different water retention potentials during wetting and drying cycles different from tritz et al 2011 we use that function for the implementation of individual hydrotopes constituting the catchment area of a karst spring in this way each hydrotope is characterized by a specific hydrological response which contributes to the total spring discharge the saturated zone consists of a single linear storage unit recharged by each hydrotope independently thus the proposed modeling approach benefits from the advantages of lumped models i e the easy implementation and the low computational power as well as from the characteristics of distributed models i e integration of spatial heterogeneities of soil hydraulic properties to the best of our knowledge such a conceptual modeling approach integrating hydrotopes as lumped non linear storages has not been widely discussed in karst hydrological research sarrazin et al 2018 the paper is structured as follows in section 2 we introduce the main characteristics of our investigated karst region in waidhofen a d ybbs austria in section 3 we present the setup and the governing equations of the hydrotope based modeling approach in section 4 and 5 we present and discuss the results of the model calibration model validation as well as the land use change impacts on the hydrological system finally we conclude our investigations in section 6 2 study area 2 1 catchment description the study area is located 10 km south of the city of waidhofen a d ybbs in lower austria fig 1 this pre alpine region is part of the eastern foothills of the northern calcareous alps with altitudes ranging from 415 to 969 m a s l in this warm moderate regional climate with an annual mean temperature of 8 c mean daily temperatures below freezing occur mainly from december to february annual mean precipitation of 1379 mm was recorded at the weather station hinterlug fig 1b during the period from 1981 to 2014 the annual distribution of precipitation is bimodal with maxima during both the summer june and july and winter months december and january with snowfall dominating precipitation in the winter supplementary material a two small fluvial systems constitute the study area s drainage the waidhofenbach and the lugerbach close to the weather station hinterlug the lugerbach flows into the waidhofenbach which drains most of the study area into the ybbs river in waidhofen the local geology is dominated by a lithologic sequence of dolomitic basement rocks main dolomite triassic age fig 1a and thus typical karst phenomena such as springs dry valleys and caves are present in the study area significant sinkholes are not present in the study area leading to the conclusion that point infiltration plays a minor role for recharge moreover prior investigations revealed that a deep karstified groundwater system exists also below the elevation level of the waidhofenbach valley hacker 2003 considering the specific hydrogeological setting of the area we can assume a well connected network of fractures and conduits the largest springs originating from those karstificable rocks are exploited for the municipal drinking water supply of waidhofen a d ybbs in this work we focus on three distinct springs and their recharge areas namely the kerschbaum 2 5 km2 mitterlug 0 25 km2 and hinterlug 1 8 km2 springs fig 1b the delineation of the respective recharge areas was performed based on tracer tests by hacker 2003 each of these springs is fed by karst aquifers of the main dolomite where the karst system of the hinterlug spring is separated tectonically from the two others by a pronounced strike slip fault that separates the two mountain massifs schnabelberg hinterlug spring in northern part and glashüttenberg kerschbaum and mitterlug spring in southern part even if the kerschbaum and mitterlug springs rise from the same mountain massif prior investigations for the designation of protection areas revealed that the feeding karst aquifers can be considered independent hacker 2003 2 2 hydrotopes in the following we shortly describe the hydrotopes that are dominant in the recharge areas of the three considered springs note that hydrotopes covering less than 1 of the respective recharge areas were not considered assuming that their contribution to the spring discharges is negligible as often done in other hydrological models neitsch et al 2005 and they are merged with the dominant hydrotopes to fill the whole recharge areas a detailed field mapping campaign was carried out by markart et al 2012 following the method by koeck and hochbichler 2012 the result of those field investigations is a detailed classification of the predominant hydrotopes in the study area fig 2 hydrotopes were mapped and classified according to i the overstorey trees as indicators for interception capacities and preferential flow paths in the soil rooting ii the understorey vegetation as an indicator for the hydrological site conditions dry to wet and iii the dominant soil types and respective thicknesses shallow to deep as qualitative parameters for the hydrophysical site properties the soil depths in the study area range from 20 cm to 60 cm markart et al 2012 the spatial share of each hydrotope in all defined recharge areas is shown in table 1 hyd q represents dolomite quarries located in the kerschbaum spring recharge area in 2007 when the orthophoto illustrated in fig 1b was taken the quarries covered 4 of the kerschbaum spring recharge area due to the removal of local vegetation and soil cover the dolomitic basement rocks remained bare in these areas the catchment classifications and the runoff modeling performed according to markart et al 2004 and kohl 2011 revealed that the dolomite quarry surfaces have discharge coefficients of almost 1 and do not contribute to a considerable amount of the recharge in the subsurface karst system instead the quarries are drained by a small creek that flows into the waidhofenbach and thus do not feed the kerschbaum spring fig 1b hyd p indicates pastures located in the mitterlug and hinterlug spring recharge areas hydrotopes b1 b2 b3 and b4 represent the forest type hydrotopes all having beeches fagus sylvatica as the dominant tree species hyd b1 is the bluegrass beech forest hydrotope and is present in the recharge areas of the kerschbaum and mitterlug spring shallow soils with high proportions of coarse fragments and a minor occurrence of fine grained textures are characteristic for that hydrotope the dominance of bluegrass sesleria albicans in the understorey vegetation indicates mostly dry site conditions as a result of low water storage capacities and locations on sun exposed slopes hyd b2 represents the white sedge beech forest type and is the only hydrotope that can be found in every investigated recharge area here the characteristic soil types show more fined grained textures as well as moderate thicknesses thus having an elevated storage capacity and a lower permeability than soils on the hyd b1 sites white sedges carex alba were mapped as the dominant understorey vegetation and indicate moderately fresh site conditions hyd b3 is the christmas rose beech forest type and occurs in the kerschbaum and mitterlug recharge areas moderate to great solum thicknesses of predominantly loam textured soils are characteristic for these sites the incidence of christmas roses helleborus niger points towards fresh site conditions hyd b4 is the wood barley beech forest type and exclusively occurs in the hinterlug recharge area as compared to the former beech forest type hydrotopes hyd b4 soils have the highest loam contents as well as the greatest soil depths permanently moist site conditions are characteristic for hyd b4 and evidenced by the presence of wood barley hordelymus europaeus and woodruff galium odoratum 3 methods 3 1 modeling concept lukars aims to simulate the hydrological processes that take place in each hydrotope to simulate their respective interaction with the saturated groundwater system and finally to reproduce the observed discharge behavior of a spring similar to tritz et al 2011 we consider the hydrotopes to conceptually represent the vadose zone soil epikarst infiltration zone and to be directly connected to the saturated zone in the model all hydrotopes receive an effective precipitation input that depends on the hydrotopes canopy interception evapotranspiration and snow melt retention in winter moreover each hydrotope is characterized by a specific retention capacity therefore the same input signal leads to different reactions of the hydrotopes both under dry emin and wet conditions emax the conceptual model considers that the activation of conduits is faster if infiltration happens faster which is less retained in a thin hydrotope low soil storage than in a thick one high soil storage the basic idea of implementing a series of hydrotopes in a single modeling framework is based on the assumption of a hydrophysical uniqueness of each hydrotope in particular the model aims to reproduce hydrotope specific hysteresis cycles and the hydrological effects of long dry and wet cycles on each hydrotope the temporal state of the catchment storage system i e dry or wet conditions therefore plays an important role for the initialization of different discharge processes tritz et al 2011 mcnamara et al 2011 fig 3 illustrates the structure of lukars and the possible flow processes that are described in the following 1 part of the water is moved out of the catchment once a hydrotope specific threshold esec is exceeded esec l is defined as an activation level for flow processes leading to water losses i e overland flow processes and secondary spring activation mazzilli et al 2017 from a conceptual perspective the flow component qsec l3t 1 integrates the flows that do not arrive at a regarded karst spring and that are transferred outside the investigated recharge area 2 another part of the water stored in a hydrotope is discharged to the outlet of the catchment qhyd 1 to qhyd 4 l3t 1 if the hydrotope specific maximum storage capacity emax l is exceeded this flow is considered a quickflow component occurring in preferential flow paths such as subsurface conduits and is responsible for the fast reaction of a spring discharge to rainfall and snowmelt events blume and van meerveld 2015 the conceptual idea is that the hydrotopes with shallow and coarse grained soils have the highest connectivity to karst conduits e g hyd 2 in fig 3 the quickflow stops once the storage volume drops below the hydrotope specific minimum storage capacity emin l 3 a next part of the water stored in a hydrotope leaks into a lower reservoir b as inter storage flow qis l3t 1 this flow represents the process of groundwater recharge deep and fine textured soils provide a more stable groundwater recharge e g hyd 4 in fig 3 than shallow and coarse textured soils e g hyd 2 in fig 3 4 the last flow component qb l3t 1 represents water transferred from the storage b to the spring this flow to the spring outlet simulates a baseflow contribution from the phreatic aquifer system to the spring discharge 3 2 governing equations the modeling approach we propose to use is based on the application of a non linear storage threshold function similar to what is suggested in tritz et al 2011 in the following the x subscript notation indicates that the respective terms are hydrotope specific lukars solves the following balance equation for each hydrotope 1 d e x dt s x q sec x q is x q hyd x a x if e x 0 0 if e x 0 where ex indicates the water level l in hydrotope x t t is the time whereas sx represents the hydrotope specific sink and source term as a mass balance of precipitation snow melt evapotranspiration and interception lt 1 as detailed in the next section ax l2 is the absolute area covered by the respective hydrotope for the baseflow storage the following balance equation is implemented in the model 2 d e b dt q is q b a if e b 0 0 if e b 0 where eb is the water level l in the baseflow storage and qis l3t 1 stands for the total flow from all hydrotopes to the baseflow storage the variable a l2 represents the whole catchment area eqs 1 and 2 are solved for each time step n using their discretized forms as given in eqs 3 and 4 respectively 3 e x n 1 m a x 0 e x n s x n q sec x n q is x n q hyd x n a x δ t 4 e b n 1 m a x 0 e b n q is n q b n a δ t the discharge terms are computed as follows 5 q hyd x n ε n max 0 e x n e min x e max x e min x α k hyd x l hyd x a x 6 q is x n k is x e x n a x 7 q sec x n k sec x m a x 0 e x n e sec x a x 8 q b n k b e b n a emax x l and emin x l are the upper and lower storage thresholds of the hydrotope and esec x l is the hydrotope specific activation level for a secondary spring discharge following the notation of tritz et al 2011 kis x lt 1 and ksec x lt 1 are the discharge coefficients for qis x l3t 1 and qsec x l3t 1 respectively the discharge coefficient for the quickflow of a hydrotope is represented by khyd x l2t 1 notice that all three discharge coefficients are hydrotope specific in contrast with tritz et al 2011 we consider the term lhyd x l which is the hydrotopes mean distance to the adjacent spring and accounts for the relative location of the same hydrotope types in a specific catchment the ratio between khyd and lhyd represents the discharge coefficient the dimensionless connectivity activation indicator ε specifies whether or not the quickflow component from a hydrotope is active during time step n and is defined as follows 9 ε n 1 0 if ε n 0 e x n 1 e max x or if ε n 1 e x n 1 e min x 10 ε n 1 1 if ε n 0 e x n 1 e max x or if ε n 1 e x n 1 e min x for each time step the total inter storage discharge qis l3t 1 computed as the sum of the inter storage discharge of each hydroptope is added to the underlying linear storage finally the spring discharge qtot l3t 1 is computed as the sum of the quick flow provided by each hydrotope and the baseflow component from the linear storage 11 q tot n q b n x q hyd x n 3 3 sink and source terms interception of solid and liquid precipitation and evapotranspiration losses are computed separately by the model since interception is high in forested sites while evapotranspiration is high from non forest surfaces in our case quarries and pastures moreover we applied a degree day model martinec 1960 to describe snow melt and accumulation in the study area the model first estimates daily losses from interception then it computes snow accumulation and snowmelt finally the removal of evapotranspiration losses is calculated the input term sx lt 1 in eq 1 is calculated as follows 12 s x m d e t d if p 0 and s x p i d m d e t d if p 0 where p represents the daily precipitation lt 1 md lt 1 is the amount of snowmelt in the case of the presence of a snow layer and id lt 1 and etd lt 1 are the daily losses of interception and evapotranspiration as indicated in the dvwk 1996 interception in beech dominated forests increases from 11 in the winter season 21st december to 17 in the summer season 21st june and then decreases again to the winter value the daily id time series was generated via linear interpolation between these two values to avoid unrealistic interception losses during heavy rainfall events percentage losses were limited to a maximum of 5 mmd 1 markart et al 2006 in the non forested hydrotopes id is set to 0 since no interception can occur considering the data availability we used the method proposed by thornthwaite 1948 to calculate potential evapotranspiration etpot based on monthly mean temperatures as follows 13 et pot 16 10 t h r where etpot lt 1 is the monthly potential evapotranspiration t c is the mean monthly temperature and h is the heat index defined as 14 h t 5 1 514 15 r 6 75 e 7 h 3 7 71 e 5 h 2 1 792 e 2 h 0 49239 with exponent r given by the computed sum of monthly etpot represents an estimate for months with a length of 30 days and 12 h of possible sunshine per day for simplicity reasons we considered etpot to be representative estimates for each month and did not further adjust the monthly time series regarding differences in the sum of the days of a month and the latitudinal variability of possible sunshine hours per day thus we divided etpot by the number of days and assumed the resulting etd lt 1 to be representative for the 15th day of a month similar to our interception calculations we interpolated linearly between these values to obtain a characteristic time series of etd the degree day method we applied in lukars is given by 16 m pot f m a x 0 t t f where mpot stands for the potential melt rate in the form of a snow water equivalent lt 1 t is the daily mean temperature c tf represents a threshold temperature c controlling either snow accumulations or melts and f is defined as the degree day factor lt 1 c 1 we assumed the following conditions for snow accumulation ssnow l and actual snowmelt md lt 1 and 17 s snow n s x n if t n t f and s snow n 1 s x n s x n 1 if t n t f t n 1 t f and s snow n 1 max 0 s snow n m d if t n 1 t f 18 m d 0 ift t f and m d m pot if t t f s snow m and m d s snow if t t f s snow m a table summarizing the notations used in lukars is further provided in supplementary material b 3 4 estimation of the hydrotope storage thresholds differences in physical soil properties are the most important criteria to differentiate the hydrotopes namely soil texture and soil thickness are the most relevant factors for the internal hydrological behavior of a hydrotope to estimate the storage thresholds emin and emax for each of the considered hydrotopes we used a new hydropedological fieldguide dwa 2018 that was developed to characterize a site of interest in terms of hydrological aspects kohl et al 2016 site mapping with this tool is performed analogous to the german soil classification system ad hoc arbeitsgruppe boden 2005 the tool derives the dominant hydrological processes as well as the storage capacities under the dry and wet conditions of a selected site based on the physical soil catchment and land use information supplementary material c to translate qualitative information about the soil properties of the hydrotopes in our study area into quantitative values i e soil thickness and texture we used the available data for similar sites presented by leitgeb 2013 finally we took the storage capacities for dry and wet conditions as indicated by the hydropedological fieldguide to set emin and emax threshold values for each hydrotope 3 5 calibration and validation process to calibrate the snow module of the model we converted the measured snow depth time series at hinterlug weather station bmnt 2018 in snow water equivalent swe time series using the approach of jonas et al 2009 the temperature thresholds for the three spring catchment areas were chosen according to the main exposition of each recharge area the natural hydrological behavior of the hydrotopes i e groundwater recharge quickflow and storage is predetermined by their physical properties hence the parameters describing the behavior of a hydrotope should be calibrated accordingly and should be consistent with the expected hydrological response of the system this means for example that the hydrotope with the most coarse grained and shallowest soils should have the highest discharge parameter khyd and the lowest range of storage volume emax emin once calibrated khyd remains constant while transferring the hydrotopes to other catchments the discharge coefficient will vary among different catchments according to the spatial distribution of the hydrotopes in the catchment since it depends on the mean distance between the area covered by a hydrotope and the outlet lhyd hence each hydrotope should be transferable to other catchment areas by solely modifying the exponent α esec and ksec in this way different catchment characteristics such as the steepness of the slopes can be included since ksec is the most unknown parameter in our modeling approach we carefully calibrated it so that ksec has a maximum range of two orders of magnitude with regard to all hydrotopes the parameter sets for hyd b1 b2 and b3 were calibrated for the kerschbaum recharge area and hyd p and b4 were calibrated in the hinterlug catchment since we did not have any information about the soil characteristics of hyd p we calibrated this particular hydrotope based on the known pasture properties derived from comparable study areas and determined the storage thresholds with the hydropedological fieldguide dwa 2018 the parameters of hyd b2 were transferred from the kerschbaum to the hinterlug catchment note that the mitterlug spring discharge is not measured directly at the spring itself but at a storage system located behind an overflow basin this leads to the fact that this time series is unusable to quantitatively assess the correctness of the hydrotopes parametrization at mitterlug spring on a daily scale thus we calculated monthly mean values from the daily discharge time series measured at the storage system since neither water leaves nor additional water enters the system before the monitoring point we used the monthly mean discharge for validation we treat this catchment as an ungauged one for which we validate the parameter sets of the hydrotopes as determined for the kerschbaum and hinterlug recharge areas the models were calibrated and validated for the years 2006 and 2007 when the dolomite quarries covered 4 of the kerschbaum recharge area for further model validation as well as to proof its applicability for land use change impact studies we also run lukars for the kerschbaum catchment for the years 2010 2013 when the area covered by the dolomite quarries almost doubled fig 7 at the expense of the area covered by hyd b2 due to the presence of large data gaps in the observed discharge time series from 2010 to 2013 we focused our model validation on three distinct timeframes in 2010 2012 and 2013 for which we have reliable measurements these three validation periods comprise high and low flow conditions to ensure a meaningful evaluation of the model results for different hydrological states of the system more information about the input data used for the model simulations is presented in supplementary material d the implemented model is provided on https github com dbittner87 lukars 4 results 4 1 calibration and validation periods the chosen parameter sets of all hydrotopes the baseflow storages of the three recharge areas as well as the snow model parameters are presented in table 2 the results of the calibration and validation periods of the snow model as well as the simulated and observed hydrographs of the kerschbaum and hinterlug springs are presented in fig 4 we can observe that the snow model overestimates the swe from january 2006 to april 2006 whereas the kerschbaum snow model produces higher swe compared to the hinterlug snow model however the timing of snow retention and the snowmelt of both models fits reasonably well similarly the snow models accurately match the timing of retention and melt during the validation phase the comparison between observed and simulated hydrographs qtot indicates that lukars is able to simulate the observed discharge behavior in the kerschbaum and hinterlug springs accurately a nash sutcliffe efficiency nse nash and sutcliffe 1970 of 0 64 for the kerschbaum spring and a nse of 0 76 for the hinterlug spring highlight an accurate reproduction of the observed discharge table 3 moreover a mae of 0 76 ls 1 for the kerschbaum spring and a mae of 1 72 ls 1 for the hinterlug spring also indicate that there is an acceptable reproduction of the simulated discharge when focusing on the calibration period of the kerschbaum spring the model mostly matches the observed peaks as well as the recession limbs of peak discharges here the model overestimates the peak at the beginning of april 2006 and slightly undershoots the summer peak discharges a similar behavior can be observed for the hinterlug discharge the model is able to reproduce the measured discharge time series but it also fits the peak in april 2006 in contrast the model underestimates the pronounced peak discharge recorded in the hinterlug hydrograph in february 2006 the simulated peak discharges in summer 2006 match the recorded time series reasonably well with respect to the validation period the calibrated kerschbaum model fits the measured hydrograph in 2007 a nse of 0 54 and a mae of 0 77 ls 1 underline a good match between the observed discharge behavior and our simulations similar to the validation of the kerschbaum spring the results for hinterlug show an acceptable match between observed and simulated discharge time series in contrast to the kerschbaum model the hinterlug model underestimates the peak discharges in january april and december 2007 however a nse of 0 77 and a mae of 1 09 ls 1 indicate the ability of the model to reproduce the total discharge and the discharge dynamics recorded in the hinterlug spring table 3 the highest specific quickflow qhyd in the kerschbaum recharge area originates from hyd b1 in response to rainfall or snowmelt events whereas hyd b2 and b3 show weaker quickflow responses fig 5 the variability of qhyd is highest in hyd b1 and lowest in hyd b3 in the recharge area of the hinterlug spring qhyd is highest in hyd p and b2 whereof the later shows the highest variance of the specific discharge however hyd b4 generates the highest qhyd in response to the snowmelt event in april 2006 moreover qhyd of hyd b4 appears to be the most dynamic hydrotope for what concerns the steepness of the recession limbs in the hydrograph qhyd originating from hyd p is less variable as compared to hyd b2 and b4 throughout the calibration and validation period qhyd from hyd q is constantly 0 considering the specific recharge qis the highest flow contributions in the kerschbaum recharge area originate from hyd b1 followed by hyd b2 and b3 fig 5 similar to the quickflow the variability of qis is highest in hyd b1 and lowest in hyd b3 in the hinterlug catchment the most specific qis originates from hyd b2 followed by hyd p the specific qis from hyd b4 can be considered of minor importance compared to the recharge from both other hydrotopes qis from hyd q is constantly 0 4 2 validation of hydrotopes concept in ungauged spring catchments as pointed out in section 3 5 we calculated the monthly means of the mitterlug spring discharge to enable a quantitative comparison between model and measurements this monthly time series and the simulated hydrograph of the mitterlug model are visualized in fig 6 the simulated time series was obtained by carefully calibrating the ksec parameters in the same range in which ksec of the hydrotopes in the other recharge areas are located regarding the north exposition of the whole recharge area we increased tf of the applied snow model to account for the natural delay of spring discharge onset in response to longer snow retention phases an overall fit between the monthly qsim and the monthly qobs can be observed throughout the two simulated years 2006 2007 in 2006 both the modeled annual trend and the total discharge adequately reproduce the observed values in 2007 the simulation results still reproduce the behavior of the aggregated monthly time series however the simulated discharge slightly overshoots the observed time series finally a nse of 0 83 and a mae of 0 49 ls 1 highlight a good match between the monthly means of observed and simulated discharges 4 3 application of lukars for land use change a comparison between the model performances under changed land use conditions is visualized in fig 7 we can observe that the model considering 4 of area covered by quarries leads to higher discharge compared to the model in which we correctly reproduce the increase in the area covered by quarries particularly the simulated low flow discharges deviate most in the two modeled hydrographs when focusing on the three distinct validation periods fig 7a c we see that the simulation results considering a larger share of hyd q better match the observed discharge in contrast the model run with 4 quarries systematically overestimates the measured records the results from the updated model are in good agreement in particular considering the recorded peak flow events during the validation phases in 2010 and 2012 fig 7a and b although the model results obtained considering the occurred land use change underestimate the peak flows during the low flow period in 2013 fig 7c the modeled low flow discharge fits the measured time series reasonably well we can also observe in all validation periods a consistent increase of the nse and a decrease in the mae for the model considering land use change in comparison to the model neglecting the effect of the quarry table 4 5 discussion 5 1 evaluation of the hydrotope based modeling approach lukars regarding the error statistics determined for the simulation runs of the calibration and validation period for the kerschbaum and hinterlug spring we can state that according to the nse and mae table 3 the results of both models accurately match the observed discharges in particular when focusing on the peak discharges in 2006 and 2007 fig 4 the hydrotopes modeling approach fits the temporal dynamics and the total amounts of the karst typical sharp peak discharges in response to both snowmelt and rainfall furthermore the model captures peak discharges in response to rainfall events after precedent wet e g 06 2006 and precedent dry e g 05 2007 periods thus showing its ability to simulate the hydrological response of the soil epikarst system following different antecedent conditions the overall match of the hydrograph recession limbs as a physical indicator for karst conduit depletion and transition from conduit to matrix flow underlines the model s capability to reproduce the temporal internal dynamics of the karst storage system in addition the good agreement of simulated and measured low flow periods highlight that the baseflow can be expressed as the sum of a continuous water supply from the hydrotopes qhyd to the spring and the flow from a collective reservoir qb the largest deviations between qobs and qsim occur when snow processes affect spring discharges in particular the underestimation of qsim at hinterlug in february 2006 and from march to april 2007 and the overestimation during the snow retention phase in winter 2006 2007 at kerschbaum and hinterlug springs in particular for the hinterlug spring these deviations explain the relatively high mae of 1 72 ls 1 during the calibration year 2006 we argue that these discrepancies result from swe over and underestimation since the modeled discharge peaks in response to rainfall events coincide with the monitored discharge although we introduced different tf to account for the different main expositions of each recharge area these inconsistencies of model simulations i e either over or underestimation of snowmelt and retention suggest that the simplicity of the degree day method is insufficient to adequately model snow processes in this pre alpine catchment regarding the qhyd hydrographs of each hydrotope fig 5 the shallowest and most coarse grained hydrotope soils in particular hyd b1 show the fastest and most intense reactions to the rainfall or snowmelt inputs qis behaves similarly due to the low storage capacity and high discharge coefficient kis the low storage capacity further causes qhyd and qis to become 0 during long dry periods e g in july 2006 this behavior complies with the conceptual idea that the connectivity to fast draining conduits to the spring and flow paths feeding the saturated aquifer is highest if the hydrotope soils are shallow with mainly coarse grained sediments the same relation between soil thickness soil texture and discharge behavior also applies for hyd b2 hyd b3 and hyd p and thus meets our hydrotope modeling concept hyd b2 has a lower storage capacity higher discharge parameters kis and khyd and consequently has a more variable specific discharge than hyd b3 in terms of qhyd and qis when comparing the qhyd and qis of hyd b2 in the kerschbaum and hinterlug recharge areas fig 5 both specific discharge time series are more dynamic in the hinterlug recharge area than in the kerschbaum one these differences in the specific discharge behavior are the result of different mean distances from the hyd b2 to the respective spring lhyd and justify the use of lhyd as a location parameter for any hydrotope in a defined recharge area despite the high storage capacity and the low khyd of hyd b4 in the hinterlug recharge area qhyd originating from hyd b4 is strongly dynamic with partially high specific discharge fig 5 since hyd b4 covers 79 of the hinterlug recharge area and with regard to the pronounced peak discharges in qobs at hinterlug spring fig 4 this dynamic contribution of qhyd is of major importance to adequately reproduce qobs by qsim we argue that the quickflow in the hinterlug recharge area is the result of pushing old water from the hydrotope s high storage volume towards the spring once new water enters the system during a rainfall or snowmelt event a process similar to the return flow occurring on steep slopes with layered soil structures this further explains the constantly low specific qis originating from hyd b4 with the chosen hydrotope parameter sets we were able to simulate the assumed variability of qhyd and qis for each hydrotope fig 5 i e higher variability with shallow soils composed of a mainly coarse grained soil texture e g hyd b1 and lower variability with thick and mainly fine textured soils e g hyd 3 hence our calibration approach to decrease khyd and to increase the range between emin and emax in parallel with more fine textured and thicker hydrotope soils leads to plausible hydrological behaviors of each hydrotope moreover the thresholds emin and emax as determined with dwa 2018 constrain the storage capacities of the hydrotopes reasonably well 5 2 model validation in the ungauged mitterlug spring recharge area given the results of the application example for the mitterlug spring we consider the good fit between the monthly qobs and qsim fig 6 as a proof of the concept of lukars since we obtained the results by simply transferring the parameter sets of the present hydrotopes as determined in two distinct recharge areas apart from the parametrization of the hydrotopes the good match between the monthly time series furthermore corroborates the applicability of the distance parameter lhyd as denominator in the discharge coefficient the increased tf and the corresponding delayed onset of snowmelt at mitterlug spring is justified by the north exposition of the whole recharge area however a measured time series of daily discharge would be needed to quantitatively validate the hydrotopes transferability with regard to the peak discharges and recession parts of the daily time series 5 3 model validation for land use change impacts with respect to the model application for the years 2010 2013 to validate its applicability for land use change impact studies a significant improvement of the model results was achieved when increasing hyd q to 7 the systematic overestimation of the model simulations including 4 hyd q results from an overestimated share of area that contributes to the total discharge in the kerschbaum spring when increasing the area of hyd q at the expense of hyd b2 we reduced the total discharge contribution from hyd b2 in the recharge area due to the fact that qis is higher than qhyd in hyd b2 fig 5 this surface reduction primarily leads to a reduction of the baseflow qb the lower baseflow explains why the discharge time series of both model simulations fig 7 deviate most during low flow periods the good fit between the simulated discharge of the updated model and the measured hydrograph during both high flow fig 7a and b and low flow periods fig 7c indicates that the improvements of the model results are not only related to one specific condition of the natural hydrograph the undershot peak discharges during the low flow period in 2013 fig 7c are related to underestimated responses to moderate precipitation events 15 mmd 1 followed by dry periods although the model does not match these peak discharges in 2013 the low flow discharge is properly described by the model results in addition these peak discharge underestimations are the result of a non exceedance of emax in hyd b1 and the related non appearance of qhyd from this hydrotope not shown and thus are not related to the land use change adaptation in the model transferred to our understanding of the karst system this land use change leads to a reduction of groundwater recharge less recharge subsequently causes a reduction of the low flow discharge in the kerschbaum spring 5 4 model uncertainties the proposed model lukars requires as fundamental input data a reliable size for the catchment area and a detailed soil classification for the definition of the hydrotopes both information can be gathered by tailored field campaigns and an inaccurate description of the catchment size or of the hydrotope classification leads to major errors in model output mazzilli et al 2012 for what concerns meteorological input data at the moment the model uses a single time series as input this makes the model suitable for small size catchments typical for water supply systems in alpine regions the extension to larger catchments will require a proper management of meteorological input data in future versions of the model this aspect will be included considering approaches commonly used for semi distributed hydrological models bieger et al 2017 finally although the model aims to be as parsimonious as possible we have a large amount of fitting parameters 24 for the kerschbaum spring 16 for the hinterlug spring and 4 for the mitterlug recharge area and most of them cannot be explicitly derived from independent field observations in this context we point out the importance of performing a rigorous parameter uncertainty analysis and we warmly recommend whenever possible to perform a multi objective model calibration moussu et al 2011 mazzilli et al 2013 tuo et al 2018 to reduce model equifinality the purpose of this work is to show that it is possible to include land use change in a hydrological karst model using hydrotopes as fundamental units therefore we applied a very simple calibration approach based on trial and error and on our expert knowledge about the study area in bittner et al 2018 we illustrate how the model parameters are informed by the spring discharge data an automatic calibration toolbox for lukars is currently under development and will be released for free 6 conclusion in this study we developed a semi distributed conceptual modeling approach lukars that lumps the different hydrotopes as stand alone units in a catchment we were able to proof the applicability and transferability of our modeling concept by applying the calibrated hydrotopes to other recharge areas in which those hydrotopes were mapped furthermore we showed that the presented approach provides a valuable tool for land use change impact studies in karstic systems by validating the calibrated kerschbaum model for a period in which the recharge area suffered from increasing dolomite mining generally the calibrated hydrotopes should be tested in other karst catchments in order to validate their parametrization as well as to investigate the relevance of the calibration parameters for an accurate process representation considering different catchment characteristics an example is hyd b4 which has the highest storage capacity solely regarding its physical properties but only occurs in the hinterlug recharge area with the steepest slopes of all catchments making a further validation of the parametrization indispensable for catchments with less steep slopes since the applicability of lukars in ungauged catchments and for land use change investigations is limited to calibrated hydrotopes that were validated for specific site conditions more investigations are required to parametrize and test more hydrotopes with different soil and land use properties acknowledgement the first author acknowledges funding from tum igsse in the framework of the unmix project

6887,a frozen soil layer may impede snowmelt infiltration resulting in a large amount of runoff that influences the soil water balance and anion movement in the soil profile to examine the relationships among soil frost depth snowmelt runoff and nitrate leaching in agricultural fields we measured both the snowmelt runoff for three winters and other environmental factors including the soil frost depth and nitrate content in a 10 000 m2 field we divided the field into two subplots one was maintained in a natural snow cover condition the control plot and the snow cover was compacted on the other plot the treated plot to enhance the development of the soil frost depth in all three winters soil frost depths in the control plot were 0 2 m and very little runoff was observed during the snowmelt period in contrast the soil frost depth became 0 4 m and a large amount of snowmelt runoff was observed in the treated plot the depth of the peak nitrate concentration after the snowmelt period was shallower in the treated plot compared to the control plot moreover a significant linear relationship was observed between 1 the amount of nitrate in the 0 0 3 m depth after the snowmelt period and 2 the total amount of snowmelt infiltration calculated by subtracting the amount of snowmelt runoff from the amount of snowmelt water these results suggest that snow compaction can be a promising technique to develop a uniform soil frost depth in large scale fields which consequently controls the soil water and nutrient movement in the soil layer keywords no3 n nitrate leaching snowmelt infiltration snow compaction runoff ratio soil frost depth 1 introduction in regions that accumulate snow the snowmelt period is one of the most significant events of the hydrological year e g granger et al 1984 stähli et al 1999 iwata et al 2010b a frozen soil layer impedes snowmelt infiltration which causes large amounts of snowmelt runoff bauder et al 1975 niu and yang 2006 lundberg et al 2016 and soil erosion mcconkey et al 1997 øygarden 2003 ban et al 2016 in the early spring in contrast iwata et al 2008 reported that a thin frozen soil layer 0 2 m did not impede snowmelt infiltration iwata et al 2008 also inferred that deep percolation of nitrate nitrogen no3 n hereafter which is one of the most dominant anions in agricultural soil and generally moves with water also occurred during the snowmelt period some plot scale research iwata et al 2013 yanai et al 2017 has indicated that a lesser amount of no3 n remains near the soil surface after the snowmelt period in fields with a thin 0 2 m frozen soil layer probably because of the larger amount of snowmelt infiltration however there is little data regarding whether a larger amount of no3 n remains near the soil surface in an entire field when a thick frozen soil layer has formed snowmelt runoff resulting from reduced snowmelt infiltration by a frozen soil layer can increase the amount of river water in the early spring shanley and chalmers 1999 some researchers have demonstrated that the quality of runoff water during the snowmelt period is changed by the formation of a frozen soil layer banaszuk et al 2013 eskelinen et al 2016 the effects of a frozen soil layer on the amount of snowmelt runoff the discharge of no3 n and the pathway of these materials were examined in agricultural fields coelho et al 2012 furthermore processes intertwined with snowmelt runoff in fields with frozen soil layers have been previously investigated in the alps bayard et al 2005 forest nyberg et al 2001 lindström et al 2002 and grassland sites dunne and black 1971 johnsson and lundin 1991 snowmelt runoff was also measured for a bared agricultural field characterized by a strong slope inclination by zuzel et al 1982 however few studies have examined the relationships between the detailed measurements of a frozen soil layer and the amount of snowmelt runoff in bared arable land having a low slope moreover the influence of soil freezing and snowmelt runoff on the vertical movement of the no3 n in the soil layer which may influence the quality of groundwater has not been established measurements to reveal these relationships are thus important for the better understanding of the influence on agricultural fields as a non point source of water and contaminants in the regional scale hydrology in cold regions in fields with a thick frozen soil layer the snow water equivalent swe hereafter the soil water content ice and liquid water and the soil temperature are the dominant factors that determine snowmelt infiltration zhao and gray 1999 gray et al 2001 iwata et al 2011 and yanai et al 2017 indicated that the soil frost depth is another dominant factor that contributes to the determination of snowmelt infiltration in regions in which the seasonal frozen layer is relatively thin 0 0 4 m depth before the onset of snowmelt kuchment and gel fan 2007 proposed that the soil frost depth is one of the dominant factors in the determination of runoff from frozen ground in european russia they showed that when the amounts of the snowmelt water being compared were identical the relationship between the amount of runoff water and the soil frost depth followed an s shaped curve however they did not report the effect of other factors such as the soil water content and soil temperature which are the dominant factors in the snowmelt infiltration rate in fields with a thick frozen soil layer as mentioned above these reports suggest that the factors involved in the amount of snowmelt runoff have not been fully revealed especially for fields in which the soil frost depth fluctuates by year and or by location regarding the vertical movement of soil no3 n in winter gray and granger 1986 stated that a substantial amount of anions moved upward when the soil freezing front penetrates to a sufficient depth in contrast iwata et al 2013 reported that no remarkable no3 n movement was observed in accord with the upward soil water movement that resulted from the penetration of the freezing front in a field with a soil frost depth of 0 4 m they also reported that the main no3 n movement might occur during and after the spring snowmelt period when a substantial amount of nitrate might be moved downward with snowmelt water iwata et al 2010a also showed that the downward soil water movement during the snowmelt period was much larger than the upward soil water movement before the onset of snowmelt in a field with a large amount of snow accumulation approx 100 mm of the max swe and a relatively shallow frost depth 0 4 m these results indicate that the soil water movement during the snowmelt period is a dominant factor controlling the nitrate movement in the winter in fields with relatively large amounts of snow accumulation therefore the reduction of the amount of snowmelt infiltration caused by runoff during the snowmelt period may be one of the most important factors in the control of the no3 n movement in the soil in winter iwata et al 2010a conducted a paired plot experiment in which snow on one of the study plots was removed in order to enhance the soil frost depth before the onset of the spring snowmelt period they put snow back on the snow removed plot and compared the difference in snowmelt infiltration between the control and snow removed returned plots this method cannot be applied to a large scale field because it is very difficult to remove and put back snow on the entire area of a large field especially for fields with a substantial amount of snow accumulation several years ago farmers in japan started to plow snow to enhance soil freezing in order to kill potato tubers yazaki et al 2013 this method can be used to deepen the soil frost depth in large scale fields however each snow plowing operation requires at least two removals of snow for details see hirota et al 2011 which may account for the nonuniform development of soil frost depth another method for enhancing the soil frost depth is snow compaction treatment shimoda et al 2015 shimoda and hirota 2018 in which the snow on a field is compacted by heavy machinery such as a tractor or bulldozer the thermal conductivity of compacted snow is much higher than that of natural snow cover edward and sato 1993 and the thickness of the snow cover decreases by compaction treatment resulting in a higher thermal gradient in the snow layer as a result soil frost depth increases because the swe on the field is not changed by compaction treatment and because obtaining a uniform soil frost depth appears to be achievable by snow compaction this method may be suitable for comparison of the amount of snowmelt runoff water from a field with differing soil frost depths during the same winter in the present study we conducted a field scale paired plot experiment in an agricultural field we divided the field into two plots and snow compaction treatment was performed on one of the plots to enhance soil freezing we monitored the soil frost depth at several sites in the field to check whether the snow compaction treatment provided a uniform development of the frozen layer we also monitored the snow cover thickness and swe to determine whether the snow accumulation and the melting process can be changed by the compaction treatment the movement of snowmelt water in the snow cover was also observed to ensure that the compacted snow did not impede the snowmelt infiltration we then monitored the amount of runoff water and the change in the vertical distribution of the no3 n in the soil profiles of each plot our main objective in conducting this study was to reveal the dominant factors that determine the nitrate movement during the snowmelt period in the snow accumulated field with a frozen soil layer the possible effects of the artificial enhancement of the soil frost depth by the snow compaction treatment on agricultural fields are also discussed 2 materials and methods 2 1 site description the study was conducted at an experimental field n42 53 e143 05 owned by the hokkaido agricultural research center which is one of the research institutes of the national agriculture and food research organization in japan this research center is located in the central part of tokachi district on the northernmost main island of japan tokachi district is one of the main crop production areas in japan many types of crops including wheat triticum aestivum potato solanum tuberosum sugar beet beta vulgaris ssp vulgaris corn zea mays beans glycine max and some vegetables are cultivated in this region because of the mild weather in the summer season 18 1 c mean monthly air temperature and 111 mm mean monthly precipitation for july based on the meteorological data collected between 1981 and 2010 at the memuro meteorological station japan meteorological agency 2018 the winter in this region is cold and a significant amount of snow accumulates on the ground 8 7 c mean monthly air temperature and 0 66 m mean monthly maximum thickness of the snow cover for january based on the same dataset the study field is covered by volcanic ash soil andisol according to the u s soil taxonomy soil survey staff 2014 a gravel layer underlies the soil layer the thickness of the soil layer fluctuates between 0 5 and 1 0 m depending on location the soil profiles and physical properties of the present study field are similar to those at study plots located approx 150 and 300 m away from the study site described in previous investigations iwata et al 2008 iwata 2010a b respectively fig 1 provides a schematic diagram of the study field we conducted this study for three winters from the autumn of 2009 to the spring of 2012 the field was approx 10 000 m2 and had an approx 1 5 slope along the long side direction we divided the field into two subplots of similar size the snow on one of the plots hereafter treated plot was compacted after substantial amount of snow when new snow accumulated 0 2 m in thickness during each winter by a tractor equipped with a roller behind it the snow on the other plot hereafter control plot was maintained in its natural condition during each winter before the experiment was started channels 0 3 m deep 0 8 m wide were dug with a power shovel along the narrow and long sides of each plot having the lowest elevations see fig 1 the bottom and side walls of each channel were covered with vinyl sheeting to prevent the infiltration of water at the lowest part of each plot an approx 2 4 m wide approx 2 m deep pit was dug for the monitoring of the runoff water corrected by the channels banks approx 0 3 m high were also made at other sides of the plots by a plow pulled by a tractor in order to prevent the invasion of surface water into the plots a windbreak of larch trees larix kaempferi was located approx 15 m from of the west edge of the western plot oats anena sativa had been planted in the field in the summer of 2009 prior to the site installation after the oats were harvested in the middle of september ammonium sulfate was applied to the field at a rate of 10 g n m 2 and the soil was plowed to the depth of 0 1 m to mix the surface soil with the ammonium and plant residue in early october the soil surface was maintained in a bare condition during the summer periods by tilling several times by a tractor with a rotary tiller the same amount of ammonium sulfate was applied in autumn in 2010 and 2011 in the same manner as that used in 2009 2 2 monitoring the soil frost depth snow cover thickness swe precipitation air temperature and soil water content a frost tube iwata et al 2012 was installed at three locations in each of the control and treated plots fig 1 frost depths were monitored manually once or twice a week using the frost tube equipment the snow cover thicknesses were monitored near the frost tubes after the frost depth was determined with the use of a steel ruler we determined the swe at the central part of each plot by sampling snow with the use of a snow survey tube made of duralumin and aluminum kamuro type snow sampler climate engineering co ltd nagaoka japan on the same day that the soil frost depth and snow cover thickness were measured at the treated plot because of the hard snow layer resulting from the compaction the snow sampler was inserted with the use of a plastic hammer to get the snow sample sampled snow cores were weighed by an electric balance sl 2000wp a d tokyo the snow cover thickness and swe were monitored three times at each of the three locations in the control and treated plots and then averaged to obtain the measurement value of each location the air temperature was monitored by a platinum resistance thermometer hmp45a vaisala helsinki finland at 1 5 m from the ground surface every 10 min in the meteorological station of the hokkaido agricultural research center which is located approx 150 m north of the study field precipitation was monitored at this meteorological station by a tipping bucket rain gauge yb071 20 yokogawa electric tokyo with a heated water reservoir and a windshield rt 4 yokogawa electric soil water contents at 0 05 0 1 0 2 and 0 3 m depths were also monitored every 10 min using a water content reflectometer cs615 campbell scientific inc logan ut 2 3 monitoring the runoff water during the first winter the 2009 2010 winter the amount of runoff water collected by the channels was monitored using a water reservoir 0 84 m 1 57 m 0 58 m high fig 1 the water meter was fixed at 0 35 m from the bottom of the reservoir at a side wall the reservoir was placed in the pit and was connected to the channel by a plastic sheet that guided the runoff water collected by the channel to the reservoir almost every day during the snowmelt period we manually recorded the water level in the reservoir and the accumulated amount of water that went through the water meter this system worked in the early snowmelt period but the runoff water overflowed at the end of the snowmelt period and the water filled the soil pit in the treated plot because of the large amount of runoff water an electric submersible pump was then used to drain the pond in the soil pit in this case discharge rates were monitored manually several times by measuring the volume of the discharge in certain periods for the determination of the amount of runoff water during the time when the measurement pit was filled with water the average value of the discharge rate was multiplied by the operating time of the pump to monitor the large amounts of water at the end of the snowmelt period we renewed the observation system in the second and third winters a v notch weir 1 m wide 0 5 m long 1 m high with a 70 angle v notch made of 10 mm thick acrylic plates was placed in the bottom of the measurement pit the distance from the bottom of the weir and the v notch was 0 5 m the v notch was put on the opposite side of the wall of the pit where the end of the channel was located water from the channel was led to the weir by the plastic sheet guide a pressure gauge mts 01 meteo denshi sapporo japan which can detect a 1 mm difference in a water level was installed approx 0 2 m from the bottom of the weir to monitor the water level in the v notch weir we calibrated the output of the water level by manually monitoring the water level several times during the snowmelt period we determined the flow coefficient of the v notch weir as 0 8 by monitoring the amount of water from the v notch q and the water level in the weir h several times during the snowmelt period in the second winter we used the same coefficient during the snowmelt period in the third winter the h was temporarily recorded every 10 sec by a datalogger cr10x campbell scientific inc logan ut and the average value was stored every 10 min to obtain the runoff amount per unit area we divided the q value by the area of each plot we compared the calculated values with the amount of snowmelt water which was calculated from the swe before the onset of the spring snowmelt and the precipitation during the snowmelt period to keep the water level outside of the v notch weir below 0 5 m i e the distance from the bottom of the weir to the v notch we installed an electric submersible pump before the snowmelt period in both pits in the control and treated plots a pressure gauge m86 meteo denshi was installed at the bottom of each pit to monitor the water level in the pit the data were recorded by the datalogger every 10 min the submersible pump was operated when the water level reached 0 4 m and stopped when the water level fell to 0 1 m the pump was controlled using the datalogger with a relay driver ry2 rv 5a climatec tokyo this system worked well except for 2 days at the end of the snowmelt period when the pressure gauge did not work at the treated plot because of the large amount of mud created by a collapse of the sidewall of the pit the pump was operated manually on those 2 days to remove water outside of the v notch weir in the pit the q value which was monitored just after the water level in the pit fell to 0 4 m i e lower than the bottom of v notch was used as the runoff rate during the period when ponding in the pit disrupted the measurement during the third winter we used the same measurement system to monitor the amount of runoff water during the snowmelt period except for the pressure water gauge for monitoring the water level outside of the weir to avoid trouble with the pressure gauge caused by the muddy water we covered the sensing part of a pressure gauge hti 100kp sensez tokyo with a porous cup 18 mm outer dia 60 mm long and clear pvc pipe 18 mm outer dia 13 mm inner dia this sensor worked well throughout the snowmelt period in the third winter 2 4 the vertical distribution of mineral nitrogen in autumn and after the snowmelt period to monitor the change in the vertical distribution of no3 n after the snowmelt period we sampled soil core samples 50 mm dia to a depth of 1 m using an auger with an engine dik 162d daiki rika kougyo saitama japan the core samples were divided into small 100 mm thick core samples these samples were packed in plastic bags in the field soil cores were sampled at six points in each plot fig 1 except for the sampling conducted in autumn before the first winter when soil cores were sampled at three points near the frost depth measurement points when the front of the auger reached the gravel layer it sometimes became difficult to get the auger any deeper into the soil we stopped to insert the auger manually in this case thus at some places it was not possible to get the soil cores to the depth of 1 m the holes made by the sampling were filled with surface soil to prevent bypass flow the samples were carried to our laboratory ten grams of fresh soil was sampled from each divided core and shaken with 50 ml of 2 m kcl solution for 1 hr after the suspension was filtered the concentrations of no3 n and nh4 n in the solution were determined with the use of a flow injection system ouaatro2 hr bl tec osaka japan we calculated the contents per unit dry weight of soil c dry g n m 2 by using the soil moisture content measured with the same soil sample the calculated values were then translated to the contents per unit area c area 0 1 g n m 2 in each 0 1 m thick soil layer by the following equation 1 c area 0 1 c dry ρ d 0 1 where ρ d is the dry bulk density measured in the undisturbed soil samples from each soil layer obtained using a 100 cm3 cylindrical soil sampler g m 3 the ρ d obtained from a field near the study site iwata et al 2010a were used in the present study to evaluate the change of the no3 n content in winter we calculated not only the c area 0 1 but also the no3 n content in the soil layer to the depth of 0 3 m this is the plow layer where most of the crop roots are generally located and to the depth of 1 m the lower limit of measurement depth to sum up the c area 0 1 soil samplings were conducted on december 17 2009 and may 6 2010 in the first winter on november 25 2010 and april 18 2011 in the second winter and on november 28 2011 and may 14 2012 in the third winter 2 5 visualization of the pathway of snowmelt water in the snow cover to ascertain the movement of snowmelt water in the snow layer we applied approx 10 mg of red food coloring on the snow surface in a 1 m2 area in the control and treated plots before the onset of spring snowmelt in the first winter february 23 2010 the profiles of the snowpack in these two areas in mid snowmelt period were observed march 24 2010 the places where the snow was dyed by the food coloring were considered the pathway of the snowmelt water we compared the profiles of the dyed snow layer of the control and treated plots to identify any differences in the pathways caused by the snow compaction in the treated plot 2 6 statistical analysis we used t tests to examine the differences in the average values of the no3 n content in the given soil layers in the control and treated plots we also conducted a pearson s correlation analysis to examine the relationships between snowmelt infiltration and the no3 n content these analyses were conducted using microsoft excel 2016 software we considered that the average values were significantly different or that the relationship was significant when the probability p values were 0 05 3 results 3 1 air temperature snow cover properties and soil frost depth in early december of the first winter the air temperature dropped below 0 c and the surface soil then started to freeze left panels in fig 2 a e in the control plot the freezing front did not penetrate deeper after the snow cover thickness became 0 2 m in mid december this is in agreement with findings obtained previously in this region hirota et al 2006 harada et al 2009 the snow on the treated plot which was located on the west side of the study site fig 1 was compacted on december 14 resulting in a lesser snow cover thickness compared to that in the control plot fig 2c and as a result the freezing front penetrated deeper in this plot fig 2e snow compaction treatments were conducted on december 22 january 4 and january 12 after substantial amounts of snow fell fig 2b the max soil frost depth in the treated plot reached 0 39 m sd 0 049 m in contrast to the almost negligible soil frost depth in the control plot fig 2e although the snow cover thicknesses in the treated plot were approx one half to two thirds of those in the control plot fig 2c the swes in the treated plot were slightly larger than those in the control plot fig 2d because of the redistribution of snow by the westerly wind the snow had disappeared completely on april 7 in the control plot and on april 9 in the treated plot probably because of the slightly larger swe in the treated plot the frozen soil had thawed completely on april 19 in the treated plot 10 days after the end of the snowmelt period in the second winter 2010 2011 winter the snow compaction treatment was switched to the eastern plot fig 1 less snow accumulated on the field throughout this winter compared to the first winter fig 2c d on december 1 the surface soil was already frozen but some of the frozen soil temporarily thawed because of a substantial amount of rainfall with air temperatures above 0 c in early december quadrilateral a in fig 2 the daily mean air temperature dropped below 0 c again causing the soil to freeze again fig 2a e however the penetration of the freezing front stopped in mid december in the control plot because of the substantial amount of snow accumulation fig 2c e in contrast the snow compaction treatment enhanced the soil frost depth until mid february when the air temperature was cold enough for the freezing front to penetrate to the deep soil layer the snow compaction treatment was applied on december 20 and 27 and january 17 the max soil frost depth in the treated plot reached 0 43 m sd 0 005 m fig 2e which was comparable to that of the treated plot in the first winter the max soil frost depth in the control plot was 0 09 m sd 0 023 m and a soil frost depth of only 0 03 m sd 0 046 was observed during the snowmelt period fig 2e the swe values in the control and treated plots were almost identical throughout the observation period in this second winter fig 2d as a result on march 29 the snow in both plots had completely melted in the treated plot the frozen soil had thawed completely 18 days after march 29 in the third winter 2011 2012 winter the snow compaction treatment was applied in the western plot fig 1 that winter can be characterized by lower air temperatures and smaller amounts of snow accumulation compared to the first and second winters fig 2a c d in the control plot the soil freezing front penetrated until late december when the snow cover thickness became 0 2 m fig 2c e because of the snow compaction treatment the snow cover thickness in the treated plot was 0 2 m until late february as a result the maximum soil frost depth in the treated plot was 0 85 m sd 0 022 which was much deeper than the 0 23 m sd 0 027 in the control plot fig 2e the swe in the treated plot was slightly larger than that in the control plot fig 2d despite the deep penetration of the freezing front in the treated plot the frozen soil had completely thawed on may 2 16 days after the day when the snow had completely melted which was similar to the corresponding periods in the other two winters 3 2 snowmelt runoff fig 3 shows the cumulative values of snowmelt runoff in the control and treated plots the cumulative amount of runoff water in the treated plot was much larger than that in the control plot in the three snowmelt periods in the first winter a remarkable decrease of the swe was observed in early april in both plots fig 2d left panel suggesting that the main spring snowmelt period started from this time the amount of runoff water increased rapidly in the treated plot from april 2 fig 3a which coincided with the time point at which the marked decrease in the swe started the amount of runoff water also increased in the control plot but the rate of increase was less than that in the treated plot as a result the total amount of runoff water during the spring snowmelt period was calculated as 103 mm in the treated plot which was much larger than the 14 mm in the control plot note that the values of cumulative runoff water are the runoff amount per the unit area which means that the volume of runoff water from the study plot can be calculated by multiplying this value by the area of the plot similarly a large amount of runoff was observed in the treated plot at the same time that the swe decreased continuously in the second and third winters figs 2d 3b c in contrast to the large amount of runoff in the treated plot the cumulative runoff water in the control plot did not increase when the swe decreased continuously in both snowmelt periods as a result the total amounts of runoff in the treated plot during the spring snowmelt period were 70 4 mm in the second winter and 60 2 mm in the third winter fig 3b c which were 56 and 39 of the total amount of snowmelt waters smws in this plot respectively the total amounts of runoff in the control plot were only 2 5 mm and 3 9 mm 2 0 and 3 1 of the smws in this plot respectively in the second and third winters respectively suggesting that most of the snowmelt water infiltrated 3 3 changes in the vertical distribution of no3 n fig 4 shows the vertical distribution of no3 n content the peak of no3 n content became deeper after the spring snowmelt period in the control plot suggesting that a large amount of nitrate moved to the deep soil layer in this plot the peak of no3 n content also became deeper after the snowmelt period in the treated plot however the distribution of no3 n content did not markedly change in the treated plot as observed in the control plot in contrast to the no3 n content only a small amount of nh4 n 0 7 g m 2 was detected in autumn and after the snowmelt period in all three winters suggesting that almost all of the ammonium sulfate amended in autumn nitrified before winter data not shown table 1 shows the no3 n content to the depths of 0 3 m and 1 m before soil freezing in autumn and after the snowmelt period in spring a significant difference in the 3 year mean values was found only between the values in the soil layer to the depth of 0 3 m in these plots after the snowmelt period table 1 this suggests that the significant effect of the no3 n retention could be found only in the soil layer to the depth of 0 3 m in the treated plot where the soil frost depth was enhanced by the snow compaction treatment 3 4 snowmelt water movement in the compacted snow layer the snow densities in the treated plot were 500 kg m 3 after the snow compaction treatment which is 2 5 times larger than the average snow density in the control plot 200 kg m 3 as calculated using the snow cover thickness and the swe shown in fig 2 despite the high bulk density of the treated plot the red color tracer located below the snow surface before the onset of snowmelt dyed the snow layer homogeneously to the bottom of the snow layer during the snowmelt period fig 4 this profile was similar to that in the control plot although surface ponding was observed near the soil surface only in the treated plot these results indicate that snowmelt water from the snow surface traveled through the snow layer to the soil surface in both the control and treated plots 4 discussion 4 1 the effects of snow compaction on the soil frost depth and the penetration of snowmelt water in the snow layer the snow compaction treatment increased the bulk density of snow from 200 kg m 3 the average value of the natural condition before the snowmelt period in the control plot to 500 kg m 3 fig 2 this change might have increased the thermal conductivity of the snow by more than twofold edward and sato 1993 moreover the snow depth was reduced by approx 50 by the snow compaction treatment fig 2c which might have increased the thermal gradient in the snow cover because heat flux is a product of thermal conductivity and the thermal gradient a large increase in heat flux might have been produced by the snow compaction resulting in the large difference in soil frost depth between the control and treated plots the difference in the frost depth measured by the frost tube at three locations in each plot were relatively large in the treated plot in the first winter fig 2e when the max sd of the soil frost depth was 0 048 m this value is slightly larger than the measurement error of the soil frost tube 0 035 m iwata et al 2012 we thus speculate that the variability of the soil frost depth may have been almost negligible in both the control and treated plots we thus consider the snow compaction treatment a good method to enhance the soil frost depth uniformly in a large scale field in contrast to the remarkable change in the soil frost depth produced by the snow compaction treatment the results of the red tracer experiment shown in fig 5 suggest that the highly dense snow layer approx 500 kg m 3 in the treated plot did not impede snowmelt water movement through the snowpack assuming that the density of pure ice is 917 kg m 3 which is the ice density at 0 c budavari 1996 the porosity of the snow layer would be 0 55 m3 m 3 suggesting that a compacted snow layer still has enough pore space to be penetrated by a large amount of snowmelt water based on these past and present findings we conclude that the snow compaction treatment can enhance the soil frost depth without impeding the snowmelt infiltration of the snow layer 4 2 the effect of the soil frost depth on the snowmelt runoff and nitrate leaching because the compacted snow did not impede snowmelt infiltration an impermeable thick frozen soil layer might induce a large amount of runoff in the treated plot as illustrated in fig 3 ponding on the soil surface was not observed after the snowmelt period in the control plot in all three winters in contrast surface ponding was observed in the treated plot after the snowmelt period part of the surface water might have infiltrated the ground after the snowmelt period with the thawing of the frozen soil layer as illustrated in detail by iwata et al 2010a however our results clearly indicate that a substantial amount of runoff can still occur in a slightly sloping field with a thick frozen layer like our study site previous researchers mentioned that soil water content before the onset of soil freezing is one of the dominant factors in determining snowmelt infiltration e g gray et al 2001 the 60 5 mm of rain that fell on december 3 2010 which temporarily thawed the soil frozen layer quadrilateral a in fig 2 may have increased the soil water content in the soil surface layer just before the soil freezing in the second winter the average soil water content at 0 0 3 m depth in the soil layer which was monitored at the meteorological station near the study site was 0 49 m3 m 3 at this time which was larger than the soil water content before soil freezing in the first winter 0 43 m3 m 3 monitored on december 1 2009 or in the third winter 0 46 m3 m 3 monitored on november 29 however the amount of runoff in the treated plot in the second year was 70 mm which was less than that in the first winter 103 mm and comparable to that in the third winter 60 mm fig 3 the amount of snowmelt infiltration which was calculated by subtracting the amount of runoff from swe was 55 mm which was smaller than in the first 105 mm and third 95 mm winters these results suggest that the soil water content before the onset of soil freezing may not be a dominant factor in increasing snowmelt runoff although this can be a factor to determine the amount of snowmelt infiltration during and after the snowmelt period the no3 n content to the depth of 0 3 m in the treated plot was significantly larger than that in the control plot only after the snowmelt period table 1 because no3 n moves with water there was a clear relationship p 0 05 r 0 84 between the no3 n that remained at the soil layer to the depth of 0 3 m and the amount of snowmelt infiltration which was calculated by subtracting the measured runoff amount shown in fig 3 from the amount of snowmelt water fig 6 this suggests that the increase in snowmelt runoff induced by the thick frozen soil layer reduced the total amount of snowmelt infiltration which accordingly retained a larger amount of no3 n near the soil surface the snow compaction treatment is a promising method to enhance the soil frost depth we thus propose that the no3 n available for plant growth may be increased by the snow compaction treatment although the 3 year s average of the no3 n content to the depth of 1 m in the treated plot was slightly larger than that in the control plot there was no significant difference between these values table 1 the no3 n contents in the treated plot were similar to those in the control plot in the second and third winters table 1 the content in the treated plot was larger than that in the control plot in the first winter but the difference in the no3 n content was much larger in the soil layer at the 0 0 3 m depth table 1 these results indicate that the difference in the no3 n content in the 0 1 m soil layer caused by the snow compaction treatment is not remarkable like that in the soil layer to the depth of 0 3 m which means that most of the nitrate may remain in the soil layer to the depth of 1 m even if most of the snowmelt water infiltrated to the ground the no3 n near the soil surface can be used effectively by plants in contrast the no3 n located below the main root zone penetrates deeper in the growing season when precipitation is greater than evapotranspiration iwata et al 2004 calculated that the potential evapotranspiration is 3 mm d 1 on average during the cultivation period assuming that the period when snow is absent on the ground is 210 days approx 7 months the cumulative evapotranspiration of 1 year would be 630 mm which is less than the 970 mm annual precipitation in this region japan meteorological agency 2018 therefore the no3 n that has moved below the plow layer potentially pollutes the groundwater in this region 4 3 the influence of snow compaction treatment on agricultural production after the snowmelt period because of the remarkable climate changes over the last 30 years the time point at which a thick snow cover insulates the soil from cold air became earlier in the eastern part of hokkaido which is one of the main crop production areas of japan resulting in a shallow penetration of the freezing front in this area hirota et al 2006 with the increase in soil temperatures during the winter a substantial amount of small potato tubers left at the harvesting period sprouted in the next crop production season becoming one of the major weed volunteer potato in this area to kill the potato tubers during the winter by freezing them farmers started to remove snow which insulates the soil from cold air hirota et al 2011 yazaki et al 2013 some farmers also attempted to kill the volunteer potato plants by compacting the snow with a tractor in the crop rotation system in this area winter wheat which is sown in late september is the most commonly grown crop after potatoes shimoda et al 2015 and shimoda and hirota 2018 showed that it is possible to kill the potato tubers without reducing the yield of winter wheat by enhancing soil freezing by the snow compaction treatment as shown in fig 4 and table 1 a substantial amount of no3 n can remain in the soil surface layer by enhancing the frozen soil layer by snow compaction this implies that the snow compaction treatment could be a useful technique to increase the yield by increasing no3 n it might not be possible to conduct a snow removal operation in the wheat fields because this may harm the wheat leaves during the operation and kill them due to the low air temperatures after the snow removal however this treatment can also potentially improve the yield of other crops planted after the snowmelt period because the lesser amount of no3 n leaching may similarly occur based on the enhanced thick frozen soil layer yanai et al 2017 showed the possibility that there is a close relationship among the soil frost depth the amount of snowmelt infiltration and the no3 n content in the soil surface layer after the snowmelt period however the relationships among the soil frost depth snowmelt infiltration snowmelt runoff no3 n content in the soil surface layer and plant growth after the snowmelt period have not been established we did not observe a marked amount of soil erosion in the treated plot in our present study but the relationships among the soil frost depth the amount of snowmelt runoff and the quality of runoff water are not addressed in this study before recommending either treatment as a management procedure it may be necessary to further evaluate the resulting effects on the environment because both snow compaction and snow removal may substantially increase runoff as shown in this study further research is therefore required to ascertain the effects of soil frost control treatments on the productivity of crops and on the environment during and after a snowmelt period 5 conclusions our field scale experiment revealed that a snow compaction treatment enhanced the soil frost depth uniformly reduced the amount of snowmelt infiltration and induced a large amount of snowmelt runoff although surface ponding water infiltrated to the ground after the snowmelt period our results clearly indicate that a substantial amount of runoff water from the thick frozen soil layer 0 4 m depth in this study reduced the total amount of snowmelt infiltration which can retain a substantial amount of nitrate in the plow layer therefore the snow compaction treatment can be an effective technique to control the amount of nitrate in fields with snow cover in cold regions in northern japan a main crop production area of the country the earlier accumulation of snow covers has reduced the soil frost depth due to the climate changes over the last 30 years this induced a troublesome new weed the volunteer potato because it is difficult to kill the volunteer potato by herbicides farmers started to remove or compact snow to kill the volunteer potato tubers during the winter our present findings preset the possibility that these operations can increase the available nitrate in farmland this also indicates that the risk of the groundwater pollution by no3 n can be reduced by these treatments further research is required to

6887,a frozen soil layer may impede snowmelt infiltration resulting in a large amount of runoff that influences the soil water balance and anion movement in the soil profile to examine the relationships among soil frost depth snowmelt runoff and nitrate leaching in agricultural fields we measured both the snowmelt runoff for three winters and other environmental factors including the soil frost depth and nitrate content in a 10 000 m2 field we divided the field into two subplots one was maintained in a natural snow cover condition the control plot and the snow cover was compacted on the other plot the treated plot to enhance the development of the soil frost depth in all three winters soil frost depths in the control plot were 0 2 m and very little runoff was observed during the snowmelt period in contrast the soil frost depth became 0 4 m and a large amount of snowmelt runoff was observed in the treated plot the depth of the peak nitrate concentration after the snowmelt period was shallower in the treated plot compared to the control plot moreover a significant linear relationship was observed between 1 the amount of nitrate in the 0 0 3 m depth after the snowmelt period and 2 the total amount of snowmelt infiltration calculated by subtracting the amount of snowmelt runoff from the amount of snowmelt water these results suggest that snow compaction can be a promising technique to develop a uniform soil frost depth in large scale fields which consequently controls the soil water and nutrient movement in the soil layer keywords no3 n nitrate leaching snowmelt infiltration snow compaction runoff ratio soil frost depth 1 introduction in regions that accumulate snow the snowmelt period is one of the most significant events of the hydrological year e g granger et al 1984 stähli et al 1999 iwata et al 2010b a frozen soil layer impedes snowmelt infiltration which causes large amounts of snowmelt runoff bauder et al 1975 niu and yang 2006 lundberg et al 2016 and soil erosion mcconkey et al 1997 øygarden 2003 ban et al 2016 in the early spring in contrast iwata et al 2008 reported that a thin frozen soil layer 0 2 m did not impede snowmelt infiltration iwata et al 2008 also inferred that deep percolation of nitrate nitrogen no3 n hereafter which is one of the most dominant anions in agricultural soil and generally moves with water also occurred during the snowmelt period some plot scale research iwata et al 2013 yanai et al 2017 has indicated that a lesser amount of no3 n remains near the soil surface after the snowmelt period in fields with a thin 0 2 m frozen soil layer probably because of the larger amount of snowmelt infiltration however there is little data regarding whether a larger amount of no3 n remains near the soil surface in an entire field when a thick frozen soil layer has formed snowmelt runoff resulting from reduced snowmelt infiltration by a frozen soil layer can increase the amount of river water in the early spring shanley and chalmers 1999 some researchers have demonstrated that the quality of runoff water during the snowmelt period is changed by the formation of a frozen soil layer banaszuk et al 2013 eskelinen et al 2016 the effects of a frozen soil layer on the amount of snowmelt runoff the discharge of no3 n and the pathway of these materials were examined in agricultural fields coelho et al 2012 furthermore processes intertwined with snowmelt runoff in fields with frozen soil layers have been previously investigated in the alps bayard et al 2005 forest nyberg et al 2001 lindström et al 2002 and grassland sites dunne and black 1971 johnsson and lundin 1991 snowmelt runoff was also measured for a bared agricultural field characterized by a strong slope inclination by zuzel et al 1982 however few studies have examined the relationships between the detailed measurements of a frozen soil layer and the amount of snowmelt runoff in bared arable land having a low slope moreover the influence of soil freezing and snowmelt runoff on the vertical movement of the no3 n in the soil layer which may influence the quality of groundwater has not been established measurements to reveal these relationships are thus important for the better understanding of the influence on agricultural fields as a non point source of water and contaminants in the regional scale hydrology in cold regions in fields with a thick frozen soil layer the snow water equivalent swe hereafter the soil water content ice and liquid water and the soil temperature are the dominant factors that determine snowmelt infiltration zhao and gray 1999 gray et al 2001 iwata et al 2011 and yanai et al 2017 indicated that the soil frost depth is another dominant factor that contributes to the determination of snowmelt infiltration in regions in which the seasonal frozen layer is relatively thin 0 0 4 m depth before the onset of snowmelt kuchment and gel fan 2007 proposed that the soil frost depth is one of the dominant factors in the determination of runoff from frozen ground in european russia they showed that when the amounts of the snowmelt water being compared were identical the relationship between the amount of runoff water and the soil frost depth followed an s shaped curve however they did not report the effect of other factors such as the soil water content and soil temperature which are the dominant factors in the snowmelt infiltration rate in fields with a thick frozen soil layer as mentioned above these reports suggest that the factors involved in the amount of snowmelt runoff have not been fully revealed especially for fields in which the soil frost depth fluctuates by year and or by location regarding the vertical movement of soil no3 n in winter gray and granger 1986 stated that a substantial amount of anions moved upward when the soil freezing front penetrates to a sufficient depth in contrast iwata et al 2013 reported that no remarkable no3 n movement was observed in accord with the upward soil water movement that resulted from the penetration of the freezing front in a field with a soil frost depth of 0 4 m they also reported that the main no3 n movement might occur during and after the spring snowmelt period when a substantial amount of nitrate might be moved downward with snowmelt water iwata et al 2010a also showed that the downward soil water movement during the snowmelt period was much larger than the upward soil water movement before the onset of snowmelt in a field with a large amount of snow accumulation approx 100 mm of the max swe and a relatively shallow frost depth 0 4 m these results indicate that the soil water movement during the snowmelt period is a dominant factor controlling the nitrate movement in the winter in fields with relatively large amounts of snow accumulation therefore the reduction of the amount of snowmelt infiltration caused by runoff during the snowmelt period may be one of the most important factors in the control of the no3 n movement in the soil in winter iwata et al 2010a conducted a paired plot experiment in which snow on one of the study plots was removed in order to enhance the soil frost depth before the onset of the spring snowmelt period they put snow back on the snow removed plot and compared the difference in snowmelt infiltration between the control and snow removed returned plots this method cannot be applied to a large scale field because it is very difficult to remove and put back snow on the entire area of a large field especially for fields with a substantial amount of snow accumulation several years ago farmers in japan started to plow snow to enhance soil freezing in order to kill potato tubers yazaki et al 2013 this method can be used to deepen the soil frost depth in large scale fields however each snow plowing operation requires at least two removals of snow for details see hirota et al 2011 which may account for the nonuniform development of soil frost depth another method for enhancing the soil frost depth is snow compaction treatment shimoda et al 2015 shimoda and hirota 2018 in which the snow on a field is compacted by heavy machinery such as a tractor or bulldozer the thermal conductivity of compacted snow is much higher than that of natural snow cover edward and sato 1993 and the thickness of the snow cover decreases by compaction treatment resulting in a higher thermal gradient in the snow layer as a result soil frost depth increases because the swe on the field is not changed by compaction treatment and because obtaining a uniform soil frost depth appears to be achievable by snow compaction this method may be suitable for comparison of the amount of snowmelt runoff water from a field with differing soil frost depths during the same winter in the present study we conducted a field scale paired plot experiment in an agricultural field we divided the field into two plots and snow compaction treatment was performed on one of the plots to enhance soil freezing we monitored the soil frost depth at several sites in the field to check whether the snow compaction treatment provided a uniform development of the frozen layer we also monitored the snow cover thickness and swe to determine whether the snow accumulation and the melting process can be changed by the compaction treatment the movement of snowmelt water in the snow cover was also observed to ensure that the compacted snow did not impede the snowmelt infiltration we then monitored the amount of runoff water and the change in the vertical distribution of the no3 n in the soil profiles of each plot our main objective in conducting this study was to reveal the dominant factors that determine the nitrate movement during the snowmelt period in the snow accumulated field with a frozen soil layer the possible effects of the artificial enhancement of the soil frost depth by the snow compaction treatment on agricultural fields are also discussed 2 materials and methods 2 1 site description the study was conducted at an experimental field n42 53 e143 05 owned by the hokkaido agricultural research center which is one of the research institutes of the national agriculture and food research organization in japan this research center is located in the central part of tokachi district on the northernmost main island of japan tokachi district is one of the main crop production areas in japan many types of crops including wheat triticum aestivum potato solanum tuberosum sugar beet beta vulgaris ssp vulgaris corn zea mays beans glycine max and some vegetables are cultivated in this region because of the mild weather in the summer season 18 1 c mean monthly air temperature and 111 mm mean monthly precipitation for july based on the meteorological data collected between 1981 and 2010 at the memuro meteorological station japan meteorological agency 2018 the winter in this region is cold and a significant amount of snow accumulates on the ground 8 7 c mean monthly air temperature and 0 66 m mean monthly maximum thickness of the snow cover for january based on the same dataset the study field is covered by volcanic ash soil andisol according to the u s soil taxonomy soil survey staff 2014 a gravel layer underlies the soil layer the thickness of the soil layer fluctuates between 0 5 and 1 0 m depending on location the soil profiles and physical properties of the present study field are similar to those at study plots located approx 150 and 300 m away from the study site described in previous investigations iwata et al 2008 iwata 2010a b respectively fig 1 provides a schematic diagram of the study field we conducted this study for three winters from the autumn of 2009 to the spring of 2012 the field was approx 10 000 m2 and had an approx 1 5 slope along the long side direction we divided the field into two subplots of similar size the snow on one of the plots hereafter treated plot was compacted after substantial amount of snow when new snow accumulated 0 2 m in thickness during each winter by a tractor equipped with a roller behind it the snow on the other plot hereafter control plot was maintained in its natural condition during each winter before the experiment was started channels 0 3 m deep 0 8 m wide were dug with a power shovel along the narrow and long sides of each plot having the lowest elevations see fig 1 the bottom and side walls of each channel were covered with vinyl sheeting to prevent the infiltration of water at the lowest part of each plot an approx 2 4 m wide approx 2 m deep pit was dug for the monitoring of the runoff water corrected by the channels banks approx 0 3 m high were also made at other sides of the plots by a plow pulled by a tractor in order to prevent the invasion of surface water into the plots a windbreak of larch trees larix kaempferi was located approx 15 m from of the west edge of the western plot oats anena sativa had been planted in the field in the summer of 2009 prior to the site installation after the oats were harvested in the middle of september ammonium sulfate was applied to the field at a rate of 10 g n m 2 and the soil was plowed to the depth of 0 1 m to mix the surface soil with the ammonium and plant residue in early october the soil surface was maintained in a bare condition during the summer periods by tilling several times by a tractor with a rotary tiller the same amount of ammonium sulfate was applied in autumn in 2010 and 2011 in the same manner as that used in 2009 2 2 monitoring the soil frost depth snow cover thickness swe precipitation air temperature and soil water content a frost tube iwata et al 2012 was installed at three locations in each of the control and treated plots fig 1 frost depths were monitored manually once or twice a week using the frost tube equipment the snow cover thicknesses were monitored near the frost tubes after the frost depth was determined with the use of a steel ruler we determined the swe at the central part of each plot by sampling snow with the use of a snow survey tube made of duralumin and aluminum kamuro type snow sampler climate engineering co ltd nagaoka japan on the same day that the soil frost depth and snow cover thickness were measured at the treated plot because of the hard snow layer resulting from the compaction the snow sampler was inserted with the use of a plastic hammer to get the snow sample sampled snow cores were weighed by an electric balance sl 2000wp a d tokyo the snow cover thickness and swe were monitored three times at each of the three locations in the control and treated plots and then averaged to obtain the measurement value of each location the air temperature was monitored by a platinum resistance thermometer hmp45a vaisala helsinki finland at 1 5 m from the ground surface every 10 min in the meteorological station of the hokkaido agricultural research center which is located approx 150 m north of the study field precipitation was monitored at this meteorological station by a tipping bucket rain gauge yb071 20 yokogawa electric tokyo with a heated water reservoir and a windshield rt 4 yokogawa electric soil water contents at 0 05 0 1 0 2 and 0 3 m depths were also monitored every 10 min using a water content reflectometer cs615 campbell scientific inc logan ut 2 3 monitoring the runoff water during the first winter the 2009 2010 winter the amount of runoff water collected by the channels was monitored using a water reservoir 0 84 m 1 57 m 0 58 m high fig 1 the water meter was fixed at 0 35 m from the bottom of the reservoir at a side wall the reservoir was placed in the pit and was connected to the channel by a plastic sheet that guided the runoff water collected by the channel to the reservoir almost every day during the snowmelt period we manually recorded the water level in the reservoir and the accumulated amount of water that went through the water meter this system worked in the early snowmelt period but the runoff water overflowed at the end of the snowmelt period and the water filled the soil pit in the treated plot because of the large amount of runoff water an electric submersible pump was then used to drain the pond in the soil pit in this case discharge rates were monitored manually several times by measuring the volume of the discharge in certain periods for the determination of the amount of runoff water during the time when the measurement pit was filled with water the average value of the discharge rate was multiplied by the operating time of the pump to monitor the large amounts of water at the end of the snowmelt period we renewed the observation system in the second and third winters a v notch weir 1 m wide 0 5 m long 1 m high with a 70 angle v notch made of 10 mm thick acrylic plates was placed in the bottom of the measurement pit the distance from the bottom of the weir and the v notch was 0 5 m the v notch was put on the opposite side of the wall of the pit where the end of the channel was located water from the channel was led to the weir by the plastic sheet guide a pressure gauge mts 01 meteo denshi sapporo japan which can detect a 1 mm difference in a water level was installed approx 0 2 m from the bottom of the weir to monitor the water level in the v notch weir we calibrated the output of the water level by manually monitoring the water level several times during the snowmelt period we determined the flow coefficient of the v notch weir as 0 8 by monitoring the amount of water from the v notch q and the water level in the weir h several times during the snowmelt period in the second winter we used the same coefficient during the snowmelt period in the third winter the h was temporarily recorded every 10 sec by a datalogger cr10x campbell scientific inc logan ut and the average value was stored every 10 min to obtain the runoff amount per unit area we divided the q value by the area of each plot we compared the calculated values with the amount of snowmelt water which was calculated from the swe before the onset of the spring snowmelt and the precipitation during the snowmelt period to keep the water level outside of the v notch weir below 0 5 m i e the distance from the bottom of the weir to the v notch we installed an electric submersible pump before the snowmelt period in both pits in the control and treated plots a pressure gauge m86 meteo denshi was installed at the bottom of each pit to monitor the water level in the pit the data were recorded by the datalogger every 10 min the submersible pump was operated when the water level reached 0 4 m and stopped when the water level fell to 0 1 m the pump was controlled using the datalogger with a relay driver ry2 rv 5a climatec tokyo this system worked well except for 2 days at the end of the snowmelt period when the pressure gauge did not work at the treated plot because of the large amount of mud created by a collapse of the sidewall of the pit the pump was operated manually on those 2 days to remove water outside of the v notch weir in the pit the q value which was monitored just after the water level in the pit fell to 0 4 m i e lower than the bottom of v notch was used as the runoff rate during the period when ponding in the pit disrupted the measurement during the third winter we used the same measurement system to monitor the amount of runoff water during the snowmelt period except for the pressure water gauge for monitoring the water level outside of the weir to avoid trouble with the pressure gauge caused by the muddy water we covered the sensing part of a pressure gauge hti 100kp sensez tokyo with a porous cup 18 mm outer dia 60 mm long and clear pvc pipe 18 mm outer dia 13 mm inner dia this sensor worked well throughout the snowmelt period in the third winter 2 4 the vertical distribution of mineral nitrogen in autumn and after the snowmelt period to monitor the change in the vertical distribution of no3 n after the snowmelt period we sampled soil core samples 50 mm dia to a depth of 1 m using an auger with an engine dik 162d daiki rika kougyo saitama japan the core samples were divided into small 100 mm thick core samples these samples were packed in plastic bags in the field soil cores were sampled at six points in each plot fig 1 except for the sampling conducted in autumn before the first winter when soil cores were sampled at three points near the frost depth measurement points when the front of the auger reached the gravel layer it sometimes became difficult to get the auger any deeper into the soil we stopped to insert the auger manually in this case thus at some places it was not possible to get the soil cores to the depth of 1 m the holes made by the sampling were filled with surface soil to prevent bypass flow the samples were carried to our laboratory ten grams of fresh soil was sampled from each divided core and shaken with 50 ml of 2 m kcl solution for 1 hr after the suspension was filtered the concentrations of no3 n and nh4 n in the solution were determined with the use of a flow injection system ouaatro2 hr bl tec osaka japan we calculated the contents per unit dry weight of soil c dry g n m 2 by using the soil moisture content measured with the same soil sample the calculated values were then translated to the contents per unit area c area 0 1 g n m 2 in each 0 1 m thick soil layer by the following equation 1 c area 0 1 c dry ρ d 0 1 where ρ d is the dry bulk density measured in the undisturbed soil samples from each soil layer obtained using a 100 cm3 cylindrical soil sampler g m 3 the ρ d obtained from a field near the study site iwata et al 2010a were used in the present study to evaluate the change of the no3 n content in winter we calculated not only the c area 0 1 but also the no3 n content in the soil layer to the depth of 0 3 m this is the plow layer where most of the crop roots are generally located and to the depth of 1 m the lower limit of measurement depth to sum up the c area 0 1 soil samplings were conducted on december 17 2009 and may 6 2010 in the first winter on november 25 2010 and april 18 2011 in the second winter and on november 28 2011 and may 14 2012 in the third winter 2 5 visualization of the pathway of snowmelt water in the snow cover to ascertain the movement of snowmelt water in the snow layer we applied approx 10 mg of red food coloring on the snow surface in a 1 m2 area in the control and treated plots before the onset of spring snowmelt in the first winter february 23 2010 the profiles of the snowpack in these two areas in mid snowmelt period were observed march 24 2010 the places where the snow was dyed by the food coloring were considered the pathway of the snowmelt water we compared the profiles of the dyed snow layer of the control and treated plots to identify any differences in the pathways caused by the snow compaction in the treated plot 2 6 statistical analysis we used t tests to examine the differences in the average values of the no3 n content in the given soil layers in the control and treated plots we also conducted a pearson s correlation analysis to examine the relationships between snowmelt infiltration and the no3 n content these analyses were conducted using microsoft excel 2016 software we considered that the average values were significantly different or that the relationship was significant when the probability p values were 0 05 3 results 3 1 air temperature snow cover properties and soil frost depth in early december of the first winter the air temperature dropped below 0 c and the surface soil then started to freeze left panels in fig 2 a e in the control plot the freezing front did not penetrate deeper after the snow cover thickness became 0 2 m in mid december this is in agreement with findings obtained previously in this region hirota et al 2006 harada et al 2009 the snow on the treated plot which was located on the west side of the study site fig 1 was compacted on december 14 resulting in a lesser snow cover thickness compared to that in the control plot fig 2c and as a result the freezing front penetrated deeper in this plot fig 2e snow compaction treatments were conducted on december 22 january 4 and january 12 after substantial amounts of snow fell fig 2b the max soil frost depth in the treated plot reached 0 39 m sd 0 049 m in contrast to the almost negligible soil frost depth in the control plot fig 2e although the snow cover thicknesses in the treated plot were approx one half to two thirds of those in the control plot fig 2c the swes in the treated plot were slightly larger than those in the control plot fig 2d because of the redistribution of snow by the westerly wind the snow had disappeared completely on april 7 in the control plot and on april 9 in the treated plot probably because of the slightly larger swe in the treated plot the frozen soil had thawed completely on april 19 in the treated plot 10 days after the end of the snowmelt period in the second winter 2010 2011 winter the snow compaction treatment was switched to the eastern plot fig 1 less snow accumulated on the field throughout this winter compared to the first winter fig 2c d on december 1 the surface soil was already frozen but some of the frozen soil temporarily thawed because of a substantial amount of rainfall with air temperatures above 0 c in early december quadrilateral a in fig 2 the daily mean air temperature dropped below 0 c again causing the soil to freeze again fig 2a e however the penetration of the freezing front stopped in mid december in the control plot because of the substantial amount of snow accumulation fig 2c e in contrast the snow compaction treatment enhanced the soil frost depth until mid february when the air temperature was cold enough for the freezing front to penetrate to the deep soil layer the snow compaction treatment was applied on december 20 and 27 and january 17 the max soil frost depth in the treated plot reached 0 43 m sd 0 005 m fig 2e which was comparable to that of the treated plot in the first winter the max soil frost depth in the control plot was 0 09 m sd 0 023 m and a soil frost depth of only 0 03 m sd 0 046 was observed during the snowmelt period fig 2e the swe values in the control and treated plots were almost identical throughout the observation period in this second winter fig 2d as a result on march 29 the snow in both plots had completely melted in the treated plot the frozen soil had thawed completely 18 days after march 29 in the third winter 2011 2012 winter the snow compaction treatment was applied in the western plot fig 1 that winter can be characterized by lower air temperatures and smaller amounts of snow accumulation compared to the first and second winters fig 2a c d in the control plot the soil freezing front penetrated until late december when the snow cover thickness became 0 2 m fig 2c e because of the snow compaction treatment the snow cover thickness in the treated plot was 0 2 m until late february as a result the maximum soil frost depth in the treated plot was 0 85 m sd 0 022 which was much deeper than the 0 23 m sd 0 027 in the control plot fig 2e the swe in the treated plot was slightly larger than that in the control plot fig 2d despite the deep penetration of the freezing front in the treated plot the frozen soil had completely thawed on may 2 16 days after the day when the snow had completely melted which was similar to the corresponding periods in the other two winters 3 2 snowmelt runoff fig 3 shows the cumulative values of snowmelt runoff in the control and treated plots the cumulative amount of runoff water in the treated plot was much larger than that in the control plot in the three snowmelt periods in the first winter a remarkable decrease of the swe was observed in early april in both plots fig 2d left panel suggesting that the main spring snowmelt period started from this time the amount of runoff water increased rapidly in the treated plot from april 2 fig 3a which coincided with the time point at which the marked decrease in the swe started the amount of runoff water also increased in the control plot but the rate of increase was less than that in the treated plot as a result the total amount of runoff water during the spring snowmelt period was calculated as 103 mm in the treated plot which was much larger than the 14 mm in the control plot note that the values of cumulative runoff water are the runoff amount per the unit area which means that the volume of runoff water from the study plot can be calculated by multiplying this value by the area of the plot similarly a large amount of runoff was observed in the treated plot at the same time that the swe decreased continuously in the second and third winters figs 2d 3b c in contrast to the large amount of runoff in the treated plot the cumulative runoff water in the control plot did not increase when the swe decreased continuously in both snowmelt periods as a result the total amounts of runoff in the treated plot during the spring snowmelt period were 70 4 mm in the second winter and 60 2 mm in the third winter fig 3b c which were 56 and 39 of the total amount of snowmelt waters smws in this plot respectively the total amounts of runoff in the control plot were only 2 5 mm and 3 9 mm 2 0 and 3 1 of the smws in this plot respectively in the second and third winters respectively suggesting that most of the snowmelt water infiltrated 3 3 changes in the vertical distribution of no3 n fig 4 shows the vertical distribution of no3 n content the peak of no3 n content became deeper after the spring snowmelt period in the control plot suggesting that a large amount of nitrate moved to the deep soil layer in this plot the peak of no3 n content also became deeper after the snowmelt period in the treated plot however the distribution of no3 n content did not markedly change in the treated plot as observed in the control plot in contrast to the no3 n content only a small amount of nh4 n 0 7 g m 2 was detected in autumn and after the snowmelt period in all three winters suggesting that almost all of the ammonium sulfate amended in autumn nitrified before winter data not shown table 1 shows the no3 n content to the depths of 0 3 m and 1 m before soil freezing in autumn and after the snowmelt period in spring a significant difference in the 3 year mean values was found only between the values in the soil layer to the depth of 0 3 m in these plots after the snowmelt period table 1 this suggests that the significant effect of the no3 n retention could be found only in the soil layer to the depth of 0 3 m in the treated plot where the soil frost depth was enhanced by the snow compaction treatment 3 4 snowmelt water movement in the compacted snow layer the snow densities in the treated plot were 500 kg m 3 after the snow compaction treatment which is 2 5 times larger than the average snow density in the control plot 200 kg m 3 as calculated using the snow cover thickness and the swe shown in fig 2 despite the high bulk density of the treated plot the red color tracer located below the snow surface before the onset of snowmelt dyed the snow layer homogeneously to the bottom of the snow layer during the snowmelt period fig 4 this profile was similar to that in the control plot although surface ponding was observed near the soil surface only in the treated plot these results indicate that snowmelt water from the snow surface traveled through the snow layer to the soil surface in both the control and treated plots 4 discussion 4 1 the effects of snow compaction on the soil frost depth and the penetration of snowmelt water in the snow layer the snow compaction treatment increased the bulk density of snow from 200 kg m 3 the average value of the natural condition before the snowmelt period in the control plot to 500 kg m 3 fig 2 this change might have increased the thermal conductivity of the snow by more than twofold edward and sato 1993 moreover the snow depth was reduced by approx 50 by the snow compaction treatment fig 2c which might have increased the thermal gradient in the snow cover because heat flux is a product of thermal conductivity and the thermal gradient a large increase in heat flux might have been produced by the snow compaction resulting in the large difference in soil frost depth between the control and treated plots the difference in the frost depth measured by the frost tube at three locations in each plot were relatively large in the treated plot in the first winter fig 2e when the max sd of the soil frost depth was 0 048 m this value is slightly larger than the measurement error of the soil frost tube 0 035 m iwata et al 2012 we thus speculate that the variability of the soil frost depth may have been almost negligible in both the control and treated plots we thus consider the snow compaction treatment a good method to enhance the soil frost depth uniformly in a large scale field in contrast to the remarkable change in the soil frost depth produced by the snow compaction treatment the results of the red tracer experiment shown in fig 5 suggest that the highly dense snow layer approx 500 kg m 3 in the treated plot did not impede snowmelt water movement through the snowpack assuming that the density of pure ice is 917 kg m 3 which is the ice density at 0 c budavari 1996 the porosity of the snow layer would be 0 55 m3 m 3 suggesting that a compacted snow layer still has enough pore space to be penetrated by a large amount of snowmelt water based on these past and present findings we conclude that the snow compaction treatment can enhance the soil frost depth without impeding the snowmelt infiltration of the snow layer 4 2 the effect of the soil frost depth on the snowmelt runoff and nitrate leaching because the compacted snow did not impede snowmelt infiltration an impermeable thick frozen soil layer might induce a large amount of runoff in the treated plot as illustrated in fig 3 ponding on the soil surface was not observed after the snowmelt period in the control plot in all three winters in contrast surface ponding was observed in the treated plot after the snowmelt period part of the surface water might have infiltrated the ground after the snowmelt period with the thawing of the frozen soil layer as illustrated in detail by iwata et al 2010a however our results clearly indicate that a substantial amount of runoff can still occur in a slightly sloping field with a thick frozen layer like our study site previous researchers mentioned that soil water content before the onset of soil freezing is one of the dominant factors in determining snowmelt infiltration e g gray et al 2001 the 60 5 mm of rain that fell on december 3 2010 which temporarily thawed the soil frozen layer quadrilateral a in fig 2 may have increased the soil water content in the soil surface layer just before the soil freezing in the second winter the average soil water content at 0 0 3 m depth in the soil layer which was monitored at the meteorological station near the study site was 0 49 m3 m 3 at this time which was larger than the soil water content before soil freezing in the first winter 0 43 m3 m 3 monitored on december 1 2009 or in the third winter 0 46 m3 m 3 monitored on november 29 however the amount of runoff in the treated plot in the second year was 70 mm which was less than that in the first winter 103 mm and comparable to that in the third winter 60 mm fig 3 the amount of snowmelt infiltration which was calculated by subtracting the amount of runoff from swe was 55 mm which was smaller than in the first 105 mm and third 95 mm winters these results suggest that the soil water content before the onset of soil freezing may not be a dominant factor in increasing snowmelt runoff although this can be a factor to determine the amount of snowmelt infiltration during and after the snowmelt period the no3 n content to the depth of 0 3 m in the treated plot was significantly larger than that in the control plot only after the snowmelt period table 1 because no3 n moves with water there was a clear relationship p 0 05 r 0 84 between the no3 n that remained at the soil layer to the depth of 0 3 m and the amount of snowmelt infiltration which was calculated by subtracting the measured runoff amount shown in fig 3 from the amount of snowmelt water fig 6 this suggests that the increase in snowmelt runoff induced by the thick frozen soil layer reduced the total amount of snowmelt infiltration which accordingly retained a larger amount of no3 n near the soil surface the snow compaction treatment is a promising method to enhance the soil frost depth we thus propose that the no3 n available for plant growth may be increased by the snow compaction treatment although the 3 year s average of the no3 n content to the depth of 1 m in the treated plot was slightly larger than that in the control plot there was no significant difference between these values table 1 the no3 n contents in the treated plot were similar to those in the control plot in the second and third winters table 1 the content in the treated plot was larger than that in the control plot in the first winter but the difference in the no3 n content was much larger in the soil layer at the 0 0 3 m depth table 1 these results indicate that the difference in the no3 n content in the 0 1 m soil layer caused by the snow compaction treatment is not remarkable like that in the soil layer to the depth of 0 3 m which means that most of the nitrate may remain in the soil layer to the depth of 1 m even if most of the snowmelt water infiltrated to the ground the no3 n near the soil surface can be used effectively by plants in contrast the no3 n located below the main root zone penetrates deeper in the growing season when precipitation is greater than evapotranspiration iwata et al 2004 calculated that the potential evapotranspiration is 3 mm d 1 on average during the cultivation period assuming that the period when snow is absent on the ground is 210 days approx 7 months the cumulative evapotranspiration of 1 year would be 630 mm which is less than the 970 mm annual precipitation in this region japan meteorological agency 2018 therefore the no3 n that has moved below the plow layer potentially pollutes the groundwater in this region 4 3 the influence of snow compaction treatment on agricultural production after the snowmelt period because of the remarkable climate changes over the last 30 years the time point at which a thick snow cover insulates the soil from cold air became earlier in the eastern part of hokkaido which is one of the main crop production areas of japan resulting in a shallow penetration of the freezing front in this area hirota et al 2006 with the increase in soil temperatures during the winter a substantial amount of small potato tubers left at the harvesting period sprouted in the next crop production season becoming one of the major weed volunteer potato in this area to kill the potato tubers during the winter by freezing them farmers started to remove snow which insulates the soil from cold air hirota et al 2011 yazaki et al 2013 some farmers also attempted to kill the volunteer potato plants by compacting the snow with a tractor in the crop rotation system in this area winter wheat which is sown in late september is the most commonly grown crop after potatoes shimoda et al 2015 and shimoda and hirota 2018 showed that it is possible to kill the potato tubers without reducing the yield of winter wheat by enhancing soil freezing by the snow compaction treatment as shown in fig 4 and table 1 a substantial amount of no3 n can remain in the soil surface layer by enhancing the frozen soil layer by snow compaction this implies that the snow compaction treatment could be a useful technique to increase the yield by increasing no3 n it might not be possible to conduct a snow removal operation in the wheat fields because this may harm the wheat leaves during the operation and kill them due to the low air temperatures after the snow removal however this treatment can also potentially improve the yield of other crops planted after the snowmelt period because the lesser amount of no3 n leaching may similarly occur based on the enhanced thick frozen soil layer yanai et al 2017 showed the possibility that there is a close relationship among the soil frost depth the amount of snowmelt infiltration and the no3 n content in the soil surface layer after the snowmelt period however the relationships among the soil frost depth snowmelt infiltration snowmelt runoff no3 n content in the soil surface layer and plant growth after the snowmelt period have not been established we did not observe a marked amount of soil erosion in the treated plot in our present study but the relationships among the soil frost depth the amount of snowmelt runoff and the quality of runoff water are not addressed in this study before recommending either treatment as a management procedure it may be necessary to further evaluate the resulting effects on the environment because both snow compaction and snow removal may substantially increase runoff as shown in this study further research is therefore required to ascertain the effects of soil frost control treatments on the productivity of crops and on the environment during and after a snowmelt period 5 conclusions our field scale experiment revealed that a snow compaction treatment enhanced the soil frost depth uniformly reduced the amount of snowmelt infiltration and induced a large amount of snowmelt runoff although surface ponding water infiltrated to the ground after the snowmelt period our results clearly indicate that a substantial amount of runoff water from the thick frozen soil layer 0 4 m depth in this study reduced the total amount of snowmelt infiltration which can retain a substantial amount of nitrate in the plow layer therefore the snow compaction treatment can be an effective technique to control the amount of nitrate in fields with snow cover in cold regions in northern japan a main crop production area of the country the earlier accumulation of snow covers has reduced the soil frost depth due to the climate changes over the last 30 years this induced a troublesome new weed the volunteer potato because it is difficult to kill the volunteer potato by herbicides farmers started to remove or compact snow to kill the volunteer potato tubers during the winter our present findings preset the possibility that these operations can increase the available nitrate in farmland this also indicates that the risk of the groundwater pollution by no3 n can be reduced by these treatments further research is required to

6888,informational entropy can be used to elucidate some important relationships between precipitation evapotranspiration et and discharge over a range of spatial and temporal scales entropy does not suffer from any a priori assumptions of linearity or distributional characteristics in a study of the southeastern united states entropy and mutual information were used to identify relationships between hydrologic variables over spatial scales from a few hundred to several thousand km2 and temporal scales from days to months two distinct et data sets were compared one based on a highly parameterized energy budget approach and the other based on a complex iterative solution and a modified penman method it was found that there was a considerable difference in uncertainty between the two methods and that although they each contained some amount of explanatory information regarding streamflow the more complex approach contained the most shared information further it was found that streamflow entropy or uncertainty increased with drainage area indicating that larger basins have more uncertainty to be reduced in that more information can possibly be gained through the knowledge of other variables however the knowledge of et reduces a greater proportion of uncertainty in smaller basins 1500 km2 while larger basins have more unexplained variability keywords entropy streamflow evapotranspiration mutual information 1 introduction the evapotranspiration et process has perplexed earth scientists and engineers for decades when constructing models of hydrologic or land surface processes the proper role of et in the model is often uncertain et algorithms range from very simple temperature driven methods to complex attempts to balance the energy budget at the canopy and or the surface and combinations of energy mass transfer and aerodynamic approaches which approach to use often reduces to the amount and type of input data that are available to the modeler in hydrology the purpose of the model is normally to simulate streamflow in a river basin so the question becomes how important will the et term in the model be to its ability to accurately simulate the hydrologic processes in the basin so as to result in an acceptable streamflow record when compared to observed data of course the answer to this question might vary with space and time scales and the resolution of the available data numerous comparisons of et methods have been conducted over the years see modeling discussion below however only a few have been aimed at determining the importance of accurate et estimates in streamflow simulation these studies have tended to be model specific in that the et term in particular models was perturbed in some way either randomly or with bias and then the model output evaluated because of this other non et related mechanisms of the particular model under review tend to affect the outcome and thus results vary according to the model used the recent advent of information theory into hydrology may offer some methods to evaluate the importance of et in streamflow models without the need to resort to the use of specific models information theory is based on the work of shannon 1948 and has found its principal application in the communication field however it has application in many areas and has found its way into various hydrologic contexts in the past thirty years or so see singh 2013a 2013b 1997 for a synthesis its advantages over conventional statistical methods include no prior assumptions regarding distributions linearity or normality in other instances the signal may be small compared to the noise and thus standard techniques may not be able to identify it efficiently especially if the sample sizes are small in addition if both space and time scales are involved then the procedures can be laborious as scales are changed and the computations are re done with the added uncertainty that one doesn t know the exact space and time scale to look for all of these disadvantages can be overcome through the use of information theory or statistical entropy the objective of this study was to use informational entropy principles to evaluate the uncertainties in evapotranspiration precipitation and streamflow and look at the reductions in uncertainty of stream flow given knowledge of other variables this analysis focused on the daily scale but expands to weekly 8 day and monthly 32 day since many large scale and drought sensitive models are run at the longer aggregates et precipitation and streamflow data were assimilated and entropy principles were employed to uncover the relationships between the variables in terms of the information content contained in each series and the common information between the data sets the aim of this investigation is to better understand how much uncertainty can be removed from streamflow predictions if the uncertainty of et estimates can be reduced 2 background 2 1 information theory and its application to hydrology as stated above informational entropy is based in the work in communication theory of shannon 1948 in this context entropy represents a measure of uncertainty contained in a message data set or distribution when information is specified about a random variable the uncertainty is reduced or removed thus taken in the reverse if entropy represents uncertainty then it can also be used to measure the amount of added information that must be included in a data set to make it useful to a desired degree put another way entropy can be seen as the amount of information expected to be gained by observation singh 2013a 2013b on average the uncertainty of the data is given by the shannon entropy function which is the negative expected value of the natural log probability 1 h e δ i i 1 n p i ln p i where h is the entropy and pi is the probability that the system is in state i e δ i is the expected value of the amount of information expected to be gained by observation here entropy is measured in nits or nats as the natural logarithm base of e is used in some instances logits or decibles are used when the common logarithm base 10 is applied for the continuous case 2 h 0 f x ln f x d x where f x is the continuous probability density function pdf since its introduction the shannon entropy theory has been extended in important ways i e cross entropy kullback and leibler 1951 and relative entropy cover and thomas 2012 where the distance between two distributions can be measured most useful in this study is the measure of mutual information taking the relative entropy a step further mutual information is a measure of the amount of information that a data set from one random variable contains about another cover and thomas 2012 mutual information is the relative entropy between the joint distribution of two random variables x y and the product of those two distributions 3 i x y x x y y p x y ln p x y p x p y d p x y p x p y further mutual information can be defined in terms of conditional entropy adapted from cover and thomas 2012 4 1 i x y x y p x y ln p x y p x p y 4 2 x y p x y ln p x x y p x y ln p x y 4 3 h x h x y thus the reduction of the uncertainty about x due to the knowledge of y is the mutual information and vice versa as the measure is symmetric for further derivations and theorems deduced from this principle see cover and thomas 2012 horibe 1985 used the conditional entropies as defined above to develop an entropic correlation coefficient ρ x y 5 ρ x y 1 d x y where d x y h x y h x if h x h y and d x y h y x h y if h y h x where d x y is the correlation distance between x and y as noted by singh 1997 in the case of multiple variables this measure introduces a natural or informative topology singh 1997 details the use of entropy theory in hydrological systems with the principal idea that there exists an inherent tendency for natural processes to proceed toward a state of greater disorder by using entropic measures the analysis is not limited to assumptions of linearity or normality entropy theory has been applied to hydrologic problems in a variety of contexts singh 2016 2013a 2013b one major theme has been the use of the maximum entropy concept jaynes 1957 to simulate vertical profiles of hydrologic or hydraulic variables such as velocity and soil moisture al hamdan and cruise 2010 barbé et al 1991 chiu 1989 cui and singh 2013 mishra et al 2015 2013 singh 2010a singh and cui 2014 simple shannon entropy has also been used to examine the uncertainties associated with hydrologic processes such as vadose zone soil moisture dynamics mays et al 2002 pachepsky et al 2006 singh 2010b rainfall runoff generation singh 2016 2015 2011 singh et al 2012 singh 2013a 2013b and sediment transport chiu 1989 singh et al 2015 singh and cui 2014 another major direction in entropy applications has been in the design and evaluation of hydrometric networks to maximize the information content in the collected data husain 1989 1987 krstanovic and singh 1992a 1992b yang and burn 1994 and in the evaluation of model performance amorocho and espildora 1973 chapman 1986 pachepsky et al 2006 studies include strategies such as maximizing the joint entropy while minimizing the total correlation or redundancy alfonso et al 2013 2010a 2010b alfonso and price 2012 li et al 2012 and net entropy mishra and coulibaly 2010 more recently these strategies have been expanded to include ensemble methods alfonso et al 2014 and multivariate analysis keum and coulibaly 2017 however it is the work of brunsell and his associates brunsell and young 2010 2008 brunsell et al 2008 brunsell and anderson 2011 in the field of mutual information that has the most relevance to this study these authors have demonstrated how relative entropy and mutual information can be used to characterize scale effects of land surface responses to atmospheric forcing with particular attention to precipitation and et similarly stoy et al 2009 used information theory to evaluate distributional changes to remotely sensed vegetation indices ndvi lai at differing spatial resolutions in this study we use entropy as an information metric to quantify the information needed to characterize a variable or its frequency distribution a higher value of entropy indicates that more information is needed to characterize the variable or its distribution which means that the variable or its distribution has higher uncertainty in other words uncertainty is connected to information that is the more information we have about a variable the less uncertain it is it is in this sense that we are using uncertainty which is standard practice in the entropy literature it might be remarked that variance a more traditional statistical measure and entropy are not uniquely connected except in cases where the distribution is known or assumed ebrahimi et al 2010 zeng et al 2016 entropy is measured using a frequency distribution while variance is measured from actual data our interest in this work is to evaluate the information that precipitation and et provide to streamflow 2 2 evapotranspiration in hydrologic models with the exception of simple single event flood models all hydrologic and land surface models include an et algorithm it is necessary to keep mass balance if for no other reason over long time periods it is often assumed that soil storage balances out over the analysis period thus the mass balance will just be p et q where p precipitation et evapotranspiration and q runoff for shorter or intermediate time periods however soil storage will not balance out and the et role is not as clear cut since one can never know with certainty at what scale soil moisture storage will cancel out the modeler cannot know the importance of et in the model beforehand this can lead to some consternation about the level of detail that the selected et method should have in a particular situation the matter is further complicated by the fact that many et equations predict potential et the atmospheric demand for water which then must be modified to get the actual et a large number of et or pet methods have been developed over the years these range from simple temperature driven models e g hamon to more physically based but data intensive approaches such as penman monteith penman monteith pm requires a great deal of atmospheric and vegetation data as well as the estimation of surface and aerodynamic resistance coefficients that are difficult to obtain and may not be consistent over large spatial domains alves and santos pereira 2000 kelliher et al 1993 thus it would be very helpful if the modeler could know something in advance about the importance of et in the particular hydrologic problem at hand investigations of the et streamflow relationship have usually focused on streamflow recession analysis methods rams e g federer 1973 tschinkel 1963 weisman 1977 often focusing specifically on riparian et impacts e g bauer et al 2004 boronina et al 2005 nachabe et al 2005 rams are a widely used technique in the investigation of storage streamflow relationships at the catchment scale however they rely solely on individual parameterizations and are often too specific for basin scale analysis stoelzle et al 2012 these studies above do provide insights that can be useful going forward in that it appears that the daily fluctuations and magnitudes of et may have a significant effect on streamflow though it could be limited to the riparian extent and base flowperiods with respect to non observational studies relating et to streamflow the most common methods used for simulating streamflow are rainfall runoff models there are several studies published that concern the sensitivity of streamflow in rainfall runoff models to potential et estimates andersson 1992 andréassian et al 2004 kokkonen and jakeman 2001 oudin et al 2006 2004 parmele 1972 vazquez 2003 these studies generally follow one of three methodologies to introduce differentiation in the potential evaporation pe to analyze its effect on the streamflow models a different et method of calculation the introduction of random errors or the introduction of fixed biased errors the studies also vary in the testing schemes used to evaluate the impacts of data errors on model performance as well as the kind of models used and the number and type of watersheds studied the filtering effect of the rainfall runoff models seems to have led some modelers into believing that improved estimation of et was not important especially at small temporal scales and when compared to the sensitivity of the models to precipitation andréassian et al 2004 andréassian et al 2001 oudin et al 2005a 2005b suggests that temporally daily varying pe contributes no significant improvement in rainfall runoff models than that of using mean pe in general it seems that the rainfall runoff models tend to compensate for et estimation biases by adapting certain parameters with little loss to efficiency acting as a low pass filter of sorts oudin et al 2004 using their internal degrees of freedom andréassian et al 2004 vazquez 2003 however did report large differences in the mike she model using three different et estimates contradicting most of the previous and current literature 3 study area and data sets used the objective of this study was to apply information theory to uncover the relationship between et and streamflow for the southeastern united states the states of alabama georgia south carolina and north florida representative streamflow records were selected from the usgs hydro climatic data network hcdn lins and slack 1999 slack and landwehr 1992 the hcdn is composed of quality controlled stream gage records from all available sites in the united states the data are screened for all anthropogenic confounding factors that might affect the fidelity of the record slack and landwehr 1992 the hcdn is the official streamflow data base used by the usgs for all global change hydrologic analyses as such it formed the basis of the landmark lins and slack 1999 study of streamflow trends in the unites states and its subsequent updates groisman et al 2004 united states geological survey 2005 from the hcdn data base 57 records were selected for this study only those gages were selected that were in operation from 1980 through 2011 gages were also selected so as to afford a good spatial representation of the southeast region watershed size was another consideration and areas ranged from 134 4 km2 to 9885 4 km2 fig 1 showcases the boundaries of the basins used in the regional analysis table a1 provided in the appendix contains the usgs gauge number name location and contributing drainage area for each of the selected 57 basins likewise two nationally recognized and vetted sources of et data were selected for analysis and comparison a few previous authors have used limited eddy flux tower observations to analyze et dynamics over relatively short time periods brunsell et al 2008 brunsell and anderson 2011 ruddell and kumar 2009 however flux tower data often only operate for short periods of time and thus suffer from periods of inconsistent data they also do not offer wide spatial coverage only 10 sites are available in the southeastern us study area and all of these offer very inconsistent data records for this reason modeled et data were necessarily used in place of flux tower estimates the two models utilized in this study were the unified noah land surface model betts et al 1997 chen et al 1997 ek 2003 and the variable infiltration capacity vic model gao et al 2009 liang et al 1994 these are two widely used models both of which are incorporated into nasa s land information system kumar et al 2006 peters lidard et al 2007 the energy balance modules of both models have been extensively tested using observed soil moisture streamflow and flux towers and the models have been found to represent observations well albeit with errors and uncertainties especially at smaller spatial scales chen et al

infiltration capacity and derives non linear base flow vic considers three categories of et canopy evaporation vegetative evapotranspiration and bare soil evaporation the total et is calculated from the sum of these components weighted by the vegetative fraction of the land surface representation the basic formulation of each of these et components is penman based complex algorithms which are applied to estimate the aerodynamic and surface canopy resistances taking into account atmospheric stability temperature vapor pressure deficits photosynthetically active radiation fluxes par and soil moisture factors gao et al 2009 the vic model can be run to balance both the water and energy budgets unlike most land surface models in vic s iterative energy balance sequence the latent heat is resolved indirectly in this process the energy flux between the over and understory canopies is computed and used to compute the canopy air temperature which in turn is then used to compute the sensible heat loss between the canopy and the atmosphere the energy fluxes are compared and if the error exceeds a tolerance level then the new temperature is employed to re compute the sensible heat fluxes and the energy budget is resolved again until the estimates match cherkauer et al 2003 the long term dataset of livneh et al 2013 developed by the university of washington group was used for

www esrl noaa gov psd data gridded data livneh html 4 methodology the streamflow data together with the two et data sets from previous section vic and noah provided consistent daily data for the period 1980 2011 over the entire study area the data were spatially averaged by grid cells over the basins in the study area for the aggregate analysis 8 day and 32 day means were computed by resampling the daily time series the first step in the analysis was to conduct preliminary evaluations of the data an initial harmonic analysis of the streamflow and et series was performed to characterize the raw absolute values of both et and q a simple time series approach was applied using sin and cos functions to estimate the periodic fluctuations of the data and to determine the variance explained by their annual cycles when cycles and autocorrelation were identified they were removed from the data sets by computing anomalies from the long term means the residuals from this exercise were then employed in the entropy analyses the entropy contained in each sample was first computed from eq 1 then the mutual information contained in each dataset was calculated using eq 4 1 since entropy requires that the data be derived from independent random samples the data with the annual cycles removed were utilized for those analyses a bootstrap process was employed wherein random samples of size 300 were selected to ensure consistency between all temporal scales without over sampling the complete populations particularly at the monthly time step research on the effects of sample size on entropy results are mixed pincus 1991 wisz et al 2008 zighed et al 2010 so it was decided to maintain a fixed sample size across all time steps for comparison as the magnitude of the entropy values is highly dependent on the number and width of the bins selected in this case evidence showed relatively long tailed distributions p and q and one more gaussian et in fact since we included samples with zero precipitation days the distribution of daily precipitation was essentially exponential in shape since a focus of this study was to compare entropies across all variables and since entropy is such a function of bin sizes the same number of bins were used for all variables it is important that the binning strategy capture the shape and moments of the probability distributions to account for the size and variability of the data we used the sturges sturges 1926 and freedman freedman and diaconis 1981 rules to calculate the localized bin size for for each sample in each basin it was found that 30 bins was most effective in capturing the distributions and was roughly the overall mean estimate from both rules used however it is important to note here that regardless of the number and width of bins selected the basic relationships and trends in the results reported below did not change only the magnitude of the results were affected 5 results and discussion 5 1 harmonic analysis fig 2 shows the results of the harmonic analysis averaged over all basins as expected the et data from the lis revealed a significant annual cycle even in the daily series with over 80 of the variance explained by the harmonic however the vic et data explained less of the variance especially at the daily scale with roughly half the influence of lis the annual cycles in the et data did not translate to particularly large cycles in the streamflow data with only about 15 of the variance explained in the daily observations and about 21 explained in the monthly series 5 2 entropy analysis entropy techniques have the potential to reveal important information about the nature of et streamflow relationships first the shannon entropy of each data set was computed for daily 8 day and 32 day aggregations the results for the 1 day entropies for each variable are summarized over all 57 basins in figs 3 and 4 below see table a2 in the appendix for a tabular summary of all entropy results for comparative purposes it is noted that the maximum entropy log n for this analysis based on a consistent bin size of 30 is 3 40 nats the figures show that et consistently has the highest entropy with vic the highest while the precipitation and streamflow uncertainties are similar in magnitude and exhibit much more variability than does either et data set comparing the two et datasets it is not surprising that the vic et data contains more uncertainty than does the lis et since more of the variance in et was taken up by the annual cycle in the lis data this phenomenon may be due both to the model differences and to the meteorological data used to force the models a comparison of the noah and vic models xia et al 2016 reveals that certain inputs e g vegetation indices are provided by look up tables in both models however other variables in the energy budget that are inputs to noah e g albedo are calculated within the vic model this fact along with the added complexity of the vic et algorithm may be responsible for at least part of the added uncertainty in the model results for example peters lidard et al 2000 have demonstrated how the use of look up tables in noah can significantly degrade the model results and how the model is highly sensitive to the meteorological inputs in that vein the livenh forcing data are primarily an interpretation of observed data as compared to the nldas reanalysis data taken together it may be that the vic model resolves more daily fluctuations in the latent heat than does the lis model as evidenced by the relatively small amount of variance accounted for by the annual cycle in vic compared to lis we can also see that the discharge and precipitation entropies exhibit considerable variation across watersheds while the two et data sets demonstrate far less spatial variability the very close relationship between the discharge and precipitation uncertainties highlights the expected relationship between the two variables however given that the entropies uncertainty in the et data sets are larger it seems natural to assume that some of the information in et is shared with streamflow above that imparted by the precipitation next we need to ask whether or not the variability shown across the watersheds in the h q p and et plots are significant the average variance of h q and h p between basins was 0 0781 and 0 0942 nats respectively assuming that the data all came from the same population a problematic assumption with known variances and sufficiently large sample sizes the results of a two sample t test indicate that a difference in mean entropy values of 0 02 nat would be significant p value 0 01 in both data sets fig 4 shows that the spread between basins in both h q and h p is indeed greater than 0 02 nat sd dev 0 28 and 0 30 respectively likewise the inter basin spread of the h vic was also significant at the 0 01 when looking at the inter sample variabilities the average of h p and h q 0 121 and 0 103 nats respectively compared to average values of 0 0174 and 0 00363 nats for the h lis and h vic respectively just from a qualitative standpoint then one can see that the inter sample variabilities are much less than are the inter basin variabilities for the h p and h q series while the two measures are much smaller for the et data this again would lead to the conclusion that the inter basin variability displayed in fig 4 for h q and h p is more significant than is true for the et data the spatial variability of the daily entropies is shown in fig 5 where the entropy is plotted against the basin drainage areas the similarity between the spatial relationships of the discharge and precipitation entropies is striking and both have non linear power trends that are significant at the 0 05 level a positive significant trend also appears to be present in the h vic in contrast to the h lis case though visibly less than that of the h q and h p the slight difference in the trends of the discharge and precipitation data appears to be due to the lesser entropies in precipitation at the small basin scale which does not appear to translate to the discharge where larger entropies are observed these differences are significant according to the t test results given above it can also be observed that the difference between h q and the et entropies are higher at the smaller basin scale than for the larger basins especially as compared to h p so it is possible that more uncertainty is shared with the discharge above that imposed by p by the et process at the smaller spatial scales and that this shared uncertainty decreases with basin size although it may still be significant fig 5 shows that uncertainty in precipitation discharge and to an extent vic et all increase with drainage area size it is obvious that uncertainty in precipitation at the larger spatial scales exerts a dominant influence on the resulting uncertainty in streamflow however other factors such as basin characteristics are undoubtedly at work it can also be observed that the entropies approach an asymptote less than log n indicating that at least for this data set there is a limit to hydrologic uncertainty with spatial scale this also implies that there is more information to be gained by further observations for the larger basins although these results are for a specific precipitation product maurer the similarity in relationships to the observed discharge gives confidence in the conclusions discussed above the relative lack of spatial variability in the et entropies as compared to h q and h p may be due also to the climate or atmospheric conditions in the southeastern us where the high relative humidity lower vapor pressure deficit and cloud cover decreased radiation across the region in summertime limits the pet and thus depresses the variability of actual et to further untangle this question a simple budyko 1971 analysis was conducted and it was found that the majority of the basins were in a water limited situation pet p 1 those that were energy limited tended to be smaller and comprise a significant majority of forest as compared to other land classes further the relative influence of the aridity index pet p on entropy was examined it was found that though the correlation between the two variables was weak r2 1 the slope of the regression was significant indicating that as the watershed becomes more water limited as opposed to energy limited it is more likely to exhibit a relatively higher uncertainty of et this can perhaps be explained by the fact that the water limitation is a result of a landscape as opposed to the climate dependent on homogeneous surface and sub surface characteristics and thus may introduce added uncertainty this is evident in both et datasets even though the raw entropy is different between the two figs 3 5 effectively illustrate the entropy of p and et as compared to streamflow uncertainty at the daily temporal scale to this point it appears that the daily uncertainties in vic et are higher than those of lis et precipitation and streamflow but et uncertainty in both data sets is less variable among the basins examined and that the relationship between et and discharge uncertainties at the daily time scale is ambiguous at best we can start to untangle these issues by looking at the mutual information mi between variables as summarized in fig 6 below the first point that stands out in fig 6 is that the mutual information between daily precipitation and discharge data is noticeably less than that between the other variables however the variability across basins appears to be about the same in all cases of course since there was less entropy in the discharge and precipitation data to begin with this would naturally lead to less mi between the two as compared to the et data the mi is higher in the et cases especially so in the case of vic although the variability is about the same as in the mutual information of p and q i p q this would seem to indicate that there is more information to be gained about discharge from further observation of et particularly vic but that there is variability across basins because the entropy of et is higher it has more potential to share information with q further it implies that vic et has the highest possibility of reducing streamflow uncertainty through further refinement of the et algorithm and meteorological inputs the mutual information between discharge and the et data sets is further illustrated where the mis are plotted against the discharge entropy for each watershed in the study in fig 7 as shown all the mis between the datasets follow the entropy of q p pattern however consistently i q vic and i p vic contain more mutual information not surprisingly the mi data generally follow the same pattern as the raw entropy data given in fig 3 and it should be noted that in general the bounds for mi are the lower entropy value from the two datasets which in this case is consistently p and q thus effectively presenting the upper bounds in fig 7 i p q and i p vic lis are plotted against the drainage areas in fig 8 a and b showing the influence the scale effect of q p entropy on the mi the relationships can be further clarified through the entropic correlations given in eq 5 and shown in fig 8c and d right side fig 8 demonstrates that the q p relationship nearly always contains the smallest amount of information of any of the other data sets particularly for the smaller drainage basins 1500 km2 q p entropic correlations are often 0 1 for these basins in these cases both et data sets consistently demonstrate higher information content with the q vic correlations between 0 2 and 0 25 the mi values for the q p relationship are often as much as 0 4 nat below that of the vic et data which according to the two sample t test given earlier is certainly significant at the 0 01 level the shared information between the entropy of the et variables and discharge as demonstrated by the correlations in fig 8 seems to indicate that up to one quarter of the uncertainty in daily streamflow could be explained by the uncertainties in daily et on the other hand there appears to be a clear scale effect in the correlation between precipitation and streamflow as shown in figs 8 and 9 mimicking the trends of the marginal entropy seen in fig 5 a picture begins to emerge that while more information about daily discharge itself can be gained by further observation at larger spatial scales fig 8 shows that mutual information between et and q is consistently larger across all scales it seems clear that the explanation of the greater uncertainty in streamflow at larger scales is more confounded between precipitation and et and perhaps basin characteristics however either way it is clear that the key to hydrologic modeling is to keep mass balance in the soil at scales commensurate with the response time of the basin it is interesting that the mi between q and et shows a more significant scale effect than did the et entropy itself this is due to the fact that mi is limited by the smallest entropy q in this case and thus the scale effect in the q entropy was imposed on the mi however as indicated on fig 8 the data shows significant power relationships indicating that the increase in mutual information as a function of basin size is larger in the small scale range da 1500 km2 than for larger basins the strong relationship at smaller scales may be related to the response time of the basins for watersheds whose response time is greater than 1 day the information gain added at the daily time step is less effective compared to the information already gained from precipitation however it appears that observation of et at these shorter time scales can add significant information about discharge above that imparted by precipitation alone comparisons of the behavior of the two et data sets also leads to some interesting insights into the relationships between q and et uncertainty at the daily time scale in the lis et data a large portion of the overall variance was accounted for by the annual cycle as compared to the vic data thus less uncertainty was left in the lis data and this entropy was not as related to the streamflow uncertainty as was the vic data which contained more uncertainty to begin with the lis noah et algorithm has more variables fixed by the user and employs a climate reanalysis data set in contrast to the vic model which computes most variables and uses interpolated observed climate data as well as resolving the daily energy budget in an iterative process thus vic appears to mimic the daily fluctuations of et above the annual cycle better than does the noah model this added uncertainty in vic is then better related to the uncertainty in the streamflow thus more potential exists to reduce streamflow uncertainty through further observation of et from the vic model than exists in the noah model however as shown in fig 9 even the noah model still contains significant ability to improve the streamflow uncertainty especially at the smaller spatial scales this may be a significant observation in that even when an et model is highly parameterized in such a way that the annual cycle dominates the response there can still be enough information available beyond the cycle to significantly affect streamflow uncertainty at smaller spatial scales in fact figs 9 and 10 captures the conundrum facing hydrologic modelers is it better to parameterize the et model to just capture the major variation in annual et i e annual cycle or to employ a more complex model that captures additional noise in the daily et process of course even at smaller basins the relationship between q and et is convoluted by the similar relationship between uncertainties of precipitation and et this intertwining of factors is illustrated in the similarity of the mi of the et q relationships and the p et relationships these relationships highlight the fact that precipitation is supplying the input for the soil moisture that regulates the et as well as the discharge however the i p q relationship in fig 8 indicates that little information about discharge can be gained for the smaller basins by observation of p alone thus quality et data are valuable at this scale it is not surprising that the i q et mimics the basic i q p since the original q entropy demonstrates this trend again the asymptotic nature of this relationship indicates the limiting nature of the uncertainty in daily discharge with drainage area and consequently the difficulty in extracting this uncertainty through observation of daily et especially for larger basins these results somewhat coincide with the findings of previous model based studies i e andréassian 2004 andréassian et al 2004 oudin et al 2004 2005a 2005b noting that improved et here inferred as reduced uncertainty may not increase the model performance however this analysis found that particular at smaller spatial scales in which some of the studies referenced included et indeed does have a significant amount of information to be imparted in addition to precipitation the previous studies seem to suggest the model parameterization as the culprit while here in a semi observational analysis the results show a distinct difference in the amount of unique information et can contribute to the reduction of the uncertainty at smaller basins as compared to larger ones the present results may be best interpreted in light of the conclusions from the entropy studies cited previously those studies generally concluded that information can be lost as data are scaled up or aggregated based on remote sensing estimates brunsell et al 2008 brunsell and anderson 2011 that information tends to flow from variables with high entropy to those with low entropy ruddell and kumar 2009 but that relatively low resolution data 2 km may be sufficient to capture et processes at least in grassland areas brunsell et al 2008 it was also concluded that scaling of et using remotely sensed instruments is relatively spatially invariant for a given instrument but may vary between sensors brunsell and anderson 2011 in our case although the et data are derived from land surface models those models rely on remotely sensed inputs that are undoubtedly affecting their uncertainties so the above conclusions are certainly relevant to our analysis for example the scaling up of the 4 km native model outputs to the basin scale would tend to result in a loss of information in the et data that would not be present in the observed streamflow data however the ruddell and kumar 2009 observation of information flow is consistent with our results that et entropy is higher especially vic and thus information would flow from the et to the streamflow 5 3 aggregates analysis it is also of interest to examine these relationships at larger time intervals such as those handled by larger scale models global continental and those primarily concerned with drought and water availability to that end the 8 and 32 day entropy and mutual information values of each variable were calculated across each watershed and are summarized in figs 9 and 10 the first thing that stands out in fig 9 is the degree to which the discharge and precipitation uncertainties have increased by aggregating to a larger time period the spread of the 8 day and 32 day entropies is also less than that of the daily data as it is evident that aggregating the data reduces the spatial variability of the discharge and precipitation uncertainties to a degree the inter sample variances are also greatly decreased by the aggregation with the 8 day values less than half that of the daily and the 32 day variances reduced by more than 50 again the increase in entropies along with the great reduction in variability both spatially and temporally leads to the conclusion that the aggregation tends to not only smooth the distributions but also to make them more uniform thus leading to greater entropy values however it is notable that the et data did not show this effect with only a slight increase in the 32 day entropy in the lis case and a notable decline in uncertainty with aggregation in the vic data the increase in discharge and precipitation entropy is contrary to the conclusion of brunsell and anderson 2011 and brunsell et al 2008 that temporal aggregation of data tends to reduce information content in the data we can further explore the relationships between aggregate et and streamflow through the mutual information shown in fig 10 the data show that mi increases each time the data are aggregated in all cases these results seem to imply that aggregating or smoothing the data series can actually increase the uncertainty in q and p but that the ability of the precipitation as well as the lis and vic et data to explain the streamflow variability is increased as well the mi is plotted against drainage area for the 8 day and 32 day aggregates in fig 11 the figure shows that the mi relationship with drainage area for the 8 day aggregates appears very similar to the daily pattern there is still significant information to be gained by further observation of et it is greater in the case of vic et and it is most prominent at the smaller spatial scales however interestingly the pattern is obscured somewhat in the case of the 32 day aggregates it s obvious that there is a greater increase in shared information between q and p at the 8 day and 32 day time scales compared to the increases in the et data so that p approaches the importantance of et at the greater time scales although there is still information to be gained from et in these cases it is not as great as in the daily case nor is it as scale related 6 conclusions this study focused on the relationship between evapotranspiration and streamflow in the southeastern united states at various time and space scales entropic analyses were employed to help characterize their uncertainties and quantify their informational relationships observed streamflow observational based precipitation and modeled et data were used the uncertainty or entropy in streamflow precipitation and vic et displayed significant spatial variability over the study area although the spatial variability was reduced at greater temporal scales lis et on the other hand displayed less entropy than did the vic et and did not exhibit significant spatial variability both et data sets consistently displayed significantly higher entropy compared to discharge and precipitation using a budyko type analysis it was found that the majority of watersheds were in a water limited situation possibly contributing to the higher et entropy the uncertainty in the daily precipitation and discharge data in particular exhibited the largest spatial variability over the region and demonstrated very similar relationships with drainage area in both cases entropy appeared to approach a limiting value with drainage area indicating that there is an upper limit in uncertainty in precipitation and runoff with basin size the relationships also imply that there is more information to be gained from observations of daily q and p on larger basins than smaller ones and that most of the uncertainty in streamflow is imparted by the uncertainty in precipitation however analysis of the shared information between variables mutual information led to a different set of insights the relationship between daily precipitation and streamflow was weaker and more variable than that between et and streamflow thus it is clear that there is value to observations of daily et above and beyond what can be imparted through precipitation alone this is probably due to the fact that et is a continuous process related to streamflow while precipitation is more sporadic there is also a clear relationship between drainage area and mi at the daily time step with more information about streamflow to be gained from observation of et on the larger basins the amount of information to be gained on the order of 0 1 0 4 nats is significant when compared to the variability of entropy as a whole interestingly at longer weekly monthly time steps the uncertainty in the precipitation and discharge data sets increased while the spatial variability was reduced with aggregation although the uncertainty in lis et also increased slightly at the greater time scales the vic et entropy showed a notable decrease however mutual information increased significantly at each time step for all variables thus indicating stronger relationships between discharge and both precipitation and et at longer time intervals additionally the scale dependence of the mutual information between discharge and the other variables was decreased with increased temporal periods the two et data sets employed in this analysis showed distinct differences in uncertainty and relationship with discharge the noah lsm lis et contained a much stronger annual cycle than did the et derived from the vic lsm thus more uncertainty was available in the vic et residuals and this fact was reflected in higher entropies in vic et across all time and space scales this uncertainty especially in the daily data may result from a more detailed resolution of the energy budget in the vic model and less parameterization of variables than is done in the noah lsm the greater available information in the vic et translated to greater shared information with streamflow compared to both lis et and precipitation and was particularly evident at smaller spatial scales thus the study reveals that et particularly if derived from a less parameterized application of the penman monteith equation to estimate latent energy can contribute significant information to streamflow modeling at the daily time step however at longer time steps the influence of precipitation becomes more dominant and thus the contribution of et while still evident becomes less significant finally it should be noted that these results are for a specific climatic and physiographic location in the united states it should also be restated that the et data used in this analysis was from two different models in place of actual flux estimates this was necessary to enable the long term spatial analysis described here however the different characteristics of the two et data sets served to further amplify the relationship between et uncertainty and resultant shared information with streamflow results may differ for other areas however

6888,informational entropy can be used to elucidate some important relationships between precipitation evapotranspiration et and discharge over a range of spatial and temporal scales entropy does not suffer from any a priori assumptions of linearity or distributional characteristics in a study of the southeastern united states entropy and mutual information were used to identify relationships between hydrologic variables over spatial scales from a few hundred to several thousand km2 and temporal scales from days to months two distinct et data sets were compared one based on a highly parameterized energy budget approach and the other based on a complex iterative solution and a modified penman method it was found that there was a considerable difference in uncertainty between the two methods and that although they each contained some amount of explanatory information regarding streamflow the more complex approach contained the most shared information further it was found that streamflow entropy or uncertainty increased with drainage area indicating that larger basins have more uncertainty to be reduced in that more information can possibly be gained through the knowledge of other variables however the knowledge of et reduces a greater proportion of uncertainty in smaller basins 1500 km2 while larger basins have more unexplained variability keywords entropy streamflow evapotranspiration mutual information 1 introduction the evapotranspiration et process has perplexed earth scientists and engineers for decades when constructing models of hydrologic or land surface processes the proper role of et in the model is often uncertain et algorithms range from very simple temperature driven methods to complex attempts to balance the energy budget at the canopy and or the surface and combinations of energy mass transfer and aerodynamic approaches which approach to use often reduces to the amount and type of input data that are available to the modeler in hydrology the purpose of the model is normally to simulate streamflow in a river basin so the question becomes how important will the et term in the model be to its ability to accurately simulate the hydrologic processes in the basin so as to result in an acceptable streamflow record when compared to observed data of course the answer to this question might vary with space and time scales and the resolution of the available data numerous comparisons of et methods have been conducted over the years see modeling discussion below however only a few have been aimed at determining the importance of accurate et estimates in streamflow simulation these studies have tended to be model specific in that the et term in particular models was perturbed in some way either randomly or with bias and then the model output evaluated because of this other non et related mechanisms of the particular model under review tend to affect the outcome and thus results vary according to the model used the recent advent of information theory into hydrology may offer some methods to evaluate the importance of et in streamflow models without the need to resort to the use of specific models information theory is based on the work of shannon 1948 and has found its principal application in the communication field however it has application in many areas and has found its way into various hydrologic contexts in the past thirty years or so see singh 2013a 2013b 1997 for a synthesis its advantages over conventional statistical methods include no prior assumptions regarding distributions linearity or normality in other instances the signal may be small compared to the noise and thus standard techniques may not be able to identify it efficiently especially if the sample sizes are small in addition if both space and time scales are involved then the procedures can be laborious as scales are changed and the computations are re done with the added uncertainty that one doesn t know the exact space and time scale to look for all of these disadvantages can be overcome through the use of information theory or statistical entropy the objective of this study was to use informational entropy principles to evaluate the uncertainties in evapotranspiration precipitation and streamflow and look at the reductions in uncertainty of stream flow given knowledge of other variables this analysis focused on the daily scale but expands to weekly 8 day and monthly 32 day since many large scale and drought sensitive models are run at the longer aggregates et precipitation and streamflow data were assimilated and entropy principles were employed to uncover the relationships between the variables in terms of the information content contained in each series and the common information between the data sets the aim of this investigation is to better understand how much uncertainty can be removed from streamflow predictions if the uncertainty of et estimates can be reduced 2 background 2 1 information theory and its application to hydrology as stated above informational entropy is based in the work in communication theory of shannon 1948 in this context entropy represents a measure of uncertainty contained in a message data set or distribution when information is specified about a random variable the uncertainty is reduced or removed thus taken in the reverse if entropy represents uncertainty then it can also be used to measure the amount of added information that must be included in a data set to make it useful to a desired degree put another way entropy can be seen as the amount of information expected to be gained by observation singh 2013a 2013b on average the uncertainty of the data is given by the shannon entropy function which is the negative expected value of the natural log probability 1 h e δ i i 1 n p i ln p i where h is the entropy and pi is the probability that the system is in state i e δ i is the expected value of the amount of information expected to be gained by observation here entropy is measured in nits or nats as the natural logarithm base of e is used in some instances logits or decibles are used when the common logarithm base 10 is applied for the continuous case 2 h 0 f x ln f x d x where f x is the continuous probability density function pdf since its introduction the shannon entropy theory has been extended in important ways i e cross entropy kullback and leibler 1951 and relative entropy cover and thomas 2012 where the distance between two distributions can be measured most useful in this study is the measure of mutual information taking the relative entropy a step further mutual information is a measure of the amount of information that a data set from one random variable contains about another cover and thomas 2012 mutual information is the relative entropy between the joint distribution of two random variables x y and the product of those two distributions 3 i x y x x y y p x y ln p x y p x p y d p x y p x p y further mutual information can be defined in terms of conditional entropy adapted from cover and thomas 2012 4 1 i x y x y p x y ln p x y p x p y 4 2 x y p x y ln p x x y p x y ln p x y 4 3 h x h x y thus the reduction of the uncertainty about x due to the knowledge of y is the mutual information and vice versa as the measure is symmetric for further derivations and theorems deduced from this principle see cover and thomas 2012 horibe 1985 used the conditional entropies as defined above to develop an entropic correlation coefficient ρ x y 5 ρ x y 1 d x y where d x y h x y h x if h x h y and d x y h y x h y if h y h x where d x y is the correlation distance between x and y as noted by singh 1997 in the case of multiple variables this measure introduces a natural or informative topology singh 1997 details the use of entropy theory in hydrological systems with the principal idea that there exists an inherent tendency for natural processes to proceed toward a state of greater disorder by using entropic measures the analysis is not limited to assumptions of linearity or normality entropy theory has been applied to hydrologic problems in a variety of contexts singh 2016 2013a 2013b one major theme has been the use of the maximum entropy concept jaynes 1957 to simulate vertical profiles of hydrologic or hydraulic variables such as velocity and soil moisture al hamdan and cruise 2010 barbé et al 1991 chiu 1989 cui and singh 2013 mishra et al 2015 2013 singh 2010a singh and cui 2014 simple shannon entropy has also been used to examine the uncertainties associated with hydrologic processes such as vadose zone soil moisture dynamics mays et al 2002 pachepsky et al 2006 singh 2010b rainfall runoff generation singh 2016 2015 2011 singh et al 2012 singh 2013a 2013b and sediment transport chiu 1989 singh et al 2015 singh and cui 2014 another major direction in entropy applications has been in the design and evaluation of hydrometric networks to maximize the information content in the collected data husain 1989 1987 krstanovic and singh 1992a 1992b yang and burn 1994 and in the evaluation of model performance amorocho and espildora 1973 chapman 1986 pachepsky et al 2006 studies include strategies such as maximizing the joint entropy while minimizing the total correlation or redundancy alfonso et al 2013 2010a 2010b alfonso and price 2012 li et al 2012 and net entropy mishra and coulibaly 2010 more recently these strategies have been expanded to include ensemble methods alfonso et al 2014 and multivariate analysis keum and coulibaly 2017 however it is the work of brunsell and his associates brunsell and young 2010 2008 brunsell et al 2008 brunsell and anderson 2011 in the field of mutual information that has the most relevance to this study these authors have demonstrated how relative entropy and mutual information can be used to characterize scale effects of land surface responses to atmospheric forcing with particular attention to precipitation and et similarly stoy et al 2009 used information theory to evaluate distributional changes to remotely sensed vegetation indices ndvi lai at differing spatial resolutions in this study we use entropy as an information metric to quantify the information needed to characterize a variable or its frequency distribution a higher value of entropy indicates that more information is needed to characterize the variable or its distribution which means that the variable or its distribution has higher uncertainty in other words uncertainty is connected to information that is the more information we have about a variable the less uncertain it is it is in this sense that we are using uncertainty which is standard practice in the entropy literature it might be remarked that variance a more traditional statistical measure and entropy are not uniquely connected except in cases where the distribution is known or assumed ebrahimi et al 2010 zeng et al 2016 entropy is measured using a frequency distribution while variance is measured from actual data our interest in this work is to evaluate the information that precipitation and et provide to streamflow 2 2 evapotranspiration in hydrologic models with the exception of simple single event flood models all hydrologic and land surface models include an et algorithm it is necessary to keep mass balance if for no other reason over long time periods it is often assumed that soil storage balances out over the analysis period thus the mass balance will just be p et q where p precipitation et evapotranspiration and q runoff for shorter or intermediate time periods however soil storage will not balance out and the et role is not as clear cut since one can never know with certainty at what scale soil moisture storage will cancel out the modeler cannot know the importance of et in the model beforehand this can lead to some consternation about the level of detail that the selected et method should have in a particular situation the matter is further complicated by the fact that many et equations predict potential et the atmospheric demand for water which then must be modified to get the actual et a large number of et or pet methods have been developed over the years these range from simple temperature driven models e g hamon to more physically based but data intensive approaches such as penman monteith penman monteith pm requires a great deal of atmospheric and vegetation data as well as the estimation of surface and aerodynamic resistance coefficients that are difficult to obtain and may not be consistent over large spatial domains alves and santos pereira 2000 kelliher et al 1993 thus it would be very helpful if the modeler could know something in advance about the importance of et in the particular hydrologic problem at hand investigations of the et streamflow relationship have usually focused on streamflow recession analysis methods rams e g federer 1973 tschinkel 1963 weisman 1977 often focusing specifically on riparian et impacts e g bauer et al 2004 boronina et al 2005 nachabe et al 2005 rams are a widely used technique in the investigation of storage streamflow relationships at the catchment scale however they rely solely on individual parameterizations and are often too specific for basin scale analysis stoelzle et al 2012 these studies above do provide insights that can be useful going forward in that it appears that the daily fluctuations and magnitudes of et may have a significant effect on streamflow though it could be limited to the riparian extent and base flowperiods with respect to non observational studies relating et to streamflow the most common methods used for simulating streamflow are rainfall runoff models there are several studies published that concern the sensitivity of streamflow in rainfall runoff models to potential et estimates andersson 1992 andréassian et al 2004 kokkonen and jakeman 2001 oudin et al 2006 2004 parmele 1972 vazquez 2003 these studies generally follow one of three methodologies to introduce differentiation in the potential evaporation pe to analyze its effect on the streamflow models a different et method of calculation the introduction of random errors or the introduction of fixed biased errors the studies also vary in the testing schemes used to evaluate the impacts of data errors on model performance as well as the kind of models used and the number and type of watersheds studied the filtering effect of the rainfall runoff models seems to have led some modelers into believing that improved estimation of et was not important especially at small temporal scales and when compared to the sensitivity of the models to precipitation andréassian et al 2004 andréassian et al 2001 oudin et al 2005a 2005b suggests that temporally daily varying pe contributes no significant improvement in rainfall runoff models than that of using mean pe in general it seems that the rainfall runoff models tend to compensate for et estimation biases by adapting certain parameters with little loss to efficiency acting as a low pass filter of sorts oudin et al 2004 using their internal degrees of freedom andréassian et al 2004 vazquez 2003 however did report large differences in the mike she model using three different et estimates contradicting most of the previous and current literature 3 study area and data sets used the objective of this study was to apply information theory to uncover the relationship between et and streamflow for the southeastern united states the states of alabama georgia south carolina and north florida representative streamflow records were selected from the usgs hydro climatic data network hcdn lins and slack 1999 slack and landwehr 1992 the hcdn is composed of quality controlled stream gage records from all available sites in the united states the data are screened for all anthropogenic confounding factors that might affect the fidelity of the record slack and landwehr 1992 the hcdn is the official streamflow data base used by the usgs for all global change hydrologic analyses as such it formed the basis of the landmark lins and slack 1999 study of streamflow trends in the unites states and its subsequent updates groisman et al 2004 united states geological survey 2005 from the hcdn data base 57 records were selected for this study only those gages were selected that were in operation from 1980 through 2011 gages were also selected so as to afford a good spatial representation of the southeast region watershed size was another consideration and areas ranged from 134 4 km2 to 9885 4 km2 fig 1 showcases the boundaries of the basins used in the regional analysis table a1 provided in the appendix contains the usgs gauge number name location and contributing drainage area for each of the selected 57 basins likewise two nationally recognized and vetted sources of et data were selected for analysis and comparison a few previous authors have used limited eddy flux tower observations to analyze et dynamics over relatively short time periods brunsell et al 2008 brunsell and anderson 2011 ruddell and kumar 2009 however flux tower data often only operate for short periods of time and thus suffer from periods of inconsistent data they also do not offer wide spatial coverage only 10 sites are available in the southeastern us study area and all of these offer very inconsistent data records for this reason modeled et data were necessarily used in place of flux tower estimates the two models utilized in this study were the unified noah land surface model betts et al 1997 chen et al 1997 ek 2003 and the variable infiltration capacity vic model gao et al 2009 liang et al 1994 these are two widely used models both of which are incorporated into nasa s land information system kumar et al 2006 peters lidard et al 2007 the energy balance modules of both models have been extensively tested using observed soil moisture streamflow and flux towers and the models have been found to represent observations well albeit with errors and uncertainties especially at smaller spatial scales chen et al 2018 godfrey and stensrud 2010 livneh et al 2013 peters lidard et al 2000 srivastava et al 2017 tesemma et al 2015 among many others the noah lis estimation of et is derived from the short term

states at 3 km grid spacing lis kumar et al 2006 peters lidard et al 2007 is a terrestrial hydrology modeling framework that integrates satellite and ground based observational data products to produce land surface states and fluxes this configuration consists of a continuous integration of the noah land surface model the noah land surface model is a one dimensional soil plant atmosphere transfer model and is used in the operational national centers for environmental prediction ncep north american mesoscale model the lsm employs a two stream canopy radiation transfer approach including shading effects to achieve proper surface energy and water balances dickinson 1983 niu and yang 2004 latent energy is estimated via a modified penman approach xia et al 2016 the soil hydrology model consists of four layers 0 10 10 40 40 100 and 100 200 cm with moisture transfer by the 1 d richards equation richards equation accounts for both advection and diffusion in soil water processes the nasa sport center runs the noah model in a real time mode at a 3 km spatial resolution over the southern and central united states case et al 2014 2008 prior to real time operation a long term spin up mode is established forced with nldas climate data temperature precipitation solar radiation the noah simulations used in this analysis are derived from the long term model spin up mode the vic model gao et al 2009 liang et al 1994 is a gridded semi distributed macroscale hydrological model that represents vegetative heterogeneity includes multiple soil layers with variable infiltration capacity and derives non linear base flow vic considers three categories of et canopy evaporation vegetative evapotranspiration and bare soil evaporation the total et is calculated from the sum of these components weighted by the vegetative fraction of the land surface representation the basic formulation of each of these et components is penman based complex algorithms which are applied to estimate the aerodynamic and surface canopy resistances taking into account atmospheric stability temperature vapor pressure deficits photosynthetically active radiation fluxes par and soil moisture factors gao et al 2009 the vic model can be run to balance both the water and energy budgets unlike most land surface models in vic s iterative energy balance sequence the latent heat is resolved indirectly in this process the energy flux between the over and understory canopies is computed and used to compute the canopy air temperature which in turn is then used to compute the sensible heat loss between the canopy and the atmosphere the energy fluxes are compared and if the error exceeds a tolerance level then the new temperature is employed to re compute the sensible heat fluxes and the energy budget is resolved again until the estimates match cherkauer et al 2003 the long term dataset of livneh et al 2013 developed by the university of washington group was used for the precipitation data and also used to force the vic model in this study livneh et al 2013 expanded the hydrologically based dataset of maurer et al 2002 to 1915 and through 2011 and increased the resolution to a 1 16th degree using the same methodology as in maurer et al 2002 the livneh et al 2013 dataset includes station based interpolation of daily precipitation and temperature data and wind fields from the national centers for environmental prediction ncep national center for atmospheric research ncar reanalysis kalnay et al 1996 national climatic data center ncdc cooperative observer coop stations with 20 year records or more total of 20 000 stations were used the livneh et al dataset 2013 and the validated vic modeled output are publicly available free and accessible online https www esrl noaa gov psd data gridded data livneh html 4 methodology the streamflow data together with the two et data sets from previous section vic and noah provided consistent daily data for the period 1980 2011 over the entire study area the data were spatially averaged by grid cells over the basins in the study area for the aggregate analysis 8 day and 32 day means were computed by resampling the daily time series the first step in the analysis was to conduct preliminary evaluations of the data an initial harmonic analysis of the streamflow and et series was performed to characterize the raw absolute values of both et and q a simple time series approach was applied using sin and cos functions to estimate the periodic fluctuations of the data and to determine the variance explained by their annual cycles when cycles and autocorrelation were identified they were removed from the data sets by computing anomalies from the long term means the residuals from this exercise were then employed in the entropy analyses the entropy contained in each sample was first computed from eq 1 then the mutual information contained in each dataset was calculated using eq 4 1 since entropy requires that the data be derived from independent random samples the data with the annual cycles removed were utilized for those analyses a bootstrap process was employed wherein random samples of size 300 were selected to ensure consistency between all temporal scales without over sampling the complete populations particularly at the monthly time step research on the effects of sample size on entropy results are mixed pincus 1991 wisz et al 2008 zighed et al 2010 so it was decided to maintain a fixed sample size across all time steps for comparison as the magnitude of the entropy values is highly dependent on the number and width of the bins selected in this case evidence showed relatively long tailed distributions p and q and one more gaussian et in fact since we included samples with zero precipitation days the distribution of daily precipitation was essentially exponential in shape since a focus of this study was to compare entropies across all variables and since entropy is such a function of bin sizes the same number of bins were used for all variables it is important that the binning strategy capture the shape and moments of the probability distributions to account for the size and variability of the data we used the sturges sturges 1926 and freedman freedman and diaconis 1981 rules to calculate the localized bin size for for each sample in each basin it was found that 30 bins was most effective in capturing the distributions and was roughly the overall mean estimate from both rules used however it is important to note here that regardless of the number and width of bins selected the basic relationships and trends in the results reported below did not change only the magnitude of the results were affected 5 results and discussion 5 1 harmonic analysis fig 2 shows the results of the harmonic analysis averaged over all basins as expected the et data from the lis revealed a significant annual cycle even in the daily series with over 80 of the variance explained by the harmonic however the vic et data explained less of the variance especially at the daily scale with roughly half the influence of lis the annual cycles in the et data did not translate to particularly large cycles in the streamflow data with only about 15 of the variance explained in the daily observations and about 21 explained in the monthly series 5 2 entropy analysis entropy techniques have the potential to reveal important information about the nature of et streamflow relationships first the shannon entropy of each data set was computed for daily 8 day and 32 day aggregations the results for the 1 day entropies for each variable are summarized over all 57 basins in figs 3 and 4 below see table a2 in the appendix for a tabular summary of all entropy results for comparative purposes it is noted that the maximum entropy log n for this analysis based on a consistent bin size of 30 is 3 40 nats the figures show that et consistently has the highest entropy with vic the highest while the precipitation and streamflow uncertainties are similar in magnitude and exhibit much more variability than does either et data set comparing the two et datasets it is not surprising that the vic et data contains more uncertainty than does the lis et since more of the variance in et was taken up by the annual cycle in the lis data this phenomenon may be due both to the model differences and to the meteorological data used to force the models a comparison of the noah and vic models xia et al 2016 reveals that certain inputs e g vegetation indices are provided by look up tables in both models however other variables in the energy budget that are inputs to noah e g albedo are calculated within the vic model this fact along with the added complexity of the vic et algorithm may be responsible for at least part of the added uncertainty in the model results for example peters lidard et al 2000 have demonstrated how the use of look up tables in noah can significantly degrade the model results and how the model is highly sensitive to the meteorological inputs in that vein the livenh forcing data are primarily an interpretation of observed data as compared to the nldas reanalysis data taken together it may be that the vic model resolves more daily fluctuations in the latent heat than does the lis model as evidenced by the relatively small amount of variance accounted for by the annual cycle in vic compared to lis we can also see that the discharge and precipitation entropies exhibit considerable variation across watersheds while the two et data sets demonstrate far less spatial variability the very close relationship between the discharge and precipitation uncertainties highlights the expected relationship between the two variables however given that the entropies uncertainty in the et data sets are larger it seems natural to assume that some of the information in et is shared with streamflow above that imparted by the precipitation next we need to ask whether or not the variability shown across the watersheds in the h q p and et plots are significant the average variance of h q and h p between basins was 0 0781 and 0 0942 nats respectively assuming that the data all came from the same population a problematic assumption with known variances and sufficiently large sample sizes the results of a two sample t test indicate that a difference in mean entropy values of 0 02 nat would be significant p value 0 01 in both data sets fig 4 shows that the spread between basins in both h q and h p is indeed greater than 0 02 nat sd dev 0 28 and 0 30 respectively likewise the inter basin spread of the h vic was also significant at the 0 01 when looking at the inter sample variabilities the average of h p and h q 0 121 and 0 103 nats respectively compared to average values of 0 0174 and 0 00363 nats for the h lis and h vic respectively just from a qualitative standpoint then one can see that the inter sample variabilities are much less than are the inter basin variabilities for the h p and h q series while the two measures are much smaller for the et data this again would lead to the conclusion that the inter basin variability displayed in fig 4 for h q and h p is more significant than is true for the et data the spatial variability of the daily entropies is shown in fig 5 where the entropy is plotted against the basin drainage areas the similarity between the spatial relationships of the discharge and precipitation entropies is striking and both have non linear power trends that are significant at the 0 05 level a positive significant trend also appears to be present in the h vic in contrast to the h lis case though visibly less than that of the h q and h p the slight difference in the trends of the discharge and precipitation data appears to be due to the lesser entropies in precipitation at the small basin scale which does not appear to translate to the discharge where larger entropies are observed these differences are significant according to the t test results given above it can also be observed that the difference between h q and the et entropies are higher at the smaller basin scale than for the larger basins especially as compared to h p so it is possible that more uncertainty is shared with the discharge above that imposed by p by the et process at the smaller spatial scales and that this shared uncertainty decreases with basin size although it may still be significant fig 5 shows that uncertainty in precipitation discharge and to an extent vic et all increase with drainage area size it is obvious that uncertainty in precipitation at the larger spatial scales exerts a dominant influence on the resulting uncertainty in streamflow however other factors such as basin characteristics are undoubtedly at work it can also be observed that the entropies approach an asymptote less than log n indicating that at least for this data set there is a limit to hydrologic uncertainty with spatial scale this also implies that there is more information to be gained by further observations for the larger basins although these results are for a specific precipitation product maurer the similarity in relationships to the observed discharge gives confidence in the conclusions discussed above the relative lack of spatial variability in the et entropies as compared to h q and h p may be due also to the climate or atmospheric conditions in the southeastern us where the high relative humidity lower vapor pressure deficit and cloud cover decreased radiation across the region in summertime limits the pet and thus depresses the variability of actual et to further untangle this question a simple budyko 1971 analysis was conducted and it was found that the majority of the basins were in a water limited situation pet p 1 those that were energy limited tended to be smaller and comprise a significant majority of forest as compared to other land classes further the relative influence of the aridity index pet p on entropy was examined it was found that though the correlation between the two variables was weak r2 1 the slope of the regression was significant indicating that as the watershed becomes more water limited as opposed to energy limited it is more likely to exhibit a relatively higher uncertainty of et this can perhaps be explained by the fact that the water limitation is a result of a landscape as opposed to the climate dependent on homogeneous surface and sub surface characteristics and thus may introduce added uncertainty this is evident in both et datasets even though the raw entropy is different between the two figs 3 5 effectively illustrate the entropy of p and et as compared to streamflow uncertainty at the daily temporal scale to this point it appears that the daily uncertainties in vic et are higher than those of lis et precipitation and streamflow but et uncertainty in both data sets is less variable among the basins examined and that the relationship between et and discharge uncertainties at the daily time scale is ambiguous at best we can start to untangle these issues by looking at the mutual information mi between variables as summarized in fig 6 below the first point that stands out in fig 6 is that the mutual information between daily precipitation and discharge data is noticeably less than that between the other variables however the variability across basins appears to be about the same in all cases of course since there was less entropy in the discharge and precipitation data to begin with this would naturally lead to less mi between the two as compared to the et data the mi is higher in the et cases especially so in the case of vic although the variability is about the same as in the mutual information of p and q i p q this would seem to indicate that there is more information to be gained about discharge from further observation of et particularly vic but that there is variability across basins because the entropy of et is higher it has more potential to share information with q further it implies that vic et has the highest possibility of reducing streamflow uncertainty through further refinement of the et algorithm and meteorological inputs the mutual information between discharge and the et data sets is further illustrated where the mis are plotted against the discharge entropy for each watershed in the study in fig 7 as shown all the mis between the datasets follow the entropy of q p pattern however consistently i q vic and i p vic contain more mutual information not surprisingly the mi data generally follow the same pattern as the raw entropy data given in fig 3 and it should be noted that in general the bounds for mi are the lower entropy value from the two datasets which in this case is consistently p and q thus effectively presenting the upper bounds in fig 7 i p q and i p vic lis are plotted against the drainage areas in fig 8 a and b showing the influence the scale effect of q p entropy on the mi the relationships can be further clarified through the entropic correlations given in eq 5 and shown in fig 8c and d right side fig 8 demonstrates that the q p relationship nearly always contains the smallest amount of information of any of the other data sets particularly for the smaller drainage basins 1500 km2 q p entropic correlations are often 0 1 for these basins in these cases both et data sets consistently demonstrate higher information content with the q vic correlations between 0 2 and 0 25 the mi values for the q p relationship are often as much as 0 4 nat below that of the vic et data which according to the two sample t test given earlier is certainly significant at the 0 01 level the shared information between the entropy of the et variables and discharge as demonstrated by the correlations in fig 8 seems to indicate that up to one quarter of the uncertainty in daily streamflow could be explained by the uncertainties in daily et on the other hand there appears to be a clear scale effect in the correlation between precipitation and streamflow as shown in figs 8 and 9 mimicking the trends of the marginal entropy seen in fig 5 a picture begins to emerge that while more information about daily discharge itself can be gained by further observation at larger spatial scales fig 8 shows that mutual information between et and q is consistently larger across all scales it seems clear that the explanation of the greater uncertainty in streamflow at larger scales is more confounded between precipitation and et and perhaps basin characteristics however either way it is clear that the key to hydrologic modeling is to keep mass balance in the soil at scales commensurate with the response time of the basin it is interesting that the mi between q and et shows a more significant scale effect than did the et entropy itself this is due to the fact that mi is limited by the smallest entropy q in this case and thus the scale effect in the q entropy was imposed on the mi however as indicated on fig 8 the data shows significant power relationships indicating that the increase in mutual information as a function of basin size is larger in the small scale range da 1500 km2 than for larger basins the strong relationship at smaller scales may be related to the response time of the basins for watersheds whose response time is greater than 1 day the information gain added at the daily time step is less effective compared to the information already gained from precipitation however it appears that observation of et at these shorter time scales can add significant information about discharge above that imparted by precipitation alone comparisons of the behavior of the two et data sets also leads to some interesting insights into the relationships between q and et uncertainty at the daily time scale in the lis et data a large portion of the overall variance was accounted for by the annual cycle as compared to the vic data thus less uncertainty was left in the lis data and this entropy was not as related to the streamflow uncertainty as was the vic data which contained more uncertainty to begin with the lis noah et algorithm has more variables fixed by the user and employs a climate reanalysis data set in contrast to the vic model which computes most variables and uses interpolated observed climate data as well as resolving the daily energy budget in an iterative process thus vic appears to mimic the daily fluctuations of et above the annual cycle better than does the noah model this added uncertainty in vic is then better related to the uncertainty in the streamflow thus more potential exists to reduce streamflow uncertainty through further observation of et from the vic model than exists in the noah model however as shown in fig 9 even the noah model still contains significant ability to improve the streamflow uncertainty especially at the smaller spatial scales this may be a significant observation in that even when an et model is highly parameterized in such a way that the annual cycle dominates the response there can still be enough information available beyond the cycle to significantly affect streamflow uncertainty at smaller spatial scales in fact figs 9 and 10 captures the conundrum facing hydrologic modelers is it better to parameterize the et model to just capture the major variation in annual et i e annual cycle or to employ a more complex model that captures additional noise in the daily et process of course even at smaller basins the relationship between q and et is convoluted by the similar relationship between uncertainties of precipitation and et this intertwining of factors is illustrated in the similarity of the mi of the et q relationships and the p et relationships these relationships highlight the fact that precipitation is supplying the input for the soil moisture that regulates the et as well as the discharge however the i p q relationship in fig 8 indicates that little information about discharge can be gained for the smaller basins by observation of p alone thus quality et data are valuable at this scale it is not surprising that the i q et mimics the basic i q p since the original q entropy demonstrates this trend again the asymptotic nature of this relationship indicates the limiting nature of the uncertainty in daily discharge with drainage area and consequently the difficulty in extracting this uncertainty through observation of daily et especially for larger basins these results somewhat coincide with the findings of previous model based studies i e andréassian 2004 andréassian et al 2004 oudin et al 2004 2005a 2005b noting that improved et here inferred as reduced uncertainty may not increase the model performance however this analysis found that particular at smaller spatial scales in which some of the studies referenced included et indeed does have a significant amount of information to be imparted in addition to precipitation the previous studies seem to suggest the model parameterization as the culprit while here in a semi observational analysis the results show a distinct difference in the amount of unique information et can contribute to the reduction of the uncertainty at smaller basins as compared to larger ones the present results may be best interpreted in light of the conclusions from the entropy studies cited previously those studies generally concluded that information can be lost as data are scaled up or aggregated based on remote sensing estimates brunsell et al 2008 brunsell and anderson 2011 that information tends to flow from variables with high entropy to those with low entropy ruddell and kumar 2009 but that relatively low resolution data 2 km may be sufficient to capture et processes at least in grassland areas brunsell et al 2008 it was also concluded that scaling of et using remotely sensed instruments is relatively spatially invariant for a given instrument but may vary between sensors brunsell and anderson 2011 in our case although the et data are derived from land surface models those models rely on remotely sensed inputs that are undoubtedly affecting their uncertainties so the above conclusions are certainly relevant to our analysis for example the scaling up of the 4 km native model outputs to the basin scale would tend to result in a loss of information in the et data that would not be present in the observed streamflow data however the ruddell and kumar 2009 observation of information flow is consistent with our results that et entropy is higher especially vic and thus information would flow from the et to the streamflow 5 3 aggregates analysis it is also of interest to examine these relationships at larger time intervals such as those handled by larger scale models global continental and those primarily concerned with drought and water availability to that end the 8 and 32 day entropy and mutual information values of each variable were calculated across each watershed and are summarized in figs 9 and 10 the first thing that stands out in fig 9 is the degree to which the discharge and precipitation uncertainties have increased by aggregating to a larger time period the spread of the 8 day and 32 day entropies is also less than that of the daily data as it is evident that aggregating the data reduces the spatial variability of the discharge and precipitation uncertainties to a degree the inter sample variances are also greatly decreased by the aggregation with the 8 day values less than half that of the daily and the 32 day variances reduced by more than 50 again the increase in entropies along with the great reduction in variability both spatially and temporally leads to the conclusion that the aggregation tends to not only smooth the distributions but also to make them more uniform thus leading to greater entropy values however it is notable that the et data did not show this effect with only a slight increase in the 32 day entropy in the lis case and a notable decline in uncertainty with aggregation in the vic data the increase in discharge and precipitation entropy is contrary to the conclusion of brunsell and anderson 2011 and brunsell et al 2008 that temporal aggregation of data tends to reduce information content in the data we can further explore the relationships between aggregate et and streamflow through the mutual information shown in fig 10 the data show that mi increases each time the data are aggregated in all cases these results seem to imply that aggregating or smoothing the data series can actually increase the uncertainty in q and p but that the ability of the precipitation as well as the lis and vic et data to explain the streamflow variability is increased as well the mi is plotted against drainage area for the 8 day and 32 day aggregates in fig 11 the figure shows that the mi relationship with drainage area for the 8 day aggregates appears very similar to the daily pattern there is still significant information to be gained by further observation of et it is greater in the case of vic et and it is most prominent at the smaller spatial scales however interestingly the pattern is obscured somewhat in the case of the 32 day aggregates it s obvious that there is a greater increase in shared information between q and p at the 8 day and 32 day time scales compared to the increases in the et data so that p approaches the importantance of et at the greater time scales although there is still information to be gained from et in these cases it is not as great as in the daily case nor is it as scale related 6 conclusions this study focused on the relationship between evapotranspiration and streamflow in the southeastern united states at various time and space scales entropic analyses were employed to help characterize their uncertainties and quantify their informational relationships observed streamflow observational based precipitation and modeled et data were used the uncertainty or entropy in streamflow precipitation and vic et displayed significant spatial variability over the study area although the spatial variability was reduced at greater temporal scales lis et on the other hand displayed less entropy than did the vic et and did not exhibit significant spatial variability both et data sets consistently displayed significantly higher entropy compared to discharge and precipitation using a budyko type analysis it was found that the majority of watersheds were in a water limited situation possibly contributing to the higher et entropy the uncertainty in the daily precipitation and discharge data in particular exhibited the largest spatial variability over the region and demonstrated very similar relationships with drainage area in both cases entropy appeared to approach a limiting value with drainage area indicating that there is an upper limit in uncertainty in precipitation and runoff with basin size the relationships also imply that there is more information to be gained from observations of daily q and p on larger basins than smaller ones and that most of the uncertainty in streamflow is imparted by the uncertainty in precipitation however analysis of the shared information between variables mutual information led to a different set of insights the relationship between daily precipitation and streamflow was weaker and more variable than that between et and streamflow thus it is clear that there is value to observations of daily et above and beyond what can be imparted through precipitation alone this is probably due to the fact that et is a continuous process related to streamflow while precipitation is more sporadic there is also a clear relationship between drainage area and mi at the daily time step with more information about streamflow to be gained from observation of et on the larger basins the amount of information to be gained on the order of 0 1 0 4 nats is significant when compared to the variability of entropy as a whole interestingly at longer weekly monthly time steps the uncertainty in the precipitation and discharge data sets increased while the spatial variability was reduced with aggregation although the uncertainty in lis et also increased slightly at the greater time scales the vic et entropy showed a notable decrease however mutual information increased significantly at each time step for all variables thus indicating stronger relationships between discharge and both precipitation and et at longer time intervals additionally the scale dependence of the mutual information between discharge and the other variables was decreased with increased temporal periods the two et data sets employed in this analysis showed distinct differences in uncertainty and relationship with discharge the noah lsm lis et contained a much stronger annual cycle than did the et derived from the vic lsm thus more uncertainty was available in the vic et residuals and this fact was reflected in higher entropies in vic et across all time and space scales this uncertainty especially in the daily data may result from a more detailed resolution of the energy budget in the vic model and less parameterization of variables than is done in the noah lsm the greater available information in the vic et translated to greater shared information with streamflow compared to both lis et and precipitation and was particularly evident at smaller spatial scales thus the study reveals that et particularly if derived from a less parameterized application of the penman monteith equation to estimate latent energy can contribute significant information to streamflow modeling at the daily time step however at longer time steps the influence of precipitation becomes more dominant and thus the contribution of et while still evident becomes less significant finally it should be noted that these results are for a specific climatic and physiographic location in the united states it should also be restated that the et data used in this analysis was from two different models in place of actual flux estimates this was necessary to enable the long term spatial analysis described here however the different characteristics of the two et data sets served to further amplify the relationship between et uncertainty and resultant shared information with streamflow results may differ for other areas however this study has demonstrated that entropy analysis has strong potential for identifying key factors in the relationships between discharge precipitation and evapotranspiration acknowledgments this

6889,water diplomacy may be understood broadly as the measures that may be taken to prevent or peacefully resolve conflicts over water resources concerning their availability allocation or use between and within states the concept is preventive in nature as well as offering an approach for conflict resolution instruments of international water law among them notably conventions and soft law developed on that basis which promote equitable and reasonable use of transboundary waters and prevention of transboundary impact can serve as tools for water diplomacy the obligation to establish agreements on shared waters and joint bodies to govern them has contributed to gathering important experience and some of this has been synthesized into the principles for effective joint bodies which were adopted by the meeting of the parties to the unece water convention in 2015 the principles are intended as a resource to increase the effectiveness of joint bodies in transboundary water cooperation this paper analyses finland s cooperation arrangements in the light of the principles and assesses the extent to which finland s transboundary water commissions reflect the good practices specified in the principles taking a wider perspective the paper also examines the elements of the principles and their practical realisation with a view to understanding better their promotion of water diplomacy relevant features include inter alia the competency and representation of the joint institution its accountability and the extent to which public participation is permitted and the cooperative mechanisms in place naturally the underlying transboundary water agreements specify the framework for cooperation between the riparian states to a great extent but the established joint bodies often play a significant role specifically in the equitable use and management of the shared water resources but even beyond in the prevention and settling of conflicts and in the general promotion of cooperation and security at a regional level keywords unece principles joint bodies transboundary waters water agreements water diplomacy 1 introduction 1 1 water diplomacy and institutional frameworks definitions of water diplomacy vary but good water governance as well as agreements and institutions invariably play a key role e g molnar et al 2017 can be referred to for a discussion about the definitions given the inherent complexity of water problems and water networks institutionalised cooperation on the part of riparian states supported by the participation of all water users is indispensable for the effective joint management of water resources and for the prevention and management of conflicts see e g schmeier 2013 priscoli and wolf 2009 in transboundary basins joint bodies such as river basin commissions or bilateral commissions can have a role in water diplomacy in various areas including through serving as a venue hub to support decision making the sharing of information monitoring compliance notification and consultation dispute resolution and basin planning schmeier and shubber 2018 this special issue while existence of joint bodies overall stabilises cooperation schmeier 2013 they do not in all cases provide for an equitable cooperation zeitoun and mirumachi 2008 describe different nuances of transboundary water interaction essentially with a combined reading of conflict and cooperation the relationship of states may in particular be affected by a presence of strong power asymmetries evident in structural inequalities lack of control over decisions or an inequitable allocation of the resource or its benefits zeitoun and warner 2006 identification and communication of the benefits of transboundary water cooperation are key drivers of the political decisions on cooperation these benefits need to be understood as going beyond economic benefits to include benefits relating to peace and stability sadoff and grey 2002 unece 2015a these should be stressed as they are often crucial elements in the creation of value in water cooperation at a regional level equally it needs to be recognised that not all water cooperation is inherently good power dynamics between the countries sometimes influence the cooperative frameworks and their implementation to the extent that the term hydro hegemony 1 denoting strong power asymmetries between the countries evident in structural inequalities lack of control over decisions and an inequitable allocation of the resource or its benefits zeitoun and warner 2006 1 finds application see e g zeitoun and warner 2006 warner et al 2017 water diplomacy is often viewed as a tool to be deployed when conflicts over water use or the development of a basin surface potentially impacting the relations of the countries concerned beyond water management at the same time water diplomacy could perhaps to a greater degree take inspiration and seek solutions from established practices and frameworks where functional cooperation has been established and major differences avoided over the management of shared waters this should be hold with the understanding that cooperation practices have developed in particular local contexts the key features of cooperation arrangements that have brought about sustained cooperation dialogue and the resolution of various issues and which have also been adapted to deal with emerging challenges merit attention 1 2 the water convention and the role of joint bodies already early general codification referred to and or highlighted the importance of specific agreements and joint institutions for transboundary water cooperation concerning non navigational uses of international rivers and lakes the helsinki rules on the uses of the waters of international rivers issued by the international law commission ila in 1966 marked the first general codification of the law of international watercourses salman 2007 these rules were later revised by the ila and issued as the berlin rules on water resources in 2004 2 the berlin rules include art 64 on establishing basin wide or other joint management arrangements and art 65 on minimal requirements for joint management arrangements 2 the convention on the law of the non navigational uses of international watercourses was adopted in 1997 following a negotiation by the un member states in the framework of the un general assembly on the basis of a text developed by the international law commission un watercourses convention the un watercourses convention which entered into force in 2014 recommends parties entering into or harmonising existing watercourse agreements and joint arrangements the convention on the protection and use of transboundary watercourses and international lakes hereinafter the water convention negotiated through an intergovernmental process under the auspices of the united nations economic commission for europe unece signed in helsinki in 1992 and entered into force in 1996 it is a framework convention promoting transboundary cooperation in the management of shared water resources including both surface waters and groundwaters for more than 20 years the water convention has influenced and provided a basis for the development of specific agreements on transboundary waters in fact article 9 of the water convention obliges the parties to conclude and or revise bilateral or multilateral agreements and to establish joint bodies institutions for transboundary cooperation it has been recognised that permanent cooperation through such mechanisms allows for early identification of potential sources of disagreement and offers a means to prevent their escalation unece 2013 thus enhancing peace and security in essence joint bodies have the positive capacity to lock parties into cooperation thereby promoting shared understanding and responsibility and preventing conflicts the water convention defines a joint body as any bilateral or multilateral commission or other appropriate institutional arrangements for cooperation between the riparian parties the existing commissions and other joint bodies for transboundary water cooperation differ from one another in terms of for example scope of work competence functions powers and organisational structure in general the institutional arrangements are in the form of multilateral river basin commissions essentially on the main transboundary rivers as well as various bilateral arrangements involving responsibility for all or specific transboundary watercourses or basins shared by two countries article 9 of the water convention specifies the basic tasks to be entrusted to the joint bodies to perform including the collection and exchange of information the elaboration of joint monitoring programmes and proposing measures and evaluating their effectiveness due to the obligations under the water convention for riparian parties to establish joint bodies for transboundary cooperation specifying basic tasks for them and the more than 20 years of practical experience that has accumulated about and by joint bodies this paper focuses on the latest related soft law guidance that has been developed and adopted in the framework of the water convention preceded by an intergovernmental review process as far as the authors are aware the principles represent the only guidance developed in an intergovernmental framework of this scale and coverage 1 3 the principles for effective joint bodies emerging international recognition of the importance of institutional arrangements for transboundary water cooperation the sustainable development goals adopted by the united nations general assembly in 2015 unga res 70 1 include goal 6 on water and sanitation which defines with various targets the global community s ambition in this area until 2030 among its targets is the improvement of integrated water resources management iwrm including transboundary cooperation as appropriate target 6 5 the indicator for monitoring progress globally is the proportion of transboundary basin area with an operational arrangement for water cooperation inter agency expert group on sustainable indicators 2016 the inclusion of an explicit mention of transboundary cooperation in water management in the 2030 agenda demonstrates the political recognition of the importance of the issue furthermore the indicator 6 5 2 underlines the key role of specific agreements or other arrangements concluded between co riparian countries as a fundamental precondition to ensure long term sustainable cooperation in freshwater management the indicator 6 5 2 which is also part of reporting progress to the high level political forum on sustainable development and for which unece and unesco are co custodian agencies also highlights that joint bodies that meet and exchange information regularly are a crucial element in making such cooperation operational un water 2016 unece 2017 despite the diversity of arrangements and different histories and contexts of establishment joint bodies and the development of international law on the management of transboundary water resources allow for the identification of certain principles of organisation and activities that generally increase the efficiency of the joint bodies and contribute to reaching a mature level of cooperation between the riparian states unece 2015a a set of such principles was developed under the water convention in 2014 drawing upon earlier work under the convention see e g unece 2009 as well as upon a review of case studies and experience from joint bodies and country representatives resulting from workshops on that topic the principles for effective joint bodies went through an intergovernmental review within the framework of the working group on integrated water resources management which discussed the principles in its ninth and tenth meeting in 2014 and 2015 see unece 2015b respectively and were adopted by the seventh session of the meeting of the parties to the water convention in november 2015 the principles are a legally non binding soft law document nevertheless they represent an important and potentially influential instrument that synthesises valuable lessons from the collective experience of the joint bodies parties to the water convention and other states as well as other stakeholders unece 2018 1 4 about the paper the scope of the principles of effective joint bodies covers the following 1 the establishment structure and functions of joint bodies 2 their operation and 3 financial and human resources the principles can be considered as a kind of checklist of features linked to more sustained mature cooperation among riparian states this paper focuses on features related to the first category factors such as competency and representation organisational structure procedural mechanisms accountability cooperation and public participation are fixed to a marked degree and less prone to dynamic change and are consequently easier to verify at the same time these factors provide the necessary framework for the functioning of a joint body they set the framework for the governance work of a joint body within a basin and include basic elements that can be adopted by different bodies in different locations and circumstances analysis of these factors is of direct relevance to the global discussion on the role and capacity of joint bodies in reconciling different interests and finding solutions among riparian states and possibly supporting developing cooperation beyond water or reinforcing good neighbourly relations this paper assesses how finland s cooperation arrangements with norway russia and sweden stand in relation to the salient features highlighted by the unece principles and how the principles both generally and in the specific contexts examined in the paper can support water diplomacy and even water security in the co management of shared freshwater resources however it is to be noted that on one hand not all aspects of finland s transboundary water cooperation are included under the unece principles and on the other hand not all unece principles are relevant or have been applied in the finnish context an example of the former is communication and reconciliation in permit matters under the finnish swedish agreement and ensuring the consideration of groundwater issues serves as an example of the latter case having been established decades ago the legal and institutional bases of these cooperation arrangements have reasonably long time spans and they have been robust in the face of change this suggests that situations where cooperation has prevented or effectively addressed potential conflicts may offer valuable lessons for water diplomacy implementation of the water convention has been shaping finland s cooperation and as an active party finland has contributed experience into this framework for water cooperation this paper is structured as follows following the introductory section part two reviews the way in which the principles for effective joint bodies are reflected in finland s transboundary water cooperation arrangement focusing on aspects related to the establishment structure and functions of the joint bodies part three analyses the findings of the preceding part and examines how they relate to the enhancement of water diplomacy at the specific regional level part four offers a conclusion that draws together the paper s main findings 2 how the principles inform finland s cooperation arrangements for transboundary waters 2 1 introduction finland is located in northern europe between scandinavia and russia the northern part of the country lapland is bordered by sweden in the west norway in the north and russia in the east in fact finland shares the whole of its eastern border with russia the length of each border that crosses water is 617 km for the border with sweden 715 km for the border with norway and 370 km for the border with russia finland s environmental administration 2016 finland s borders with sweden and norway are partly constituted by rivers to manage these large areas of shared freshwater finland has signed bilateral transboundary waters agreements with its neighbour countries under which the established joint bodies promote coordination and cooperation in the management of the shared water resources the cooperation takes into account the special characteristics of each transboundary watercourse area finland shares the river muonionjoki and part of the river torne tornionjoki with sweden the current agreement concerning transboundary rivers between the countries has been in force since 2010 its predecessor was signed in 1971 the institution that manages the transboundary river cooperation is the finnish swedish transboundary river commission which was established by the agreement overall cooperation on transboundary waters between finland and sweden has been conducted in a good spirit thanks to the long traditions of cross border interaction in the area and to the fact that the environmental legislations of the two countries are largely harmonised the largest river basins that finland shares with norway are the catchment areas of the teno tana näätämö neiden and paatsjoki pasvik rivers all located in lapland finland and norway concluded an agreement on the frontier water commission in 1980 for the purpose of formally fulfilling the requirements laid down in directive 2000 60 ec of the european parliament and of the council hereinafter the water framework directive or wfd 3 even though norway is not a member of the european union but of the european economic area eea it implements the water framework directive with a delayed schedule 3 finland and norway concluded an agreement on the finnish norwegian river basin district in 2014 overall the transboundary water agreements and other cooperative arrangements between finland and norway have enhanced cooperation between the norwegian and finnish border municipalities and have improved water quality in the border rivers luokkanen and räinä 2007 finland and the russian federation share a land border of approximately 1300 km the border region contains 20 watersheds and 800 water bodies but none of the major rivers runs along the finnish russian borderline the largest transboundary watercourses are those of the vuoksi and paatsjoki pasvik rivers kaatra 2012 the agreement concerning frontier watercourses was signed by finland and the soviet union in 1964 and entered into force a year later it was adopted by the russian federation after the dissolution of the soviet union in early 1990s the agreement established the joint finnish russian commission on the utilisation of frontier waters generally cooperation between finland and russia can be regarded as one of the success stories of international water law see e g belinskij 2015 even though the institutionalisation of the transboundary cooperation between finland and its neighbours predates the water convention it has been shaped by the implementation of the convention obligations the fact that it was not considered necessary to adapt the bilateral frontier river agreements due to the implementation of the convention when finland was involved in the process of ratifying it unece 2013 stands as evidence about consistency with the convention s principles and provisions in addition to finland and its co riparian countries being parties to the water convention the four countries have also adopted other international legal instruments e g the 1991 espoo convention on environmental impact assessment in a transboundary context thus further demonstrating commitment to principles of transboundary cooperation furthermore ratification of the 1998 aarhus convention on access to information public participation in decision making and access to justice in environmental matters russia not a party adds a certain consistency to the legal basis in terms of principles and obligations in addition the eu wfd has naturally shaped finland s arrangements for transboundary water management see later this paper 2 2 competency principle 1 2 clear definition of the waters subject to cooperation in accordance with the basin approach and participation of all basin countries in a joint body all three transboundary freshwater agreements to which finland is a party provide for a clear definition of the waters subject to cooperation and have adopted a basin approach the riparians are equal participants in the joint bodies principle 1 1 broad competence of a joint body which allows for addressing in a complex way on the basis of iwrm the entire spectrum of issues related to the sustainable development management use including infrastructure and protection of transboundary waters different sectoral interests in water use and the development of a basin may cause friction in relation to transboundary basins the broad competence of a joint body can be of assistance in reconciling diverging interests of parties and stakeholders the competence of the finnish swedish commission similarly to the scope of the underlying agreement covers both water and fishing issues the relevant water issues include equitable use joint coordinated management instruments programmes and plans and environmental objectives prevention of flood damage monitoring of flow conditions and the management of transboundary impacts the fishing regulations contained in the agreement are mainly addressed to national authorities the competence of the finnish norwegian commission covers matters related to transboundary waters article 1 more specifically these matters pertain to the management of the transboundary waters monitoring the condition and quality of the waters fishing conditions the prevention of pollution of the waters construction work in the watercourse and the general regulation of the waters the finnish russian agreement is concerned with a great number and variety of issues water flow and structural measures flood control and water scarcity timber floating and water traffic fisheries and fish migration pollution and water quality and public health and economy indeed cooperation under the agreement has arguably adopted a multi objective approach kaatra 2012 the competence of the joint finnish russian commission follows the lines of the underlying agreement articles 6 and 8 as its name suggests the commission s work has focused on the utilisation of waters however in recent years the commission has increasingly engaged with environmental protection issues overall the competencies of all three transboundary water commissions are relatively broad as recommended by the unece principles sustainable and equitable use and management of the transboundary waters is perceived as important in all three regions and the commissions have actively enabled and promoted a wide range of different uses in respect of the waters principle 1 3 clearly defined tasks and powers for the joint body which are sufficient for effective activities related to the management development use and protection of transboundary waters principle 1 6 certain flexibility of the agreement establishing the joint body allowing to progressively develop cooperation in terms of scope mandate and riparian states involved principle 1 10 a mandate to identify and assess accurately the potential benefits of transboundary water cooperation taking into account the economic social environmental and geopolitical aspects the powers and tasks of the finnish swedish commission are clearly defined in the underlying agreement articles 10 and 11 on the functions and competence of the commission the commission may give statements appeal certain decisions and bring claims to rectify violations in certain cases it also has tasks related to monitoring developing and promoting cooperation and to developing programmes and plans concerning the water management area the finnish norwegian transboundary water commission has first and foremost an advisory role its main tasks include submitting proposals and motions and issuing statements on matters related to the management of the transboundary waters in addition the commission monitors the status and quality of the transboundary waters and prevents their deterioration article 1 the tasks and powers of the joint finnish russian commission have been formulated very clearly the commission examines on the instruction of the parties or on its own initiative matters relating to the utilisation of frontier watercourses as included in the frontier watercourses agreement such matters may be resolved by making a decision or issuing an opinion in addition the commission oversees in general that the agreement is complied with and monitors the state of the transboundary waters article 8 the commission has certain regulatory powers related to timber floating in the frontier watercourses article 13 regarding principle 1 6 on a certain flexibility of the agreement establishing the joint body finland s transboundary water agreements remain at a relatively modest level on the other hand the agreements were broad in their sectoral scope to begin with the principle is perhaps more relevant for states that have agreements with a more limited scope e g on a specific water use which flexibility could help broaden or states sharing basins where major new development such as construction of dams or major expansion of irrigation systems is expected to take place flexibility that provides for adjustment to changes in conditions in the long term is valuable especially due to climate change see e g honkonen 2017 as agreements on transboundary waters commonly remain in force and provide the basis for cooperation for a long time robustness is also a valuable quality to balance flexibility the agreement with sweden gives the joint commission the power to draw the parties attention to any need to amend the agreement article 10 furthermore the parties convene as necessary to ensure the application of the agreement article 31 the agreement with norway entitles the joint commission to put forward proposals and submit initiatives regarding the amendment of the agreement on the commission or of other agreements between the parties article 9 the agreement with russia does not include specific flexibility clauses however the fact that the finnish russian commission was made responsible for overseeing the implementation of the discharge rule for lake saimaa and the vuoksi river which was negotiated within the commission and concluded in 1989 demonstrates that it has a certain flexibility as a cooperation framework none of the transboundary water commissions to which finland is a party is expected to involve additional riparian states there are in practice none that need be involved in the case of the finnish swedish commission the finnish norwegian commission has had representatives from russia participating as observers of its work for a long time and the finnish russian commission is concerned merely with finland and russia with the possibility to invite the chairpersons of the finnish norwegian commission as observers to the meetings k kinnunen personal communication 13 october 2016 the mandates of the three joint bodies examined here do not specifically empower the bodies to assess the potential benefits of the cooperation nevertheless the commissions regularly report on their activities to the state parties and thereby also assess the realised and potential benefits of the cooperation the benefits and significance of the cooperation involving the commissions have not been put under question by any party capacity to address emerging issues to prevent those from causing friction is potentially valuable from a hydro diplomatic perspective 2 3 representation and organisational structure principle 1 5 a sufficiently broad and complete representation of national authorities in the joint body implying participation beyond the water management authorities to include representatives from environment fishery agriculture transport health energy hydrometeorology authorities economy and finance ministries as appropriate principle 1 7 availability of technical informational scientific and other support to joint body s activities through appropriate design of organisational structure representation within a joint body affects its expertise legitimacy and its ability to resolve disagreements of the three members from each country in the finnish swedish transboundary river commission one has to be from the government authority responsible for water issues and one from the municipality in the area of application of the agreement countries are free to choose the third member the members should as a minimum have expertise in water management and the local conditions the commission uses experts to assist it in its work and each party may appoint up to three permanent experts the commission may also use other experts currently the commission has two permanent expert members appointed by each party who are professionals specialising in water policy within the finnish norwegian frontier water commission there are three members from each country representing environmental administration and municipalities of the members one has to have experience in water management while another has to be particularly familiar with the circumstances of the border area article 40 the members are to have expertise in water management and local conditions the commission may hear experts during its meetings and assign to them responsibility for the preparation of studies and reports article 5 in both nordic commissions the third members are freely chosen by the parties to represent other interests that are considered important in the finnish swedish commission the current third members are local entrepreneurs while in the finnish norwegian commission the third members are from municipalities one representing the indigenous sami people overall this kind of discretion in the membership of the commissions is a significant element of flexibility also in the sense that the interests represented within the commissions may change due to changes in the membership the joint finnish russian commission comprises three members from each contracting state and three alternates article 6 the agreement remains silent as to the expertise that is required of the commission members which may be regarded as a sign of operational flexibility national authorities that currently participate in the activities of the commission include on the finnish side the ministry of agriculture and forestry the ministry for foreign affairs the centre for economic development transport and the environment of south eastern finland and the finnish environment institute on the russian side the main participating authorities are different units of regional water administration and other regional authorities representatives from the federal ministries of foreign affairs and energy participate occasionally as observers the finnish russian commission has the experts it requires at its disposal the practical work of the commission is mainly carried out by its permanent working groups the integrated water management group the expert group on fisheries the water protection group and the frontier guards group the finnish russian commission routinely involves energy companies and research institutions in its work the two energy companies that participate in the work of the commission have assisted the commission in finding equitable solutions in respect of many issues relating to energy and water utilisation in transboundary waters energy companies have also participated in the creation adjustment and implementation of the lake saimaa and river vuoksi discharge rule under which the parties manage discharge volumes to control flood and drought risks in the joint waters 2 4 procedural aspects and mechanisms principle 1 4 an organisational structure that allows for developing and adopting decisions as well as implementing them neither of the nordic commissions has competence to make decisions that are legally binding on the parties the finnish swedish commission may issue statements and propose motions in certain matters article 11 the finnish norwegian commission may submit proposals propose motions and issue statements on matters related to the management of the transboundary waters the governments of finland or russia may submit a matter to the finnish russian commission for it to make a legally binding unanimous decision or issue an opinion the authorities in both countries are obliged to give the commission all the information and assistance that it needs article 12 in making its decisions the commission must take into account the applicable legislation of both countries article 10 when a certain measure may have significant effects in the territory of one of the parties or where the commission fails to reach a decision on a matter submitted to it the commission must refer the matter to the governments of the parties for consideration article 10 the commission usually deals with matters relating to transboundary watercourses on its own initiative kotkasaari 2008 principle 1 8 regularity in the work of a joint body the agreement between finland and sweden does not set any requirements for regularity in the work of the joint body the commission has adopted an active role for example it held seven meetings in 2017 the finnish norwegian commission meets as needed and at least once a year article 4 in recent years the commission has indeed met annually the finnish russian commission as well as its permanent working groups meet annually throughout the year the parties may exchange new information for the purposes of providing statements or comments or to assist in preparatory work bearing in mind the wide range and large number of issues under consideration by the finnish russian commission the possibility for communication outside the context of the annual meetings is very useful 2 5 implementation of decisions principle 2 2 effective mechanisms for cooperation of a joint body with national authorities and the availability of mechanisms to support the implementation of decisions one of the set objectives of the finnish swedish transboundary river commission is to promote cooperation between the authorities of the parties the 2010 agreement established the finnish swedish water management area according to the requirements of the wfd concrete measures to realise cooperation in the area are joint programmes and plans that authorities in finland and sweden are required to prepare article 4 the commission shall adopt or reject proposals for programmes or plans concerning the water management area article 10 in producing a joint international river basin management plan rbmp for the finnish norwegian river basin district the transboundary water commission must present its views in a coordinated manner on the preparation of the national river basin management plans article 5 in addition the involvement of the commission should be ensured in the exchange of information between competent national authorities mou 2013 the teno tana näätämö neiden and paatsjoki pasvik international river basin district extends to a limited extent across the border into russian territory unece 2011 it is worth noting that the finnish norwegian commission and authorities in both countries have sought cooperation with the russian authorities on matters concerning water management in the joint river basins in matters related to the river paatsjoki pasvik the murmansk regional environment authorities from russia work in cooperation with the finnish norwegian commission russia has participated in the work of the commission in the role of an observer and expert since 1991 4 for instance the russian authorities have partnered in the preparation of a multiple use plan for the river paatsjoki pasvik christiansen 2011 in addition an environmental status and a common monitoring and assessment programme for the paatsjoki pasvik area initiated by the commission has been compiled by russian finnish and norwegian environmental authorities and researchers supported by the murmansk regional environment authorities the pasvik programme is responsible for monitoring in a coordinated manner the state of the environment in the cross border area of finland norway and russia 4 this is a prime example of effective cooperation between national authorities facilitated by a joint water commission in the region national authorities in both countries are active participants in the work of the finnish russian commission the underlying agreement does not establish specific mechanisms for the involvement of national authorities but they cooperate with each other and with the commission exchanging information discussing regulatory measures etc in addition the commission s practice is to provide opinions to national authorities usually to those responsible for granting permits when they are dealing with cases that may have transboundary impacts kaatra 2012 in contrast to opinions the decisions of the commission are binding on both countries article 11 principle 2 6 coordination of activities with other joint bodies in the same catchment area as well as with relevant joint bodies established for preservation of the marine environment there has been discussion of the prospect of including norway in the cooperation relating to the management plan of the international water district in the torne river basin since a small part of the basin lies on the norwegian territory the water framework directive which lays down the obligation for member states to establish river basin districts prescribes that where a river basin extends outside the eu the relevant member state s must endeavour to establish appropriate cooperation with the relevant non member state article 3 however this requirement has not yet been operationalised under the finnish swedish management regime from a practical viewpoint appropriate cooperation in the field is already being carried out under the finnish norwegian regime moreover the area in question is so small that its practical significance is negligible within this context k kinnunen personal communication 13 october 2016 the finnish norwegian commission has been active in establishing cooperation and coordinating activities with the russian side of the basin however the cooperation has been between the commission and local authorities in russia not with a joint body in the same catchment area finland sweden and norway have been engaged in the unofficial trilateral working group for the harmonisation of the water framework directive in the north calotte region the goal of the project was to strengthen and coordinate cooperation between the three countries in working to implement the wfd in the north calotte region the three meetings that took place from 2011 to 2013 enabled the participants responsible for implementing the wfd in a transboundary context i e local authorities and the finnish swedish transboundary river commission to share their experiences concerning implementation of the wfd as well as to determine common areas of cooperation report of the trilateral working group 2013 there is no formal coordination between the finnish russian commission and the baltic marine environment protection commission helcom s rekolainen personal communication 13 october 2016 the work of the finnish russian commission concentrates on transboundary lakes rivers and streams 2 6 accountability transparency and public participation principle 2 1 effective accountability mechanisms for the joint bodies to ensure the implementation of their activities and obligations the finnish swedish and finnish norwegian commissions do not use specific accountability 5 dombrowsky 2007 has discussed options for maintaining accountability in the context of international organisations for water management when competencies are transferred from accountable governments the first viable option involves an accountability mechanism based on the representation of the states in the decision making arrangement this is expected to ensure that decisions taken by the joint body are acceptable to the state parties alternatively an accountability mechanism could be developed by establishing a direct link between the organisation joint body and the local population an additional complication is that public interest in a transboundary basin is not easy to define when for example upstream and downstream interests may differ considerably 5 or compliance mechanisms the former joint body shall monitor the application of the agreement and the permit practices article 10 and it has the right to bring a claim for rectifying a violation of a permit decision or rules or regulations issued by law or under it to a public authority for consideration in accordance with the national legislation article 11 the commission may also give statements in respect of relevant matters the finnish norwegian commission has general monitoring and supervision duties article 1 but they are not directly linked to compliance with the provisions of the agreement the finnish russian commission does not use any specific accountability mechanism to ensure the implementation of the agreement the lack of specific compliance mechanisms in finland s transboundary water agreements reflects the fact that effective and established cooperation is in place and it is not to be considered as a sign of ignorance of compliance problems under the regimes in the finnish setting a small number of parties are involved and they are in regular contact as a result of which any problems that arise can be addressed with ease principle 2 4 mechanisms for public participation and stakeholder involvement in the activities of the joint body are key appropriate tools for public participation and stakeholder involvement should be selected according to their purpose i e to identify stakeholders and interested public to notify inform or consult the stakeholders and the public or to take due account of their comments reflecting also the specific context and the objectives for a consistent provision of necessary funds to support public participation and stakeholder involvement it is important to institutionalize the mechanisms for participation of stakeholders and public drawing on the ece convention on access to information public participation in decision making and access to justice in environmental matters the following criteria should be taken into account for effective public participation and stakeholder involvement equity and inclusiveness accountability and transparency flexibility effectiveness and responsiveness the finnish swedish commission works in close cooperation with the municipalities entrepreneurs authorities and other actors in the river torne basin the information held by the commission is public with some limitations the 2010 agreement contains detailed regulation on access to documents held by the commission article 13 interestingly a voluntary water parliament was set up for the torne river in 2007 and it holds annual finnish swedish meetings the parliament is a forum for information exchange and cooperation regarding water issues between local authorities the frontier river commission and interest organisations experts and when necessary local residents can be heard at the meetings of the finnish norwegian commission article 5 it is an important and rather unusual feature of both nordic commissions that they deal with issues at a regional level and that the people affected by their policy making are heard or even represented as members or deputy members of the commissions k kinnunen personal communication 13 october 2016 the finnish russian commission receives information from and is party to initiatives to support and guide its work by non governmental organisations and private citizens kotkasaari 2008 in addition energy companies have been active in the work of the commission the involvement of frontier guards and energy companies in the commission s work has been an essential element in the cooperation between the countries in the border region and in matters related to the operation of hydropower plants kaatra 2012 in general as parties to the aarhus convention finland sweden and norway have obligations regarding the organisation of public participation in environmental decision making these obligations are also reflected in the regulation of the transboundary water commissions and the work they carry out 2 7 dispute resolution principle 2 5 use of neutral facilitators and external expertise in the process of initiating restarting a dialogue and cooperation both the finnish swedish and finnish norwegian transboundary water agreements state that disputes between parties concerning the application or interpretation of the agreement are to be settled by negotiation articles 6 and 30 or by other manner agreed by the parties in the case of the finnish swedish agreement neither agreement specifies whether the negotiations should involve the commissions the finnish russian regime lays down a mechanism that goes further than finland s agreements with sweden and norway and requires that any differences of opinion arising from the interpretation or application of the agreement that cannot be settled by the commission must be settled by a joint board comprising two members appointed by the governments of finland and russia respectively if the board fails to reach agreement the differences at issue are to be settled via the diplomatic channel article 19 this mechanism involves external facilitators in the process of solving disputes and illustrates the subtle role of the commission which was not designed as a dispute settlement body but rather as a cooperative body upon ratification of the water convention the parties may specify whether they would use the international court of justice or the water convention s dispute settlement mechanism to solve differences with parties concerning the interpretation or application of the convention article 22 more generally joint bodies often play a significant role in preventing and resolving conflicts among riparian states even in the absence of well established dispute resolution mechanisms the commissions usually have a good selection of tools 6 the tools of dispute prevention including monitoring dialogue and exchange of information and the tools of dispute resolution including negotiation mediation arbitration and resolution by the joint body 6 available to promote cooperation and trust among the parties and thus work towards reducing the likelihood of conflicts emerging and escalating see e g tir and stinnett 2012 extensive use of and heavy reliance on joint river basin organisations to perform the task of dispute prevention or to act as pragmatic conflict resolution facilitators is typical of different transboundary water regimes regardless of the region involved wouters 2003 this is understandable since these bodies have been established to promote cooperation and coordination among the riparian states and their members can usually be expected to be experts on issues concerning the regime 3 broader institutional perspectives on the transboundary water commissions of finland and its co riparians and the implications for water diplomacy 3 1 international experience several studies in the past decade have highlighted features relevant to the functioning and effectiveness of joint bodies in transboundary water management and have concluded that there is significant variation between them see e g schmeier 2013 lautze et al 2013 unece 2009 hooper 2006 kliot et al 2001 based on a global overview focusing on river basin organisations schmeier describes the effectiveness of river basin governance as depending on two main categories of factors 1 exogenous factors including the nature of the collective action problem and the constellation of actors and 2 endogenous factors of which she underlines the institutional design as being the one likely to matter the most schmeier 2013 unece has analysed joint bodies in transboundary water governance in terms of their structures and activities unece 2009 despite differences in contexts and cultures among others there is potential for joint bodies to share their experiences in addressing a wide range of issues in particular it would be worth evaluating the value in terms of water diplomacy of situations in which major differences that have emerged between parties have been resolved during long cooperation 3 2 structure of joint bodies and cooperation with national authorities review of joint bodies across europe has led to the conclusion that the achievement of continuity and effective implementation of decisions calls for joint commissions to have executive and working bodies in addition to a decision making body unece 2009 expert or working groups which have been established most commonly in coordination oriented river basin organisations are regarded as an important institutional design feature schmeier 2013 the work carried out by the finnish russian commission s working groups is set by issue or area of work e g integrated water management and fisheries the work of subsidiary bodies of a bilateral commission is also frequently organised by reference to a river basin the work of the finnish russian commission covers a large number of water bodies but their relative importance in terms of use and need for coordination is very different the work of the finnish swedish commission focuses on one major river basin whereas the finnish norwegian commission covers numerous boundary waters shared by the two countries the organisation of the finnish russian commission differs from the other two transboundary water commissions to which finland is a party from a water diplomacy angle both approaches appear to function well the issues that the finnish russian commission mostly deals with often require state level administrative measures and it is therefore appropriate that state representatives make decisions on them at the annual meetings of the commission the broad based memberships of the other two commissions enhance the legitimacy of their work and underline their expertise in local conditions in terms of regularity finland s joint commissions compare well with regional practice in europe many joint commissions meet at least annually even when contacts are also maintained through other means see e g unece 2009 against that background the finnish swedish commission can even be said to meet frequently overall all the commissions have regular meetings and carry out effective communication between the meetings holding meetings on a regular basis is important to ensure good working relationships and the exchange of up to date information within the commissions these qualities actively facilitate the practicing of environmental diplomacy in the regions in many cases multilateral river basin commissions in the pan european region include permanent secretariats which tend to be small and have rather limited staff when comparing globally european commission 2012b smaller secretariats often work better for coordination oriented basin organisations than for implementation oriented ones schmeier 2013 it is less common for bilateral commissions to have permanent joint secretariats since the provision of information is one of its tasks the office of the finnish swedish commission is likely to supplement the outreach offered to local stakeholders regional organisations provide the secretariats of the finnish norwegian commission with a consistent regional focus for their work in the case of the finnish russian commission secretariat support is provided as needed by each member country article 6 overall all three commissions are well supported they hold regular meetings and have effective secretariat functions a sound financial basis and easy access to local and scientific expertise this ensures that their work is effective and balanced and provides tools to deal with inter alia different areas of cooperation and uncertainties and different development needs in the joint water management furthermore long term cooperation institutions provide continuity when political changes occur with changing governments 3 3 scope and focus of work from the perspective of water diplomacy and the prevention of conflicts within shared river basins it is of the utmost importance that the waters subject to cooperation and joint management are defined clearly when all basin countries are equal members of the joint management body the body has a better chance to function effectively both from environmental or technical and political perspectives equal participation works towards enhancing fairness and the perceived ownership of the decisions and actions taken by the joint body the impacts of the real world power relations of the parties cannot perhaps be always totally overcome in line with the hydro hegemony thematic but the involvement of all basin states 7 sometimes it is sufficient that all major basin states are involved as parties in the cooperation a state that shares only a tiny part of the basin can be included as an observer in the treaty arrangement this is the case for example with norway in the finnish swedish transboundary rivers agreement 7 and representative participation in the work of the joint body is still very important in terms of the scope of work carried out the three joint commissions of finland cover a relatively broad range of issues the scope and focus of cooperation has however evolved to some degree over the decades influenced by legislative changes the wfd etc environmental protection has gradually received more attention which is logical as the agreements were initially concluded at a time when environmental concerns were less prominent and the related regulation less substantial timber floating which was previously an important economic activity relevant to the application of the finnish russian agreement has lost its importance finland s agreements with sweden and norway have had to be revised to ensure alignment with the wfd the original finnish russian agreement 1964 did not refer to hydropower or energy before the discharge rule of lake saimaa and the vuoksi river 1989 was adopted hence the legal basis has developed to address the challenge of optimising the flow regulation the discharges are adjusted supervised by the commission to achieve a balance between the requirements of hydropower production the mitigation of flood impacts and meeting environmental needs influenced by the coordination obligation laid down in the wfd river basin planning including related studies and consultations has become a prominent part of finland s institutional transboundary cooperation although the measures required by the wfd are promoted by finland in cooperation with russia the work of the two nordic commissions is much more far reaching due to the common basis harmonised legislation the same planning cycle classifications etc and has increasingly converged towards joint basin planning for the current cycle of planning 2015 2021 such flexibility or progressive evolution of the cooperation framework seems valuable for effectively addressing emerging issues on the basis of the rbmps of 2009 2015 the european union eu recommended that finland should extend the related international coordination with all its co riparian countries european commission 2012a the degree of international coordination and cooperation under the wfd has increased and the coordination arrangements including joint commissions have played a key role in the preparation of international rbmps coherent with their national counterparts however examples of rbmps coordinated with riparian countries that are not eu member states remain few in number the known examples are on the danube river basin and the sava river basin unece 2011 the nordic commissions effectiveness and dispute prevention capacity are not in practice significantly hindered by the fact that they do not issue decisions that are binding upon the parties there is a strong spirit of cooperation between the countries involved and their environmental legislations and practices are largely harmonised as a result of which the commissions planning and management activities do not require legally binding authority the finnish russian commission is of older origin the scope of its work including e g discharge issues that have notable effects on the parties is larger and the economic and other interests of the parties and stakeholders in the issues under regulation are often stronger and this fact underlines the importance of issuing legally binding decisions the broad competence of the joint management body is an asset in terms of the conduct of water diplomacy it allows the body to address a wide variety of issues that are felt by the parties to be important and also to address new and emerging issues that were perhaps not envisaged at the time of adoption of the original agreement this may help in preventing differences from emerging and addressing them among the member states generally a joint body s ability to deal with uncertainties incomplete knowledge or conflicting views among the parties is often critical in the face of these kinds of challenges it is invaluable for the joint management body to have broad competence as well as links to national and regional authorities for the implementation of the decisions it is worth bearing in mind that in practice water diplomacy is not limited to water cooperation but is also relevant to cooperation involving for instance energy trade and environmental issues a joint water commission that has competence in these areas can be a valuable institution for cooperation among the basin states beyond water the finnish norwegian commission has given its opinion on issues related to and impacting on water management such as construction and planning 3 4 work with national authorities accountability and coordination the implementation of decisions in transboundary water management is only possible through cooperation with the national authorities of the parties in this respect the representation of national authorities in the joint body and the means by which the joint body can draw upon national authorities capacities and inputs are crucial unece 2009 each joint body has a unique function in its region the relevant agreements specify the tasks of the joint bodies which often parallel or complement the functions and competencies of the national authorities of the parties bilateral commissions like those of finland with its co riparians do not have all the features of a full fledged basin organisation in its relations with different actors the work of the finnish russian commission is more at the level of central government although regional administration is also represented in the nordic commissions the emphasis is more on local issues this is reflected in their communication which is oriented more towards the regions and the local communities this approach is also reflected in the composition of the commissions it is clear that local links are also important in respect of the accountability of joint bodies the strong local dimension also ensures expertise in local matters relating to the waters subject to cooperation this is an interesting approach from the water diplomacy perspective however it is obviously a well functioning practice especially from the viewpoint of settling differences between the parties which provides tools at an early stage for the parties to prevent potential conflict situations from escalating even if not many different national authorities are always directly involved in the work of the commissions it is crucial that the joint bodies have access to such expertise when it is needed that is important for information management participation and the balancing of different interests the modality of representation and working with the regional authorities as well as stakeholders developed in the nordic commissions may merit attention in water diplomacy efforts it has distinct advantages but then again the issues may have less prominence at the national level therefore assessing the value for another context it needs to be taken into account how politicised water issues are 3 5 public participation and access to information various forms and mechanisms for public participation can be used by joint bodies the purpose of the work being carried out has a significant influence on the selection of the most appropriate tools to identify stakeholders and the interested public to notify inform or consult the stakeholders and the public and to take due account of their comments the relevant methods that may be used include granting observer status based on specific criteria and allowing for the submission of written enquiries the formulation of the unece principle 2 4 on public participation was informed by the aarhus convention which is referred to for guidance notably related to the interpretation of public participation and information related provisions of the water convention unece 2013 in particular it can be highlighted that regionalisation and participation of the local population are features that stand out in the work of the nordic commissions the implementation of the rbmps and the public consultations required by the processes have influenced the organisation of public participation within the context of nordic transboundary water cooperation the finnish norwegian commission has taken the indigenous sami population into account by the inclusion of a local member from the sami group the finnish russian commission is more concerned with national level coordination and extensions to participation are made to utilise specific expertise and include the private sector the finnish russian commission does not in particular communicate with the local population through a website as is the practice in the nordic commissions from the angle of water diplomacy effective stakeholder participation is a crucial feature of joint bodies in transboundary water governance by effective participation the authors of the present paper understand first and foremost the engagement of all relevant stakeholders in a way that is inclusive provides a variety of ways and channels of participation and the inputs of which are genuinely considered by the policy makers this understanding is in line with the provisions on public participation of the aarhus convention effective stakeholder participation in transboundary water management promotes transparency information sharing conflict prevention and management among others at the same time it is important to ensure that the work of the commissions is not too heavily or in an unbalanced way influenced by stakeholder interests 4 conclusions this paper has limited its analysis to those principles for effective joint bodies that principally concern the scope and organisation of the work carried out by such bodies as well as procedural aspects the principles which have been developed considering a broad range of joint bodies and decades of experience can be viewed as a kind of check list to accompany setting up or revisiting institutional arrangements to regularise and develop water cooperation the principles themselves have been formulated recently and published just before the finalization of the present paper and consequently not yet widely disseminated to serve as reference for states and actors in particular to inform initial reflection or shaping of cooperation in early stages this paper demonstrates the relevance of the principles but also reveals diversity in terms of how and to what degree they feature in practice in the framework of the cooperation arrangements analysed while evolved since then the legal bases and institutional frameworks for finland s transboundary cooperation predates the water convention and the principles for effective joint bodies making a comparison to the synthesis of wide international experience and good practice which the principles constitute interesting finland s cooperation in the management of transboundary waters is institutionally light and does not demonstrate all the features of the principles to a high degree in general the approaches taken in finland s cooperation arrangements indicate adaptation to local settings and needs this approach probably appropriate beyond the cooperation arrangements discussed here a customised cooperative and institutional structure is often the most effective in preventing friction building up and supporting finding mutually agreeable ways forward among the parties such an approach is apt to ensure that any differences that may turn into a source of friction are detected early on and that the resolution measures can be tailored to meet the specific circumstances in addition building of trust and the fact that the parties and stakeholders know each other well are also important for preventing and resolving conflicts within this setting it is interesting to note how e g the finnish swedish transboundary water cooperation has been able to contribute to so called de bordering processes despite the fact that the river torne has formed the state border for more than 200 years sallisalmi 2018 the active and participatory work of the finnish swedish commission has contributed to connecting local people on both sides of the border and encouraged them to act for the benefit of the border region in the management of the transboundary watershed the applied method of localisation of the conservation and management of the shared water basin has brought about many benefits to the transboundary cooperation built in trust in the relations between and within the commission and different stakeholders communication of both opposing and shared interests and goals development of joint strategies with stakeholders and the possibility for a more diversified dialogue to emerge on the development paths of the basin area ibid all these aspects are important for the maintenance and improvement of local and regional water security ensuring an enabling environment for productive activities that depend on water and they provide important lessons also for other transboundary freshwater regimes the scope of cooperation demonstrates a broad competency including different water uses as recommended by the principles gradual evolution can be observed in the work of the joint commissions which is still largely being carried out on the basis of agreements that go back decades demonstrating robustness in the face of societal political and economic changes in the case of the nordic commissions the coordination of river basin management planning has intensified and now extends to the preparation of joint river basin management plans for shared basins implementation of the wfd imposes a coordination obligation upon finland and sweden also on norway to some extent furthermore embeddedness in the eu regime and previous adoption of unece legal instruments have promoted harmonisation and accompanied the nordic countries into mature cooperation and joint management of their transboundary waters the convention has also provided a forum for sharing the nordic cooperation experience the scale and frequency of interaction with stakeholders is also an area where clear differences can be observed in some cases specific arrangements and mechanisms for participation of stakeholders and the public have been developed the water parliament in the river torne basin and the active participation of energy companies in the work of the finnish russian commission can be highlighted as examples the interests of states and stakeholders are taken into account in the work of all the commissions and water management issues are inextricably linked with cooperation over energy the environment etc the work of the commissions has had influence beyond water management for example on building regulations and on municipal planning as has been the case of the finnish norwegian commission the experience from work with stakeholders offers valuable lessons for joint bodies in respect of the effective promotion of water security and diplomacy within shared basins the impact dimension of the effectiveness of the joint bodies needs to be assessed in relation to the achievement of the commissions objectives to the extent to which these objectives have been explicitly stated and in relation to the amelioration of the problems or challenges that they were established to address several positive developments in relation to issues within the mandates of the nordic commissions have been observed for example the consistency of monitoring results has improved over time assisted by intercalibration efforts some improvement in water quality has also been observed unece 2011 the finnish russian commission oversees an agreed flow regulation arrangement and even discusses related compensation when appropriate involving different sectors and important economic interests these facts demonstrate some degree of advancement in the cooperation these findings show that institutionally relatively light cooperation in the management of transboundary waters can bring environmental benefits and at the same time support multi level governance from the water diplomacy perspective finland s joint commissions have a strong yet usually implicit emphasis on the prevention of conflicts only the finnish russian regime involves a more direct approach that also covers conflict resolution in terms of agreed procedures this approach is very much in line with the nature of the regimes which have been designed in particular contexts for specific needs the commissions in focus have addressed contentious issues of importance to the riparian countries and the regions in particular including flood risk management fishing rights and hydropower this suggests that there are likely transferable lessons about building trust and addressing various issues that are of value to water diplomacy beyond the region it seems that overall the use of experience from the cooperation discussed in this paper has so far been limited perhaps happening mainly through individuals nevertheless some sharing of the lessons has taken place through the water convention s platform 8 examples of such experience sharing include the water allocation in transboundary basins a global workshop on the status and good practices in geneva 16 17 october 2017 and the international symposium managing transboundary waters from policy to practice in hanoi 2 4 october 2016 where also the finnish experiences were presented and discussed 8 as russia s other bilateral agreements on transboundary waters are more recent than the one with finland unece 2011 the experience may have informed the development of russia s cooperation in other basins on other borders thorough assessment of the work done by the commissions and its impacts lies outside the scope of this paper nonetheless it is reasonable to infer that the manner in which the cooperation has been established and the exchange of information and coordination of actions it has facilitated has contributed to finland and its co riparians making significant progress in the management of transboundary waters while there is always room for improvement the current state of cooperation bodes well in the light of the unece principles for effective joint bodies

6889,water diplomacy may be understood broadly as the measures that may be taken to prevent or peacefully resolve conflicts over water resources concerning their availability allocation or use between and within states the concept is preventive in nature as well as offering an approach for conflict resolution instruments of international water law among them notably conventions and soft law developed on that basis which promote equitable and reasonable use of transboundary waters and prevention of transboundary impact can serve as tools for water diplomacy the obligation to establish agreements on shared waters and joint bodies to govern them has contributed to gathering important experience and some of this has been synthesized into the principles for effective joint bodies which were adopted by the meeting of the parties to the unece water convention in 2015 the principles are intended as a resource to increase the effectiveness of joint bodies in transboundary water cooperation this paper analyses finland s cooperation arrangements in the light of the principles and assesses the extent to which finland s transboundary water commissions reflect the good practices specified in the principles taking a wider perspective the paper also examines the elements of the principles and their practical realisation with a view to understanding better their promotion of water diplomacy relevant features include inter alia the competency and representation of the joint institution its accountability and the extent to which public participation is permitted and the cooperative mechanisms in place naturally the underlying transboundary water agreements specify the framework for cooperation between the riparian states to a great extent but the established joint bodies often play a significant role specifically in the equitable use and management of the shared water resources but even beyond in the prevention and settling of conflicts and in the general promotion of cooperation and security at a regional level keywords unece principles joint bodies transboundary waters water agreements water diplomacy 1 introduction 1 1 water diplomacy and institutional frameworks definitions of water diplomacy vary but good water governance as well as agreements and institutions invariably play a key role e g molnar et al 2017 can be referred to for a discussion about the definitions given the inherent complexity of water problems and water networks institutionalised cooperation on the part of riparian states supported by the participation of all water users is indispensable for the effective joint management of water resources and for the prevention and management of conflicts see e g schmeier 2013 priscoli and wolf 2009 in transboundary basins joint bodies such as river basin commissions or bilateral commissions can have a role in water diplomacy in various areas including through serving as a venue hub to support decision making the sharing of information monitoring compliance notification and consultation dispute resolution and basin planning schmeier and shubber 2018 this special issue while existence of joint bodies overall stabilises cooperation schmeier 2013 they do not in all cases provide for an equitable cooperation zeitoun and mirumachi 2008 describe different nuances of transboundary water interaction essentially with a combined reading of conflict and cooperation the relationship of states may in particular be affected by a presence of strong power asymmetries evident in structural inequalities lack of control over decisions or an inequitable allocation of the resource or its benefits zeitoun and warner 2006 identification and communication of the benefits of transboundary water cooperation are key drivers of the political decisions on cooperation these benefits need to be understood as going beyond economic benefits to include benefits relating to peace and stability sadoff and grey 2002 unece 2015a these should be stressed as they are often crucial elements in the creation of value in water cooperation at a regional level equally it needs to be recognised that not all water cooperation is inherently good power dynamics between the countries sometimes influence the cooperative frameworks and their implementation to the extent that the term hydro hegemony 1 denoting strong power asymmetries between the countries evident in structural inequalities lack of control over decisions and an inequitable allocation of the resource or its benefits zeitoun and warner 2006 1 finds application see e g zeitoun and warner 2006 warner et al 2017 water diplomacy is often viewed as a tool to be deployed when conflicts over water use or the development of a basin surface potentially impacting the relations of the countries concerned beyond water management at the same time water diplomacy could perhaps to a greater degree take inspiration and seek solutions from established practices and frameworks where functional cooperation has been established and major differences avoided over the management of shared waters this should be hold with the understanding that cooperation practices have developed in particular local contexts the key features of cooperation arrangements that have brought about sustained cooperation dialogue and the resolution of various issues and which have also been adapted to deal with emerging challenges merit attention 1 2 the water convention and the role of joint bodies already early general codification referred to and or highlighted the importance of specific agreements and joint institutions for transboundary water cooperation concerning non navigational uses of international rivers and lakes the helsinki rules on the uses of the waters of international rivers issued by the international law commission ila in 1966 marked the first general codification of the law of international watercourses salman 2007 these rules were later revised by the ila and issued as the berlin rules on water resources in 2004 2 the berlin rules include art 64 on establishing basin wide or other joint management arrangements and art 65 on minimal requirements for joint management arrangements 2 the convention on the law of the non navigational uses of international watercourses was adopted in 1997 following a negotiation by the un member states in the framework of the un general assembly on the basis of a text developed by the international law commission un watercourses convention the un watercourses convention which entered into force in 2014 recommends parties entering into or harmonising existing watercourse agreements and joint arrangements the convention on the protection and use of transboundary watercourses and international lakes hereinafter the water convention negotiated through an intergovernmental process under the auspices of the united nations economic commission for europe unece signed in helsinki in 1992 and entered into force in 1996 it is a framework convention promoting transboundary cooperation in the management of shared water resources including both surface waters and groundwaters for more than 20 years the water convention has influenced and provided a basis for the development of specific agreements on transboundary waters in fact article 9 of the water convention obliges the parties to conclude and or revise bilateral or multilateral agreements and to establish joint bodies institutions for transboundary cooperation it has been recognised that permanent cooperation through such mechanisms allows for early identification of potential sources of disagreement and offers a means to prevent their escalation unece 2013 thus enhancing peace and security in essence joint bodies have the positive capacity to lock parties into cooperation thereby promoting shared understanding and responsibility and preventing conflicts the water convention defines a joint body as any bilateral or multilateral commission or other appropriate institutional arrangements for cooperation between the riparian parties the existing commissions and other joint bodies for transboundary water cooperation differ from one another in terms of for example scope of work competence functions powers and organisational structure in general the institutional arrangements are in the form of multilateral river basin commissions essentially on the main transboundary rivers as well as various bilateral arrangements involving responsibility for all or specific transboundary watercourses or basins shared by two countries article 9 of the water convention specifies the basic tasks to be entrusted to the joint bodies to perform including the collection and exchange of information the elaboration of joint monitoring programmes and proposing measures and evaluating their effectiveness due to the obligations under the water convention for riparian parties to establish joint bodies for transboundary cooperation specifying basic tasks for them and the more than 20 years of practical experience that has accumulated about and by joint bodies this paper focuses on the latest related soft law guidance that has been developed and adopted in the framework of the water convention preceded by an intergovernmental review process as far as the authors are aware the principles represent the only guidance developed in an intergovernmental framework of this scale and coverage 1 3 the principles for effective joint bodies emerging international recognition of the importance of institutional arrangements for transboundary water cooperation the sustainable development goals adopted by the united nations general assembly in 2015 unga res 70 1 include goal 6 on water and sanitation which defines with various targets the global community s ambition in this area until 2030 among its targets is the improvement of integrated water resources management iwrm including transboundary cooperation as appropriate target 6 5 the indicator for monitoring progress globally is the proportion of transboundary basin area with an operational arrangement for water cooperation inter agency expert group on sustainable indicators 2016 the inclusion of an explicit mention of transboundary cooperation in water management in the 2030 agenda demonstrates the political recognition of the importance of the issue furthermore the indicator 6 5 2 underlines the key role of specific agreements or other arrangements concluded between co riparian countries as a fundamental precondition to ensure long term sustainable cooperation in freshwater management the indicator 6 5 2 which is also part of reporting progress to the high level political forum on sustainable development and for which unece and unesco are co custodian agencies also highlights that joint bodies that meet and exchange information regularly are a crucial element in making such cooperation operational un water 2016 unece 2017 despite the diversity of arrangements and different histories and contexts of establishment joint bodies and the development of international law on the management of transboundary water resources allow for the identification of certain principles of organisation and activities that generally increase the efficiency of the joint bodies and contribute to reaching a mature level of cooperation between the riparian states unece 2015a a set of such principles was developed under the water convention in 2014 drawing upon earlier work under the convention see e g unece 2009 as well as upon a review of case studies and experience from joint bodies and country representatives resulting from workshops on that topic the principles for effective joint bodies went through an intergovernmental review within the framework of the working group on integrated water resources management which discussed the principles in its ninth and tenth meeting in 2014 and 2015 see unece 2015b respectively and were adopted by the seventh session of the meeting of the parties to the water convention in november 2015 the principles are a legally non binding soft law document nevertheless they represent an important and potentially influential instrument that synthesises valuable lessons from the collective experience of the joint bodies parties to the water convention and other states as well as other stakeholders unece 2018 1 4 about the paper the scope of the principles of effective joint bodies covers the following 1 the establishment structure and functions of joint bodies 2 their operation and 3 financial and human resources the principles can be considered as a kind of checklist of features linked to more sustained mature cooperation among riparian states this paper focuses on features related to the first category factors such as competency and representation organisational structure procedural mechanisms accountability cooperation and public participation are fixed to a marked degree and less prone to dynamic change and are consequently easier to verify at the same time these factors provide the necessary framework for the functioning of a joint body they set the framework for the governance work of a joint body within a basin and include basic elements that can be adopted by different bodies in different locations and circumstances analysis of these factors is of direct relevance to the global discussion on the role and capacity of joint bodies in reconciling different interests and finding solutions among riparian states and possibly supporting developing cooperation beyond water or reinforcing good neighbourly relations this paper assesses how finland s cooperation arrangements with norway russia and sweden stand in relation to the salient features highlighted by the unece principles and how the principles both generally and in the specific contexts examined in the paper can support water diplomacy and even water security in the co management of shared freshwater resources however it is to be noted that on one hand not all aspects of finland s transboundary water cooperation are included under the unece principles and on the other hand not all unece principles are relevant or have been applied in the finnish context an example of the former is communication and reconciliation in permit matters under the finnish swedish agreement and ensuring the consideration of groundwater issues serves as an example of the latter case having been established decades ago the legal and institutional bases of these cooperation arrangements have reasonably long time spans and they have been robust in the face of change this suggests that situations where cooperation has prevented or effectively addressed potential conflicts may offer valuable lessons for water diplomacy implementation of the water convention has been shaping finland s cooperation and as an active party finland has contributed experience into this framework for water cooperation this paper is structured as follows following the introductory section part two reviews the way in which the principles for effective joint bodies are reflected in finland s transboundary water cooperation arrangement focusing on aspects related to the establishment structure and functions of the joint bodies part three analyses the findings of the preceding part and examines how they relate to the enhancement of water diplomacy at the specific regional level part four offers a conclusion that draws together the paper s main findings 2 how the principles inform finland s cooperation arrangements for transboundary waters 2 1 introduction finland is located in northern europe between scandinavia and russia the northern part of the country lapland is bordered by sweden in the west norway in the north and russia in the east in fact finland shares the whole of its eastern border with russia the length of each border that crosses water is 617 km for the border with sweden 715 km for the border with norway and 370 km for the border with russia finland s environmental administration 2016 finland s borders with sweden and norway are partly constituted by rivers to manage these large areas of shared freshwater finland has signed bilateral transboundary waters agreements with its neighbour countries under which the established joint bodies promote coordination and cooperation in the management of the shared water resources the cooperation takes into account the special characteristics of each transboundary watercourse area finland shares the river muonionjoki and part of the river torne tornionjoki with sweden the current agreement concerning transboundary rivers between the countries has been in force since 2010 its predecessor was signed in 1971 the institution that manages the transboundary river cooperation is the finnish swedish transboundary river commission which was established by the agreement overall cooperation on transboundary waters between finland and sweden has been conducted in a good spirit thanks to the long traditions of cross border interaction in the area and to the fact that the environmental legislations of the two countries are largely harmonised the largest river basins that finland shares with norway are the catchment areas of the teno tana näätämö neiden and paatsjoki pasvik rivers all located in lapland finland and norway concluded an agreement on the frontier water commission in 1980 for the purpose of formally fulfilling the requirements laid down in directive 2000 60 ec of the european parliament and of the council hereinafter the water framework directive or wfd 3 even though norway is not a member of the european union but of the european economic area eea it implements the water framework directive with a delayed schedule 3 finland and norway concluded an agreement on the finnish norwegian river basin district in 2014 overall the transboundary water agreements and other cooperative arrangements between finland and norway have enhanced cooperation between the norwegian and finnish border municipalities and have improved water quality in the border rivers luokkanen and räinä 2007 finland and the russian federation share a land border of approximately 1300 km the border region contains 20 watersheds and 800 water bodies but none of the major rivers runs along the finnish russian borderline the largest transboundary watercourses are those of the vuoksi and paatsjoki pasvik rivers kaatra 2012 the agreement concerning frontier watercourses was signed by finland and the soviet union in 1964 and entered into force a year later it was adopted by the russian federation after the dissolution of the soviet union in early 1990s the agreement established the joint finnish russian commission on the utilisation of frontier waters generally cooperation between finland and russia can be regarded as one of the success stories of international water law see e g belinskij 2015 even though the institutionalisation of the transboundary cooperation between finland and its neighbours predates the water convention it has been shaped by the implementation of the convention obligations the fact that it was not considered necessary to adapt the bilateral frontier river agreements due to the implementation of the convention when finland was involved in the process of ratifying it unece 2013 stands as evidence about consistency with the convention s principles and provisions in addition to finland and its co riparian countries being parties to the water convention the four countries have also adopted other international legal instruments e g the 1991 espoo convention on environmental impact assessment in a transboundary context thus further demonstrating commitment to principles of transboundary cooperation furthermore ratification of the 1998 aarhus convention on access to information public participation in decision making and access to justice in environmental matters russia not a party adds a certain consistency to the legal basis in terms of principles and obligations in addition the eu wfd has naturally shaped finland s arrangements for transboundary water management see later this paper 2 2 competency principle 1 2 clear definition of the waters subject to cooperation in accordance with the basin approach and participation of all basin countries in a joint body all three transboundary freshwater agreements to which finland is a party provide for a clear definition of the waters subject to cooperation and have adopted a basin approach the riparians are equal participants in the joint bodies principle 1 1 broad competence of a joint body which allows for addressing in a complex way on the basis of iwrm the entire spectrum of issues related to the sustainable development management use including infrastructure and protection of transboundary waters different sectoral interests in water use and the development of a basin may cause friction in relation to transboundary basins the broad competence of a joint body can be of assistance in reconciling diverging interests of parties and stakeholders the competence of the finnish swedish commission similarly to the scope of the underlying agreement covers both water and fishing issues the relevant water issues include equitable use joint coordinated management instruments programmes and plans and environmental objectives prevention of flood damage monitoring of flow conditions and the management of transboundary impacts the fishing regulations contained in the agreement are mainly addressed to national authorities the competence of the finnish norwegian commission covers matters related to transboundary waters article 1 more specifically these matters pertain to the management of the transboundary waters monitoring the condition and quality of the waters fishing conditions the prevention of pollution of the waters construction work in the watercourse and the general regulation of the waters the finnish russian agreement is concerned with a great number and variety of issues water flow and structural measures flood control and water scarcity timber floating and water traffic fisheries and fish migration pollution and water quality and public health and economy indeed cooperation under the agreement has arguably adopted a multi objective approach kaatra 2012 the competence of the joint finnish russian commission follows the lines of the underlying agreement articles 6 and 8 as its name suggests the commission s work has focused on the utilisation of waters however in recent years the commission has increasingly engaged with environmental protection issues overall the competencies of all three transboundary water commissions are relatively broad as recommended by the unece principles sustainable and equitable use and management of the transboundary waters is perceived as important in all three regions and the commissions have actively enabled and promoted a wide range of different uses in respect of the waters principle 1 3 clearly defined tasks and powers for the joint body which are sufficient for effective activities related to the management development use and protection of transboundary waters principle 1 6 certain flexibility of the agreement establishing the joint body allowing to progressively develop cooperation in terms of scope mandate and riparian states involved principle 1 10 a mandate to identify and assess accurately the potential benefits of transboundary water cooperation taking into account the economic social environmental and geopolitical aspects the powers and tasks of the finnish swedish commission are clearly defined in the underlying agreement articles 10 and 11 on the functions and competence of the commission the commission may give statements appeal certain decisions and bring claims to rectify violations in certain cases it also has tasks related to monitoring developing and promoting cooperation and to developing programmes and plans concerning the water management area the finnish norwegian transboundary water commission has first and foremost an advisory role its main tasks include submitting proposals and motions and issuing statements on matters related to the management of the transboundary waters in addition the commission monitors the status and quality of the transboundary waters and prevents their deterioration article 1 the tasks and powers of the joint finnish russian commission have been formulated very clearly the commission examines on the instruction of the parties or on its own initiative matters relating to the utilisation of frontier watercourses as included in the frontier watercourses agreement such matters may be resolved by making a decision or issuing an opinion in addition the commission oversees in general that the agreement is complied with and monitors the state of the transboundary waters article 8 the commission has certain regulatory powers related to timber floating in the frontier watercourses article 13 regarding principle 1 6 on a certain flexibility of the agreement establishing the joint body finland s transboundary water agreements remain at a relatively modest level on the other hand the agreements were broad in their sectoral scope to begin with the principle is perhaps more relevant for states that have agreements with a more limited scope e g on a specific water use which flexibility could help broaden or states sharing basins where major new development such as construction of dams or major expansion of irrigation systems is expected to take place flexibility that provides for adjustment to changes in conditions in the long term is valuable especially due to climate change see e g honkonen 2017 as agreements on transboundary waters commonly remain in force and provide the basis for cooperation for a long time robustness is also a valuable quality to balance flexibility the agreement with sweden gives the joint commission the power to draw the parties attention to any need to amend the agreement article 10 furthermore the parties convene as necessary to ensure the application of the agreement article 31 the agreement with norway entitles the joint commission to put forward proposals and submit initiatives regarding the amendment of the agreement on the commission or of other agreements between the parties article 9 the agreement with russia does not include specific flexibility clauses however the fact that the finnish russian commission was made responsible for overseeing the implementation of the discharge rule for lake saimaa and the vuoksi river which was negotiated within the commission and concluded in 1989 demonstrates that it has a certain flexibility as a cooperation framework none of the transboundary water commissions to which finland is a party is expected to involve additional riparian states there are in practice none that need be involved in the case of the finnish swedish commission the finnish norwegian commission has had representatives from russia participating as observers of its work for a long time and the finnish russian commission is concerned merely with finland and russia with the possibility to invite the chairpersons of the finnish norwegian commission as observers to the meetings k kinnunen personal communication 13 october 2016 the mandates of the three joint bodies examined here do not specifically empower the bodies to assess the potential benefits of the cooperation nevertheless the commissions regularly report on their activities to the state parties and thereby also assess the realised and potential benefits of the cooperation the benefits and significance of the cooperation involving the commissions have not been put under question by any party capacity to address emerging issues to prevent those from causing friction is potentially valuable from a hydro diplomatic perspective 2 3 representation and organisational structure principle 1 5 a sufficiently broad and complete representation of national authorities in the joint body implying participation beyond the water management authorities to include representatives from environment fishery agriculture transport health energy hydrometeorology authorities economy and finance ministries as appropriate principle 1 7 availability of technical informational scientific and other support to joint body s activities through appropriate design of organisational structure representation within a joint body affects its expertise legitimacy and its ability to resolve disagreements of the three members from each country in the finnish swedish transboundary river commission one has to be from the government authority responsible for water issues and one from the municipality in the area of application of the agreement countries are free to choose the third member the members should as a minimum have expertise in water management and the local conditions the commission uses experts to assist it in its work and each party may appoint up to three permanent experts the commission may also use other experts currently the commission has two permanent expert members appointed by each party who are professionals specialising in water policy within the finnish norwegian frontier water commission there are three members from each country representing environmental administration and municipalities of the members one has to have experience in water management while another has to be particularly familiar with the circumstances of the border area article 40 the members are to have expertise in water management and local conditions the commission may hear experts during its meetings and assign to them responsibility for the preparation of studies and reports article 5 in both nordic commissions the third members are freely chosen by the parties to represent other interests that are considered important in the finnish swedish commission the current third members are local entrepreneurs while in the finnish norwegian commission the third members are from municipalities one representing the indigenous sami people overall this kind of discretion in the membership of the commissions is a significant element of flexibility also in the sense that the interests represented within the commissions may change due to changes in the membership the joint finnish russian commission comprises three members from each contracting state and three alternates article 6 the agreement remains silent as to the expertise that is required of the commission members which may be regarded as a sign of operational flexibility national authorities that currently participate in the activities of the commission include on the finnish side the ministry of agriculture and forestry the ministry for foreign affairs the centre for economic development transport and the environment of south eastern finland and the finnish environment institute on the russian side the main participating authorities are different units of regional water administration and other regional authorities representatives from the federal ministries of foreign affairs and energy participate occasionally as observers the finnish russian commission has the experts it requires at its disposal the practical work of the commission is mainly carried out by its permanent working groups the integrated water management group the expert group on fisheries the water protection group and the frontier guards group the finnish russian commission routinely involves energy companies and research institutions in its work the two energy companies that participate in the work of the commission have assisted the commission in finding equitable solutions in respect of many issues relating to energy and water utilisation in transboundary waters energy companies have also participated in the creation adjustment and implementation of the lake saimaa and river vuoksi discharge rule under which the parties manage discharge volumes to control flood and drought risks in the joint waters 2 4 procedural aspects and mechanisms principle 1 4 an organisational structure that allows for developing and adopting decisions as well as implementing them neither of the nordic commissions has competence to make decisions that are legally binding on the parties the finnish swedish commission may issue statements and propose motions in certain matters article 11 the finnish norwegian commission may submit proposals propose motions and issue statements on matters related to the management of the transboundary waters the governments of finland or russia may submit a matter to the finnish russian commission for it to make a legally binding unanimous decision or issue an opinion the authorities in both countries are obliged to give the commission all the information and assistance that it needs article 12 in making its decisions the commission must take into account the applicable legislation of both countries article 10 when a certain measure may have significant effects in the territory of one of the parties or where the commission fails to reach a decision on a matter submitted to it the commission must refer the matter to the governments of the parties for consideration article 10 the commission usually deals with matters relating to transboundary watercourses on its own initiative kotkasaari 2008 principle 1 8 regularity in the work of a joint body the agreement between finland and sweden does not set any requirements for regularity in the work of the joint body the commission has adopted an active role for example it held seven meetings in 2017 the finnish norwegian commission meets as needed and at least once a year article 4 in recent years the commission has indeed met annually the finnish russian commission as well as its permanent working groups meet annually throughout the year the parties may exchange new information for the purposes of providing statements or comments or to assist in preparatory work bearing in mind the wide range and large number of issues under consideration by the finnish russian commission the possibility for communication outside the context of the annual meetings is very useful 2 5 implementation of decisions principle 2 2 effective mechanisms for cooperation of a joint body with national authorities and the availability of mechanisms to support the implementation of decisions one of the set objectives of the finnish swedish transboundary river commission is to promote cooperation between the authorities of the parties the 2010 agreement established the finnish swedish water management area according to the requirements of the wfd concrete measures to realise cooperation in the area are joint programmes and plans that authorities in finland and sweden are required to prepare article 4 the commission shall adopt or reject proposals for programmes or plans concerning the water management area article 10 in producing a joint international river basin management plan rbmp for the finnish norwegian river basin district the transboundary water commission must present its views in a coordinated manner on the preparation of the national river basin management plans article 5 in addition the involvement of the commission should be ensured in the exchange of information between competent national authorities mou 2013 the teno tana näätämö neiden and paatsjoki pasvik international river basin district extends to a limited extent across the border into russian territory unece 2011 it is worth noting that the finnish norwegian commission and authorities in both countries have sought cooperation with the russian authorities on matters concerning water management in the joint river basins in matters related to the river paatsjoki pasvik the murmansk regional environment authorities from russia work in cooperation with the finnish norwegian commission russia has participated in the work of the commission in the role of an observer and expert since 1991 4 for instance the russian authorities have partnered in the preparation of a multiple use plan for the river paatsjoki pasvik christiansen 2011 in addition an environmental status and a common monitoring and assessment programme for the paatsjoki pasvik area initiated by the commission has been compiled by russian finnish and norwegian environmental authorities and researchers supported by the murmansk regional environment authorities the pasvik programme is responsible for monitoring in a coordinated manner the state of the environment in the cross border area of finland norway and russia 4 this is a prime example of effective cooperation between national authorities facilitated by a joint water commission in the region national authorities in both countries are active participants in the work of the finnish russian commission the underlying agreement does not establish specific mechanisms for the involvement of national authorities but they cooperate with each other and with the commission exchanging information discussing regulatory measures etc in addition the commission s practice is to provide opinions to national authorities usually to those responsible for granting permits when they are dealing with cases that may have transboundary impacts kaatra 2012 in contrast to opinions the decisions of the commission are binding on both countries article 11 principle 2 6 coordination of activities with other joint bodies in the same catchment area as well as with relevant joint bodies established for preservation of the marine environment there has been discussion of the prospect of including norway in the cooperation relating to the management plan of the international water district in the torne river basin since a small part of the basin lies on the norwegian territory the water framework directive which lays down the obligation for member states to establish river basin districts prescribes that where a river basin extends outside the eu the relevant member state s must endeavour to establish appropriate cooperation with the relevant non member state article 3 however this requirement has not yet been operationalised under the finnish swedish management regime from a practical viewpoint appropriate cooperation in the field is already being carried out under the finnish norwegian regime moreover the area in question is so small that its practical significance is negligible within this context k kinnunen personal communication 13 october 2016 the finnish norwegian commission has been active in establishing cooperation and coordinating activities with the russian side of the basin however the cooperation has been between the commission and local authorities in russia not with a joint body in the same catchment area finland sweden and norway have been engaged in the unofficial trilateral working group for the harmonisation of the water framework directive in the north calotte region the goal of the project was to strengthen and coordinate cooperation between the three countries in working to implement the wfd in the north calotte region the three meetings that took place from 2011 to 2013 enabled the participants responsible for implementing the wfd in a transboundary context i e local authorities and the finnish swedish transboundary river commission to share their experiences concerning implementation of the wfd as well as to determine common areas of cooperation report of the trilateral working group 2013 there is no formal coordination between the finnish russian commission and the baltic marine environment protection commission helcom s rekolainen personal communication 13 october 2016 the work of the finnish russian commission concentrates on transboundary lakes rivers and streams 2 6 accountability transparency and public participation principle 2 1 effective accountability mechanisms for the joint bodies to ensure the implementation of their activities and obligations the finnish swedish and finnish norwegian commissions do not use specific accountability 5 dombrowsky 2007 has discussed options for maintaining accountability in the context of international organisations for water management when competencies are transferred from accountable governments the first viable option involves an accountability mechanism based on the representation of the states in the decision making arrangement this is expected to ensure that decisions taken by the joint body are acceptable to the state parties alternatively an accountability mechanism could be developed by establishing a direct link between the organisation joint body and the local population an additional complication is that public interest in a transboundary basin is not easy to define when for example upstream and downstream interests may differ considerably 5 or compliance mechanisms the former joint body shall monitor the application of the agreement and the permit practices article 10 and it has the right to bring a claim for rectifying a violation of a permit decision or rules or regulations issued by law or under it to a public authority for consideration in accordance with the national legislation article 11 the commission may also give statements in respect of relevant matters the finnish norwegian commission has general monitoring and supervision duties article 1 but they are not directly linked to compliance with the provisions of the agreement the finnish russian commission does not use any specific accountability mechanism to ensure the implementation of the agreement the lack of specific compliance mechanisms in finland s transboundary water agreements reflects the fact that effective and established cooperation is in place and it is not to be considered as a sign of ignorance of compliance problems under the regimes in the finnish setting a small number of parties are involved and they are in regular contact as a result of which any problems that arise can be addressed with ease principle 2 4 mechanisms for public participation and stakeholder involvement in the activities of the joint body are key appropriate tools for public participation and stakeholder involvement should be selected according to their purpose i e to identify stakeholders and interested public to notify inform or consult the stakeholders and the public or to take due account of their comments reflecting also the specific context and the objectives for a consistent provision of necessary funds to support public participation and stakeholder involvement it is important to institutionalize the mechanisms for participation of stakeholders and public drawing on the ece convention on access to information public participation in decision making and access to justice in environmental matters the following criteria should be taken into account for effective public participation and stakeholder involvement equity and inclusiveness accountability and transparency flexibility effectiveness and responsiveness the finnish swedish commission works in close cooperation with the municipalities entrepreneurs authorities and other actors in the river torne basin the information held by the commission is public with some limitations the 2010 agreement contains detailed regulation on access to documents held by the commission article 13 interestingly a voluntary water parliament was set up for the torne river in 2007 and it holds annual finnish swedish meetings the parliament is a forum for information exchange and cooperation regarding water issues between local authorities the frontier river commission and interest organisations experts and when necessary local residents can be heard at the meetings of the finnish norwegian commission article 5 it is an important and rather unusual feature of both nordic commissions that they deal with issues at a regional level and that the people affected by their policy making are heard or even represented as members or deputy members of the commissions k kinnunen personal communication 13 october 2016 the finnish russian commission receives information from and is party to initiatives to support and guide its work by non governmental organisations and private citizens kotkasaari 2008 in addition energy companies have been active in the work of the commission the involvement of frontier guards and energy companies in the commission s work has been an essential element in the cooperation between the countries in the border region and in matters related to the operation of hydropower plants kaatra 2012 in general as parties to the aarhus convention finland sweden and norway have obligations regarding the organisation of public participation in environmental decision making these obligations are also reflected in the regulation of the transboundary water commissions and the work they carry out 2 7 dispute resolution principle 2 5 use of neutral facilitators and external expertise in the process of initiating restarting a dialogue and cooperation both the finnish swedish and finnish norwegian transboundary water agreements state that disputes between parties concerning the application or interpretation of the agreement are to be settled by negotiation articles 6 and 30 or by other manner agreed by the parties in the case of the finnish swedish agreement neither agreement specifies whether the negotiations should involve the commissions the finnish russian regime lays down a mechanism that goes further than finland s agreements with sweden and norway and requires that any differences of opinion arising from the interpretation or application of the agreement that cannot be settled by the commission must be settled by a joint board comprising two members appointed by the governments of finland and russia respectively if the board fails to reach agreement the differences at issue are to be settled via the diplomatic channel article 19 this mechanism involves external facilitators in the process of solving disputes and illustrates the subtle role of the commission which was not designed as a dispute settlement body but rather as a cooperative body upon ratification of the water convention the parties may specify whether they would use the international court of justice or the water convention s dispute settlement mechanism to solve differences with parties concerning the interpretation or application of the convention article 22 more generally joint bodies often play a significant role in preventing and resolving conflicts among riparian states even in the absence of well established dispute resolution mechanisms the commissions usually have a good selection of tools 6 the tools of dispute prevention including monitoring dialogue and exchange of information and the tools of dispute resolution including negotiation mediation arbitration and resolution by the joint body 6 available to promote cooperation and trust among the parties and thus work towards reducing the likelihood of conflicts emerging and escalating see e g tir and stinnett 2012 extensive use of and heavy reliance on joint river basin organisations to perform the task of dispute prevention or to act as pragmatic conflict resolution facilitators is typical of different transboundary water regimes regardless of the region involved wouters 2003 this is understandable since these bodies have been established to promote cooperation and coordination among the riparian states and their members can usually be expected to be experts on issues concerning the regime 3 broader institutional perspectives on the transboundary water commissions of finland and its co riparians and the implications for water diplomacy 3 1 international experience several studies in the past decade have highlighted features relevant to the functioning and effectiveness of joint bodies in transboundary water management and have concluded that there is significant variation between them see e g schmeier 2013 lautze et al 2013 unece 2009 hooper 2006 kliot et al 2001 based on a global overview focusing on river basin organisations schmeier describes the effectiveness of river basin governance as depending on two main categories of factors 1 exogenous factors including the nature of the collective action problem and the constellation of actors and 2 endogenous factors of which she underlines the institutional design as being the one likely to matter the most schmeier 2013 unece has analysed joint bodies in transboundary water governance in terms of their structures and activities unece 2009 despite differences in contexts and cultures among others there is potential for joint bodies to share their experiences in addressing a wide range of issues in particular it would be worth evaluating the value in terms of water diplomacy of situations in which major differences that have emerged between parties have been resolved during long cooperation 3 2 structure of joint bodies and cooperation with national authorities review of joint bodies across europe has led to the conclusion that the achievement of continuity and effective implementation of decisions calls for joint commissions to have executive and working bodies in addition to a decision making body unece 2009 expert or working groups which have been established most commonly in coordination oriented river basin organisations are regarded as an important institutional design feature schmeier 2013 the work carried out by the finnish russian commission s working groups is set by issue or area of work e g integrated water management and fisheries the work of subsidiary bodies of a bilateral commission is also frequently organised by reference to a river basin the work of the finnish russian commission covers a large number of water bodies but their relative importance in terms of use and need for coordination is very different the work of the finnish swedish commission focuses on one major river basin whereas the finnish norwegian commission covers numerous boundary waters shared by the two countries the organisation of the finnish russian commission differs from the other two transboundary water commissions to which finland is a party from a water diplomacy angle both approaches appear to function well the issues that the finnish russian commission mostly deals with often require state level administrative measures and it is therefore appropriate that state representatives make decisions on them at the annual meetings of the commission the broad based memberships of the other two commissions enhance the legitimacy of their work and underline their expertise in local conditions in terms of regularity finland s joint commissions compare well with regional practice in europe many joint commissions meet at least annually even when contacts are also maintained through other means see e g unece 2009 against that background the finnish swedish commission can even be said to meet frequently overall all the commissions have regular meetings and carry out effective communication between the meetings holding meetings on a regular basis is important to ensure good working relationships and the exchange of up to date information within the commissions these qualities actively facilitate the practicing of environmental diplomacy in the regions in many cases multilateral river basin commissions in the pan european region include permanent secretariats which tend to be small and have rather limited staff when comparing globally european commission 2012b smaller secretariats often work better for coordination oriented basin organisations than for implementation oriented ones schmeier 2013 it is less common for bilateral commissions to have permanent joint secretariats since the provision of information is one of its tasks the office of the finnish swedish commission is likely to supplement the outreach offered to local stakeholders regional organisations provide the secretariats of the finnish norwegian commission with a consistent regional focus for their work in the case of the finnish russian commission secretariat support is provided as needed by each member country article 6 overall all three commissions are well supported they hold regular meetings and have effective secretariat functions a sound financial basis and easy access to local and scientific expertise this ensures that their work is effective and balanced and provides tools to deal with inter alia different areas of cooperation and uncertainties and different development needs in the joint water management furthermore long term cooperation institutions provide continuity when political changes occur with changing governments 3 3 scope and focus of work from the perspective of water diplomacy and the prevention of conflicts within shared river basins it is of the utmost importance that the waters subject to cooperation and joint management are defined clearly when all basin countries are equal members of the joint management body the body has a better chance to function effectively both from environmental or technical and political perspectives equal participation works towards enhancing fairness and the perceived ownership of the decisions and actions taken by the joint body the impacts of the real world power relations of the parties cannot perhaps be always totally overcome in line with the hydro hegemony thematic but the involvement of all basin states 7 sometimes it is sufficient that all major basin states are involved as parties in the cooperation a state that shares only a tiny part of the basin can be included as an observer in the treaty arrangement this is the case for example with norway in the finnish swedish transboundary rivers agreement 7 and representative participation in the work of the joint body is still very important in terms of the scope of work carried out the three joint commissions of finland cover a relatively broad range of issues the scope and focus of cooperation has however evolved to some degree over the decades influenced by legislative changes the wfd etc environmental protection has gradually received more attention which is logical as the agreements were initially concluded at a time when environmental concerns were less prominent and the related regulation less substantial timber floating which was previously an important economic activity relevant to the application of the finnish russian agreement has lost its importance finland s agreements with sweden and norway have had to be revised to ensure alignment with the wfd the original finnish russian agreement 1964 did not refer to hydropower or energy before the discharge rule of lake saimaa and the vuoksi river 1989 was adopted hence the legal basis has developed to address the challenge of optimising the flow regulation the discharges are adjusted supervised by the commission to achieve a balance between the requirements of hydropower production the mitigation of flood impacts and meeting environmental needs influenced by the coordination obligation laid down in the wfd river basin planning including related studies and consultations has become a prominent part of finland s institutional transboundary cooperation although the measures required by the wfd are promoted by finland in cooperation with russia the work of the two nordic commissions is much more far reaching due to the common basis harmonised legislation the same planning cycle classifications etc and has increasingly converged towards joint basin planning for the current cycle of planning 2015 2021 such flexibility or progressive evolution of the cooperation framework seems valuable for effectively addressing emerging issues on the basis of the rbmps of 2009 2015 the european union eu recommended that finland should extend the related international coordination with all its co riparian countries european commission 2012a the degree of international coordination and cooperation under the wfd has increased and the coordination arrangements including joint commissions have played a key role in the preparation of international rbmps coherent with their national counterparts however examples of rbmps coordinated with riparian countries that are not eu member states remain few in number the known examples are on the danube river basin and the sava river basin unece 2011 the nordic commissions effectiveness and dispute prevention capacity are not in practice significantly hindered by the fact that they do not issue decisions that are binding upon the parties there is a strong spirit of cooperation between the countries involved and their environmental legislations and practices are largely harmonised as a result of which the commissions planning and management activities do not require legally binding authority the finnish russian commission is of older origin the scope of its work including e g discharge issues that have notable effects on the parties is larger and the economic and other interests of the parties and stakeholders in the issues under regulation are often stronger and this fact underlines the importance of issuing legally binding decisions the broad competence of the joint management body is an asset in terms of the conduct of water diplomacy it allows the body to address a wide variety of issues that are felt by the parties to be important and also to address new and emerging issues that were perhaps not envisaged at the time of adoption of the original agreement this may help in preventing differences from emerging and addressing them among the member states generally a joint body s ability to deal with uncertainties incomplete knowledge or conflicting views among the parties is often critical in the face of these kinds of challenges it is invaluable for the joint management body to have broad competence as well as links to national and regional authorities for the implementation of the decisions it is worth bearing in mind that in practice water diplomacy is not limited to water cooperation but is also relevant to cooperation involving for instance energy trade and environmental issues a joint water commission that has competence in these areas can be a valuable institution for cooperation among the basin states beyond water the finnish norwegian commission has given its opinion on issues related to and impacting on water management such as construction and planning 3 4 work with national authorities accountability and coordination the implementation of decisions in transboundary water management is only possible through cooperation with the national authorities of the parties in this respect the representation of national authorities in the joint body and the means by which the joint body can draw upon national authorities capacities and inputs are crucial unece 2009 each joint body has a unique function in its region the relevant agreements specify the tasks of the joint bodies which often parallel or complement the functions and competencies of the national authorities of the parties bilateral commissions like those of finland with its co riparians do not have all the features of a full fledged basin organisation in its relations with different actors the work of the finnish russian commission is more at the level of central government although regional administration is also represented in the nordic commissions the emphasis is more on local issues this is reflected in their communication which is oriented more towards the regions and the local communities this approach is also reflected in the composition of the commissions it is clear that local links are also important in respect of the accountability of joint bodies the strong local dimension also ensures expertise in local matters relating to the waters subject to cooperation this is an interesting approach from the water diplomacy perspective however it is obviously a well functioning practice especially from the viewpoint of settling differences between the parties which provides tools at an early stage for the parties to prevent potential conflict situations from escalating even if not many different national authorities are always directly involved in the work of the commissions it is crucial that the joint bodies have access to such expertise when it is needed that is important for information management participation and the balancing of different interests the modality of representation and working with the regional authorities as well as stakeholders developed in the nordic commissions may merit attention in water diplomacy efforts it has distinct advantages but then again the issues may have less prominence at the national level therefore assessing the value for another context it needs to be taken into account how politicised water issues are 3 5 public participation and access to information various forms and mechanisms for public participation can be used by joint bodies the purpose of the work being carried out has a significant influence on the selection of the most appropriate tools to identify stakeholders and the interested public to notify inform or consult the stakeholders and the public and to take due account of their comments the relevant methods that may be used include granting observer status based on specific criteria and allowing for the submission of written enquiries the formulation of the unece principle 2 4 on public participation was informed by the aarhus convention which is referred to for guidance notably related to the interpretation of public participation and information related provisions of the water convention unece 2013 in particular it can be highlighted that regionalisation and participation of the local population are features that stand out in the work of the nordic commissions the implementation of the rbmps and the public consultations required by the processes have influenced the organisation of public participation within the context of nordic transboundary water cooperation the finnish norwegian commission has taken the indigenous sami population into account by the inclusion of a local member from the sami group the finnish russian commission is more concerned with national level coordination and extensions to participation are made to utilise specific expertise and include the private sector the finnish russian commission does not in particular communicate with the local population through a website as is the practice in the nordic commissions from the angle of water diplomacy effective stakeholder participation is a crucial feature of joint bodies in transboundary water governance by effective participation the authors of the present paper understand first and foremost the engagement of all relevant stakeholders in a way that is inclusive provides a variety of ways and channels of participation and the inputs of which are genuinely considered by the policy makers this understanding is in line with the provisions on public participation of the aarhus convention effective stakeholder participation in transboundary water management promotes transparency information sharing conflict prevention and management among others at the same time it is important to ensure that the work of the commissions is not too heavily or in an unbalanced way influenced by stakeholder interests 4 conclusions this paper has limited its analysis to those principles for effective joint bodies that principally concern the scope and organisation of the work carried out by such bodies as well as procedural aspects the principles which have been developed considering a broad range of joint bodies and decades of experience can be viewed as a kind of check list to accompany setting up or revisiting institutional arrangements to regularise and develop water cooperation the principles themselves have been formulated recently and published just before the finalization of the present paper and consequently not yet widely disseminated to serve as reference for states and actors in particular to inform initial reflection or shaping of cooperation in early stages this paper demonstrates the relevance of the principles but also reveals diversity in terms of how and to what degree they feature in practice in the framework of the cooperation arrangements analysed while evolved since then the legal bases and institutional frameworks for finland s transboundary cooperation predates the water convention and the principles for effective joint bodies making a comparison to the synthesis of wide international experience and good practice which the principles constitute interesting finland s cooperation in the management of transboundary waters is institutionally light and does not demonstrate all the features of the principles to a high degree in general the approaches taken in finland s cooperation arrangements indicate adaptation to local settings and needs this approach probably appropriate beyond the cooperation arrangements discussed here a customised cooperative and institutional structure is often the most effective in preventing friction building up and supporting finding mutually agreeable ways forward among the parties such an approach is apt to ensure that any differences that may turn into a source of friction are detected early on and that the resolution measures can be tailored to meet the specific circumstances in addition building of trust and the fact that the parties and stakeholders know each other well are also important for preventing and resolving conflicts within this setting it is interesting to note how e g the finnish swedish transboundary water cooperation has been able to contribute to so called de bordering processes despite the fact that the river torne has formed the state border for more than 200 years sallisalmi 2018 the active and participatory work of the finnish swedish commission has contributed to connecting local people on both sides of the border and encouraged them to act for the benefit of the border region in the management of the transboundary watershed the applied method of localisation of the conservation and management of the shared water basin has brought about many benefits to the transboundary cooperation built in trust in the relations between and within the commission and different stakeholders communication of both opposing and shared interests and goals development of joint strategies with stakeholders and the possibility for a more diversified dialogue to emerge on the development paths of the basin area ibid all these aspects are important for the maintenance and improvement of local and regional water security ensuring an enabling environment for productive activities that depend on water and they provide important lessons also for other transboundary freshwater regimes the scope of cooperation demonstrates a broad competency including different water uses as recommended by the principles gradual evolution can be observed in the work of the joint commissions which is still largely being carried out on the basis of agreements that go back decades demonstrating robustness in the face of societal political and economic changes in the case of the nordic commissions the coordination of river basin management planning has intensified and now extends to the preparation of joint river basin management plans for shared basins implementation of the wfd imposes a coordination obligation upon finland and sweden also on norway to some extent furthermore embeddedness in the eu regime and previous adoption of unece legal instruments have promoted harmonisation and accompanied the nordic countries into mature cooperation and joint management of their transboundary waters the convention has also provided a forum for sharing the nordic cooperation experience the scale and frequency of interaction with stakeholders is also an area where clear differences can be observed in some cases specific arrangements and mechanisms for participation of stakeholders and the public have been developed the water parliament in the river torne basin and the active participation of energy companies in the work of the finnish russian commission can be highlighted as examples the interests of states and stakeholders are taken into account in the work of all the commissions and water management issues are inextricably linked with cooperation over energy the environment etc the work of the commissions has had influence beyond water management for example on building regulations and on municipal planning as has been the case of the finnish norwegian commission the experience from work with stakeholders offers valuable lessons for joint bodies in respect of the effective promotion of water security and diplomacy within shared basins the impact dimension of the effectiveness of the joint bodies needs to be assessed in relation to the achievement of the commissions objectives to the extent to which these objectives have been explicitly stated and in relation to the amelioration of the problems or challenges that they were established to address several positive developments in relation to issues within the mandates of the nordic commissions have been observed for example the consistency of monitoring results has improved over time assisted by intercalibration efforts some improvement in water quality has also been observed unece 2011 the finnish russian commission oversees an agreed flow regulation arrangement and even discusses related compensation when appropriate involving different sectors and important economic interests these facts demonstrate some degree of advancement in the cooperation these findings show that institutionally relatively light cooperation in the management of transboundary waters can bring environmental benefits and at the same time support multi level governance from the water diplomacy perspective finland s joint commissions have a strong yet usually implicit emphasis on the prevention of conflicts only the finnish russian regime involves a more direct approach that also covers conflict resolution in terms of agreed procedures this approach is very much in line with the nature of the regimes which have been designed in particular contexts for specific needs the commissions in focus have addressed contentious issues of importance to the riparian countries and the regions in particular including flood risk management fishing rights and hydropower this suggests that there are likely transferable lessons about building trust and addressing various issues that are of value to water diplomacy beyond the region it seems that overall the use of experience from the cooperation discussed in this paper has so far been limited perhaps happening mainly through individuals nevertheless some sharing of the lessons has taken place through the water convention s platform 8 examples of such experience sharing include the water allocation in transboundary basins a global workshop on the status and good practices in geneva 16 17 october 2017 and the international symposium managing transboundary waters from policy to practice in hanoi 2 4 october 2016 where also the finnish experiences were presented and discussed 8 as russia s other bilateral agreements on transboundary waters are more recent than the one with finland unece 2011 the experience may have informed the development of russia s cooperation in other basins on other borders thorough assessment of the work done by the commissions and its impacts lies outside the scope of this paper nonetheless it is reasonable to infer that the manner in which the cooperation has been established and the exchange of information and coordination of actions it has facilitated has contributed to finland and its co riparians making significant progress in the management of transboundary waters while there is always room for improvement the current state of cooperation bodes well in the light of the unece principles for effective joint bodies
