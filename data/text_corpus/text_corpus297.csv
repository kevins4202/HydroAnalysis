1485,noble gases have been used for oil field exploration due to their partitioning behavior in oil water systems however their application to study sites contaminated with non aqueous phase liquids napl has been limited except for 222rn which has been traditionally used as a partitioning tracer for contaminated sites this study applied natural noble gas components such as 222rn he ne ar kr and xe to the characterization of a field site contaminated with trichloroethylene tce located in wonju korea groundwater at the site showed a maximum level of tce that exceeded 1000 μg l with an approximate average of 400 μg l indicating the presence of residual tce in the subsurface system even after remediation the traditional tracer i e 222rn was first used to characterize residual tce however its heterogeneous distribution throughout the fractured bedrock aquifer negated its usefulness as a tce indicator the use of radiogenic 4he was also limited by the wide distribution of radiogenic sources on the site by contrast changes in the tce level had clear effects on the conditions of other noble gases such as ne ar and xe making them useful for characterization of the tce contaminated site furthermore calculation of the tce water ratio including residual tce was achieved but identification of the tce originating from the vadose zone was relatively hard the results of this study indicate that based on their partitioning behavior naturally occurring noble gases can be used to delineate and quantify residual tce graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords noble gas residual trichloroethylene partitioning tracer non aqueous phase liquid contamination 222rn groundwater contamination 1 introduction trichloroethylene tce is universally used as a degreasing agent russell et al 1992 and is one of the most pervasive chlorinated compounds among industrial solvents corrupting groundwater kao and lei 2000 tce is a well known carcinogen and has toxic effects on the human nervous or reproductive systems chiu et al 2012 therefore korea has set a standard limit for tce concentrations in drinking water i e 0 03 mg l this is relatively high compared to the standard established by the environmental protection agency epa in the united states of america the epa standard for drinking water is 0 005 ppm and 0 03 ppm for groundwater that can affect indoor air monosson 2008 to manage a tce contaminated region understanding the extent of the contamination is important according to davis et al 2002 traditional sampling methods mainly include the direct sampling of water or soil however they were able to interrogate only a small volume of the aquifer as a representative which was insufficient for large scale contaminant regions davis et al 2002 to overcome this disadvantage some studies were performed using partitioning tracers such as hexanol injection istok et al 2002 and 222rn push pull test davis et al 2005 to cover large regions and accurately characterize the source and extent of tce contamination young et al 1999 an additional method called the partitioning interwell tracer test pitt uses the delay between two tracer signals to estimate napl quantity dridi et al 2009 hartog et al 2010 however pitt requires continuous sampling and provides information for a limited space between two test wells only when measurable connectivity is guaranteed between boreholes among the partitioning tracers noble gases are notable because their sources are relatively clear owing to their chemical inertness as chemical processes are not involved it is possible to interpret the fractionation or distribution of noble gases by only considering the physical changes such as temperature pressure and phase composition barry et al 2017 ju et al 2019 considering this advantage some previous studies used noble gases in oil or natural gas exploration barry et al 2017 and pinti and marty 1995 used noble gases as partitioning tracers to quantify the ratio of oil gas and water in a reservoir moreover zaikowski and spangler 1990 used the changes in the noble gas composition to predict gas production at a natural gas reservoir despite the history of noble gas use in the oil and natural gas industries the noble gas method has rarely been used to understand the distribution of the non aqueous phase liquid napl contamination i e tce in groundwater a lab scale investigation was conducted to evaluate the use of he and ne as partitioning tracers to quantify tce contamination of water saturated sand columns however the results were limited in that they only provided a basis for field scale applications divine et al 2003 this study was conducted at a test site located in the road administrative office rao wonju korea that historically had extensive tce contamination groundwater at the site showed maximum tce concentrations of over 1000 μg l with an approximate average of 400 μg l even after remediation including the pumping and treatment and soil flushing indicating the existence of residual tce in a subsurface system lee et al 2013 this site has been studied extensively using dual isotope data carbon and chlorine microbial community distribution and the tracer 222rn to understand tce distribution kaown et al 2014b lee et al 2015 yoon et al 2013 but the exact amount of residual tce has not yet been determined in this study the noble gas partitioning pattern between groundwater and tce was examined by analyzing the natural noble gases along with tce concentrations a traditional partitioning tracer i e 222rn and other noble gas tracers i e he ne ar kr and xe were used to understand the distribution of residual tce the purpose of this study is to determine whether noble gases are appropriate for identifying the source zone and estimating the degree of tce contamination in a contaminated field for further application of their partitioning nature this study also evaluated the relationship between noble gas components and seasonal variations related to water table fluctuations 2 study area the study area is in wonju city approximately 75 km east of seoul the capital of the republic of korea fig 1a the woosan industrial complex wic was formed in wonju city in 1970 and the rao of gangwon province is located in the western part of the wic fig 1b c previous studies found that various reagents were used for asphalt quality tests beginning from 1981 even though the exact names and quantities of the discarded solvents are unidentified tce is known to be the main contaminant in the test region yang et al 2012 the aquifer at the study site consists of soil and alluvial deposits with highly fractured bedrock lying underneath baek and lee 2011 yu et al 2006 the fractures in the bedrock facilitate the transport of radiogenic products to the alluvial deposit fig 1a is a geological map of wonju and the study site is located in the jurassic biotite granite region as rocks of granitic composition allow accumulation of radiogenic products in circulating groundwater high 4he and 222rn concentrations which are generated by radioactive decay were expected with respect to hydrology the study site shows water table fluctuations in accordance with seasonal changes fig 2 shows the change in water table level and rainfall rate at rao during the sampling period water levels monitored in all wells showed an increase during the test period among the four wells kdpw7 exhibited the highest fluctuation in water table level 1 56 m from 114 0 m a s l to 115 5 m a s l and kdmw1 exhibited the lowest fluctuation in water table level 1 07 m from 122 7 m a s l to 123 8 m a s l water levels increased following heavy rainfall from late august to early september 2018 and then decreased steadily until early october 3 material and methods 3 1 sample collection and analytical techniques groundwater was sampled from wells kdpw2 4 5 6 7 and kdmw1 and 8 at the wic region for he ne ar kr and xe analysis fig 1c once in august and in october 2018 these wells were selected because they are located in an area that was highly contaminated with tce lee et al 2015 yang and lee 2012 sampling dates were selected by examining real time groundwater level monitoring data for woosan dong wonju provided by the groundwater information management and service center gims http www gims go kr from the previous study by yang and lee 2012 and yang et al 2012 the wonju region exhibited tce concentrations that fluctuated with seasonal hydrological variations considering the relationship between the tce concentration and the water table fluctuation august 14 2018 and october 4 2018 were selected for sampling because they were the two points during the test period with the lowest and highest groundwater levels respectively moreover water level change data is from well kdmw1 kdpw2 4 and 7 logged by the ctd diver ctd diver eijkelkamp soil water netherlands water level data loggers were installed at wells in the main source zone kdmw1 kdpw2 kdpw4 and at a well with no pavement kdpw7 which is thought to exhibit greater changes in water level than wells located in paved regions groundwater samples were pumped from the well using a submersible and controllable quantitative pump mp1 van walt ltd england all samples were acquired after the readings temperature do ec tds salinity ph and orp on ysi ysi xylem usa in a multiparameter water quality sonde are equilibrated sampling was done at the depth in table 1 the sampling system for he ne ar kr and xe was designed to make the water flow within a polyethylene pe pipe and then into a flexible tube connected to a copper tube that was fixed on the steel rack with clamps at each end to avoid any contact with the atmosphere or other external sources aeschbach hertig and solomon 2013 fig 3 two sets of copper tubes on steel racks were set up to obtain duplicate samples to account for any errors during the procedures after ensuring that there were no air bubbles inside the pe pipes and the flexible tubing both valves were closed beginning with the downstream valve finally the clamps were tightened using a wrench the copper tubes were then removed from the rack with the clamps still tightly closed copper tube sampling method can preserve even the most vulnerable he content semi permanently for future analysis aeschbach hertig and solomon 2013 the copper tubes were then transported to the noble gas lab at the university of utah the usa for analysis aeschbach hertig and solomon 2013 solomon et al 2015 only the gas fractions in the groundwater samples were extracted for analysis each of the gas components he ne ar kr and xe was separated using saes getter technology and cryogenics the system was under high vacuum with rough pumps turbo pumps getters and ion pumps the university of utah 2020 finally the sample was placed in the quadrupole mass spectrometer rga 300 stanford research systems united states for analysis the reproducibility of this method was within 1 for he and 5 for the other noble gases manning et al 2005 solomon et al 2010 gas standards were measured to convert the output signals to concentrations standards were analyzed after each sample measurement to reflect the exact condition of the mass spectrometer which could be slightly different every day groundwater was sampled from a total of 53 wells for 222rn analysis fig 1b once in november 2010 the 53 wells included 28 wells from the rao site and 25 wells from the wic site the 222rn concentrations of each water sample were measured using 222rn and 220rn monitors rtm1688 2 sarad germany sampled groundwater was placed in a 500 ml air bubbling flask connected to the monitor in a closed air loop measurements were taken at 15 min intervals after which an equilibrium value was obtained and adjusted for the short half life of 222rn for tce analysis all samples from 2010 and 2018 were pumped from the well using a submersible and controllable quantitative pump mp1 van walt ltd england stored in 40 ml amber glass vials with no headspace all samples were analyzed on the same day using the varian saturn 2100 t gas chromatograph mass spectrometer at sangji university korea the error of tce analysis was less than 7 4 and on average 3 8 o and h isotopes were measured at the korea basic science institute kbsi using the stable isotope ratio mass spectrometer results were converted to δ notation relative to vienna standard mean ocean water v smow at a precision that was lower than 1 for both δ18o and δd 3 2 222rn partitioning to tce 222rn has a half life of 3 83 days and is continuously produced in an aquifer matrix by α decay of its parent nuclide 226ra as a part of the 238u decay chain due to its preferential uptake in residual napl 222rn has been used as a partitioning tracer for napl contamination in several studies davis et al 2002 schubert et al 2007 yang et al 2014 yoon et al 2013 hunkeler et al 1997 observed an approximate decrease of 40 in 222rn activity owing to diesel fuel contamination while 222rn concentration in napl free groundwater quickly reaches its equilibrium value depending on the minerals contained and the porosity of the matrix 222rn concentration in napl contaminated groundwater is reduced by the partitioning of 222rn to the napl yoon et al 2013 3 3 noble gas partitioning to tce like 222rn other noble gases also exhibit affinity for tce compared to water divine et al 2003 as there are no biochemical processes affecting concentration interactions between different fluid phases i e tce and water are reflected through their partitioned concentrations ballentine et al 2002 in calculating the degree of interaction whether the reacting system is open or closed is an important factor in a closed system where the amount of each phase is limited the noble gas concentration follows batch fractionation in an open system where the reacting phase is continuously removed and replenished the rayleigh equation governs the process the solubility of the noble gas in water and tce is required to understand both systems with respect to tce solubility divine et al 2003 only acquired the constants for he and ne at 20 c however the groundwater samples from the on site experiment of this study were 14 4 16 5 c and solubility of other noble gas components rather than he and ne is required therefore the solubility constant for heavy oil at 14 4 c which is representative of the napl species was used kharaka and specht 1988 the equations and constants used during the derivation are presented in appendix a 4 results and discussion 4 1 tce distribution from the groundwater analysis performed in 2010 and 2018 the tce source was found to be at the rao spreading to the wic region which is a plume area in decreased concentration fig 1b c the maximum tce concentration at the rao in november 2010 was 14 295 μg l with an average of 2754 μg l while in the wic region the maximum concentration was 657 μg l with an average of 140 μg l due to dilution during groundwater flow and biodegradation the tce concentration levels decreased after the remediation projects in 2013 lee et al 2013 however tce concentrations of a maximum 1376 μg l were detected from the investigation in 2018 table 2 fig 4 moreover seasonal variation of tce concentrations was observed owing to contact with residual tce yang and lee 2012 yang et al 2012 residual tce is present near the water table at the study site and when the water table rises from august to october it acts as a continuous source of tce elevating the dissolved tce concentration in october table 2 4 2 quantifying and allocating the tce source using 222rn as 222rn exhibits affinity toward napl a 222rn deficit occurs in groundwater with napl contamination because the 222rn dissolved in the groundwater partitions selectively into the napl in this study 222rn deficits were shown when the rao and wic sites were compared using a box whisker plot fig 5 the rao region shows slightly lower 222rn concentrations in the groundwater compared to the wic consistent with the fact that the tce source is in the rao region however the bar charts presenting the 222rn and tce data from each well show that samples from the rao source area that are supposed to yield a low 222rn concentration range due to tce contamination yield a wide distribution of 222rn concentrations specifically samples with tce concentrations that were lower than 5000 μg l yielded a 222rn concentration range of 2 bq l to 298 bq l making it difficult to understand a 10 m distance range and small scale tce contamination area in detail moreover linear regression was used to statistically assess whether the 222rn concentration was appropriate for understanding tce contamination at the study site fig 6 because the rao source region had a lot of data on noble gas only the samples obtained from the rao were plotted on the graph for comparison with the data for noble gases the coefficient of determination r2 of the linear regression line was 0 06 indicating a low correlation between 222rn and tce concentration this is thought to be due to local heterogeneity of 222rn over the study site the background concentration of 222rn was too heterogeneous to be clearly understood since it is affected by various conditions such as type of bedrock or distribution of fractures that create pathways for radiogenic sources yoon et al 2013 4 3 quantifying and allocating tce source using noble gases as noble gases are inert very few processes can change noble gas concentrations in groundwater excess air injection due to water table fluctuation radiogenic contributions and partitioning to tce are main factors affecting noble gas concentrations the most in this study site kulongoski and hilton 2012 to verify that tce contamination affected the noble gases in the groundwater at the study site noble gas concentrations except 222rn were compared with standards calculated using temperature and excess air conditions noble gases such as he ne ar kr and xe were converted into f notation eq 1 to clearly verify the effect of partitioning pinti and marty 1995 1 f i i a r sample i a r a s w in eq 1 i stands for the noble gas component the f factors for he ne ar kr and xe were first compared with calculated concentrations of air saturated water asw using the matlab based routine noble90 aeschbach hertig et al 1999 fig 7 asw samples were calculated for four conditions for temperatures of 14 4 and 16 5 c which are the highest and lowest noble gas temperatures ngt of the uncontaminated groundwater and for two excess air conditions 0 and 45 ne which are known to be the typical excess air ranges in nature gilfillan et al 2008 in fig 7 he kr and xe show clear variation exceeding the calculated natural range therefore it is appropriate to say that partitioning to tce influences the groundwater at the wic which is the source area among the noble gas components shown in fig 7 ne and xe were selected as parameters for further partitioning analysis ne and xe were selected because they exhibit the largest difference in napl solubility by choosing pairs with a large difference in solubility and normalizing with ar which has median solubility the noble gas components in the pair show opposite changing patterns when additional partitioning occurs despite these reasons he could not be used as a tracer for this study because 4he is influenced by radiogenic sources and the wonju region has many radiogenic sources that can affect 4he concentration other than tce contamination on the excess air corrected heexc plot of 3he and 4he fig 8 all samples obtained from the study area followed the radiogenic trajectory line rather than routes that showed the influence of terrigenic or tritiogenic sources aeschbach hertig et al 1998 the study site is in a region with jurassic granite as a bedrock granite is well known to have various radionuclides such as u and th which produce 4he as an α decay product in addition the granite located at the study site is highly fractured baek and lee 2011 yu et al 2006 allowing radiogenic 4he to move along and accumulate torgersen and o donnell 1991 therefore samples from the study site show a clear pattern of he distribution influenced by radiogenic sources heaton 1984 kaown et al 2014a a detailed explanation of the concepts underlying he source identification is presented in appendix b the f factors for the samples are plotted on an fne fxe graph with the calculated ideal partition lines of rayleigh partitioning and batch equilibrium as shown in fig 9 partitioning lines in both open and closed systems are drawn on the graph the numbers along the lines from 0 01 to 0 05 are tce water ratios existing at the partitioning system including residual tce from the distance to ideal lines samples could be divided into two groups samples that were close to the fractionation lines were obtained from wells kdpw 2 4 7 and kdmw 1 8 in group 1 and matched the ones with tce concentration over 150 μg l shown in table 2 therefore the source of tce contamination is shown to be near the wells in group 1 their location on the plot also implies tce volume in the system in this case total tce including residual tce that is not properly dissolved will be 0 02 0 03 relative to the groundwater volume when calculated with henry s constant for heavy oil points in the plot showing the least conformance to either of the fractionation lines represent group 2 samples these samples show that they are influenced by other mechanisms rather than partitioning to tce by comparing them with excess air influenced samples in cross symbols the group 2 samples appear to be influenced first by partitioning with a small amount of tce and later mostly diluted by the addition of excess air 4 4 effect of water level fluctuation on noble gas partitioning in wonju groundwater levels rise during the period ranging from august to october table 2 in kdpw 6 where the rise in water level was greatest the difference between the water levels in the two seasons was approximately 3 99 m according to manual measurement results rainfall at the study site is concentrated in summer and early fall in the year therefore this rise in water level was thought to be attributable to the infiltration of rainwater according to the o h isotope data groundwater in both sampling periods tends to follow the local meteoric water line lmwl in the wet season lee 1999 suggesting that most of the recharge took place during the wet season when intensive precipitation occurred fig 10 kaown et al 2014a despite the introduction of uncontaminated rainwater every test showed an increase in tce concentration in october table 2 this increase is relevant to the findings by yang and lee 2012 and yang et al 2012 which stated that tce concentration in the groundwater in the main source zone can be affected by residual tce in the lower unsaturated zone when the groundwater level rises samples from group 1 were plotted on fig 11 along with ideal batch equilibrium and rayleigh fractionation lines and divided into two groups according to their sampling date to find out whether noble gas can exhibit seasonal variation table 2 on the graph samples from each date show a similar distribution they are plotted at the point where tce water ratio is approximately 0 02 0 03 along the batch and rayleigh partitioning line noble gas distribution was supposed to shift toward rayleigh fractionation which stands for open system partitioning due to contact with residual tce however samples do not show a distinct shift with time this is thought to be because of the noble gas composition of tce in the vadose zone tce in the vadose zone has been exposed to the air in the unsaturated zone and reached the noble gas concentration of asw remained unchanged when introduced to the elevated groundwater 5 conclusion groundwater at the site yielded a maximum of over 1000 μg l and an average of approximately 400 μg l of tce even after remediation suggesting the existence of residual tce in the subsurface system to quantify the residual tce natural noble gases including 222rn were used at the study sites of the wic and the rao located in wonju he source distribution analysis was performed and the results indicate clear effects of radiogenic sources on the groundwater at the study site supporting the results regarding 222rn concentration upon studying the partitioning behavior of noble gases with tce based on rayleigh fractionation and batch equilibrium scenarios the tce water ratios at the test site were calculated to be 0 02 0 03 and the main source area was found to be near wells kdpw2 4 7 and kdmw1 and 8 in this study natural noble gases were found to be good tracers when gases with significant external origins e g radiogenic components were disregarded not only in lab scale experiments described in previous studies but also in this field scale study the atmospheric noble gases also varied according to recharge temperature and an excess amount of air i e excess ne of 45 in 14 4 16 5 c which demanded the minimum threshold for identifying tce contamination that is tce water ratio that exceeded 0 02 if excess air influx is higher than 45 ne and xe concentration shows a huge change with recharge temperature tce concentration should be high enough to show the partitioning behavior in addition to that noble gases were insufficient in reflecting the seasonal variations resulting from water table fluctuation necessitating the source identification tracer however noble gases were still effective in understanding the spatial distribution of tce with the approximate tce water ratios that exist at a test site including residual tce unlike the regional measurement of tce concentration using the traditional method to use 222rn as a direct tracer at a tce contaminated site the geology of the site should be studied to ensure radiogenic uniformity therefore the application of noble gas partitioning is proposed as a promising method of the field scale characterization of a tce contaminated site and further studies should pay greater attention to a background investigation and the solubility of noble gases in various temperature acknowledgments this work was supported by the national research foundation of korea nrf grant funded by the korea government msit nrf 2018r1c1b6007390

heavy oil and water the f value is often used to explain the partitioning behavior of noble gas in the oil and natural gas fields among the five components ar is used because of the mass dependent change in the solubility of noble gases ar has a median value of solubility to heavy oil among noble gas components prinzhofer 2013 and by normalizing solubility with ar heavier components with higher solubility to heavy oil show positive change when partitioned to more soluble substances and lighter components such as he and ne will show negative change clearly showing the effect of partitioning

in groundwater because of its distinctive isotopic signatures kulongoski and hilton 2012 he concentrations in groundwater are expected to be at solubility equilibrium however they tend to exceed the equilibrium value due to radiogenic production and release of he from aquifer material into contacting pore waters the evolution of groundwater from its recharge conditions is often identified using a he isotope plot with an excess air corrected ratio of 3he and 4he aeschbach hertig et al 1998 kulongoski and hilton 2012 this method is widely used in various sites around the world kaown et al 2014a koh et al 2006 kulongoski et al 2008 the total he concentration in the sample is separated into equilibrated and exceeding concentrations using noble90 for this plot aeschbach hertig et al 1999 there are several excess air models in noble90 to calculate noble gas concentrations in groundwater measured noble gas concentrations are then fitted with the aforementioned excess air models via noble90 to calculate the equilibrium and excess concentration the result with a minimum χ2 chi square is selected for the plotting of a 3hetot 3heexc 4hetot 4heexc to 4heeq 4hetot 4heexc graph for he source identification hetot stands for total he concentration in the sample and heexc stands for the excess air component of he the x and y axis of the plot are the excess air corrected 4he and excess air corrected ratio of 3he and 4he respectively the he concentration in the groundwater sample consists of air equilibrated he heeq excess air derived he heexc terrigenic he which originates mainly from solid earth including the rock medium within which the groundwater is located for both he components and the radioactive decay of tritium in the water for 3he aeschbach hertig et al 1998 therefore by calculating the excess air derived he using noble90 the effect of non atmospheric sources such as terrigenic radiogenic and tritiogenic 3he can be verified this plot clearly shows the share of each component making it easier to determine the dominant process that affects the groundwater systems from recharge conditions notable references to add in this plot are the evolutionary trajectory line that crosses air saturated water asw with y axis intercept as 0 02ra representing the addition of radiogenic he to asw and the addition of tritiogenic 3he 3he 4he kulongoski and hilton 2012 if sample plots follow the reference line the effect of radiogenic crustal 4he or the addition of tritiogenic 3he respectively is shown 
1485,noble gases have been used for oil field exploration due to their partitioning behavior in oil water systems however their application to study sites contaminated with non aqueous phase liquids napl has been limited except for 222rn which has been traditionally used as a partitioning tracer for contaminated sites this study applied natural noble gas components such as 222rn he ne ar kr and xe to the characterization of a field site contaminated with trichloroethylene tce located in wonju korea groundwater at the site showed a maximum level of tce that exceeded 1000 μg l with an approximate average of 400 μg l indicating the presence of residual tce in the subsurface system even after remediation the traditional tracer i e 222rn was first used to characterize residual tce however its heterogeneous distribution throughout the fractured bedrock aquifer negated its usefulness as a tce indicator the use of radiogenic 4he was also limited by the wide distribution of radiogenic sources on the site by contrast changes in the tce level had clear effects on the conditions of other noble gases such as ne ar and xe making them useful for characterization of the tce contaminated site furthermore calculation of the tce water ratio including residual tce was achieved but identification of the tce originating from the vadose zone was relatively hard the results of this study indicate that based on their partitioning behavior naturally occurring noble gases can be used to delineate and quantify residual tce graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords noble gas residual trichloroethylene partitioning tracer non aqueous phase liquid contamination 222rn groundwater contamination 1 introduction trichloroethylene tce is universally used as a degreasing agent russell et al 1992 and is one of the most pervasive chlorinated compounds among industrial solvents corrupting groundwater kao and lei 2000 tce is a well known carcinogen and has toxic effects on the human nervous or reproductive systems chiu et al 2012 therefore korea has set a standard limit for tce concentrations in drinking water i e 0 03 mg l this is relatively high compared to the standard established by the environmental protection agency epa in the united states of america the epa standard for drinking water is 0 005 ppm and 0 03 ppm for groundwater that can affect indoor air monosson 2008 to manage a tce contaminated region understanding the extent of the contamination is important according to davis et al 2002 traditional sampling methods mainly include the direct sampling of water or soil however they were able to interrogate only a small volume of the aquifer as a representative which was insufficient for large scale contaminant regions davis et al 2002 to overcome this disadvantage some studies were performed using partitioning tracers such as hexanol injection istok et al 2002 and 222rn push pull test davis et al 2005 to cover large regions and accurately characterize the source and extent of tce contamination young et al 1999 an additional method called the partitioning interwell tracer test pitt uses the delay between two tracer signals to estimate napl quantity dridi et al 2009 hartog et al 2010 however pitt requires continuous sampling and provides information for a limited space between two test wells only when measurable connectivity is guaranteed between boreholes among the partitioning tracers noble gases are notable because their sources are relatively clear owing to their chemical inertness as chemical processes are not involved it is possible to interpret the fractionation or distribution of noble gases by only considering the physical changes such as temperature pressure and phase composition barry et al 2017 ju et al 2019 considering this advantage some previous studies used noble gases in oil or natural gas exploration barry et al 2017 and pinti and marty 1995 used noble gases as partitioning tracers to quantify the ratio of oil gas and water in a reservoir moreover zaikowski and spangler 1990 used the changes in the noble gas composition to predict gas production at a natural gas reservoir despite the history of noble gas use in the oil and natural gas industries the noble gas method has rarely been used to understand the distribution of the non aqueous phase liquid napl contamination i e tce in groundwater a lab scale investigation was conducted to evaluate the use of he and ne as partitioning tracers to quantify tce contamination of water saturated sand columns however the results were limited in that they only provided a basis for field scale applications divine et al 2003 this study was conducted at a test site located in the road administrative office rao wonju korea that historically had extensive tce contamination groundwater at the site showed maximum tce concentrations of over 1000 μg l with an approximate average of 400 μg l even after remediation including the pumping and treatment and soil flushing indicating the existence of residual tce in a subsurface system lee et al 2013 this site has been studied extensively using dual isotope data carbon and chlorine microbial community distribution and the tracer 222rn to understand tce distribution kaown et al 2014b lee et al 2015 yoon et al 2013 but the exact amount of residual tce has not yet been determined in this study the noble gas partitioning pattern between groundwater and tce was examined by analyzing the natural noble gases along with tce concentrations a traditional partitioning tracer i e 222rn and other noble gas tracers i e he ne ar kr and xe were used to understand the distribution of residual tce the purpose of this study is to determine whether noble gases are appropriate for identifying the source zone and estimating the degree of tce contamination in a contaminated field for further application of their partitioning nature this study also evaluated the relationship between noble gas components and seasonal variations related to water table fluctuations 2 study area the study area is in wonju city approximately 75 km east of seoul the capital of the republic of korea fig 1a the woosan industrial complex wic was formed in wonju city in 1970 and the rao of gangwon province is located in the western part of the wic fig 1b c previous studies found that various reagents were used for asphalt quality tests beginning from 1981 even though the exact names and quantities of the discarded solvents are unidentified tce is known to be the main contaminant in the test region yang et al 2012 the aquifer at the study site consists of soil and alluvial deposits with highly fractured bedrock lying underneath baek and lee 2011 yu et al 2006 the fractures in the bedrock facilitate the transport of radiogenic products to the alluvial deposit fig 1a is a geological map of wonju and the study site is located in the jurassic biotite granite region as rocks of granitic composition allow accumulation of radiogenic products in circulating groundwater high 4he and 222rn concentrations which are generated by radioactive decay were expected with respect to hydrology the study site shows water table fluctuations in accordance with seasonal changes fig 2 shows the change in water table level and rainfall rate at rao during the sampling period water levels monitored in all wells showed an increase during the test period among the four wells kdpw7 exhibited the highest fluctuation in water table level 1 56 m from 114 0 m a s l to 115 5 m a s l and kdmw1 exhibited the lowest fluctuation in water table level 1 07 m from 122 7 m a s l to 123 8 m a s l water levels increased following heavy rainfall from late august to early september 2018 and then decreased steadily until early october 3 material and methods 3 1 sample collection and analytical techniques groundwater was sampled from wells kdpw2 4 5 6 7 and kdmw1 and 8 at the wic region for he ne ar kr and xe analysis fig 1c once in august and in october 2018 these wells were selected because they are located in an area that was highly contaminated with tce lee et al 2015 yang and lee 2012 sampling dates were selected by examining real time groundwater level monitoring data for woosan dong wonju provided by the groundwater information management and service center gims http www gims go kr from the previous study by yang and lee 2012 and yang et al 2012 the wonju region exhibited tce concentrations that fluctuated with seasonal hydrological variations considering the relationship between the tce concentration and the water table fluctuation august 14 2018 and october 4 2018 were selected for sampling because they were the two points during the test period with the lowest and highest groundwater levels respectively moreover water level change data is from well kdmw1 kdpw2 4 and 7 logged by the ctd diver ctd diver eijkelkamp soil water netherlands water level data loggers were installed at wells in the main source zone kdmw1 kdpw2 kdpw4 and at a well with no pavement kdpw7 which is thought to exhibit greater changes in water level than wells located in paved regions groundwater samples were pumped from the well using a submersible and controllable quantitative pump mp1 van walt ltd england all samples were acquired after the readings temperature do ec tds salinity ph and orp on ysi ysi xylem usa in a multiparameter water quality sonde are equilibrated sampling was done at the depth in table 1 the sampling system for he ne ar kr and xe was designed to make the water flow within a polyethylene pe pipe and then into a flexible tube connected to a copper tube that was fixed on the steel rack with clamps at each end to avoid any contact with the atmosphere or other external sources aeschbach hertig and solomon 2013 fig 3 two sets of copper tubes on steel racks were set up to obtain duplicate samples to account for any errors during the procedures after ensuring that there were no air bubbles inside the pe pipes and the flexible tubing both valves were closed beginning with the downstream valve finally the clamps were tightened using a wrench the copper tubes were then removed from the rack with the clamps still tightly closed copper tube sampling method can preserve even the most vulnerable he content semi permanently for future analysis aeschbach hertig and solomon 2013 the copper tubes were then transported to the noble gas lab at the university of utah the usa for analysis aeschbach hertig and solomon 2013 solomon et al 2015 only the gas fractions in the groundwater samples were extracted for analysis each of the gas components he ne ar kr and xe was separated using saes getter technology and cryogenics the system was under high vacuum with rough pumps turbo pumps getters and ion pumps the university of utah 2020 finally the sample was placed in the quadrupole mass spectrometer rga 300 stanford research systems united states for analysis the reproducibility of this method was within 1 for he and 5 for the other noble gases manning et al 2005 solomon et al 2010 gas standards were measured to convert the output signals to concentrations standards were analyzed after each sample measurement to reflect the exact condition of the mass spectrometer which could be slightly different every day groundwater was sampled from a total of 53 wells for 222rn analysis fig 1b once in november 2010 the 53 wells included 28 wells from the rao site and 25 wells from the wic site the 222rn concentrations of each water sample were measured using 222rn and 220rn monitors rtm1688 2 sarad germany sampled groundwater was placed in a 500 ml air bubbling flask connected to the monitor in a closed air loop measurements were taken at 15 min intervals after which an equilibrium value was obtained and adjusted for the short half life of 222rn for tce analysis all samples from 2010 and 2018 were pumped from the well using a submersible and controllable quantitative pump mp1 van walt ltd england stored in 40 ml amber glass vials with no headspace all samples were analyzed on the same day using the varian saturn 2100 t gas chromatograph mass spectrometer at sangji university korea the error of tce analysis was less than 7 4 and on average 3 8 o and h isotopes were measured at the korea basic science institute kbsi using the stable isotope ratio mass spectrometer results were converted to δ notation relative to vienna standard mean ocean water v smow at a precision that was lower than 1 for both δ18o and δd 3 2 222rn partitioning to tce 222rn has a half life of 3 83 days and is continuously produced in an aquifer matrix by α decay of its parent nuclide 226ra as a part of the 238u decay chain due to its preferential uptake in residual napl 222rn has been used as a partitioning tracer for napl contamination in several studies davis et al 2002 schubert et al 2007 yang et al 2014 yoon et al 2013 hunkeler et al 1997 observed an approximate decrease of 40 in 222rn activity owing to diesel fuel contamination while 222rn concentration in napl free groundwater quickly reaches its equilibrium value depending on the minerals contained and the porosity of the matrix 222rn concentration in napl contaminated groundwater is reduced by the partitioning of 222rn to the napl yoon et al 2013 3 3 noble gas partitioning to tce like 222rn other noble gases also exhibit affinity for tce compared to water divine et al 2003 as there are no biochemical processes affecting concentration interactions between different fluid phases i e tce and water are reflected through their partitioned concentrations ballentine et al 2002 in calculating the degree of interaction whether the reacting system is open or closed is an important factor in a closed system where the amount of each phase is limited the noble gas concentration follows batch fractionation in an open system where the reacting phase is continuously removed and replenished the rayleigh equation governs the process the solubility of the noble gas in water and tce is required to understand both systems with respect to tce solubility divine et al 2003 only acquired the constants for he and ne at 20 c however the groundwater samples from the on site experiment of this study were 14 4 16 5 c and solubility of other noble gas components rather than he and ne is required therefore the solubility constant for heavy oil at 14 4 c which is representative of the napl species was used kharaka and specht 1988 the equations and constants used during the derivation are presented in appendix a 4 results and discussion 4 1 tce distribution from the groundwater analysis performed in 2010 and 2018 the tce source was found to be at the rao spreading to the wic region which is a plume area in decreased concentration fig 1b c the maximum tce concentration at the rao in november 2010 was 14 295 μg l with an average of 2754 μg l while in the wic region the maximum concentration was 657 μg l with an average of 140 μg l due to dilution during groundwater flow and biodegradation the tce concentration levels decreased after the remediation projects in 2013 lee et al 2013 however tce concentrations of a maximum 1376 μg l were detected from the investigation in 2018 table 2 fig 4 moreover seasonal variation of tce concentrations was observed owing to contact with residual tce yang and lee 2012 yang et al 2012 residual tce is present near the water table at the study site and when the water table rises from august to october it acts as a continuous source of tce elevating the dissolved tce concentration in october table 2 4 2 quantifying and allocating the tce source using 222rn as 222rn exhibits affinity toward napl a 222rn deficit occurs in groundwater with napl contamination because the 222rn dissolved in the groundwater partitions selectively into the napl in this study 222rn deficits were shown when the rao and wic sites were compared using a box whisker plot fig 5 the rao region shows slightly lower 222rn concentrations in the groundwater compared to the wic consistent with the fact that the tce source is in the rao region however the bar charts presenting the 222rn and tce data from each well show that samples from the rao source area that are supposed to yield a low 222rn concentration range due to tce contamination yield a wide distribution of 222rn concentrations specifically samples with tce concentrations that were lower than 5000 μg l yielded a 222rn concentration range of 2 bq l to 298 bq l making it difficult to understand a 10 m distance range and small scale tce contamination area in detail moreover linear regression was used to statistically assess whether the 222rn concentration was appropriate for understanding tce contamination at the study site fig 6 because the rao source region had a lot of data on noble gas only the samples obtained from the rao were plotted on the graph for comparison with the data for noble gases the coefficient of determination r2 of the linear regression line was 0 06 indicating a low correlation between 222rn and tce concentration this is thought to be due to local heterogeneity of 222rn over the study site the background concentration of 222rn was too heterogeneous to be clearly understood since it is affected by various conditions such as type of bedrock or distribution of fractures that create pathways for radiogenic sources yoon et al 2013 4 3 quantifying and allocating tce source using noble gases as noble gases are inert very few processes can change noble gas concentrations in groundwater excess air injection due to water table fluctuation radiogenic contributions and partitioning to tce are main factors affecting noble gas concentrations the most in this study site kulongoski and hilton 2012 to verify that tce contamination affected the noble gases in the groundwater at the study site noble gas concentrations except 222rn were compared with standards calculated using temperature and excess air conditions noble gases such as he ne ar kr and xe were converted into f notation eq 1 to clearly verify the effect of partitioning pinti and marty 1995 1 f i i a r sample i a r a s w in eq 1 i stands for the noble gas component the f factors for he ne ar kr and xe were first compared with calculated concentrations of air saturated water asw using the matlab based routine noble90 aeschbach hertig et al 1999 fig 7 asw samples were calculated for four conditions for temperatures of 14 4 and 16 5 c which are the highest and lowest noble gas temperatures ngt of the uncontaminated groundwater and for two excess air conditions 0 and 45 ne which are known to be the typical excess air ranges in nature gilfillan et al 2008 in fig 7 he kr and xe show clear variation exceeding the calculated natural range therefore it is appropriate to say that partitioning to tce influences the groundwater at the wic which is the source area among the noble gas components shown in fig 7 ne and xe were selected as parameters for further partitioning analysis ne and xe were selected because they exhibit the largest difference in napl solubility by choosing pairs with a large difference in solubility and normalizing with ar which has median solubility the noble gas components in the pair show opposite changing patterns when additional partitioning occurs despite these reasons he could not be used as a tracer for this study because 4he is influenced by radiogenic sources and the wonju region has many radiogenic sources that can affect 4he concentration other than tce contamination on the excess air corrected heexc plot of 3he and 4he fig 8 all samples obtained from the study area followed the radiogenic trajectory line rather than routes that showed the influence of terrigenic or tritiogenic sources aeschbach hertig et al 1998 the study site is in a region with jurassic granite as a bedrock granite is well known to have various radionuclides such as u and th which produce 4he as an α decay product in addition the granite located at the study site is highly fractured baek and lee 2011 yu et al 2006 allowing radiogenic 4he to move along and accumulate torgersen and o donnell 1991 therefore samples from the study site show a clear pattern of he distribution influenced by radiogenic sources heaton 1984 kaown et al 2014a a detailed explanation of the concepts underlying he source identification is presented in appendix b the f factors for the samples are plotted on an fne fxe graph with the calculated ideal partition lines of rayleigh partitioning and batch equilibrium as shown in fig 9 partitioning lines in both open and closed systems are drawn on the graph the numbers along the lines from 0 01 to 0 05 are tce water ratios existing at the partitioning system including residual tce from the distance to ideal lines samples could be divided into two groups samples that were close to the fractionation lines were obtained from wells kdpw 2 4 7 and kdmw 1 8 in group 1 and matched the ones with tce concentration over 150 μg l shown in table 2 therefore the source of tce contamination is shown to be near the wells in group 1 their location on the plot also implies tce volume in the system in this case total tce including residual tce that is not properly dissolved will be 0 02 0 03 relative to the groundwater volume when calculated with henry s constant for heavy oil points in the plot showing the least conformance to either of the fractionation lines represent group 2 samples these samples show that they are influenced by other mechanisms rather than partitioning to tce by comparing them with excess air influenced samples in cross symbols the group 2 samples appear to be influenced first by partitioning with a small amount of tce and later mostly diluted by the addition of excess air 4 4 effect of water level fluctuation on noble gas partitioning in wonju groundwater levels rise during the period ranging from august to october table 2 in kdpw 6 where the rise in water level was greatest the difference between the water levels in the two seasons was approximately 3 99 m according to manual measurement results rainfall at the study site is concentrated in summer and early fall in the year therefore this rise in water level was thought to be attributable to the infiltration of rainwater according to the o h isotope data groundwater in both sampling periods tends to follow the local meteoric water line lmwl in the wet season lee 1999 suggesting that most of the recharge took place during the wet season when intensive precipitation occurred fig 10 kaown et al 2014a despite the introduction of uncontaminated rainwater every test showed an increase in tce concentration in october table 2 this increase is relevant to the findings by yang and lee 2012 and yang et al 2012 which stated that tce concentration in the groundwater in the main source zone can be affected by residual tce in the lower unsaturated zone when the groundwater level rises samples from group 1 were plotted on fig 11 along with ideal batch equilibrium and rayleigh fractionation lines and divided into two groups according to their sampling date to find out whether noble gas can exhibit seasonal variation table 2 on the graph samples from each date show a similar distribution they are plotted at the point where tce water ratio is approximately 0 02 0 03 along the batch and rayleigh partitioning line noble gas distribution was supposed to shift toward rayleigh fractionation which stands for open system partitioning due to contact with residual tce however samples do not show a distinct shift with time this is thought to be because of the noble gas composition of tce in the vadose zone tce in the vadose zone has been exposed to the air in the unsaturated zone and reached the noble gas concentration of asw remained unchanged when introduced to the elevated groundwater 5 conclusion groundwater at the site yielded a maximum of over 1000 μg l and an average of approximately 400 μg l of tce even after remediation suggesting the existence of residual tce in the subsurface system to quantify the residual tce natural noble gases including 222rn were used at the study sites of the wic and the rao located in wonju he source distribution analysis was performed and the results indicate clear effects of radiogenic sources on the groundwater at the study site supporting the results regarding 222rn concentration upon studying the partitioning behavior of noble gases with tce based on rayleigh fractionation and batch equilibrium scenarios the tce water ratios at the test site were calculated to be 0 02 0 03 and the main source area was found to be near wells kdpw2 4 7 and kdmw1 and 8 in this study natural noble gases were found to be good tracers when gases with significant external origins e g radiogenic components were disregarded not only in lab scale experiments described in previous studies but also in this field scale study the atmospheric noble gases also varied according to recharge temperature and an excess amount of air i e excess ne of 45 in 14 4 16 5 c which demanded the minimum threshold for identifying tce contamination that is tce water ratio that exceeded 0 02 if excess air influx is higher than 45 ne and xe concentration shows a huge change with recharge temperature tce concentration should be high enough to show the partitioning behavior in addition to that noble gases were insufficient in reflecting the seasonal variations resulting from water table fluctuation necessitating the source identification tracer however noble gases were still effective in understanding the spatial distribution of tce with the approximate tce water ratios that exist at a test site including residual tce unlike the regional measurement of tce concentration using the traditional method to use 222rn as a direct tracer at a tce contaminated site the geology of the site should be studied to ensure radiogenic uniformity therefore the application of noble gas partitioning is proposed as a promising method of the field scale characterization of a tce contaminated site and further studies should pay greater attention to a background investigation and the

heavy oil and water the f value is often used to explain the partitioning behavior of noble gas in the oil and natural gas fields among the five components ar is used because of the mass dependent change in the solubility of noble gases ar has a median value of solubility to heavy oil among noble gas components prinzhofer 2013 and by normalizing solubility with ar heavier components with higher solubility to heavy oil show positive change when partitioned to more soluble substances and lighter components such as he and ne will show negative change clearly showing the effect of partitioning

in groundwater because of its distinctive isotopic signatures kulongoski and hilton 2012 he concentrations in groundwater are expected to be at solubility equilibrium however they tend to exceed the equilibrium value due to radiogenic production and release of he from aquifer material into contacting pore waters the evolution of groundwater from its recharge conditions is often identified using a he isotope plot with an excess air corrected ratio of 3he and 4he aeschbach hertig et al 1998 kulongoski and hilton 2012 this method is widely used in various sites around the world kaown et al 2014a koh et al 2006 kulongoski et al 2008 the total he concentration in the sample is separated into equilibrated and exceeding concentrations using noble90 for this plot aeschbach hertig et al 1999 there are several excess air models in noble90 to calculate noble gas concentrations in groundwater measured noble gas concentrations are then fitted with the aforementioned excess air models via noble90 to calculate the equilibrium and excess concentration the result with a minimum χ2 chi square is selected for the plotting of a 3hetot 3heexc 4hetot 4heexc to 4heeq 4hetot 4heexc graph for he source identification hetot stands for total he concentration in the sample and heexc stands for the excess air component of he the x and y axis of the plot are the excess air corrected 4he and excess air corrected ratio of 3he and 4he respectively the he concentration in the groundwater sample consists of air equilibrated he heeq excess air derived he heexc terrigenic he which originates mainly from solid earth including the rock medium within which the groundwater is located for both he components and the radioactive decay of tritium in the water for 3he aeschbach hertig et al 1998 therefore by calculating the excess air derived he using noble90 the effect of non atmospheric sources such as terrigenic radiogenic and tritiogenic 3he can be verified this plot clearly shows the share of each component making it easier to determine the dominant process that affects the groundwater systems from recharge conditions notable references to add in this plot are the evolutionary trajectory line that crosses air saturated water asw with y axis intercept as 0 02ra representing the addition of radiogenic he to asw and the addition of tritiogenic 3he 3he 4he kulongoski and hilton 2012 if sample plots follow the reference line the effect of radiogenic crustal 4he or the addition of tritiogenic 3he respectively is shown 
1486,cadmium cd pollution in soil has attracted more attention recently for its high toxicity and easy accumulation in crops this study aims to investigate the mechanisms governing the transport behavior of cd and to simulate and predict the long term migration of cd in different paddy soil layers therefore a layer by layer lbl model based on the geochemical model phreeqc was developed a dual porosity finite difference method was applied to model the two region diffusion process the solute transport parameters were obtained by field measurement literature review or inversely estimation using phreeqc based on the experimental results modeling and experimental results both indicate that different mechanisms cation exchange reaction preferential flow etc control the transport and vertical distribution of cd the prediction results show that only the surface soil 0 3 m would pose the risk of cd2 pollution the coupled lbl model could correctly simulate the migration of cd under near field conditions graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords cadmium coupled model reactive transport layered paddy soil phreeqc 1 introduction cadmium cd pollution is of great concern in

understand the processes that affect the migration of cd in the paddy soil huang et al 2015 especially long term knowledge of the distribution of cd in different soil layers is crucial for controlling nonpoint source pollution rao et al 2018 the transport of heavy metals i e cd2 in the soil has been investigated for several decades lei et al 2010 pueyo et al 2003 different conclusions have been drawn about the risk of heavy metals leaching into groundwater through paddy soil chen et al 2010 huang et al 2015 teng et al 2015 however most studies have not considered the heterogeneity of paddy soil and the resulting migration behavior of heavy metals between different soil layers xu et al 2013 xu et al 2014 the primary source of the heterogeneity in solutes distribution is related to morphological chemical and ecological variability at various soil layers a typical paddy soil profile includes three distinct layers surface puddled layer middle consolidated layer and bottom undisturbed soil wopereis et al 1992 much higher bulk density and lower saturated hydraulic conductivity are the distinct characteristics of the surface puddled layer while the layers below the surface soil are generally more porous than it patil et al 2011 recent studies have shown that the difference in the geometric structure of the structural pore network may significantly affect the transport of cd in the soil cd could be leached by preferential flow or transport through macro structures such as cracks worm holes and plant root channels the studies found that preferential flow can significantly increase the longitudinal mobility and speed of cd in soil nimmo 2012 seyfried and rao 1987 the effects of preferential flow can be particularly dramatic beneath the puddled layer which consists of a mobile region through which solutes preferentially pass and an immobile region with the negligible flow velocity rezanezhad et al 2016 another factor that enhances cd mobility is the binding of cd to organic ligands or colloids particularly in soils with a high content of dissolved organic carbons docs and oxide minerals loganathan et al 2012 organic matters and minerals in the puddled layer often reduce the leaching potential of the solute through adsorption processes such as exchange and surface complexation reactions sauer and daniel 1987 for example halim et al 2015 found that organic matter reduces the cd accumulation in straws and roots of rice through adsorbing or forming the stable complexes with cd it is also found that organic acids exist as negative anions which could complex with cd ions and immobilize cd in soil thereby reducing the mobility of cd li et al 2017 becher 1991 found that in the lower density soil layer with coarser pores the exchange process is faster moreover it has been shown that an increase in the charge of background cations ca2 mg2 k na etc reduces the sorption of targeted cation such as cd2 to soil exchange sites naidu et al 2010 generally solute transport in paddy fields involves relatively complex processes however observation and evaluation under field conditions is extraordinarily difficult costly and time consuming li et al 2014 reactive transport modeling using the phreeqc program has been proved to be an efficient method for simulating aqueous speciation reaction path and 1 d reactive transport marsac et al 2011 sprocati et al 2019 zhang et al 2017 this is partly due to that the program allows users to describe rate equations via basic scripts these scripts are then run with the program along with other parts of input files and databases for kinetic model simulations zhang et al 2019 besides the program contains several classical models such as ddl diffuse double layer model dzombak and morel 1990 cd music model charge distribution multisite complexation hiemstra and van riemsdijk 1996 and debye hückel model nowotny and rekas 1989 etc to describe the surface complexation and ion exchange reactions in soil in this study a layer by layer lbl reactive transport model based on the geochemical model phreeqc has been developed to investigate the mechanisms governing the heterogeneous vertical distribution of cd as well as transport behavior in different paddy soil layers the soil unit was conceptualized as a three layer structure on the basis of which the reactive transport process and interface between different soil layers could be coupled a dual porosity finite difference method was applied to model the preferential flow in topsoil subsoil several criteria were provided to improve the grid spacing and select the optimal input parameters besides a series of bench scale column experiments were conducted to verify the previously established models the objective is to illustrate the feasibility of the model and to simulate and predict the long term migration and heterogeneous vertical distribution of cd in paddy soil 2 methodology 2 1 soil preparation soil samples used in this study were derived a flooded rice field of shahe n30 55 41 and e114 59 45 the yangtze river basin china the samples were taken at different depths air dried and sieved through 2 mm diameter mesh screens the soils collected from the depths of 0 30 30 60 and 60 90 cm were defined as surface soil topsoil and subsoil respectively 2 2 soil physical and chemical properties the soil texture was assigned according to the usda particle size classes clay 2 μm silt 2 50 μm sand 50 2000 μm gee and or 2002 the soil ph was determined by measuring the ph of the slurry

cec of the soil was measure using a bacl2 compulsive exchange procedure ross and ketterings 1995 the bulk density of soil was estimated from the soil particle size distribution and soil organic matter content keller and håkansson 2010 the total soil porosity could be calculated from bulk density and specific density brown and ransom 1996 the surface site concentration was measured by a potentiometric titration method stollenwerk 1995 the available heavy metal was extracted by a cacl2 extraction procedure and quantified with the inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry icp ms elan drc e perkinelmer novozamsky et al 1993 the total amount of cl was measured using a silver nitrate titration method breuer et al 2011 the titration experiment was conducted using an automatic potentiometric titrator t90 2 rondo60 mettler toledo and the titration error is 0 2 the background concentrations of the different soil layers at the studied site ware listed in table s1 in the supplementary material 2 3 column experiments design 2 3 1 column structure and soil filling a soil column leaching device is used in the experiment which is consists of a cylindrical quartz glass tube and a funnel with straight edges fig s1 each quartz tube 8 cm 65 cm has eight sampling ports with an interval of 5 cm a polyethylene tank was used to supply the solution and a peristaltic pump lead fluid bt100 l china was used to maintain a constant inflow from the top of the column a 4 cm thick acid washed cobble layer was placed in each column s funnel to filter the soil leachate the 0 20 cm 20 40 cm and 40 60 cm sections of the column are filled with uniformly mixed soil samples from the original layers of 0 30 cm 30 60 cm and 60 90 cm in the paddy soil respectively finally a 5 cm thick layer of washed gravel was added on the top of the soil layer to prevent it from being washed away 2 3 2 dynamic leaching of nacl before the experiment 3 l of deionized water was added to the column for about 24 h to make the soil evenly moist then the column was continuously flushed with nacl solution 1 mol l for three days at alternating flow rates of 0 6 ml min 6 ml min and 9 ml min in the leaching test leachate samples were collected 20 times at the outlet before analysis the leachate sample was filtered and stored at 4 c and then the concentration of cl was measured using the silver nitrate titration method 2 3 3 cd no3 2 leaching test after rinsing with deionized water the column soil was first saturated with deionized water and then irrigated with 6 l of cd no3 2 solution 10 mg l at a flow rate of 0 7 ml min for about six days at the outlet of the column leachate samples were collected ten times at intervals of 0 15 l the relative concentration current concentration c initial concentration c 0 of solutes was plotted against the pore volume total effluent volume v void space volume within the column v 0 to obtain the solutes breakthrough curves the v 0 could be determined by the total porosity and total volume of the soil in the column after discharging 6 l of solution the leachates at different heights of the column were also collected from the sampling ports to gain the cd2 concentration profile the concentrations of cations cd2 na k ca2 and mg2 were measured by the icp ms the limits of detection lod for cd2 na k ca2 and mg2 in this study are 32 90 28 187 and 190 ppt respectively the concentration of no3 was measured by potassium permanganate titration szabó and bartha 1950 with an automatic potentiometric titrator and the relative error was 3 8 each reagent used above is analytically pure and the solutions are prepared according to standard methods beeler et al 1965 makita and fujii 1992 2 4 models and theories 2 4 1 model framework and assumptions the actual migration of water and pollutants in paddy soil is extremely complex so the main processes considered in this simulation are as follows i advection and dispersion ii diffusion between the mobile region and the stagnant region iii multicomponent competitive cation exchange and surface complexation reactions paddy soil is divided into three layers each layer has soil matrix and soil fracture as shown in fig s2 it is assumed that the process i occurs in surface soil and topsoil subsoil fracture mobile region the process ii occurs between soil fracture and topsoil subsoil matrix the process iii was believed to occur in surface soil and topsoil with various exchange surface sites fig 1 shows the framework of the lbl model the simulations of the above processes can be achieved by calling the keywords transport exchange surface and mix in the basic script the simulation results of each layer of soil are directly transmitted to the next layer and calculated in order the simulation results are compared with the experimental data and the model is continuously calibrated so that the model can accurately predict the vertical reaction migration of solutes in the layered paddy soil 2 4 2 transport of solutes in the column with mobile immobile mim region the advection reaction dispersion ard equation was developed to describe the transport of solutes through the column parkhurst and appelo 1999 1 c t v c x d l 2 c x 2 q t where c is the concentration in the solution mol kgw 1 t is the time s x is the distance m v denotes the pore water flow velocity ms 1 d l denotes the hydrodynamic dispersion coefficient m 2 s 1 and q is the solid phase concentration mol kgw 1 the hydrodynamic dispersion coefficient d l is given by 2 d l d e α l v where d e is the effective diffusion coefficient m 2 s 1 α l is the dispersivity m a mobile immobile model mim was used to simulate the transport of the solutes between the soil matrix and soil fracture in a one dimension steady flow system multi species mim with a reactive term is given by the following formula van genuchten and wierenga 1976 3 θ m c m t θ im c im t v m θ m c m x θ m d l 2 c m x 2 θ m q t 4 θ im c im t α c m c im where the subscripts m and im refer to the mobile phase and immobile liquid phase θ m and θ im are the water filled porosity of the mobile part and stagnant part respectively θ is the total water content v m is the average pore velocity ms 1 in the mobile region and α is the first order mass transfer coefficient s 1 the solute transport parameters were obtained by field measurement literature review or inversely estimation using phreeqc based on the experimental results for the ard model v was calculated from column water flux j w and soil water content θ the j w could be measured through the leaching experiment and the θ is equal to total soil porosity under the saturated condition the d l was inversely estimated by fitting the experimental results with phreeqc modeling data of nacl dynamic leaching when v was fixed the α l was determined with d l and v and d e can be ignored because the flow velocity in the column is large enough to cause a dispersion governed spreading appelo and postma 2004 for the two region model the θ im was determined by the geometry of the soil matrix and soil fracture prescribed see text 1 in supplement material while the θ m θ the v m was determined from the v and θ m v m vθ m the α can be calculated from the dimensionless mass transfer coefficient ω since ω αl j w where l is the length of the column and the ω can be estimated with the first order mass transfer model haggerty and gorelick 1998 the reactive transport model parameters obtained by the above methods were listed in table s2 2 4 3 ion exchange and surface complexation reactions the cation exchange reactions are modeled in the form of half reactions shaviv and mattigod 1981 for example for cdca exchange the reaction a cd 2 ca x 2 cd x 2 ca 2 k cd ca is split in two half reactions b cd 2 2 x cd x 2 k cd x 2 c ca 2 2 x ca x 2 k ca x 2 where x represents the surface of the exchanger cdx2 and cax2 are exchangeable cations which are calculated as association complexes the half reactions are included in the phreeqc database using association constants relative to k nax the cation selective effect can be modeled using the active fraction model which is derived from the theory of constant capacitance for surface complexation appelo et al 2002 for the exchange half reaction of ca2 in eq c the association constant selectivity coefficient of the active fraction model becomes 5 log k log k a f 1 β ca where log k is the logarithm of the equilibrium constant when all sites are occupied by ca2 a f is the active fraction coefficient and β ca is the equivalent fraction of ca2 in the exchanger the mobility of cd2 can also be limited by adsorption on newly formed solid phases such as organic matter the process could be described by halim et al 2005 as shown in eqs 6 8 6 cd 2 organic x cdorganic x k 1 cdorganic x cd 2 organic x 7 cd 2 2organic x cdorganic x 2 k 2 cdorganic x2 cd2 organic x 2 8 cd 2 3organic x cdorganic x 3 k 3 cdorganic x 3 cd2 organic x 3 where k 1 k 2 and k 3 are log formation constants for corresponding complex species the selectivity coefficients log k for cation exchange reactions at 25 c used in this study are derived from the appelo and postma 1993 and listed in table 1 the values of k 1 k 2 and k 3 are derived from the results of halim et al 2005 and muller 1996 for the complexation of cd with dissolved colloidal and particulate matters in paddy fields 2 5 grid spacing and boundary condition assumption in order to solve the above mim equations a finite difference grid was laid over the immobile region as shown in fig s3 the research field was divided into a single row of mobile cells adjacent to an immobile cell array diffusion occurs in two regions in the form of mixing for an arbitrarily shaped cell j the fick s diffusion equation can be transformed to finite differences 9 c j t 2 c j t 1 d e t i j n a ij h ij v j c i t 1 c j t 1 f bc where c j t1 is the concentration in cell j at the current time c j t2 is the concentration after t t is time step s i denotes an adjacent cell a ij is share surface area of cell i and cell j m 2 h ij is the distance between midpoints of neighboring cells m the v j is volume of cell j m 3 and f bc is a boundary condition correction factor the mixing factors for adjacent cells is defined as parkhurst and appelo 1999 10 mix f ij d e t a ij f bc h ij v j for the central cells the mixing factor is 11 mix f jj 1 d e t i j n a ij f bc h ij v j thus the eq 9 can be rewritten in terms of mixing factors as follows 12 c j t 2 mix f jj c j t 1 i j n mix f ij c i t 1 in this study a 1 d transport of solutes was simulated and flux boundary condition cauchy boundary condition was chosen for the saturated flow of soil water in the simulation the boundary condition correction factor f bc used in eqs 9 11 accounts for the volumetric ratio of adjacent cells and could be set to 1 0 if adjacent cells have equal volumes parkhurst and appelo 1999 at the fracture matrix interface where adjacent cell volumes may be unequal the f bc could be set to 2 0 if the concentration in the fracture is constant appelo and postma 1993 for adjacent cells f bc depends on the ratio of the volume of the mobile zone v m to the volume of the boundary cell contacting the mobile zone v bc parkhurst and appelo 1999 13 f bc 2 v m v m v bc moreover the amounts of solute flowing out from fracture due to diffusion should not be greater than that of solute entering the fracture due to advection and dispersion therefore an influx factor φ the ratio of influx to outflux is defined as lipson et al 2007 14 φ v m π d b 2 d 2 d l θ im δr where d b and r are the parameters related to grid spacing for the conceptualized model see fig s3 the details for grid spacing could be found in text 1 in the supplementary material and all the results of grid spacing and boundary conditions were listed in table s3 in order to verify the numerical accuracy of the coupled model the results of phreeqc simulation are compared with the measured data by correlation coefficient r2 15 r 2 1 i 1 n c mea i c sim i 2 i 1 n c mea i c mea i 2 with c mea is the concentration obtained from measured data c sim denotes the concentration from simulation result c mea denotes the mean value of c mea 3 results and discussion 3 1 soil characterization several selected soil properties were listed in table 2 it is shown that the soil tends to be neutral with a ph value ranging from 6 44 to 6 77 the surface soil layer has the highest content of silt 70 and the lowest content of sand 8 which results to the maximum bulk density of 1 58 g cm3 this indicates that the soil texture below the surface puddle layer tends to be less dense which may further lead to preferential flow in the topsoil subsoil with increasing soil depth the organic matter content decreased from 1 26 wt to 0 03 wt and the associated surface sites decreased from 0 98 cmol kg to 0 10 cmol kg moreover the cec decreased from 21 cmolc kg in the surface soil to 0 5 cmolc kg in the subsoil this indicates that the cation exchange and surface complexation reactions mainly occur in the topsoil and the subsoil and these reactions can be ignored in the subsoil the dry bulk density observed in the subsoil 1 47 g cm3 was higher than that of the topsoil 1 34 g cm3 this may be due to the higher pressure exerted on the deeper soil generally due to the difference in soil texture at different depths the physical and chemical properties of the soil are different which may further affect the transport behavior of solutes in different soil layers 3 2 dynamic leaching of nacl the results of the dynamic leaching test show that the average pore water velocity v dispersivity α l and cl penetration time between various soil layers are different fig 2 as the soil depth increases the time for cl to penetrate and saturate each soil layer is reduced from 67 5 h to about 2 h it is shown that as the soil depth increases the average pore water velocity increases from 1 15 10 7 m s for the surface soil to 8 33 10 6 m s for the subsoil as previously analyzed it is more porous of the soil layers below the surface puddle layer so that solutes could transport faster in the topsoil subsoil moreover the higher content of sand in the subsoil may lead to a larger permeability and larger pore water velocity than the topsoil sharma and bhagat 1993 with increasing soil depth the dispersion of cl increases from 0 015 m to 0 08 m it can also be observed that both v and α l in the topsoil subsoil are more than ten times larger than those in the surface soil this trend may be due to the different permeability and hydraulic conductivity of different soil layers generally higher bulk density and lower saturated hydraulic conductivity are prominent features of the surface puddled layer and the layers below the surface soil are usually more porous than the overlying one patil et al 2011 this also indicates that preferential flow may occur in the topsoil subsoil so the pore water has a higher flow rate and the solute disperses faster 3 3 simulated and measured ion concentrations profiles the comparison of the six day observation and the three hour simulation of ion concentrations distribution at different depths is shown in fig 3 as the soil depth increases the cd2 level fig 3a decreases from the initial value of 10 mg l to a minimum of 0 10 mg l this indicates that cd2 may be adsorbed onto soil particles through ion exchange reactions with other cations or complexation reactions with soil organic matter kantar et al 2009 however at the same time the concentration of other cations increases with increasing soil depth the initial concentrations of the cations in each soil layer are equal to the background concentration shown in fig s1 in the surface soil a significant increase in concentration is observed only in ca2 however in the topsoil the na mg2 and k are also released in sequence with corresponding concentrations of 0 17 1 93 and 1 12 mg l respectively this phenomenon could be explained by the theory of cation exchange selectivity dolcater et al 1968 according to the theory when the influent cation cd2 in this study enters the most selective exchange sites will be filled up first and then the exchange sites with lower selectivity will be filled mansell et al 1993 vega et al 2009 have reached a similar conclusion when studying the adsorption of cd cu and pb in mg saturated soils in which the mg2 adsorbed on the soil was replaced by cd2 cu2 and pb2 in sequence it is also be seen in fig 3 that the average concentrations of ca2 mg2 na and k in the subsoil are much higher than those of the surface soil and topsoil as the soil depth increases from 0 6 m to 0 9 m the concentrations of ca2 mg2 na and k increases by 9 0 7 20 3 51 and 0 88 mg l respectively this may be due to the much lower organic matter content in the subsoil so the alkali alkaline earth metal ions are mainly present in the soil water rather than being adsorbed onto the colloids or minerals jung 2008 reached a similar conclusion according to his research organic matter plays a significant role in controlling the sorption of cd to the soil by forming the inner sphere cd mineral surface complexes generally higher organic matter content delays the transport of cd to deeper soil layers conroy et al 2016 fan et al 2016 moreover the data in fig 3b shows that the concentration of no3 remained at the initial value of 20 mg l until it entered the subsoil and significantly decreased to 8 38 mg l since no3 does not participate in the geochemical processes involved in the transport of cd2 it is suitable as a tracer to observe the migration of cd solutions addiscott et al 2010 the concentration distribution pattern of no3 shows that no3 has not yet saturated the subsoil therefore it can be concluded that after six days of observation ca2 mg2 na and k exchanged by cd2 and released from the surface soil topsoil have been enriched in the subsoil the correlation coefficient r2 calculated using the eq 16 is also given in fig 3 except for k the r2 of cd2 ca2 mg2 and na are all greater than 0 5 especially for mg2 na and cd2 the r2 are 0 83 0 88 and 0 97 respectively indicating a good correlation between the observed data and the simulation results however the experimental and simulated values of k show a relatively weak relationship the deviation may be caused by measurement errors potassium and sodium have similar geochemical properties under the same soil conditions so they should exhibit similar concentration distribution patterns kwonrae et al 2009 however this not the case in general the simulated results of solutes cd2 k ca2 and mg2 distribution are in good agreement with the observation data it has also been noted that along with the three soil layers the cd2 concentration presented a non line decrease this change is due to different transport modes i e preferential flow caused by the various physical properties and textures of different soil layers gerke et al 2001 3 4 measured and simulated solutes breakthrough curves the relative concentration c c0 of cd2 mg2 na k ca2 no3 and cl were plotted against the pore volume p p0 and shown in fig 4 as can be seen from fig 4a c and e the typical s shaped breakthrough curves btcs for no3 were observed and the c c0 of no3 increases at a same rate as that of cl decreases in the surface soil the btc of no3 reaches the breakthrough point c c0 starts to be greater than zero after about 0 75 pore volumes while 0 5 and 0 35 pore volumes were needed in the topsoil and subsoil respectively the difference in breakthrough volume could be due to the various vertical dispersivity as the dispersivity increases from 0 015 m surface soil to 0 08 m subsoil the molecular diffusion and mechanical dispersion at the interface between the influent liquid and the soil column solution are enhanced so the contention peak of no3 moves faster moreover the btc of no3 in surface soil shows almost a sudden change in c c0 in the pore volume between 0 75 and 1 0 whose btc tends to be a plug flow pattern gvirtzman et al 1986 due to the much lower porosity and permeability in surface soil the diffusion is weak in the axial direction and there are no radial variations in the species composition raja et al 2000 it is shown in fig 4b d f that the migration behavior of cd2 varies in different soil layers in the subsoil the cd2 concentration in the filtrate is the same as that of the influent solution after about 1 0 pore volume in topsoil nearly 3 5 volumes of cd no3 2 solution are needed to saturate the soil layer while the cd2 transports more slowly in surface soil with a saturate volume of 7 0 this may be due to the decrease in cec and organic matter content as the soil depth increases so the cation exchange and complexation processes weakens resulting to the more efficient vertical transport of cd2 same as the previous analysis due to the selectivity priority the c c0 of na mg2 k ca2 drop to zero in sequence in the surface soil and topsoil take the case in topsoil for example the na was completely released from the exchange sites at about 0 9 pore volumes while c c0 of mg2 and k decrease to zero at about 2 5 pore volumes due to their larger log k than that of na the cation exchange sites and organic matters could adsorb heavy metals i e cd2 by 1 either promoting or inhibiting cd2 sorption to mineral phases 2 complexing with cd2 in solution and 3 adsorbing onto mineral phases thereby delaying the cd2 transport from surface soil to the deeper layers kantar et al 2009 in general the larger cec and organic matter content in soil delays the transport of cd to the deeper soil layers the faster migration of cd2 in the topsoil and subsoil than that in the surface soil could also be attributed to the preferential flow effect it could be observed in fig 4 f that the btcs for na mg2 k and ca2 are almost overlapped indicating no chemical adsorption process exists the c c0 of cd2 reaches to 1 0 at about 1 0 pore volumes which may be due to the efficient transport of influent solution in the preferential flow channels the preferential flow is an irregular flow pathway of water and solutes in soils form distinct patterns such as macropore structure differing initial or boundary conditions flury et al 1994 variations in the geometry of the structural pore networks likely produce different forms of irregular flow paths of solutes in the soils such as macro pore structures the surface soil of the paddy fields is tilled and puddled every growing season which destroys the macropores formed by decayed roots so the preferential flow effect is usually weak zhang et al 2015 the preferential flow increases water infiltration by producing a bypass flow water flows through cracks into the subsoil in cracked paddy soils zhang et al 2013 this also explains that btcs of cd2 reach the breakthrough point faster in the deeper soil layers relative to surface soil luo et al 2008 concluded a similar conclusion that is the btc in the macropore domain showed a higher solute concentration and a faster time of arrival compared to that of the matrix region generally the preferential flow accelerates the transport of cd and increases the environmental risk of groundwater 3 5 predicted concentration distributions of cd2 in paddy soil based on the developed reactive transport model after 60 days and 120 days of simulation the concentration profiles of cd2 at various initial pollutant concentrations 0 1 0 3 0 6 and 1 0 mmol l are shown in fig 5a and c respectively the corresponding total concentrations of the cd calculated by integrating the concentration profiles are given in fig 5b and d the result shows that as the initial pollutant concentration increases more cd2 is transported to the underlying soil layers taking a 60 day simulation as an example when the initial concentrations are 0 3 0 6 and 1 0 mmol l the cd2 concentrations in the topsoil are 1 0 10 5 4 13 10 5 and 0 12 mg kg respectively that is as the initial cd2 concentration increases the cd2 enrichment in the soil increases the same phenomenon can be observed in the 120 day simulation napier et al 2009 reached a similar result that higher concentrations of influent heavy metals increase the risk of soil contamination in the underlying paddy layers by comparing the results of fig 5a with 5c it can be seen that as the simulation time increases more pollutant cd2 is enriched in the paddy soil when the initial concentration is 0 6 mmol l the concentrations of cd2 in surface soil topsoil and subsoil after migration for 60 days are 29 50 mg kg 4 13 10 5 mg kg and 1 28 10 8 mg kg respectively however for the 120 day simulation the average concentrations of cd2 in the corresponding soil layers are 59 78 mg kg 0 52 mg kg and 0 02 mg kg respectively the accumulation of cd2 may be due to the large adsorption capacity of paddy soil many experimental and modeling studies have shown that cd2 is usually enriched in the paddy soils through binding with metal oxides and forming monodentate e g socd or bidentate surface complexes e g so2cd ainsworth et al 1994 boily et al 2005 randall et al 1999 according to fig 5a and b after 60 days of migration the maximal average concentration of cd2 in the surface soil layer 0 0 3 m was observed to exceed the upper limit of 0 3 mg kg this value is the maximum discharge value specified by the environmental quality standard for soils gb15618 2008 issued by the ministry of environmental protection of china it should also be noted that when a medium level 0 6 mmol l of cd no3 2 solution is infused the concentration of cd2 in the topsoil is slightly higher than 0 3 mg kg therefore it can be concluded that with the low concentration of cd2 entering i e 0 1 0 3 mmol l only the surface soil has the risk of cd2 contamination however in a more acid soil environment cd2 adsorbed in the soil surface may be re released into the soil water and may be taken in by the crops and pose a severe threat to human health through the food chain degryse et al 2010 hu et al 2013 the above analysis shows that better management methods can be applied to control cd load in the fields for example 1 soil remediation measures should be formulated for surface soil and implemented at a depth of fewer than 0 3 m 2 soil salinization should be avoided and paddy field water should not contain high concentrations of alkaline earth metal ions 3 it is necessary to establish a more accurate prediction model based on field scale experiments it should also be mentioned that the developed lbl model has its limitations in addition to the simple cation exchange surface complexation reactions the transport of solutes in typical paddy soil should include multicomponent processes such as irf evaporation kinetically controlled mineral dissolution precipitation etc pettenati et al 2013 on the other hand horizontal solute transport should also be considered koestel et al 2008 the lbl reactive transport model used here only considers the heterogeneity of the paddy soil and relatively simply combines the two region diffusion process with multiple surface reactions however the used phreeqc model allows the users to describe rate equations via basic scripts it includes a friendly interface that can be coupled with other programs such as comsol minteq and hydrus etc this makes it possible to improve the lbl reactive transport model to simulate the more complex solute transport processes in the future 4 conclusions the purpose of this study was to investigate the mechanisms governing the transport behavior of cd and to simulate and predict the long term migration of cd in different paddy soil layers to this end a coupled lbl model based on the phreeqc model was established the solute transport parameters were obtained by field measurement literature review or inversely estimation using phreeqc based on the experimental results also laboratory scale column experiments were conducted to verify the model except for k the r2 of cd2 ca2 mg2 and na are all greater than 0 5 especially for mg2 na and cd2 the r2 are 0 83 0 88 and 0 97 respectively indicating a good correlation between the observed data and the simulation results different transport mechanisms such as cation exchange reactions surface complexation reactions and preferential flow have also been shown to determine the heterogeneous vertical distribution of cd the larger cec and organic matter content in soil delays the transport of cd to the deeper soil layers the preferential flow accelerates the transport of cd and increases the environmental risk of groundwater according to the predicted results with the low concentration 0 1 0 3 mmol l cd entering only the surface soil is at risk of cd contamination which may be due to the large adsorption capacity of paddy soil better management practices can be applied to control cd loads in the fields for examples 1 soil remediation measures should be formulated for surface soil and implemented at a depth of less than 0 3 m 2 soil salinization should be avoided and paddy water should not contain high

1486,cadmium cd pollution in soil has attracted more attention recently for its high toxicity and easy accumulation in crops this study aims to investigate the mechanisms governing the transport behavior of cd and to simulate and predict the long term migration of cd in different paddy soil layers therefore a layer by layer lbl model based on the geochemical model phreeqc was developed a dual porosity finite difference method was applied to model the two region diffusion process the solute transport parameters were obtained by field measurement literature review or inversely estimation using phreeqc based on the experimental results modeling and experimental results both indicate that different mechanisms cation exchange reaction preferential flow etc control the transport and vertical distribution of cd the prediction results show that only the surface soil 0 3 m would pose the risk of cd2 pollution the coupled lbl model could correctly simulate the migration of cd under near field conditions graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords cadmium coupled model reactive transport layered paddy soil phreeqc 1 introduction cadmium cd pollution is of great concern in agricultural production due to its high toxicity good mobility and being easily accumulated in rice according to a previous study the area of cd contaminated cultivated land reached almost 2 8 109 m2 in china bermudez et al 2012 liu et al 2015 cd entered in paddy soil can end up in the food chain or cause contamination of groundwater resources thereby threatening human health hu et al 2016 rizwan et al 2017 given the severity of cd pollution urgent measures are required to reduce current environmental and food security risks the first step to better manage cd content in the soil is to understand the processes that affect the migration of cd in the paddy soil huang et al 2015 especially long term knowledge of the distribution of cd in different soil layers is crucial for controlling nonpoint source pollution rao et al 2018 the transport of heavy metals i e cd2 in the soil has been investigated for several decades lei et al 2010 pueyo et al 2003 different conclusions have been drawn about the risk of heavy metals leaching into groundwater through paddy soil chen et al 2010 huang et al 2015 teng et al 2015 however most studies have not considered the heterogeneity of paddy soil and the resulting migration behavior of heavy metals between different soil layers xu et al 2013 xu et al 2014 the primary source of the heterogeneity in solutes distribution is related to morphological chemical and ecological variability at various soil layers a typical paddy soil profile includes three distinct layers surface puddled layer middle consolidated layer and bottom undisturbed soil wopereis et al 1992 much higher bulk density and lower saturated hydraulic conductivity are the distinct characteristics of the surface puddled layer while the layers below the surface soil are generally more porous than it patil et al 2011 recent studies have shown that the difference in the geometric structure of the structural pore network may significantly affect the transport of cd in the soil cd could be leached by preferential flow or transport through macro structures such as cracks worm holes and plant root channels the studies found that preferential flow can significantly increase the longitudinal mobility and speed of cd in soil nimmo 2012 seyfried and rao 1987 the effects of preferential flow can be particularly dramatic beneath the puddled layer which consists of a mobile region through which solutes preferentially pass and an immobile region with the negligible flow velocity rezanezhad et al 2016 another factor that enhances cd mobility is the binding of cd to organic ligands or colloids particularly in soils with a high content of dissolved organic carbons docs and oxide minerals loganathan et al 2012 organic matters and minerals in the puddled layer often reduce the leaching potential of the solute through adsorption processes such as exchange and surface complexation reactions sauer and daniel 1987 for example halim et al 2015 found that organic matter reduces the cd accumulation in straws and roots of rice through adsorbing or forming the stable complexes with cd it is also found that organic acids exist as negative anions which could complex with cd ions and immobilize cd in soil thereby reducing the mobility of cd li et al 2017 becher 1991 found that in the lower density soil layer with coarser pores the exchange process is faster moreover it has been shown that an increase in the charge of background cations ca2 mg2 k na etc reduces the sorption of targeted cation such as cd2 to soil exchange sites naidu et al 2010 generally solute transport in paddy fields involves relatively complex processes however observation and evaluation under field conditions is extraordinarily difficult costly and time consuming li et al 2014 reactive transport modeling using the phreeqc program has been proved to be an efficient method for simulating aqueous speciation reaction path and 1 d reactive transport marsac et al 2011 sprocati et al 2019 zhang et al 2017 this is partly due to that the program allows users to describe rate equations via basic scripts these scripts are then run with the program along with other parts of input files and databases for kinetic model simulations zhang et al 2019 besides the program contains several classical models such as ddl diffuse double layer model dzombak and morel 1990 cd music model charge distribution multisite complexation hiemstra and van riemsdijk 1996 and debye hückel model nowotny and rekas 1989 etc to describe the surface complexation and ion exchange reactions in soil in this study a layer by layer lbl reactive transport model based on the geochemical model phreeqc has been developed to investigate the mechanisms governing the heterogeneous vertical distribution of cd as well as transport behavior in different paddy soil layers the soil unit was conceptualized as a three layer structure on the basis of which the reactive transport process and interface between different soil layers could be coupled a dual porosity finite difference method was applied to model the preferential flow in topsoil subsoil several criteria were provided to improve the grid spacing and select the optimal input parameters besides a series of bench scale column experiments were conducted to verify the previously established models the objective is to illustrate the feasibility of the model and to simulate and predict the long term migration and heterogeneous vertical distribution of cd in paddy soil 2 methodology 2 1 soil preparation soil samples used in this study were derived a flooded rice field of shahe n30 55 41 and e114 59 45 the yangtze river basin china the samples were taken at different depths air dried and sieved through 2 mm diameter mesh screens the soils collected from the depths of 0 30 30 60 and 60 90 cm were defined as surface soil topsoil and subsoil respectively 2 2 soil physical and chemical properties the soil texture was assigned according to the usda particle size classes clay 2 μm silt 2 50 μm sand 50 2000 μm gee and or 2002 the soil ph was determined by measuring the ph of the slurry with a mass ratio of 1 2 soil to deionized water using a ph meter sumner 1994 the organic matter content was determined with the walkey black procedure janitzky 1986 the cation exchangeable capacity cec of the soil was measure using a bacl2 compulsive exchange procedure ross and ketterings 1995 the bulk density of soil was estimated from the soil particle size distribution and soil organic matter content keller and håkansson 2010 the total soil porosity could be calculated from bulk density and specific density brown and ransom 1996 the surface site concentration was measured by a potentiometric titration method stollenwerk 1995 the available heavy metal was extracted by a cacl2 extraction procedure and quantified with the inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry icp ms elan drc e perkinelmer novozamsky et al 1993 the total amount of cl was measured using a silver nitrate titration method breuer et al 2011 the titration experiment was conducted using an automatic potentiometric titrator t90 2 rondo60 mettler toledo and the titration error is 0 2 the background concentrations of the different soil layers at the studied site ware listed in table s1 in the supplementary material 2 3 column experiments design 2 3 1 column structure and soil filling a soil column leaching device is used in the experiment which is consists of a cylindrical quartz glass tube and a funnel with straight edges fig s1 each quartz tube 8 cm 65 cm has eight sampling ports with an interval of 5 cm a polyethylene tank was used to supply the solution and a peristaltic pump lead fluid bt100 l china was used to maintain a constant inflow from the top of the column a 4 cm thick acid washed cobble layer was placed in each column s funnel to filter the soil leachate the 0 20 cm 20 40 cm and 40 60 cm sections of the column are filled with uniformly mixed soil samples from the original layers of 0 30 cm 30 60 cm and 60 90 cm in the paddy soil respectively finally a 5 cm thick layer of washed gravel was added on the top of the soil layer to prevent it from being washed away 2 3 2 dynamic leaching of nacl before the experiment 3 l of deionized water was added to the column for about 24 h to make the soil evenly moist then the column was continuously flushed with nacl solution 1 mol l for three days at alternating flow rates of 0 6 ml min 6 ml min and 9 ml min in the leaching test leachate samples were collected 20 times at the outlet before analysis the leachate sample was filtered and stored at 4 c and then the concentration of cl was measured using the silver nitrate titration method 2 3 3 cd no3 2 leaching test after rinsing with deionized water the column soil was first saturated with deionized water and then irrigated with 6 l of cd no3 2 solution 10 mg l at a flow rate of 0 7 ml min for about six days at the outlet of the column leachate samples were collected ten times at intervals of 0 15 l the relative concentration current concentration c initial concentration c 0 of solutes was plotted against the pore volume total effluent volume v void space volume within the column v 0 to obtain the solutes breakthrough curves the v 0 could be determined by the total porosity and total volume of the soil in the column after discharging 6 l of solution the leachates at different heights of the column were also collected from the sampling ports to gain the cd2 concentration profile the concentrations of cations cd2 na k ca2 and mg2 were measured by the icp ms the limits of detection lod for cd2 na k ca2 and mg2 in this study are 32 90 28 187 and 190 ppt respectively the concentration of no3 was measured by potassium permanganate titration szabó and bartha 1950 with an automatic potentiometric titrator and the relative error was 3 8 each reagent used above is analytically pure and the solutions are prepared according to standard methods beeler et al 1965 makita and fujii 1992 2 4 models and theories 2 4 1 model framework and assumptions the actual migration of water and pollutants in paddy soil is extremely complex so the main processes considered in this simulation are as follows i advection and dispersion ii diffusion between the mobile region and the stagnant region iii multicomponent competitive cation exchange and surface complexation reactions paddy soil is divided into three layers each layer has soil matrix and soil fracture as shown in fig s2 it is assumed that the process i occurs in surface soil and topsoil subsoil fracture mobile region the process ii occurs between soil fracture and topsoil subsoil matrix the process iii was believed to occur in surface soil and topsoil with various exchange surface sites fig 1 shows the framework of the lbl model the simulations of the above processes can be achieved by calling the keywords transport exchange surface and mix in the basic script the simulation results of each layer of soil are directly transmitted to the next layer and calculated in order the simulation results are compared with the experimental data and the model is continuously calibrated so that the model can accurately predict the vertical reaction migration of solutes in the layered paddy soil 2 4 2 transport of solutes in the column with mobile immobile mim region the advection reaction dispersion ard equation was developed to describe the transport of solutes through the column parkhurst and appelo 1999 1 c t v c x d l 2 c x 2 q t where c is the concentration in the solution mol kgw 1 t is the time s x is the distance m v denotes the pore water flow velocity ms 1 d l denotes the hydrodynamic dispersion coefficient m 2 s 1 and q is the solid phase concentration mol kgw 1 the hydrodynamic dispersion coefficient d l is given by 2 d l d e α l v where d e is the effective diffusion coefficient m 2 s 1 α l is the dispersivity m a mobile immobile model mim was used to simulate the transport of the solutes between the soil matrix and soil fracture in a one dimension steady flow system multi species mim with a reactive term is given by the following formula van genuchten and wierenga 1976 3 θ m c m t θ im c im t v m θ m c m x θ m d l 2 c m x 2 θ m q t 4 θ im c im t α c m c im where the subscripts m and im refer to the mobile phase and immobile liquid phase θ m and θ im are the water filled porosity of the mobile part and stagnant part respectively θ is the total water content v m is the average pore velocity ms 1 in the mobile region and α is the first order mass transfer coefficient s 1 the solute transport parameters were obtained by field measurement literature review or inversely estimation using phreeqc based on the experimental results for the ard model v was calculated from column water flux j w and soil water content θ the j w could be measured through the leaching experiment and the θ is equal to total soil porosity under the saturated condition the d l was inversely estimated by fitting the experimental results with phreeqc modeling data of nacl dynamic leaching when v was fixed the α l was determined with d l and v and d e can be ignored because the flow velocity in the column is large enough to cause a dispersion governed spreading appelo and postma 2004 for the two region model the θ im was determined by the geometry of the soil matrix and soil fracture prescribed see text 1 in supplement material while the θ m θ the v m was determined from the v and θ m v m vθ m the α can be calculated from the dimensionless mass transfer coefficient ω since ω αl j w where l is the length of the column and the ω can be estimated with the first order mass transfer model haggerty and gorelick 1998 the reactive transport model parameters obtained by the above methods were listed in table s2 2 4 3 ion exchange and surface complexation reactions the cation exchange reactions are modeled in the form of half reactions shaviv and mattigod 1981 for example for cdca exchange the reaction a cd 2 ca x 2 cd x 2 ca 2 k cd ca is split in two half reactions b cd 2 2 x cd x 2 k cd x 2 c ca 2 2 x ca x 2 k ca x 2 where x represents the surface of the exchanger cdx2 and cax2 are exchangeable cations which are calculated as association complexes the half reactions are included in the phreeqc database using association constants relative to k nax the cation selective effect can be modeled using the active fraction model which is derived from the theory of constant capacitance for surface complexation appelo et al 2002 for the exchange half reaction of ca2 in eq c the association constant selectivity coefficient of the active fraction model becomes 5 log k log k a f 1 β ca where log k is the logarithm of the equilibrium constant when all sites are occupied by ca2 a f is the active fraction coefficient and β ca is the equivalent fraction of ca2 in the exchanger the mobility of cd2 can also be limited by adsorption on newly formed solid phases such as organic matter the process could be described by halim et al 2005 as shown in eqs 6 8 6 cd 2 organic x cdorganic x k 1 cdorganic x cd 2 organic x 7 cd 2 2organic x cdorganic x 2 k 2 cdorganic x2 cd2 organic x 2 8 cd 2 3organic x cdorganic x 3 k 3 cdorganic x 3 cd2 organic x 3 where k 1 k 2 and k 3 are log formation constants for corresponding complex species the selectivity coefficients log k for cation exchange reactions at 25 c used in this study are derived from the appelo and postma 1993 and listed in table 1 the values of k 1 k 2 and k 3 are derived from the results of halim et al 2005 and muller 1996 for the complexation of cd with dissolved colloidal and particulate matters in paddy fields 2 5 grid spacing and boundary condition assumption in order to solve the above mim equations a finite difference grid was laid over the immobile region as shown in fig s3 the research field was divided into a single row of mobile cells adjacent to an immobile cell array diffusion occurs in two regions in the form of mixing for an arbitrarily shaped cell j the fick s diffusion equation can be transformed to finite differences 9 c j t 2 c j t 1 d e t i j n a ij h ij v j c i t 1 c j t 1 f bc where c j t1 is the concentration in cell j at the current time c j t2 is the concentration after t t is time step s i denotes an adjacent cell a ij is share surface area of cell i and cell j m 2 h ij is the distance between midpoints of neighboring cells m the v j is volume of cell j m 3 and f bc is a boundary condition correction factor the mixing factors for adjacent cells is defined as parkhurst and appelo 1999 10 mix f ij d e t a ij f bc h ij v j for the central cells the mixing factor is 11 mix f jj 1 d e t i j n a ij f bc h ij v j thus the eq 9 can be rewritten in terms of mixing factors as follows 12 c j t 2 mix f jj c j t 1 i j n mix f ij c i t 1 in this study a 1 d transport of solutes was simulated and flux boundary condition cauchy boundary condition was chosen for the saturated flow of soil water in the simulation the boundary condition correction factor f bc used in eqs 9 11 accounts for the volumetric ratio of adjacent cells and could be set to 1 0 if adjacent cells have equal volumes parkhurst and appelo 1999 at the fracture matrix interface where adjacent cell volumes may be unequal the f bc could be set to 2 0 if the concentration in the fracture is constant appelo and postma 1993 for adjacent cells f bc depends on the ratio of the volume of the mobile zone v m to the volume of the boundary cell contacting the mobile zone v bc parkhurst and appelo 1999 13 f bc 2 v m v m v bc moreover the amounts of solute flowing out from fracture due to diffusion should not be greater than that of solute entering the fracture due to advection and dispersion therefore an influx factor φ the ratio of influx to outflux is defined as lipson et al 2007 14 φ v m π d b 2 d 2 d l θ im δr where d b and r are the parameters related to grid spacing for the conceptualized model see fig s3 the details for grid spacing could be found in text 1 in the supplementary material and all the results of grid spacing and boundary conditions were listed in table s3 in order to verify the numerical accuracy of the coupled model the results of phreeqc simulation are compared with the measured data by correlation coefficient r2 15 r 2 1 i 1 n c mea i c sim i 2 i 1 n c mea i c mea i 2 with c mea is the concentration obtained from measured data c sim denotes the concentration from simulation result c mea denotes the mean value of c mea 3 results and discussion 3 1 soil characterization several selected soil properties were listed in table 2 it is shown that the soil tends to be neutral with a ph value ranging from 6 44 to 6 77 the surface soil layer has the highest content of silt 70 and the lowest content of sand 8 which results to the maximum bulk density of 1 58 g cm3 this indicates that the soil texture below the surface puddle layer tends to be less dense which may further lead to preferential flow in the topsoil subsoil with increasing soil depth the organic matter content decreased from 1 26 wt to 0 03 wt and the associated surface sites decreased from 0 98 cmol kg to 0 10 cmol kg moreover the cec decreased from 21 cmolc kg in the surface soil to 0 5 cmolc kg in the subsoil this indicates that the cation exchange and surface complexation reactions mainly occur in the topsoil and the subsoil and these reactions can be ignored in the subsoil the dry bulk density observed in the subsoil 1 47 g cm3 was higher than that of the topsoil 1 34 g cm3 this may be due to the higher pressure exerted on the deeper soil generally due to the difference in soil texture at different depths the physical and chemical properties of the soil are different which may further affect the transport behavior of solutes in different soil layers 3 2 dynamic leaching of nacl the results of the dynamic leaching test show that the average pore water velocity v dispersivity α l and cl penetration time between various soil layers are different fig 2 as the soil depth increases the time for cl to penetrate and saturate each soil layer is reduced from 67 5 h to about 2 h it is shown that as the soil depth increases the average pore water velocity increases from 1 15 10 7 m s for the surface soil to 8 33 10 6 m s for the subsoil as previously analyzed it is more porous of the soil layers below the surface puddle layer so that solutes could transport faster in the topsoil subsoil moreover the higher content of sand in the subsoil may lead to a larger permeability and larger pore water velocity than the topsoil sharma and bhagat 1993 with increasing soil depth the dispersion of cl increases from 0 015 m to 0 08 m it can also be observed that both v and α l in the topsoil subsoil are more than ten times larger than those in the surface soil this trend may be due to the different permeability and hydraulic conductivity of different soil layers generally higher bulk density and lower saturated hydraulic conductivity are prominent features of the surface puddled layer and the layers below the surface soil are usually more porous than the overlying one patil et al 2011 this also indicates that preferential flow may occur in the topsoil subsoil so the pore water has a higher flow rate and the solute disperses faster 3 3 simulated and measured ion concentrations profiles the comparison of the six day observation and the three hour simulation of ion concentrations distribution at different depths is shown in fig 3 as the soil depth increases the cd2 level fig 3a decreases from the initial value of 10 mg l to a minimum of 0 10 mg l this indicates that cd2 may be adsorbed onto soil particles through ion exchange reactions with other cations or complexation reactions with soil organic matter kantar et al 2009 however at the same time the concentration of other cations increases with increasing soil depth the initial concentrations of the cations in each soil layer are equal to the background concentration shown in fig s1 in the surface soil a significant increase in concentration is observed only in ca2 however in the topsoil the na mg2 and k are also released in sequence with corresponding concentrations of 0 17 1 93 and 1 12 mg l respectively this phenomenon could be explained by the theory of cation exchange selectivity dolcater et al 1968 according to the theory when the influent cation cd2 in this study enters the most selective exchange sites will be filled up first and then the exchange sites with lower selectivity will be filled mansell et al 1993 vega et al 2009 have reached a similar conclusion when studying the adsorption of cd cu and pb in mg saturated soils in which the mg2 adsorbed on the soil was replaced by cd2 cu2 and pb2 in sequence it is also be seen in fig 3 that the average concentrations of ca2 mg2 na and k in the subsoil are much higher than those of the surface soil and topsoil as the soil depth increases from 0 6 m to 0 9 m the concentrations of ca2 mg2 na and k increases by 9 0 7 20 3 51 and 0 88 mg l respectively this may be due to the much lower organic matter content in the subsoil so the alkali alkaline earth metal ions are mainly present in the soil water rather than being adsorbed onto the colloids or minerals jung 2008 reached a similar conclusion according to his research organic matter plays a significant role in controlling the sorption of cd to the soil by forming the inner sphere cd mineral surface complexes generally higher organic matter content delays the transport of cd to deeper soil layers conroy et al 2016 fan et al 2016 moreover the data in fig 3b shows that the concentration of no3 remained at the initial value of 20 mg l until it entered the subsoil and significantly decreased to 8 38 mg l since no3 does not participate in the geochemical processes involved in the transport of cd2 it is suitable as a tracer to observe the migration of cd solutions addiscott et al 2010 the concentration distribution pattern of no3 shows that no3 has not yet saturated the subsoil therefore it can be concluded that after six days of observation ca2 mg2 na and k exchanged by cd2 and released from the surface soil topsoil have been enriched in the subsoil the correlation coefficient r2 calculated using the eq 16 is also given in fig 3 except for k the r2 of cd2 ca2 mg2 and na are all greater than 0 5 especially for mg2 na and cd2 the r2 are 0 83 0 88 and 0 97 respectively indicating a good correlation between the observed data and the simulation results however the experimental and simulated values of k show a relatively weak relationship the deviation may be caused by measurement errors potassium and sodium have similar geochemical properties under the same soil conditions so they should exhibit similar concentration distribution patterns kwonrae et al 2009 however this not the case in general the simulated results of solutes cd2 k ca2 and mg2 distribution are in good agreement with the observation data it has also been noted that along with the three soil layers the cd2 concentration presented a non line decrease this change is due to different transport modes i e preferential flow caused by the various physical properties and textures of different soil layers gerke et al 2001 3 4 measured and simulated solutes breakthrough curves the relative concentration c c0 of cd2 mg2 na k ca2 no3 and cl were plotted against the pore volume p p0 and shown in fig 4 as can be seen from fig 4a c and e the typical s shaped breakthrough curves btcs for no3 were observed and the c c0 of no3 increases at a same rate as that of cl decreases in the surface soil the btc of no3 reaches the breakthrough point c c0 starts to be greater than zero after about 0 75 pore volumes while 0 5 and 0 35 pore volumes were needed in the topsoil and subsoil respectively the difference in breakthrough volume could be due to the various vertical dispersivity as the dispersivity increases from 0 015 m surface soil to 0 08 m subsoil the molecular diffusion and mechanical dispersion at the interface between the influent liquid and the soil column solution are enhanced so the contention peak of no3 moves faster moreover the btc of no3 in surface soil shows almost a sudden change in c c0 in the pore volume between 0 75 and 1 0 whose btc tends to be a plug flow pattern gvirtzman et al 1986 due to the much lower porosity and permeability in surface soil the diffusion is weak in the axial direction and there are no radial variations in the species composition raja et al 2000 it is shown in fig 4b d f that the migration behavior of cd2 varies in different soil layers in the subsoil the cd2 concentration in the filtrate is the same as that of the influent solution after about 1 0 pore volume in topsoil nearly 3 5 volumes of cd no3 2 solution are needed to saturate the soil layer while the cd2 transports more slowly in surface soil with a saturate volume of 7 0 this may be due to the decrease in cec and organic matter content as the soil depth increases so the cation exchange and complexation processes weakens resulting to the more efficient vertical transport of cd2 same as the previous analysis due to the selectivity priority the c c0 of na mg2 k ca2 drop to zero in sequence in the surface soil and topsoil take the case in topsoil for example the na was completely released from the exchange sites at about 0 9 pore volumes while c c0 of mg2 and k decrease to zero at about 2 5 pore volumes due to their larger log k than that of na the cation exchange sites and organic matters could adsorb heavy metals i e cd2 by 1 either promoting or inhibiting cd2 sorption to mineral phases 2 complexing with cd2 in solution and 3 adsorbing onto mineral phases thereby delaying the cd2 transport from surface soil to the deeper layers kantar et al 2009 in general the larger cec and organic matter content in soil delays the transport of cd to the deeper soil layers the faster migration of cd2 in the topsoil and subsoil than that in the surface soil could also be attributed to the preferential flow effect it could be observed in fig 4 f that the btcs for na mg2 k and ca2 are almost overlapped indicating no chemical adsorption process exists the c c0 of cd2 reaches to 1 0 at about 1 0 pore volumes which may be due to the efficient transport of influent solution in the preferential flow channels the preferential flow is an irregular flow pathway of water and solutes in soils form distinct patterns such as macropore structure differing initial or boundary conditions flury et al 1994 variations in the geometry of the structural pore networks likely produce different forms of irregular flow paths of solutes in the soils such as macro pore structures the surface soil of the paddy fields is tilled and puddled every growing season which destroys the macropores formed by decayed roots so the preferential flow effect is usually weak zhang et al 2015 the preferential flow increases water infiltration by producing a bypass flow water flows through cracks into the subsoil in cracked paddy soils zhang et al 2013 this also explains that btcs of cd2 reach the breakthrough point faster in the deeper soil layers relative to surface soil luo et al 2008 concluded a similar conclusion that is the btc in the macropore domain showed a higher solute concentration and a faster time of arrival compared to that of the matrix region generally the preferential flow accelerates the transport of cd and increases the environmental risk of groundwater 3 5 predicted concentration distributions of cd2 in paddy soil based on the developed reactive transport model after 60 days and 120 days of simulation the concentration profiles of cd2 at various initial pollutant concentrations 0 1 0 3 0 6 and 1 0 mmol l are shown in fig 5a and c respectively the corresponding total concentrations of the cd calculated by integrating the concentration profiles are given in fig 5b and d the result shows that as the initial pollutant concentration increases more cd2 is transported to the underlying soil layers taking a 60 day simulation as an example when the initial concentrations are 0 3 0 6 and 1 0 mmol l the cd2 concentrations in the topsoil are 1 0 10 5 4 13 10 5 and 0 12 mg kg respectively that is as the initial cd2 concentration increases the cd2 enrichment in the soil increases the same phenomenon can be observed in the 120 day simulation napier et al 2009 reached a similar result that higher concentrations of influent heavy metals increase the risk of soil contamination in the underlying paddy layers by comparing the results of fig 5a with 5c it can be seen that as the simulation time increases more pollutant cd2 is enriched in the paddy soil when the initial concentration is 0 6 mmol l the concentrations of cd2 in surface soil topsoil and subsoil after migration for 60 days are 29 50 mg kg 4 13 10 5 mg kg and 1 28 10 8 mg kg respectively however for the 120 day simulation the average concentrations of cd2 in the corresponding soil layers are 59 78 mg kg 0 52 mg kg and 0 02 mg kg respectively the accumulation of cd2 may be due to the large adsorption capacity of paddy soil many experimental and modeling studies have shown that cd2 is usually enriched in the paddy soils through binding with metal oxides and forming monodentate e g socd or bidentate surface complexes e g so2cd ainsworth et al 1994 boily et al 2005 randall et al 1999 according to fig 5a and b after 60 days of migration the maximal average concentration of cd2 in the surface soil layer 0 0 3 m was observed to exceed the upper limit of 0 3 mg kg this value is the maximum discharge value specified by the environmental quality standard for soils gb15618 2008 issued by the ministry of environmental protection of china it should also be noted that when a medium level 0 6 mmol l of cd no3 2 solution is infused the concentration of cd2 in the topsoil is slightly higher than 0 3 mg kg therefore it can be concluded that with the low concentration of cd2 entering i e 0 1 0 3 mmol l only the surface soil has the risk of cd2 contamination however in a more acid soil environment cd2 adsorbed in the soil surface may be re released into the soil water and may be taken in by the crops and pose a severe threat to human health through the food chain degryse et al 2010 hu et al 2013 the above analysis shows that better management methods can be applied to control cd load in the fields for example 1 soil remediation measures should be formulated for surface soil and implemented at a depth of fewer than 0 3 m 2 soil salinization should be avoided and paddy field water should not contain high concentrations of alkaline earth metal ions 3 it is necessary to establish a more accurate prediction model based on field scale experiments it should also be mentioned that the developed lbl model has its limitations in addition to the simple cation exchange surface complexation reactions the transport of solutes in typical paddy soil should include multicomponent processes such as irf evaporation kinetically controlled mineral dissolution precipitation etc pettenati et al 2013 on the other hand horizontal solute transport should also be considered koestel et al 2008 the lbl reactive transport model used here only considers the heterogeneity of the paddy soil and relatively simply combines the two region diffusion process with multiple surface reactions however the used phreeqc model allows the users to describe rate equations via basic scripts it includes a friendly interface that can be coupled with other programs such as comsol minteq and hydrus etc this makes it possible to improve the lbl reactive transport model to simulate the more complex solute transport processes in the future 4 conclusions the purpose of this study was to investigate the mechanisms governing the transport behavior of cd and to simulate and predict the long term migration of cd in different paddy soil layers to this end a coupled lbl model based on the phreeqc model was established the solute transport parameters were obtained by field measurement literature review or inversely estimation using phreeqc based on the experimental results also laboratory scale column experiments were conducted to verify the model except for k the r2 of cd2 ca2 mg2 and na are all greater than 0 5 especially for mg2 na and cd2 the r2 are 0 83 0 88 and 0 97 respectively indicating a good correlation between the observed data and the simulation results different transport mechanisms such as cation exchange reactions surface complexation reactions and preferential flow have also been shown to determine the heterogeneous vertical distribution of cd the larger cec and organic matter content in soil delays the transport of cd to the deeper soil layers the preferential flow accelerates the transport of cd and increases the environmental risk of groundwater according to the predicted results with the low concentration 0 1 0 3 mmol l cd entering only the surface soil is at risk of cd contamination which may be due to the large adsorption capacity of paddy soil better management practices can be applied to control cd loads in the fields for examples 1 soil remediation measures should be formulated for surface soil and implemented at a depth of less than 0 3 m 2 soil salinization should be avoided and paddy water should not contain high concentrations of alkaline earth metal ions which usually have better affinity than the heavy metals to the soil adsorption sites 3 more accurate prediction models need to be established based on

based on the table 1 ca is found in ca due to cockleshell si al and fe were detected in the ca due to presence of zeolites bentonite and cement bet characteristics of ca are shown in table 2 based on table 2 the surface area of the ca is high which could improve the adsorption process via ca fig 2 shows several pores on the ca given the presence of zeolites bentonite cockleshell biochar and cement ca can perform ion exchange and adsorption process simultaneously 3 1 cod and ammonia removal as mentioned above two reactors namely first reactor sbr ca and second reactor sbr were run as shown in fig 3 the performance of first reactor in removing cod and ammonia was more than the second reactor in synthetic wastewater initial concentration of cod and ammonia were 150 mg l 1 and 120 mg l 1 respectively minimum removal of cod and ammonia were 61 4 mg l 1 40 9 and 52 9 mg l 1 44 1 at react time 2 h the maximum abatement of cod and ammonia were 138 6 mg l 1 92 4 and 114 2 mg l 1 95 2 at contact time 24 h however the removal performance of cod and ammonia was almost stable from react time 14 h to 24 h it shows that most part of the cod and the ammonia could be eliminated at contact time 14 h de costa et al 2008 reported a removal of 73 96 of cod and 50 99 of ammonia using a hybrid sbr during urban wastewater treatment for the second reactor minimum removal of cod and ammonia were 41 1 mg l 1 27 4 and 39 7 mg l 1 33 1 at react time 2 h the maximum elimination of cod and ammonia were 82 7 mg l 1 55 1 and 73 2 mg l 1 61 0 at contact time 24 h interestingly the abatement performance of cod and ammonia was almost stable from reaction time 20 h to 24 h it shows that most part of the cod and the ammonia could be eliminated at contact time 20h mojiri et al 2014 eliminated up to 46 3 of cod from landfill leachate with conventional sbr as shown in fig 3 ca could improve the abatement of cod and ammonia from wastewater kotoulas et al 2019 stated that zeolite is an

reactor and the second reactor 2 mg l 1 respectively kim et al 2014 removed up to 54 of diazepam from a wastewater treatment plant including activated sludge process and filtration the removal effectiveness of atn is lower than the elimination effectiveness of cip and dia in both reactors because of low biodegradability of atn marques et al 2018 the better performance of first reactor could be explained by adding ca in the sbr there were some low cost materials in the structure of ca which have been reported in removing pharmaceuticals and enhancing microbial community in previous studies rossner et al 2009 and amin et al 2016 expressed that clays such as bentonite and zeolites are natural effectual adsorbents for abatement of organic micropollutants besides researchers yen and yang 2016 bentley and summers 2020 kearns et al 2020 reported that shell and biochar are effective in eliminating organic micropollutants from wastewaters sima et al 2017 expressed that the performance of activated sludge process could be enhanced by adding biochar in the system ziganshina et al 2015 stated that zeolites are also remarked as materials with high capacity to immobilize microorganisms on their surfaces and to enhance microbial community besides zeolites have a positive effect on removing contaminants and regulation of ph zhao et al 2019 reported that a positive effect of bentonite in maintain the system stability during anaerobic treatment of activated sludge 3 3 process optimisation 3 3 1 optimisation with rsm table 3 and figs 5 and 6 show the details of

concentration 1 91 mg l 1 maximum dia removal was 56 9 at the optimum contact time 24 h and the initial concentration 1 99 mg l 1 and maximum cip removal was 57 2 at the optimum contact time 24 h and the initial concentration 2 33 mg l 1 the best removal of atn 56 3 1 306 mg l 1 cip 57 2 1 327 mg l 1 and dia 57 4 1 331 mg l 1 at the initial concentration of 2 32 mg l 1 and the react time 24 0 h

not require any prior structural knowledge of the relations that exist between principal variables and procedures to be modelled güçlü and dursun 2010 due to its accuracy of prediction the employing of artificial neural network ann to model wastewater treatment procedure has gained attentions mojiri et al 2019a influence of two vital factors comprising initial concentration of mps mg l 1 and react time h on mps removal was investigated and modelled by the ann the most important part of ann is the training system the training ann was done by the lm training algorithm with using 60 of data the performance of modelling and the r 2 of elimination efficacies for the first reactor and the second reactor are shown in figs 7 to 9 and the other details about the ann process are shown in figs a 4 to a 5 in supplementary file the mean squared error of the established networks became more reasonable with increase in the number of neurons from 1 to 5 the established ann model was verified for its validity by comparison model predicted values and experiments vales high r 2 values more than 0 99 specified that ann optimised the abatement of pharmaceuticals in a logical aspect mojiri et al 2019b dolatabadi et al 2020 reported high r 2 values 0 91 to 0 96 in applying ann for optimization of pharmaceuticals removal by modified zeolite which is in line with current study see figs 8 and 10

ca can perform ion exchange and adsorption process simultaneously 3 1 cod and ammonia removal as mentioned above two reactors namely first reactor sbr ca and second reactor sbr were run as shown in fig 3 the performance of first reactor in removing cod and ammonia was more than the second reactor in synthetic wastewater initial concentration of cod and ammonia were 150 mg l 1 and 120 mg l 1 respectively minimum removal of cod and ammonia were 61 4 mg l 1 40 9 and 52 9 mg l 1 44 1 at react time 2 h the maximum abatement of cod and ammonia were 138 6 mg l 1 92 4 and 114 2 mg l 1 95 2 at contact time 24 h however the removal performance of cod and ammonia was almost stable from react time 14 h to 24 h it shows that most part of the cod and the ammonia could be eliminated at contact

reactor and the second reactor 2 mg l 1 respectively kim et al 2014 removed up to 54 of diazepam from a wastewater treatment plant including activated sludge process and filtration the removal effectiveness of atn is lower than the elimination effectiveness of cip and dia in both reactors because of low biodegradability of atn marques et al 2018 the better performance of first reactor could be explained by adding ca in the sbr there were some low cost materials in the structure of ca which have been reported in removing pharmaceuticals and enhancing microbial community in previous studies rossner et al 2009 and amin et al 2016 expressed that clays such as bentonite and zeolites are natural effectual adsorbents for abatement of organic micropollutants besides researchers yen and yang 2016 bentley and summers 2020 kearns et al 2020 reported that shell and biochar are effective in eliminating organic micropollutants from wastewaters sima et al 2017 expressed that the performance of activated sludge process could be enhanced by adding biochar in the system ziganshina et al 2015 stated that zeolites are also remarked as materials with high capacity to immobilize microorganisms on their surfaces and to enhance microbial community besides zeolites have a positive effect on removing contaminants and regulation of ph zhao et al 2019 reported that a positive effect of bentonite in maintain the system stability during anaerobic treatment of activated sludge 3 3 process optimisation 3 3 1 optimisation with rsm table 3 and figs 5 and 6 show the details of

not require any prior structural knowledge of the relations that exist between principal variables and procedures to be modelled güçlü and dursun 2010 due to its accuracy of prediction the employing of artificial neural network ann to model wastewater treatment procedure has gained attentions mojiri et al 2019a influence of two vital factors comprising initial concentration of mps mg l 1 and react time h on mps removal was investigated and modelled by the ann the most important part of ann is the training system the training ann was done by the lm training algorithm with using 60 of data

vital tests for monitoring reusability of an adsorbent the methanol was employed for regenerating adsorbent mostly researchers fillippa et al 2016 fard and barkdoll 2018 employed methanol during regenerating adsorbent after removal of pharmaceuticals it can be justified due to high solubility of organic micropollutants in alcohols because of the hydroxyl groups apart from that the restoration capability of methanol is higher than that of ethanol mojiri et al 2019a as shown in fig 11 the ca could be employed for at least six times without any significant change in the performance 4

1488,geochemical systems are known to exhibit highly variable spatiotemporal behavior this may be observed both in non smooth concentration curves in space for a single sampling time and also in variability between samples taken from the same location at different times however most models that are designed to simulate these systems provide only single solution smooth curves and fail to capture the noise and variability seen in the data we apply a recently developed reactive particle tracking method to a system that displays highly complex geochemical behavior when the method is made to most closely resemble a corresponding eulerian method in its unperturbed form we see near exact match between solutions of the two models more importantly we consider two approaches for perturbing the model and find that the spatially perturbed condition is able to capture a greater degree of the variability present in the data this method of perturbation is a task to which particle methods are uniquely suited and eulerian models are not well suited additionally because of the nature of the algorithm noisy spatial gradients can be highly resolved by a large number of mobile particles and this incurs negligible computational cost as compared to expensive chemistry calculations keywords lagrangian modeling particle methods imperfect mixing diffusion reaction equation heavy metal cycling 1 introduction chemical reactions are ubiquitous in hydrologic systems and play a controlling role in the small and large scale behavior of many systems of practical interest e g dentz et al 2011 valocchi et al 2018 however predicting complex reactions in realistic environmental settings which are typically characterized by high degrees of heterogeneity and uncertainty with multiple processes occurring at different spatial and temporal scales still remains a demanding challenge many theoretical e g le borgne et al 2010 kitanidis 1994 engdahl et al 2014 de barros et al 2012 ranz 1979 le borgne et al 2015 and computational approaches e g steefel et al 2005 mayer et al 2002 beisman et al 2015 benson and meerschaert 2008 have and continue to be developed to tackle this issue on the computational side methods for simulating reactive transport broadly fall into two categories eulerian and lagrangian defined in broad terms eulerian methods are grid based methods while lagrangian methods are gridless to date eulerian methods e g classical finite difference volume or element methods are most commonly used these employ a spatial grid on which chemical species move in accordance with discretized forms of mass balance laws such that they approximate transport governed by advection and dispersion to simulate chemical reactions each grid block is treated as a well mixed volume and reactions are calculated based on the average concentrations of species residing within that volume advantages of eulerian methods include their intuitive nature relative ease of implementation parallelization and the large body of mathematical research and justification supporting them this has led to their widespread use in various industrial and research applications xu et al 2014 steefel 2009 parkhurst and appelo 2013 prommer 2006 however such methods also suffer from a variety of important drawbacks such as the introduction of spurious numerical diffusion in the simulation of advection sweby 1984 leonard 1991 leveque 2002 and an inability in their most basic implementation to capture fluctuations in concentration or mixing below scales resolved by the numerical grid oftentimes strongly non linear reactions cause the concentration fluctuations to dominate overall reaction rates relative to the means it should be noted that there are strategies that allow eulerian methods to capture subgrid mixing variability for instance by the application of a block scale dispersion rubin et al 1999 rubin et al 2003 de barros and rubin 2011 de barros and dentz 2016 or higher order closures porta et al 2012 porta et al 2013 but these also come with limitations as a result if the system of interest requires capturing small scale fluctuations which can be important in the context of reactions battiato and tartakovsky 2011 battiato et al 2009 a very finely discretized grid is required and may lead to high computational overhead particularly as numerical stability conditions dictated by advective velocity or dispersive diffusive strength impose restrictive time steps e g δt δx 2 c for some number c alternatively upscaling and the inclusion of additional closure terms that account for subscale effects can be included in the governing equations but these too present significant challenges and restrictions depending on the complexity of reactions and competition between transport and reaction time scales battiato and tartakovsky 2011 battiato et al 2009 schwede et al 2008 benson et al 2019 while empirical adjustments to reaction rates can often lead to better agreement between measurements and models the physical basis for these adjustments calibrations can be questionable and typically cannot be scaled to other systems of interest agreement is often only obtained through unphysical calibration and tweaking of model parameters which works for hind casting and observation fitting but highlights the unphysical basis of many of these models and reveals problems with their use in a truly predictive sense lagrangian methods often referred to as particle tracking pt do not employ a static spatial grid but rather discretize mass or concentrations into numerical particles whose locations evolve in time again following rules designed to capture advection and dispersion processes generally speaking one can define three sub classes of these methods grouped here according to how they simulate dispersion typically dictated by the needs of the model one group simulates dispersion using random walks alone benson and meerschaert 2008 paster et al 2013 paster et al 2014 benson et al 2017 bolster et al 2016 ding et al 2013 ding and benson 2015 ding et al 2017 schmidt et al 2017 sole mari et al 2017 sole mari and fernàndez garcia 2018 sole mari et al 2019a a second simulates dispersion via mass transfer between and among particles that do not random walk and whose positions can only change by advection herrera et al 2009 herrera and beckie 2012 schmidt et al 2018 the third group combines the random walk and mass transfer approaches engdahl et al 2017 herrera et al 2017 benson and bolster 2016 schmidt et al 2019 sole mari et al 2019b providing these algorithms the flexibility to model the distinct processes of mixing and spreading separately for methods that simulate dispersion via mass transfer there are two subdivisions whose equivalence under specific modeling assumptions was recently shown sole mari et al 2019b smoothed particle hydrodynamics sph methods herrera et al 2009 herrera and beckie 2012 gingold and monaghan 1977 monaghan 2012 and mass transfer particle tracking mtpt methods schmidt et al 2018 engdahl et al 2017 benson and bolster 2016 schmidt et al 2019 engdahl et al 2019 in this work we focus on the group of hybrid pt methods that use both random walks and mass transfer to simulate dispersion some key advantages of particle tracking methods include a lack of numerical diffusion when simulating advection and a natural ability to model arbitrarily steep concentration gradients and thus the incomplete mixing inherent to many natural systems because particle positions evolve continuously with time regions of chemical heterogeneity can evolve move and change size with time with arbitrarily fine resolution so there is no homogeneity cutoff as exists at the grid scale of an eulerian method also recent work has allowed for the parallelization of these algorithms significantly reducing computational times engdahl et al 2019 rizzo et al 2019 however important drawbacks also arise from these methods first the body of literature supporting pt methods is still relatively young and there are open questions relating to the optimal particle number or time step length utilized in simulations schmidt et al 2017 additionally while it has been conjectured empirically demonstrated and semi analytically confirmed that these particle methods are simulating a perturbed reactive transport system paster et al 2014 schmidt et al 2017 it is not clearly understood how different methods of perturbing the simulation correspond to observable heterogeneities in the real world to date these approaches have only been applied to relatively simple reactive systems consisting of a somewhat small number of reactive components and reactions in order to address these challenges we apply the mobile immobile reactive particle tracking mirpt model of schmidt et al 2019 that allows for interaction between aqueous mobile solutes and immobile mineral phases to simulate a chemically complex benchmark system in the course of this application we examine the effects of a key modeling choice that is inherent to the mirpt algorithm the choice of how to represent solid species via immobile particles specifically what happens if we perturb this representation and what is the meaning of different types of perturbations as it relates to reactant inhomogeneity or imperfect mixing from a physical perspective it seems intuitive that the spatial configuration of solid species should influence the results of a reactive transport simulation in order to capture a highly heterogeneous state eulerian methods would require an increased level of spatial discretization to resolve solid species distributions driving up computation times and imposing stricter stability conditions in fact due to the computational burden imposed by such conditions the family of particle tracking models considered in this work tend to display run times significantly lower than first order eulerian methods and less than half that of a more accurate 3rd order method benson et al 2017 this particular particle tracking method mirpt offers increased flexibility in its ability to capture heterogeneity for a sufficient number of immobile particles a user may distribute them in space in a fully controllable manner this may be done to fit a desired continuous distribution incurring no extra computational cost as no increase in discretization is required also due to the local nature of particle methods in that particles that are not near one another do not interact via mass transfer they are able to capture poor mixing in a way that eulerian models cannot additionally without increasing model complexity the user may run an ensemble of such simulations in order to inform descriptive statistics about the system rather than just obtaining point estimates the test problem we use to investigate the above mentioned issues is presented in arora et al 2015 wherein the authors consider the problem of heavy metal cycling in lake sediments henceforth referred to as the hmls system the authors use the system as a benchmark to compare several popular and state of the art eulerian reactive transport models toughreact xu et al 2014 crunchflow steefel 2009 phreeqc parkhurst and appelo 2013 parkhurst and wissmeier 2015 and pht3d prommer 2006 a selection of the results of this benchmark study are shown in fig 2 in which their results are compared to experimental data from winowiecki 2002 note that while all of the eulerian models yield nearly identical results none of them capture the variability in the data nor do they capture visible fluctuations of certain species this is most evident in fig 2 f depicting pb 2 where we see an order of magnitude difference between the two data plots and a non smooth distribution of the data in space neither of these is captured by the single solution smooth curves provided by the eulerian models but this variability is exactly the type of behavior that can be captured by our stochastic particle tracking model especially when using an ensemble of realizations employing perturbed conditions we wish to note here that our primary goal in this work is to investigate how transport modeling choices affect the results of a geochemical model as such within our various particle models we employ exactly the same phreeqc input file as was used in arora et al 2015 which was provided by the authors this is to say that we aim to test if we can better capture certain characteristics of the data without any alteration of geochemical parameters or methods we organize our investigation of this benchmark reactive transport system as follows in section 2 we discuss the mathematical model and describe relevant physical processes in section 3 we describe how a finite difference method later used as a base case for comparison with our pt models is implemented and provide details germane to our implementation of the mirpt algorithm in section 4 we outline the results of simulating the hmls system with the mirpt algorithm where we develop unperturbed and perturbed models finally conclusions are presented in section 6 2 governing model 2 1 conceptual description generally speaking our model concerns a diffusion reaction transport system driven by the vertical diffusion of solute into a sediment lake bed that is treated as a 1 dimensional column for brevity we refer the reader to the work of arora et al arora et al 2015 for a highly detailed description of the system and chemical reactions involved see fig 1 for their schematic diagram here we provide only a brief synopsis of the principal physico chemical processes in general the system represents a transition from oxic conditions at an upper lake water boundary to anoxic or reducing conditions deeper in the sediment column oxygenated water with an electron donor food source of acetate is present in the lake water and enters the column from the top microbial aerobic respiration converts the acetate to carbonate ions represented here by total alkalinity and reduces aqueous phase electron acceptors in order of preference or ease of conversion o2 nitrate no3 fe 3 and sulfate so4 2 reductive dissolution of solid phase in the lake sediments ferrihydrite fe oh 3 in this sequence also releases metals sorbed to the mineral surface including lead and zinc these dissolved metals and associated aqueous complexes may diffuse back into the upper boundary lake water or react with biogenically produced sulfide from sulfate reduction in the lake sediments and precipitate as solid sulfide minerals 2 2 mathematical formulation the mathematical model we consider is governed by the 1d diffusion reaction equation dre 1 t ϕ c i d c i x 2 r i c 1 c n k 1 k m i 1 n x ω ℝ t 0 where c i t x mol m 3 is the concentration of chemical species i ϕ dimensionless is porosity d m2 s 1 is the diffusion coefficient defined to be constant and equal for all aqueous species and zero for solid species and r i mol m 3 s 1 is a source sink term representing chemical reaction that for each species i is a function of some number of the n species and m reaction coefficients k j the system that we focus on is referred to as the biotic case or base case in the work of arora et al arora et al 2015 their schematic diagram is reproduced in fig 1 but we also summarize here in this system the modeling domain ω is a vertically oriented sediment column of length l 0 4 m in the downward direction i e ω 0 0 0 4 the initial condition ic is homogeneous throughout the domain and consists of a specific distribution of the species of chemical reactants see arora et al 2015 table 6 the boundary conditions bcs are dirichlet constant and equivalent to the initial condition at the upper boundary x 0 or sediment lake water interface and neumann zero flux at the lower boundary x l which represents the lake bed such that 2 c i t 0 x c i 0 c i t x 0 c i 0 i 1 n x c i t x l 0 a table showing the initial concentrations c i 0 for key chemical species of interest is given in table 1 note that the initial pore water chemistry has not yet been allowed to equilibrate with the mineral phases in the sediments as to the values of relevant model parameters we use those found in arora et al 2015 table 5 namely ϕ 0 47 d 4 27 10 10 m2 s 1 and a total simulation time of t 5 years we clarify here that based on the description in arora et al 2015 of the problem and correspondence of our numerical results section 4 with theirs holding porosity constant in time appears to be the appropriate modeling choice in this case as such we absorb ϕ into d and the reactive term for an effective diffusion coefficient of d d ϕ 9 09 10 10 m2 s 1 chemical reaction parameters are not discussed here as they are defined within a phreeqc input file and database that were provided by the authors of arora et al 2015 so as to match those used

2020 3 numerical implementation in order to re create the results of arora et al 2015 and consider the effect of spatial perturbations in the pt model we consider two numerical approaches a finite difference fd model that we use as a base case for comparison and one employing the miprt algorithm schmidt et al 2019 both models use the phreeqcrm reaction module parkhurst and wissmeier 2015 for chemistry calculations which is driven by the phreeqc input file and database provided by the authors of arora et al 2015 3 1 finite difference model the fd model we use as a base case is on a regularly spaced grid explicit in time and second order centered in space we use an operator splitting approach between diffusion and reaction calculations we choose a spatial grid with spatial step size δx 1 cm implying a number of cells n c l δx 40 in contrast to arora et al 2015 which uses 46 cells spaced by 0 5 cm for the top 8 and by 1 cm for the rest of the domain we consider three different time step lengths of δt 259 2592 25920 s so as to calibrate our model by exploring the range of time step lengths explored by arora et al 2015 while obeying the von neumann stability condition d δ t δ x 2 1 2 3 2 particle tracking model the pt model we use employs the mirpt algorithm of schmidt et al 2019 that algorithm is based on bolster et al 2016 which reformulated reactive pt algorithms in terms of mass reduction rather than a particle killing approach the work of benson and bolster 2016 extended this algorithm such that particles could carry an arbitrary number of chemical species that are transferred among particles via diffusive mass transfer and engdahl et al 2017 added phreeqcrm parkhurst and wissmeier 2015 to handle complex geochemical reactions between the species the algorithm of schmidt et al 2019 further added the capability for fluid solid mobile immobile interactions for this implementation we partition the total effective diffusion of the system such that 3 d d rw d mi d im where d rw d mi and d im are the portions of the total diffusion simulated by random walks mobile to immobile mass transfers and immobile to mobile mass transfers respectively we impose values of d 0 5 0 25 0 25 this means that half of the total diffusion in the system is simulated by random walking mobile particles and the remaining half is simulated by the two directions of mass transfer for the purposes of this project these values were chosen ad hoc though it has been suggested that properly calibrating this partitioning allows for separate simulation of the distinct processes of mixing and spreading schmidt et al 2018 sole mari et al 2019b for a discussion of the effect of these modeling choices see appendix a in schmidt et al 2019 the time step lengths that we employ are chosen so as to correspond to the results given by the finite difference simulations and so we consider δt 259 2592 25920 s the number of mobile particles n m is held to be 4000 for all simulations though we consider different numbers of immobile particles n i depending on the effects we wish to examine for the base unperturbed case we consider n i 40 100 400 and for the perturbed cases we consider n i 100 400 the reason for the disparity between n i and n m is that we wish to highly resolve spatial gradients with a large number of mobile particles because transport calculations are computationally cheap however because the highly expensive chemistry calculations are conducted on the immobile particles we would like to minimize n i to the smallest appropriate level to put numbers to this concept when employing n i n m 40 4000 and running on a laptop machine the chemistry calculations are o 100 times more expensive than all of the transport calculations within a time step despite the chemistry calculations being conducted in parallel on 4 cores and the transport being conducted in serial finally the zero flux neumann condition at x l is enforced as a reflecting boundary szymczak and ladd 2003 3 2 1 reformulated optimality condition here we provide a brief discussion of the optimality condition for the mirpt algorithm schmidt et al 2019 in particular the simulation constraint attempts to ensure that the maximum average inter particle spacing whether of mobile or immobile particles is of the same order as the magnitude of the system s diffusion within a time step of length δt as such there should always be a nearby mobile or immobile particle to receive mass transfers from a given particle of the opposite type violation of this condition does not necessarily lead to unstable solutions that blow up as occurs when one violates a von neumann stability condition in a finite difference simulation instead the accuracy of the solution degrades in a relatively steady manner as we move further from the prescribed optimal values of η 4 η l min n i n m 2 d δ t 1 we acknowledge that many of the previously mentioned choices of discretization parameters n i n m δt violate this condition in schmidt et al 2019 n i and n m were always close to the same order of magnitude while here this is not feasible due to the highly expensive chemistry calculations i e we always choose to have fewer immobile particles in order to minimize the cost of these chemistry calculations as a result a more nuanced formulation of this condition is presented for our purposes we would like to enforce a condition such that for a given transfer denoted mi for mobile to immobile and vice versa im the expected distance between two particles of opposite species is less than the standard diffusion distance ℓ 2 d δ t this is motivated by the fact that the weighting kernel for mass transfers is a gaussian function with bandwidth variance that is proportional to ℓ and maintaining an expected inter particle spacing on this order ensures that mass transfers will be non negligible this inter particle distance is maximized when a particle is located directly between two particles of the opposite species so in the case of an mi transfer the maximum distance of a mobile particle to the nearest immobile particle is l 2n i thus we would reformulate the individual optimality conditions for a given mi or im transfer as l 2 n i 2 d δ t 1 and l 2 n m 2 d δ t 1 or upon simplifying these expressions 5 η mi l n i 2 d δ t 8 η im l n m 2 d δ t 8 hence we choose all values of n i n m and δt in the following sections so as to satisfy these conditions 4 results next we examine the effect of various modeling choices on the results of simulating the hmls system via the mirpt algorithm all plots in this section depict final time results 5 years within the domain for relevant chemical species and ph corresponding to those from figs 3 and 4 of arora et al arora et al 2015 which are reproduced in fig 2 for reference the plots that correspond to arora et al 2015 fig 3 depict final concentrations of key chemical markers including important aqueous ions ph and alkalinity and they aim to recreate experimental data from winowiecki 2002 we obtained a copy of the winowiecki thesis winowiecki 2002 which includes the data that is used by arora et al 2015 the data in the thesis include two trials at two different sampling times summer and fall of 2001 and we portray all of this data in order to highlight its variability note that the two data scatters in arora et al 2015 depict summer trial 2 and fall trial 1 in figs 3 6 and 8 we plot the data for ph sulfate fe 2 and pb plots a and d f respectively note however that there are not two trials for each sampling for ph so only two data scatters are shown in plot a the plots that correspond to arora et al 2015 fig 4 depict the percentage difference between initial and final amounts of three secondary iron species for which there is not data but whose behavior would be affected by the presence of the previously mentioned aqueous ions the code used to generate the results is implemented in fortran using the intel fortran compiler version 16 0 1 geochemical calculations are performed using the phreeqcrm library parkhurst and wissmeier 2015 compiled using openmp that takes advantage of the natural parallelism of reaction calculations the simulations were run on nodes of a linux cluster running centos release 6 9 for reference using a 16 core node to run the base case particle tracking simulations discussed in section 4 2 with δt 25920 s employing 4000 mobile particles n m and n i 40 100 400 immobile particles results in run times of 52 min 2 h and 7 75 h respectively all of the code used to generate the results in this section including the data from winowiecki 2002 may be found at doi https doi org 10 5281 zenodo 3731275 schmidt 2020 4 1 verification we first verify that the results of arora et al arora et al 2015 can be recreated by implementing the fd simulation described in section 3 1 the results of running fd simulations for values of δt ranging three orders of magnitude corresponding to the time steps used in the eulerian models of arora et al 2015 are displayed in fig 3 and show that for this model the length of the time step does not appear to result in a significant difference in the results all plots shown in fig 3 demonstrate nearly identical behavior and correspond closely to those shown in fig 3 of arora et al 2015 reproduced here in fig 2 one noticeable difference however is the appearance of slight changes in the upper x 0 boundary concentrations of nitrate no3 fig 3 c related to the chemistry calculations performed by phreeqcrm such deviations occur as the authors of arora et al 2015 note in their provided phreeqc input file because equilibrium is never reached for nitrate under the conditions they consider this is evidenced by the discrepancy between initial boundary concentrations and concentrations within the domain at the x 0 boundary the magnitude of which appears to be highly dependent on time step length thus a longer time step results in more consumption of the nitrate entering at the upper boundary explaining the lower concentrations as the time step is increased the authors also note the same for sulfate so4 2 fig 3 d though the effects are less dramatic in these fd cases the results shown in fig 3 indicate that little error is induced in the chemistry calculations by choosing a time step in the given range and provided that it does not introduce error in the transport calculations we may consider time step lengths in this range for pt simulations 4 2 particle tracking results for base case model now that the fd simulations have been faithfully reproduced we will use the mirpt algorithm to model the hmls system we first verify that the prior results are produced in the case of equally spaced immobile particles fig 4 displays the results of pt simulations for immobile particles that are equally spaced across the domain and possess the same initial concentrations as in the fd case we compare these to the finest time discretization of the fd results though they were similar for all tested values of δt we find close agreement between most of the pt simulations and the fd results with the cases of n i δt 40 100 25920 and n i δt 400 259 2592 all displaying nearly identical behavior these pt simulations diverge from the fd results in the case of nitrate and sulfate concentrations no3 and so4 2 fig 4 c and d respectively however this difference is attributable to the effect of the time step on the chemistry calculations as described in section 4 1 the other differences occur in the alkalinity fig 4 b but are relatively small we note that the n i 400 simulations seem to resolve a sharper gradient in pb concentration at the upper boundary x 0 than the fd or n i 40 100 cases with a smaller time step corresponding to a sharper apparent gradient the one simulation that shows the most significant difference from the other pt simulations is the n i δt 400 25920 case though these differences are still minor both in comparison to the fd simulation and the remaining pt simulations overall the pt and fd models yield highly comparable results 4 3 perturbation analysis for particle tracking model next we investigate the mirpt model described in section 3 2 under two different perturbation approaches we first study the effects of perturbing the initial aqueous phase concentrations stored on the evenly spaced immobile particles section 4 3 1 and later study perturbations of the spatial locations of the immobile particles section 4 3 2 see fig 5 for a conceptual depiction of these two perturbation strategies as compared to the unperturbed condition the former approach introduces a level of variability into the initial distribution of reactants without affecting the overall mixedness of the system i e the level of mixing by interaction with mobile species remains the same as in the unperturbed case thus these results should occupy a middle ground between the unperturbed case and the spatially perturbed case in the subsequent section contrastingly the latter approach is meant to physically represent an irregular spatial distribution of solid species which can also be thought of as introducing a poorly mixed condition to the system these spatial gaps between reactants will take time for aqueous mobile species to traverse delaying their contact with other reactive species the associated increase in travel time will lead to a slowdown of reaction speed that should be apparent in the shape and position of reaction fronts we note that initial concentration perturbation considered in section 4 3 1 is a method that can be achieved similarly by using eulerian methods however the position perturbations considered in section 4 3 2 are not so easily achieved with grid based methods and represent a task to which particle tracking methods are uniquely suited in both cases we conduct an ensemble of 100 realizations in order to accurately capture the statistics of the results 4 3 1 perturbations of immobile particle initial concentrations in this section we employ equally spaced immobile particles as in section 4 2 but uniformly perturb the initial concentrations that are stored on these particles this is achieved by choosing an amount α 0 1 and for each species i and immobile particle j perturbing the initial concentration c 0 ij according to a draw from a uniform u 1 α c 0 ij 1 α c 0 ij distribution see fig 5 b for a conceptual depiction of this perturbation strategy in other words we perturb the initial concentration by 100α and for the results of this section we have selected α 0 8 this value results in perturbations of relative significance without the possibility of zero initial concentrations at any particles as zero concentrations cause errors with the geochemical solver for this analysis we run simulations with n i δt 100 25920 and n i δt 400 2592 25920 the results for these levels of discretization were similar enough that we only depict and discuss n i δt 100 25920 fig 6 shows the final time concentrations for each of the 100 realizations and fig 7 shows the ensemble mean blue markers and 1 and 2 standard deviations of the concentration ensemble results yellow and orange error bars respectively in all plots we compare to the unperturbed solution of section 4 2 solid black line and we also show the data from winowiecki 2002 in selected plots so that we may compare to the results in the following section in which the positions of immobile particles were randomly chosen and differ for each member of the ensemble the ensemble mean and standard deviations were computed by binning concentrations into equally spaced bins the bin size is chosen such that at least one particle is in each bin and this resulted in 19 bins 4 3 2 perturbations of immobile particle spatial positions in this section we consider the effect of spatial perturbations to the positions of immobile particles to do this we set the positions of immobile particles according to random draws from a uniform distribution u 0 0 0 4 and set the initial concentrations on each immobile particle to be the same as in the previous equally spaced case see table 1 see fig 5 c for a conceptual depiction of this perturbation strategy an ensemble of 100 realizations is then conducted each with a different spatial distribution of immobile particles as in section 4 3 1 we perform simulations for n i δt 100 25920 and n i δt 400 2592 25920 and find the combination n i δt 100 25920 to be sufficiently representative so that we only depict and discuss those results in fig 8 we plot a selection of 3 realizations out of the 100 conducted a plot depicting the full 100 member ensemble results may be found at doi https doi org 10 5281 zenodo 3731275 schmidt 2020 and we specifically choose these three realizations so as to demonstrate the spatial variability that may be induced by this type of perturbation fig 9 depicts the ensemble mean blue markers and 1 and 2 standard deviations of the concentration ensemble results yellow and orange error bars respectively in all plots we compare to the unperturbed solution of section 4 2 solid black line and we also show the data from winowiecki 2002 in selected plots as mentioned in the previous section we bin the ensemble data into 19 equally spaced bins to compute the statistics plotted in fig 9 5 discussion here we discuss the results of section 4 section 5 1 contains a numerical perspective on the results generated by the two perturbation methods presented in 4 3 for ease of discussion we will refer to the perturbations of immobile particle initial concentrations of section 4 3 1 as the cp concentration perturbation case and the perturbations of immobile particle spatial positions of section 4 3 2 as the sp spatial perturbation case in contrast section 5 2 is a geochemical discussion of the results 5 1 numerical discussion of perturbation analysis inspection of fig 6 shows that the spread of the simulated results for the cp results is relatively narrow this is due to the fact that while the perturbations discussed in this section do create an initially noisy distribution of reactants with areas of reactant scarcity the overall mixing present in the system is unaltered thus the speed of reactions is not substantially reduced and final time concentrations are perturbed symmetrically about the mean value of the unperturbed case for the most part this behavior is more clearly evident in fig 7 where we see very close match between the ensemble means and the unperturbed case the exception to this present in nearly every plot is that the position of reaction fronts spatial gradients tends to be pushed upward or delayed as compared to the unperturbed reference solution this indicates that the initial concentration perturbations do have a measurable effect on mixing and reaction rates though not as significant as in the sp case another behavior of interest observed in fig 6 is that the concentration curves for the different realizations are for the most part parallel both to one another and to the reference unperturbed solution the exceptions to this generalization are pb and fes pb displays some minor crossing of curves while fes displays highly oscillatory behavior in the case of fes the reason for this is most likely related to the extremely low initial concentration of aqueous sulfur in the unperturbed case c 0 sulfur o 10 28 and as a result any perturbation of this quantity will magnify the amount of fes that precipitates as for pb we first note that these fluctuations are reflected in the data shown in fig 2 f leading to the conclusion that this type of perturbation may be more representative of the true conditions than the domain wide constant initial condition employed in the unperturbed case our explanation for the observed behavior in fig 6 f is related to the shape of the concentration curve at the final time it is the only species that does not display a smooth reaction front that spans the domain and instead contains inflection points other than ph but the behavior of ph is much more smooth and tightly constrained as such slight shifts in the position of the local maxima and minima of pb these can also be thought of as local reaction fronts can have magnified downstream effects in the results plotted in fig 9 we see a much greater degree of intra ensemble concentration variability than that of fig 7 this indicates that a perturbed spatial distribution of solid species has a magnified impact on the results of hmls reactive transport simulations as compared to merely perturbing the initial concentrations fig 9 shows that alkalinity pb and siderite are quite sensitive to these spatial perturbations and all display a high degree of variability throughout the domain physically this is due to several biotic reactions that consume acetate and an electron donor e g o2 no3 fe 3 and so4 2 to produce bicarbonate thereby increasing alkalinity for this reason the primary electron donors nitrate no3 and sulfate so4 2 display a similar degree of variability near the upper boundary x 0 and fe 2 and pb show a lesser degree of variability also mainly focused near the upper boundary all species display the greatest variability in concentration where large magnitude gradients or fronts exist likely because these fronts indicate regions in which a given species is out of chemical equilibrium after diffusing some small distance a sufficiently large gap between immobile particles will slow down reaction rates in that area because aqueous mobile species will take time to travel some portion of this distance before they can become eligible for reaction such reasoning also explains the greater variability in alkalinity as compared to other quantities because it displays a front that spans the entire domain at final time while nitrate sulfate fe 2 and pb are nearly constant throughout much of the domain one of the more important aspects of these sp simulations may be observed most clearly in fig 9 in particular for species that display relatively stable final time behavior e g ph nitrate sulfate or ferrihydrite their ensemble mean value closely matches the unperturbed solution however for species that display sharp gradients at final time the ensemble mean tends to lag behind the unperturbed solution in relation to the direction the species is traveling by diffusion confirming that spatial gaps slow down reaction fronts additionally in fig 8 we see that the depicted concentration curves are non smooth and do not parallel the unperturbed solution as they do in fig 6 this more closely approximates the noise and variability we see in the data which is also non smooth in space within a single sample in fact if we compare figs 6 f and 8 f we see that the results in fig 8 f more closely capture the oscillation and spread of the data as such it is likely that the true distribution of solids involves a spatially perturbed condition that alters mixing as in the sp case rather than just perturbed concentrations as in the cp case 5 2 geochemical discussion even in the relatively simple geochemical system explored here heterogeneity can play a role in spatial distribution of geochemical processes pb exhibits the greatest variation in aqueous concentrations within the original data likely due to the sorption of pb to mineral and organic surfaces controlling the concentrations in the original modeling of arora et al and the modeling performed here ferrihydrite is the only mineral surface pb is allowed to sorb to and ferrihydrite has a homogeneous surface area in natural systems surface area of ferrihydrite can vary and other mineral or organic surfaces may be available for metal sorption adding additional heterogeneity in these parameters may permit better fitting of the variations in concentrations but the model fits the general distributions with higher concentrations in the subsurface decreasing upward toward the water sediment interface for all the parameters evaluated the biggest differences between unperturbed and perturbed simulations are observed around the active reaction front where consumption of oxygen through acetate oxidation changes redox conditions and drives reduction of aqueous fe 3 and subsequent dissolution of ferrihydrite the cascading effect of heterogeneity on myriad geochemical processes in a single system is observed in this case study as well when comparing simulation results from the unperturbed case and the immobile particle position perturbation case sp alkalinity shows the largest deviation with higher alkalinity concentrations at depth 0 2 m in the perturbed case compared to the unperturbed case fig 8 b the higher concentrations of carbonate ions at depth lead to more siderite precipitation fig 8 i carbonate is produced from the oxidation of acetate suggesting that more acetate is oxidized and more oxygen is consumed when particles are distributed heterogeneously randomly than when they are distributed homogeneously evenly as more oxygen is consumed more iron is reduced and more ferrihydrite dissolves releasing pb into solution and more sulfate is reduced to hs and leads to fes precipitation fig 8 h heterogeneous distribution of solid phases also impacts the positioning of the reaction front in this case with shallower reaction fronts where minerals are heterogeneously distributed these results highlight the importance of considering heterogeneity in geochemical systems when the spatial distributions of geochemical processes are important e g jung and navarre sitchler 2018a jung and navarre sitchler 2018b finally we address the issue of imperfect fit between model and data in terms of concentration magnitude manifesting as horizontal gaps between model plots and data scatters in the figures this is attributed to calibration of the geochemical parameters and the same result is present identically in the results of arora et al arora et al 2015 because we employ the same phreeqc input file for conducting geochemical calculations calibration of these parameters is not the goal of this work and is not something we focus on we are primarily interested in how the transport modeling conditions affect the results of a geochemical model as such we see that given a geochemical model that fails to capture the variability in data our perturbed model does capture the variability caused by imperfect mixing conditions 6 conclusions in this work we have applied the mirpt algorithm of schmidt et al 2019 to model a benchmark reactive transport problem involving heavy metal cycling in lake sediments the hmls system this system was modeled using eulerian methods in arora et al 2015 and those authors achieved favorable and nearly identical results for all considered methods however the smooth curves produced by eulerian models fail to capture the variability inherent to the data see fig 2 in the unperturbed base case implementation section 4 2 we first recreated the results of a corresponding eulerian model with very close match the main differences are a varying resolution of sharp gradients and differing boundary concentrations of nitrate and sulfate the former is typical of varying levels of discretization and the latter is due to the influence of time step length on the ability of these species to reach equilibrium as such we conclude that the mirpt model in the unperturbed case is capable of capturing the same behavior as a corresponding eulerian model the primary focus herein was to investigate the impact of imperfectly mixed reactants on the behavior of a complicated geochemical system eulerian models are not as well suited to represent this kind of physical heterogeneity because they can only do so by increasing discretization leading to a more restrictive time step and a greater number of expensive chemistry calculations during each time step in contrast the lagrangian model used in this work is uniquely suited to this task because the number of chemistry calculations per time step can be fixed by selecting the number of immobile particles within a simulation while still increasing spatial resolution of aqueous species practically for free by increasing the number of mobile particles that appear to explore the effects of imperfect mixing we perturbed the representation of solid species in our model using two different approaches to demonstrate the typical method for perturbing a reactive transport simulation in section 4 3 1 we randomly varied the initial concentrations of reactants on evenly spaced immobile particles this introduced a noisy initial condition to the problem and can also be achieved using eulerian methods the results of this perturbed experiment failed to capture the variability and noise in the data see fig 6 as the variation in results was relatively minor and most results smoothly parallel the unperturbed solution which is closely captured by the ensemble mean this is because the concentration perturbations initially affect the state of the system but are quickly mitigated over the course of the simulation and overall mixing in the system is not affected for large times the more interesting result is found in section 4 3 2 wherein we spatially perturbed simulations by randomly varying the positions of immobile particles this is a method that cannot be explored using eulerian methods because neighboring grid points communicate during every time step which makes it impossible to create the persistent zones of poor mixing that are induced by spatial gaps between immobile particles to be clear eulerian methods can certainly employ a stochastically perturbed grid to mimic part of this behavior however without the mobile particles that carry the reactants through space they will not fully capture this poor mixing due to reactant segregation additionally introducing the perturbations of either sort into the particle tracking simulations required no change to the algorithm while in the case of eulerian models this would be a signifcantly more complicated endeavor than employing an equally spaced grid finally in order to ensure the stability of a spatially perturbed eulerian simulation one would need to choose a time step length corresponding to the smallest spacing in each grid realization leading to unpredictable and possibly prohibitive run times the results of the spatially perturbed experiment are compelling because we see much wider variation in the intra ensemble results see fig 8 and this variance is an important feature of the data that neither the single solution eulerian models nor the alternative perturbation method can fully capture for this reason the spatial perturbation method captures an important real world feature that is neglected by other modeling and simulation methods specifically we are able to capture the slowdown in reaction speed that is induced by poorly mixed conditions ultimately we conjecture though it remains to be rigorously proven that the perturbations in immobile particle position correspond mathematically to perturbations in the magnitude of diffusion present in the system a reasonable and necessary modeling choice when trying to capture the irregular behaviors induced by the inhomogeneity of porous media declaration

1488,geochemical systems are known to exhibit highly variable spatiotemporal behavior this may be observed both in non smooth concentration curves in space for a single sampling time and also in variability between samples taken from the same location at different times however most models that are designed to simulate these systems provide only single solution smooth curves and fail to capture the noise and variability seen in the data we apply a recently developed reactive particle tracking method to a system that displays highly complex geochemical behavior when the method is made to most closely resemble a corresponding eulerian method in its unperturbed form we see near exact match between solutions of the two models more importantly we consider two approaches for perturbing the model and find that the spatially perturbed condition is able to capture a greater degree of the variability present in the data this method of perturbation is a task to which particle methods are uniquely suited and eulerian models are not well suited additionally because of the nature of the algorithm noisy spatial gradients can be highly resolved by a large number of mobile particles and this incurs negligible computational cost as compared to expensive chemistry calculations keywords lagrangian modeling particle methods imperfect mixing diffusion reaction equation heavy metal cycling

computational side methods for simulating reactive transport broadly fall into two categories eulerian and lagrangian defined in broad terms eulerian methods are grid based methods while lagrangian methods are gridless to date eulerian methods e g classical finite difference volume or element methods are most commonly used these employ a spatial grid on which chemical species move in accordance with discretized forms of mass balance laws such that they approximate transport governed by advection and dispersion to simulate chemical reactions each grid block is treated as a well mixed volume and reactions are calculated based on the average concentrations of species residing within that volume advantages of eulerian methods include their intuitive nature relative ease of implementation parallelization and the large body of mathematical research and justification supporting them this has led to their widespread use in various industrial and research applications xu et al 2014 steefel 2009 parkhurst and appelo 2013 prommer 2006 however such methods also suffer from a variety of important drawbacks such as the introduction of spurious numerical diffusion in the simulation of advection sweby 1984 leonard 1991 leveque 2002 and an inability in their most basic implementation to capture fluctuations in concentration or mixing below scales resolved by the numerical grid oftentimes strongly non linear reactions cause the concentration fluctuations to dominate overall reaction rates relative to the means it should be noted that there are strategies that allow eulerian methods to capture subgrid mixing variability for instance by the application of a block scale dispersion rubin et al 1999 rubin et al 2003 de barros and rubin 2011 de barros and dentz 2016 or higher order closures porta et al 2012 porta et al 2013 but these also come with limitations as a result if the system of interest requires capturing small scale fluctuations which can be important in the context of reactions battiato and tartakovsky 2011 battiato et al 2009 a very finely discretized grid is required and may lead to high computational overhead particularly as numerical stability conditions dictated by advective velocity or dispersive diffusive strength impose restrictive time steps e g δt δx 2 c for some number c alternatively upscaling and the inclusion of additional closure terms that account for subscale effects can be included in the governing equations but these too present significant challenges and restrictions depending on the complexity of reactions and competition between transport and reaction time scales battiato and tartakovsky 2011 battiato et al 2009 schwede et al 2008 benson et al 2019 while empirical adjustments to reaction rates can often lead to better agreement between measurements and models the physical basis for these adjustments calibrations can be questionable and typically cannot be scaled to other systems of interest agreement is often only obtained through unphysical calibration and tweaking of model parameters which works for hind casting and observation fitting but highlights the unphysical basis of many of these models and reveals problems with their use in a truly predictive sense lagrangian methods often referred to as particle tracking pt do not employ a static spatial grid but rather discretize mass or concentrations into numerical particles whose locations evolve in time again following rules designed to capture advection and dispersion processes generally speaking one can define three sub classes

subdivisions whose equivalence under specific modeling assumptions was recently shown sole mari et al 2019b smoothed particle hydrodynamics sph methods herrera et al 2009 herrera and beckie 2012 gingold and monaghan 1977 monaghan 2012 and mass transfer particle tracking mtpt methods schmidt et al 2018 engdahl et al 2017 benson and bolster 2016 schmidt et al 2019 engdahl et al 2019 in this work we focus on the group of hybrid pt methods that use both random walks and mass transfer to simulate dispersion some key advantages of particle tracking methods include a lack of numerical diffusion when simulating advection and a natural ability to model arbitrarily steep concentration gradients and thus the incomplete mixing inherent to many natural systems because particle positions evolve continuously with time regions of chemical heterogeneity can evolve move and change size with time with arbitrarily fine resolution so there is no homogeneity cutoff as exists at the grid scale of an eulerian method also recent work has allowed for the parallelization of these algorithms significantly reducing computational times engdahl et al 2019 rizzo et al 2019 however important drawbacks also arise from these methods first the body of literature supporting pt methods is still relatively young and there are open questions relating to the optimal particle number or time step length utilized in simulations schmidt et al 2017 additionally while it has been conjectured empirically demonstrated and semi analytically confirmed that these particle methods are simulating a perturbed reactive transport system paster et al 2014 schmidt et al 2017 it is not clearly understood how different methods of perturbing the simulation correspond to observable heterogeneities in the real world to date these approaches have only been applied to relatively simple reactive systems consisting of a somewhat small number of reactive components and reactions in order to address these challenges we apply the mobile immobile reactive particle tracking mirpt model of schmidt et al 2019 that allows for interaction between aqueous mobile solutes and immobile mineral phases to simulate a chemically complex benchmark system in the course of this application we examine the effects of a key modeling choice that is inherent to the mirpt algorithm the choice of how to represent solid species via immobile particles specifically what happens if we perturb this representation and what is the meaning of different types of perturbations as it relates to reactant inhomogeneity or imperfect mixing from a physical perspective it seems intuitive that the spatial configuration of solid species should influence the results of a reactive transport simulation in order to capture a highly heterogeneous state eulerian methods would require an increased level of spatial discretization to resolve solid species distributions driving up computation times and imposing stricter stability conditions in fact due to the computational burden imposed by such conditions the family of particle tracking models considered in this work tend to display run times significantly lower than first order eulerian methods and less than half that of a more accurate 3rd order method benson et al 2017 this particular particle tracking method mirpt offers increased flexibility in its ability to capture heterogeneity for a sufficient number of immobile particles a user may distribute them in space in a fully controllable manner this may be done to fit a desired continuous distribution incurring no extra computational cost as no increase in discretization is required also due to the local nature of particle methods in that particles that are not near one another do not interact via mass transfer they are able to capture poor mixing in a way that eulerian models cannot additionally without increasing model complexity the user may run an ensemble of such simulations in order to inform descriptive statistics about the system rather than just obtaining point estimates the test problem we use to investigate the above mentioned issues is presented in arora et al 2015 wherein the authors consider the problem of heavy metal cycling in lake sediments henceforth referred to as the hmls system the authors use the system as a benchmark to compare several popular and state of the art eulerian reactive transport models toughreact xu et al 2014 crunchflow steefel 2009 phreeqc parkhurst and appelo 2013 parkhurst and wissmeier 2015 and pht3d prommer 2006 a selection of the results of this benchmark study are shown in fig 2 in which their results are compared to experimental data from winowiecki 2002 note that while all of the eulerian models yield nearly identical results none of them capture the variability in the data nor do they capture visible fluctuations of certain species this is most evident in fig 2 f depicting pb 2 where we see an order of magnitude difference between the two data plots and a non smooth distribution of the data in space neither of these is captured by the single solution smooth curves provided by the eulerian models but this variability is exactly the type of behavior that can be captured by our stochastic particle tracking model especially when using an ensemble of realizations employing perturbed conditions we wish to note here that our primary goal in this work is to investigate how transport modeling choices affect the results of a geochemical model as such within our various particle models we employ exactly the same phreeqc input file as was used in arora et al 2015 which was provided by the authors this is to say that we aim to test if we can better capture certain characteristics of the data without any alteration of geochemical parameters or methods we organize our investigation of this benchmark reactive transport system as follows in section 2 we discuss the mathematical model and describe relevant physical processes in section 3 we describe how a finite difference method later used as a base case for comparison with our pt models is implemented and provide details germane to our implementation of the mirpt algorithm in section 4 we outline the results of simulating the hmls system with the mirpt algorithm where we develop unperturbed and perturbed models finally conclusions are presented in section 6 2 governing model 2 1 conceptual description generally speaking our model concerns a diffusion reaction transport system driven by the vertical diffusion of solute into a sediment lake bed that is treated as a 1 dimensional column for brevity we refer the reader to the work of arora et al arora et al 2015 for a highly detailed description of the system and chemical reactions involved see fig 1 for their schematic diagram here we provide only a brief synopsis of the principal physico chemical processes in general the system represents a transition from oxic conditions at an upper lake water boundary to anoxic or reducing conditions deeper in the sediment column oxygenated water with an electron donor food source of acetate is present in the lake water and enters the column from the top microbial aerobic respiration converts the acetate to carbonate ions represented here by total alkalinity and reduces aqueous phase electron acceptors in order of preference or ease of conversion o2 nitrate no3 fe 3 and sulfate so4 2 reductive dissolution of solid phase in the lake sediments ferrihydrite fe oh 3 in this sequence also releases metals sorbed to the mineral surface including lead and zinc these dissolved metals and associated aqueous complexes may diffuse back into the upper boundary lake water or react with biogenically produced sulfide from sulfate reduction in the lake sediments and precipitate as solid sulfide minerals 2 2 mathematical formulation the mathematical model we consider is governed by the 1d diffusion reaction equation dre 1 t ϕ c i d c i x 2 r i c 1 c n k 1 k m i 1 n x ω ℝ t 0 where c i t x mol m 3 is the concentration of chemical species i ϕ dimensionless is porosity d m2 s 1 is the diffusion coefficient defined to be constant and equal for all aqueous species and zero for solid species and r i mol m 3 s 1 is a source sink term representing chemical reaction that for each species i is a function of some number of the n species and m reaction coefficients k j the system that we focus on is referred to as the biotic case or base case in the work of arora et al arora et al 2015 their schematic diagram is reproduced in fig 1 but we also summarize here in this system the modeling domain ω is a vertically oriented sediment column of length l 0 4 m in the downward direction i e ω 0 0 0 4 the initial condition ic is homogeneous throughout the domain and consists of a specific distribution of the species of chemical reactants see arora et al 2015 table 6 the boundary conditions bcs are dirichlet constant and equivalent to the initial condition at the upper boundary x 0 or sediment lake water interface and neumann zero flux at the lower boundary x l which represents the lake bed such that 2 c i t 0 x c i 0 c i t x 0 c i 0 i 1 n x c i t x l 0 a table showing the initial concentrations c i 0 for key chemical species of interest is given in table 1 note that the initial pore water chemistry has not yet been allowed to equilibrate with the mineral phases in the sediments as to the values of relevant model parameters we use those found in arora et al 2015 table 5 namely ϕ 0 47 d 4 27 10 10 m2 s 1 and a total simulation time of t 5 years we clarify here that based on the description in arora et al 2015 of the problem and correspondence of our numerical results section 4 with theirs holding porosity constant in time appears to be the appropriate modeling choice in this case as such we absorb ϕ into d and the reactive term for an effective diffusion coefficient of d d ϕ 9 09 10 10 m2 s 1 chemical reaction parameters are not discussed here as they are defined within a phreeqc input file and database that were provided by the authors of arora et al 2015 so as to match those used in their simulations these files along with the rest of the code used to generate the results in section 4 are provided in the following repository doi https doi org 10 5281 zenodo 3731275 schmidt 2020 3 numerical implementation in order to re create the results of arora et al 2015 and consider the effect of spatial perturbations in the pt model we consider two numerical approaches a finite difference fd model that we use as a base case for comparison and one employing the miprt algorithm schmidt et al 2019 both models use the phreeqcrm reaction module parkhurst and wissmeier 2015 for chemistry calculations which is driven by the phreeqc input file and database provided by the authors of arora et al 2015 3 1 finite difference model the fd model we use as a base case is on a regularly spaced grid explicit in time and second order centered in space we use an operator splitting approach between diffusion and reaction calculations we choose a spatial grid with spatial step size δx 1 cm implying a number of cells n c l δx 40 in contrast to arora et al 2015 which uses 46 cells spaced by 0 5 cm for the top 8 and by 1 cm for the rest of the domain we consider three different time step lengths of δt 259 2592 25920 s so as to calibrate our model by exploring the range of time step lengths explored by arora et al 2015 while obeying the von neumann stability condition d δ t δ x 2 1 2 3 2 particle tracking model the pt model we use employs the mirpt algorithm of schmidt et al 2019 that algorithm is based on bolster et al 2016 which reformulated reactive pt algorithms in terms of mass reduction rather than a particle killing approach the work of benson and bolster 2016 extended this algorithm such that particles could carry an arbitrary number of chemical species that are transferred among particles via diffusive mass transfer and engdahl et al 2017 added phreeqcrm parkhurst and wissmeier 2015 to handle complex geochemical reactions between the species the algorithm of schmidt et al 2019 further added the capability for fluid solid mobile immobile interactions for this implementation we partition the total effective diffusion of the system such that 3 d d rw d mi d im where d rw d mi and d im are the portions of the total diffusion simulated by random walks mobile to immobile mass transfers and immobile to mobile mass transfers respectively we impose values of d 0 5 0 25 0 25 this means that half of the total diffusion in the system is simulated by random walking mobile particles and the remaining half is simulated by the two directions of mass transfer for the purposes of this project these values were chosen ad hoc though it has been suggested that properly calibrating this partitioning allows for separate simulation of the distinct processes of mixing and spreading schmidt et al 2018 sole mari et al 2019b for a discussion of the effect of these modeling choices see appendix a in schmidt et al 2019 the time step lengths that we employ are chosen so as to correspond to the results given by the finite difference simulations and so we consider δt 259 2592 25920 s the number of mobile particles n m is held to be 4000 for all simulations though we consider different numbers of immobile particles n i depending on the effects we wish to examine for the base unperturbed case we consider n i 40 100 400 and for the perturbed cases we consider n i 100 400 the reason for the disparity between n i and n m is that we wish to highly resolve spatial gradients with a large number of mobile particles because transport calculations are computationally cheap however because the highly expensive chemistry calculations are conducted on the immobile particles we would like to minimize n i to the smallest appropriate level to put numbers to this concept when employing n i n m 40 4000 and running on a laptop machine the chemistry calculations are o 100 times more expensive than all of the transport calculations within a time step despite the chemistry calculations being conducted in parallel on 4 cores and the transport being conducted in serial finally the zero flux neumann condition at x l is enforced as a reflecting boundary szymczak and ladd 2003 3 2 1 reformulated optimality condition here we provide a brief discussion of the optimality condition for the mirpt algorithm schmidt et al 2019 in particular the simulation constraint attempts to ensure that the maximum average inter particle spacing whether of mobile or immobile particles is of the same order as the magnitude of the system s diffusion within a time step of length δt as such there should always be a nearby mobile or immobile particle to receive mass transfers from a given particle of the opposite type violation of this condition does not necessarily lead to unstable solutions that blow up as occurs when one violates a von neumann stability condition in a finite difference simulation instead the accuracy of the solution degrades in a relatively steady manner as we move further from the prescribed optimal values of η 4 η l min n i n m 2 d δ t 1 we acknowledge that many of the previously mentioned choices of discretization parameters n i n m δt violate this condition in schmidt et al 2019 n i and n m were always close to the same order of magnitude while here this is not feasible due to the highly expensive chemistry calculations i e we always choose to have fewer immobile particles in order to minimize the cost of these chemistry calculations as a result a more nuanced formulation of this condition is presented for our purposes we would like to enforce a condition such that for a given transfer denoted mi for mobile to immobile and vice versa im the expected distance between two particles of opposite species is less than the standard diffusion distance ℓ 2 d δ t this is motivated by the fact that the weighting kernel for mass transfers is a gaussian function with bandwidth variance that is proportional to ℓ and maintaining an expected inter particle spacing on this order ensures that mass transfers will be non negligible this inter particle distance is maximized when a particle is located directly between two particles of the opposite species so in the case of an mi transfer the maximum distance of a mobile particle to the nearest immobile particle is l 2n i thus we would reformulate the individual optimality conditions for a given mi or im transfer as l 2 n i 2 d δ t 1 and l 2 n m 2 d δ t 1 or upon simplifying these expressions 5 η mi l n i 2 d δ t 8 η im l n m 2 d δ t 8 hence we choose all values of n i n m and δt in the following sections so as to satisfy these conditions 4 results next we examine the effect of various modeling choices on the results of simulating the hmls system via the mirpt algorithm all plots in this section depict final time results 5 years within the domain for relevant chemical species and ph corresponding to those from figs 3 and 4 of arora et al arora et al 2015 which are reproduced in fig 2 for reference the plots that correspond to arora et al 2015 fig 3 depict final concentrations of key chemical markers including important aqueous ions ph and alkalinity and they aim to recreate experimental data from winowiecki 2002 we obtained a copy of the winowiecki thesis winowiecki 2002 which includes the data that is used by arora et al 2015 the data in the thesis include two trials at two different sampling times summer and fall of 2001 and we portray all of this data in order to highlight its variability note that the two data scatters in arora et al 2015 depict summer trial 2 and fall trial 1 in figs 3 6 and 8 we plot the data for ph sulfate fe 2 and pb plots a and d f respectively note however that there are not two trials for each sampling for ph so only two data scatters are shown in plot a the plots that correspond to arora et al 2015 fig 4 depict the percentage difference between initial and final amounts of three secondary iron species for which there is not data but whose behavior would be affected by the presence of the previously mentioned aqueous ions the code used to generate the results is implemented in fortran using the intel fortran compiler version 16 0 1 geochemical calculations are performed using the phreeqcrm library parkhurst and wissmeier 2015 compiled using openmp that takes advantage of the natural parallelism of reaction calculations the simulations were run on nodes of a linux cluster running centos release 6 9 for reference using a 16 core node to run the base case particle tracking simulations discussed in section 4 2 with δt 25920 s employing 4000 mobile particles n m and n i 40 100 400 immobile particles results in run times of 52 min 2 h and 7 75 h respectively all of the code used to generate the results in this section including the data from winowiecki 2002 may be found at doi https doi org 10 5281 zenodo 3731275 schmidt 2020 4 1 verification we first verify that the results of arora et al arora et al 2015 can be recreated by implementing the fd simulation described in section 3 1 the results of running fd simulations for values of δt ranging three orders of magnitude corresponding to the time steps used in the eulerian models of arora et al 2015 are displayed in fig 3 and show that for this model the length of the time step does not appear to result in a significant difference in the results all plots shown in fig 3 demonstrate nearly identical behavior and correspond closely to those shown in fig 3 of arora et al 2015 reproduced here in fig 2 one noticeable difference however is the appearance of slight changes in the upper x 0 boundary concentrations of nitrate no3 fig 3 c related to the chemistry calculations performed by phreeqcrm such deviations occur as the authors of arora et al 2015 note in their provided phreeqc input file because equilibrium is never reached for nitrate under the conditions they consider this is evidenced by the discrepancy between initial boundary concentrations and concentrations within the domain at the x 0 boundary the magnitude of which appears to be highly dependent on time step length thus a longer time step results in more consumption of the nitrate entering at the upper boundary explaining the lower concentrations as the time step is increased the authors also note the same for sulfate so4 2 fig 3 d though the effects are less dramatic in these fd cases the results shown in fig 3 indicate that little error is induced in the chemistry calculations by choosing a time step in the given range and provided that it does not introduce error in the transport calculations we may consider time step lengths in this range for pt simulations 4 2 particle tracking results for base case model now that the fd simulations have been faithfully reproduced we will use the mirpt algorithm to model the hmls system we first verify that the prior results are produced in the case of equally spaced immobile particles fig 4 displays the results of pt simulations for immobile particles that are equally spaced across the domain and possess the same initial concentrations as in the fd case we compare these to the finest time discretization of the fd results though they were similar for all tested values of δt we find close agreement between most of the pt simulations and the fd results with the cases of n i δt 40 100 25920 and n i δt 400 259 2592 all displaying nearly identical behavior these pt simulations diverge from the fd results in the case of nitrate and sulfate concentrations no3 and so4 2 fig 4 c and d respectively however this difference is attributable to the effect of the time step on the chemistry calculations as described in section 4 1 the other differences occur in the alkalinity fig 4 b but are relatively small we note that the n i 400 simulations seem to resolve a sharper gradient in pb concentration at the upper boundary x 0 than the fd or n i 40 100 cases with a smaller time step corresponding to a sharper apparent gradient the one simulation that shows the most significant difference from the other pt simulations is the n i δt 400 25920 case though these differences are still minor both in comparison to the fd simulation and the remaining pt simulations overall the pt and fd models yield highly comparable results 4 3 perturbation analysis for particle tracking model next we investigate the mirpt model described in section 3 2 under two different perturbation approaches we first study the effects of perturbing the initial aqueous phase concentrations stored on the evenly spaced immobile particles section 4 3 1 and later study perturbations of the spatial locations of the immobile particles section 4 3 2 see fig 5 for a conceptual depiction of these two perturbation strategies as compared to the unperturbed condition the former approach introduces a level of variability into the initial distribution of reactants without affecting the overall mixedness of the system i e the level of mixing by interaction with mobile species remains the same as in the unperturbed case thus these results should occupy a middle ground between the unperturbed case and the spatially perturbed case in the subsequent section contrastingly the latter approach is meant to physically represent an irregular spatial distribution of solid species which can also be thought of as introducing a poorly mixed condition to the system these spatial gaps between reactants will take time for aqueous mobile species to traverse delaying their contact with other reactive species the associated increase in travel time will lead to a slowdown of reaction speed that should be apparent in the shape and position of reaction fronts we note that initial concentration perturbation considered in section 4 3 1 is a method that can be achieved similarly by using eulerian methods however the position perturbations considered in section 4 3 2 are not so easily achieved with grid based methods and represent a task to which particle tracking methods are uniquely suited in both cases we conduct an ensemble of 100 realizations in order to accurately capture the statistics of the results 4 3 1 perturbations of immobile particle initial concentrations in this section we employ equally spaced immobile particles as in section 4 2 but uniformly perturb the initial concentrations that are stored on these particles this is achieved by choosing an amount α 0 1 and for each species i and immobile particle j perturbing the initial concentration c 0 ij according to a draw from a uniform u 1 α c 0 ij 1 α c 0 ij distribution see fig 5 b for a conceptual depiction of this perturbation strategy in other words we perturb the initial concentration by 100α and for the results of this section we have selected α 0 8 this value results in perturbations of relative significance without the possibility of zero initial concentrations at any particles as zero concentrations cause errors with the geochemical solver for this analysis we run simulations with n i δt 100 25920 and n i δt 400 2592 25920 the results for these levels of discretization were similar enough that we only depict and discuss n i δt 100 25920 fig 6 shows the final time concentrations for each of the 100 realizations and fig 7 shows the ensemble mean blue markers and 1 and 2 standard deviations of the concentration ensemble results yellow and orange error bars respectively in all plots we compare to the unperturbed solution of section 4 2 solid black line and we also show the data from winowiecki 2002 in selected plots so that we may compare to the results in the following section in which the positions of immobile particles were randomly chosen and differ for each member of the ensemble the ensemble mean and standard deviations were computed by binning concentrations into equally spaced bins the bin size is chosen such that at least one particle is in each bin and this resulted in 19 bins 4 3 2 perturbations of immobile particle spatial positions in this section we consider the effect of spatial perturbations to the positions of immobile particles to do this we set the positions of immobile particles according to random draws from a uniform distribution u 0 0 0 4 and set the initial concentrations on each immobile particle to be the same as in the previous equally spaced case see table 1 see fig 5 c for a conceptual depiction of this perturbation strategy an ensemble of 100 realizations is then conducted each with a different spatial distribution of immobile particles as in section 4 3 1 we perform simulations for n i δt 100 25920 and n i δt 400 2592 25920 and find the combination n i δt 100 25920 to be sufficiently representative so that we only depict and discuss those results in fig 8 we plot a selection of 3 realizations out of the 100 conducted a plot depicting the full 100 member ensemble results may be found at doi https doi org 10 5281 zenodo 3731275 schmidt 2020 and we specifically choose these three realizations so as to demonstrate the spatial variability that may be induced by this type of perturbation fig 9 depicts the ensemble mean blue markers and 1 and 2 standard deviations of the concentration ensemble results yellow and orange error bars respectively in all plots we compare to the unperturbed solution of section 4 2 solid black line and we also show the data from winowiecki 2002 in selected plots as mentioned in the previous section we bin the ensemble data into 19 equally spaced bins to compute the statistics plotted in fig 9 5 discussion here we discuss the results of section 4 section 5 1 contains a numerical perspective on the results generated by the two perturbation methods presented in 4 3 for ease of discussion we will refer to the perturbations of immobile particle initial concentrations of section 4 3 1 as the cp concentration perturbation case and the perturbations of immobile particle spatial positions of section 4 3 2 as the sp spatial perturbation case in contrast section 5 2 is a geochemical discussion of the results 5 1 numerical discussion of perturbation analysis inspection of fig 6 shows that the spread of the simulated results for the cp results is relatively narrow this is due to the fact that while the perturbations discussed in this section do create an initially noisy distribution of reactants with areas of reactant scarcity the overall mixing present in the system is unaltered thus the speed of reactions is not substantially reduced and final time concentrations are perturbed symmetrically about the mean value of the unperturbed case for the most part this behavior is more clearly evident in fig 7 where we see very close match between the ensemble means and the unperturbed case the exception to this present in nearly every plot is that the position of reaction fronts spatial gradients tends to be pushed upward or delayed as compared to the unperturbed reference solution this indicates that the initial concentration perturbations do have a measurable effect on mixing and reaction rates though not as significant as in the sp case another behavior of interest observed in fig 6 is that the concentration curves for the different realizations are for the most part parallel both to one another and to the reference unperturbed solution the exceptions to this generalization are pb and fes pb displays some minor crossing of curves while fes displays highly oscillatory behavior in the case of fes the reason for this is most likely related to the extremely low initial concentration of aqueous sulfur in the unperturbed case c 0 sulfur o 10 28 and as a result any perturbation of this quantity will magnify the amount of fes that precipitates as for pb we first note that these fluctuations are reflected in the data shown in fig 2 f leading to the conclusion that this type of perturbation may be more representative of the true conditions than the domain wide constant initial condition employed in the unperturbed case our explanation for the observed behavior in fig 6 f is related to the shape of the concentration curve at the final time it is the only species that does not display a smooth reaction front that spans the domain and instead contains inflection points other than ph but the behavior of ph is much more smooth and tightly constrained as such slight shifts in the position of the local maxima and minima of pb these can also be thought of as local reaction fronts can have magnified downstream effects in the results plotted in fig 9 we see a much greater degree of intra ensemble concentration variability than that of fig 7 this indicates that a perturbed spatial distribution of solid species has a magnified impact on the results of hmls reactive transport simulations as compared to merely perturbing the initial concentrations fig 9 shows that alkalinity pb and siderite are quite sensitive to these spatial perturbations and all display a high degree of variability throughout the domain physically this is due to several biotic reactions that consume acetate and an electron donor e g o2 no3 fe 3 and so4 2 to produce bicarbonate thereby increasing alkalinity for this reason the primary electron donors nitrate no3 and sulfate so4 2 display a similar degree of variability near the upper boundary x 0 and fe 2 and pb show a lesser degree of variability also mainly focused near the upper boundary all species display the greatest variability in concentration where large magnitude gradients or fronts exist likely because these fronts indicate regions in which a given species is out of chemical equilibrium after diffusing some small distance a sufficiently large gap between immobile particles will slow down reaction rates in that area because aqueous mobile species will take time to travel some portion of this distance before they can become eligible for reaction such reasoning also explains the greater variability in alkalinity as compared to other quantities because it displays a front that spans the entire domain at final time while nitrate sulfate fe 2 and pb are nearly constant throughout much of the domain one of the more important aspects of these sp simulations may be observed most clearly in fig 9 in particular for species that display relatively stable final time behavior e g ph nitrate sulfate or ferrihydrite their ensemble mean value closely matches the unperturbed solution however for species that display sharp gradients at final time the ensemble mean tends to lag behind the unperturbed solution in relation to the direction the species is traveling by diffusion confirming that spatial gaps slow down reaction fronts additionally in fig 8 we see that the depicted concentration curves are non smooth and do not parallel the unperturbed solution as they do in fig 6 this more closely approximates the noise and variability we see in the data which is also non smooth in space within a single sample in fact if we compare figs 6 f and 8 f we see that the results in fig 8 f more closely capture the oscillation and spread of the data as such it is likely that the true distribution of solids involves a spatially perturbed condition that alters mixing as in the sp case rather than just perturbed concentrations as in the cp case 5 2 geochemical discussion even in the relatively simple geochemical system explored here heterogeneity can play a role in spatial distribution of geochemical processes pb exhibits the greatest variation in aqueous concentrations within the original data likely due to the sorption of pb to mineral and organic surfaces controlling the concentrations in the original modeling of arora et al and the modeling performed here ferrihydrite is the only mineral surface pb is allowed to sorb to and ferrihydrite has a homogeneous surface area in natural systems surface area of ferrihydrite can vary and other mineral or organic surfaces may be available for metal sorption adding additional heterogeneity in these parameters may permit better fitting of the variations in concentrations but the model fits the general distributions with higher concentrations in the subsurface decreasing upward toward the water sediment interface for all the parameters evaluated the biggest differences between unperturbed and perturbed simulations are observed around the active reaction front where consumption of oxygen through acetate oxidation changes redox conditions and drives reduction of aqueous fe 3 and subsequent dissolution of ferrihydrite the cascading effect of heterogeneity on myriad geochemical processes in a single system is observed in this case study as well when comparing simulation results from the unperturbed case and the immobile particle position perturbation case sp alkalinity shows the largest deviation with higher alkalinity concentrations at depth 0 2 m in the perturbed case compared to the unperturbed case fig 8 b the higher concentrations of carbonate ions at depth lead to more siderite precipitation fig 8 i carbonate is produced from the oxidation of acetate suggesting that more acetate is oxidized and more oxygen is consumed when particles are distributed heterogeneously randomly than when they are distributed homogeneously evenly as more oxygen is consumed more iron is reduced and more ferrihydrite dissolves releasing pb into solution and more sulfate is reduced to hs and leads to fes precipitation fig 8 h heterogeneous distribution of solid phases also impacts the positioning of the reaction front in this case with shallower reaction fronts where minerals are heterogeneously distributed these results highlight the importance of considering heterogeneity in geochemical systems when the spatial distributions of geochemical processes are important e g jung and navarre sitchler 2018a jung and navarre sitchler 2018b finally we address the issue of imperfect fit between model and data in terms of concentration magnitude manifesting as horizontal gaps between model plots and data scatters in the figures this is attributed to calibration of the geochemical parameters and the same result is present identically in the results of arora et al arora et al 2015 because we employ the same phreeqc input file for conducting geochemical calculations calibration of these parameters is not the goal of this work and is not something we focus on we are primarily interested in how the transport modeling conditions affect the results of a geochemical model as such we see that given a geochemical model that fails to capture the variability in data our perturbed model does capture the variability caused by imperfect mixing conditions 6 conclusions in this work we have applied the mirpt algorithm of schmidt et al 2019 to model a benchmark reactive transport problem involving heavy metal cycling in lake sediments the hmls system this system was modeled using eulerian methods in arora et al 2015 and those authors achieved favorable and nearly identical results for all considered methods however the smooth curves produced by eulerian models fail to capture the variability inherent to the data see fig 2 in the unperturbed base case implementation section 4 2 we first recreated the results of a corresponding eulerian model with very close match the main differences are a varying resolution of sharp gradients and differing boundary concentrations of nitrate and sulfate the former is typical of varying levels of discretization and the latter is due to the influence of time step length on the ability of these species to reach equilibrium as such we conclude that the mirpt model in the unperturbed case is capable of capturing the same behavior as a corresponding eulerian model the primary focus herein was to investigate the impact of imperfectly mixed reactants on the behavior of a complicated geochemical system eulerian models are not as well suited to represent this kind of physical heterogeneity because they can only do so by increasing discretization leading to a more restrictive time step and a greater number of expensive chemistry calculations during each time step in contrast the lagrangian model used in this work is uniquely suited to this task because the number of chemistry calculations per time step can be fixed by selecting the number of immobile particles within a simulation while still increasing spatial resolution of aqueous species practically for free by increasing the number of mobile particles that appear to explore the effects of imperfect mixing we perturbed the representation of solid species in our model using two different approaches to demonstrate the typical method for perturbing a reactive transport simulation in section 4 3 1 we randomly varied the initial concentrations of reactants on evenly spaced immobile particles this introduced a noisy initial condition to the problem and can also be achieved using eulerian methods the results of this perturbed experiment failed to capture the variability and noise in the data see fig 6 as the variation in results was relatively minor and most results smoothly parallel the unperturbed solution which is closely captured by the ensemble mean this is because the concentration perturbations initially affect the state of the system but are quickly mitigated over the course of the simulation and overall mixing in the system is not affected for large times the more interesting result is found in section 4 3 2 wherein we spatially perturbed simulations by randomly varying the positions of immobile particles this is a method that cannot be explored using eulerian methods because neighboring grid points communicate during every time step which makes it impossible to create the persistent zones of poor mixing that are induced by spatial gaps between immobile particles to be clear eulerian methods can certainly employ a stochastically perturbed grid to mimic part of this behavior however without the mobile particles that carry the reactants through space they will not fully capture this poor mixing due to reactant segregation additionally introducing the perturbations of either sort into the particle tracking simulations required no change to the algorithm while in the case of eulerian models this would be a signifcantly more complicated endeavor than employing an equally spaced grid finally in order to ensure the stability of a spatially perturbed eulerian simulation one would need to choose a time step length corresponding to the smallest spacing in each grid realization leading to unpredictable and possibly prohibitive run times the results of the spatially perturbed experiment are compelling because we see much wider variation in the intra ensemble results see fig 8 and this variance is an important feature of the data that neither the single solution eulerian models nor the alternative perturbation method can fully capture for this reason the spatial perturbation method captures an important real world feature that is neglected by other modeling and simulation methods specifically we are able to capture the slowdown in reaction speed that is induced by poorly mixed conditions ultimately we conjecture though it remains to be rigorously proven that the perturbations in immobile particle position correspond mathematically to perturbations in the magnitude of diffusion present in the system a reasonable and necessary modeling choice when trying to capture the irregular behaviors induced by the inhomogeneity of porous media declaration

1489,the injection of nanoscale zero valent iron nzvi can be an effective technique for the treatment of groundwater contaminants including chlorinated solvents however its effectiveness can be limited by natural reductant demand nrd reactions including the reduction of water resulting in the production of hydrogen gas this study presents results from a series of laboratory experiments to investigate gas production and mobilization following the injection of nzvi solutions along with sodium borohydride nabh4 that is used for nzvi synthesis experiments were performed in a thin two dimensional flow cell 22 34 1 cm3 to measure hydrogen gas volumes and local gas saturations and to investigate the distribution of gas within and above the injection zone an additional experiment was conducted in a larger flow cell 150 150 2 cm3 containing dissolved trichloroethene tce to assess changes in aqueous flow pathways and enhanced vertical transport of tce by mobilized gas the results showed substantial gas production 60 to 740 of the injected solution volume resulting in gas mobilization as a network of gas channels above the injection zone with more gas produced from greater excess nabh4 used during nzvi synthesis trapped gas saturations were sufficient to cause the diversion of aqueous flow around the nzvi injection zone in addition gas production and mobilization resulted in the bubble facilitated transport of tce and detectable concentrations of tce and reaction products ethane and ethene above the target treatment zone keywords nanoscale zero valent iron bubble facilitated transport gas dynamics hydrogen gas groundwater remediation light transmission visualization 1 introduction the injection of nanoscale zero valent iron nzvi is a promising technology for the remediation of chlorinated solvents and heavy metals in groundwater due to its large specific surface area and high reactivity although the rapid transformation of contaminants has been demonstrated in several laboratory studies zhang 2003 song and carraway 2005 liu et al 2005 liu and zhang 2010 sarathy et al 2010 hwang et al 2011 o carroll et al 2013 field scale applications can be challenging kanel et al 2008 phenrat et al 2010 kocur et al 2014 this is due in part to limited nzvi effectiveness caused by poor mobility o carroll et al 2013 kocur et al 2014 chowdhury et al 2015 and poor selectivity liu et al 2005 schöftner et al 2015 fan et al 2016a li et al 2018 vogel et al 2019 he et al 2020 poor selectivity is the result of reactions with dissolved oxygen and water often referred to as natural reductant demand nrd unlike natural oxidant demand nod which is typically used to describe non target reactions with naturally occurring species during in situ chemical oxidation isco applications e g mumford et al 2005 nrd impacts an nzvi application throughout injection and migration because of continuous contact with water fan et al 2016a as a result nrd reactions can lead to limited longevity of nzvi in the subsurface treatment of contaminants occurs alongside nrd reactions as determined by the electron efficiency which is typically dominated by the nrd reactions particularly at low contaminant concentrations schöftner et al 2015 fan et al 2016a the reaction of nzvi with for example trichloroethene tce occurs via beta elimination to acetylene with subsequent degradation to ethene and ethane or hydrogenolysis to ethene with subsequent degradation to ethane liu et al 2005 the reaction of nzvi with water produces hydrogen chen et al 2011 o carroll et al 2013 huang et al 2016 1 fe 0 2h 2 o fe 2 2oh h 2 in cases where nzvi is synthesized using the borohydride reduction method wang and zhang 1997 boparai et al 2011 chen et al 2011 2012 huang et al 2016 unreacted sodium borohydride nabh4 can also produce hydrogen by reaction with water gonçalves et al 2007 2 nabh 4 4h 2 o nab oh 4 4h 2 hydrogen gas production according to eq 2 will be increased if nabh4 is added in excess to promote complete reaction and uniform nzvi particle growth during synthesis zhang 2003 he and zhao 2007 yaacob et al 2012 leaving more unreacted nabh4 at the time of injection although hydrogen generation is used to measure electron efficiency liu et al 2005 schöftner et al 2015 previous studies have focused on the consumption of nzvi and the associated effects on contaminant removal and not on the effects of hydrogen production itself an increase in the dissolved hydrogen concentration in groundwater can lead to increased contaminant reduction either by nzvi liu et al 2005 or through increased anaerobic microbial activity where hydrogen is used as an electron donor for biodegradation o carroll et al 2013 shi et al 2015 however if hydrogen is produced in excess of its aqueous solubility it will form a gas phase with two potentially important effects on an nzvi application first gas trapping will reduce aqueous saturations and aqueous phase permeability this can lead to changes in aqueous flow pathways and bypassing of the target treatment zone this has been suggested as a mechanism that can limit nzvi mobility even when nzvi is stabilized to limit aggregation johnson et al 2013 mohammed et al 2019 demonstrated that the injection of nabh4 resulted in a decrease in aqueous phase relative permeability to as low as 0 23 second bubble facilitated transport of volatile organic compounds vocs can occur if sufficient gas is produced to exceed the trapping capacity of the porous medium this has the potential to redistribute volatile contaminants away from the treatment zone reducing the treatment effectiveness and creating new contaminant transport pathways bubble facilitated voc transport has been demonstrated in the context of vapour intrusion soucy and mumford 2017 chong and mayer 2017 ma et al 2019 and mass transfer from dense non aqueous phase liquid dnapl pools mumford et al 2010 and can both increase the voc mass flux from a source zone and transport vocs to previously uncontaminated groundwater strategies employed to improve the selectivity of nzvi include methods to modify nzvi using different additives and supports emulsified zero valent iron ezvi activated carbon supported nzvi ac nzvi and sulfidation are recognized as promising approaches quinn et al 2005 o hara et al 2006 tseng et al 2011 su et al 2012 fan et al 2013 2016a 2016b wu et al 2013 nunez garcia et al 2016 li et al 2018 guerra et al 2018 mortazavian et al 2018 liu et al 2019 vogel et al 2019 he et al 2020 these approaches will decrease the amount of hydrogen produced however the reduction of water will still occur with applications of ezvi and ac nzvi sulfidation on the other hand has been shown in proof of concept laboratory studies fan et al 2013 2016b nunez garcia et al 2016 to largely inhibit water reduction by nzvi the main source of nrd while maintaining reactivity with contaminants nevertheless until field scale applications of sulfidated nzvi become common an understanding of the effects of hydrogen gas production are important for the design operation and monitoring of nzvi applications there is a need to investigate the potential effects of hydrogen gas production on nzvi applications beyond the concept of nrd the objectives of this study were to i assess the volume and distribution of gas produced by the reaction of nzvi with water in sand ii determine the potential for trapped gas to affect aqueous flow pathways after nzvi injection and iii investigate bubble facilitated transport of vocs initiated by hydrogen gas production these objectives were addressed using a series of laboratory experiments conducted in thin flow cells to measure gas volumes and saturations visualize gas and aqueous flow and determine aqueous contaminant concentrations above a target treatment zone 2 material and methods 2 1 chemicals gases and porous media chemicals used included tce fisher scientific 99

sakulchaicharoen et al 2010 o carroll et al 2013 kocur et al 2014 kocur et al 2015 mondal et al 2018 analytical standards were prepared using separate sources of tce supelco 40 085 and ethane and ethene linde all water used in the experiments was deionized water in equilibrium with atmospheric air the sand used in all experiments was a clean uniform silica sand accusand 20 30 agsco with a median grain diameter of 0 71 mm schroth et al 1996 the sand was rinsed thoroughly with deionized water to remove fines prior to use the sand was packed into the flow cells using a wet packing technique in which a slurry of sand and water is poured continuously into a partially water filled cell while tapping the cell walls with a rubber mallet to promote a uniform initially water saturated

a prefix to denote the injection of nabh4 solution into uncontaminated sand bh the injection of nzvi and nabh4 into uncontaminated sand nz or the injection of nzvi and nabh4 into sand that contained a dissolved tce plume tc the suffix 1 or 6 denotes the approximate nabh4 concentration in g l either injected or used during nzvi synthesis experiments bh 1 and bh 6 were conducted to measure gas volumes and saturations resulting from the injection of nabh4 solutions nabh4 was selected because its reaction with water produces hydrogen eq 2 but as a colourless solution it does not obscure visualization of the gas experiments nz 1 and nz 6 were conducted to measure gas volumes and assess the distribution of gas resulting from the injection of nzvi solutions an nzvi concentration of 1 g l was selected to match previous laboratory and field studies phenrat et al 2009 bennett et al 2010 johnson et al 2013 kocur et al 2014 chowdhury et al 2015 stefaniuk et al 2016 the nzvi solutions also contained unreacted nabh4 that remained following synthesis mondal et al 2018 an initial nabh4 concentration of 1 35 g l represents the nabh4 fe molar ratio of 2 1 recommended by he and zhao 2007 and commonly employed in laboratory and field nzvi applications zhang and elliott 2006 johnson et al 2013 kocur et al 2013 kocur et al 2014 this is greater than the stoichiometric nabh4 fe ratio of 1 2 for nzvi synthesis using ferrous sulfate and assuming complete reaction and no other losses would result in 1 02 g l of nabh4 remaining an initial nabh4 concentration of 6 35 g l represents a nabh4 fe ratio of 9 4 1 and was used to investigate the production of a large hydrogen gas volume assuming complete reaction and no other losses during synthesis this initial concentration would result in 6 02 g l of nabh4 remaining experiment tc 1 was conducted to investigate the mobilization of hydrogen gas over larger distances than in the previous experiments using a larger flow cell as well as the subsequent bubble facilitated transport of tce and changes in aqueous flow using the typical 2 1 nabh4 fe ratio 2 3 small scale flow cell experiments bh 1 bh 6 nz 1 and nz 6 were performed in a 22 34 1 inside thickness cm3 flow cell fig 1a packed with sand the flow cell was built from acrylic plastic with a removable aluminum lid fastened to the base of the cell using six exterior threaded rods and sealed to the top of the walls using a neoprene gasket four ports were installed along each of the two edges for water displacement and solution injection an additional four ports were installed in the base and equipped with hydrophilic nylon membranes 10 μm pore size emd millipore corporation to allow uniform drainage of the cell under vacuum to a residual water saturation the sand pack was separated from the inside edges of the cell by sections of stainless steel mesh creating influent and effluent clear wells to promote uniform flow during water displacement solutions of nabh4 experiments bh 1 and bh 6 or nzvi with nabh4 experiments nz 1 and nz 6 table 1 were injected 10 ml each through a stainless steel needle to a location 2 cm above the base of the pack the volume of gas produced in the sand pack during experiments in the small scale flow cell was determined by measuring the mass of water displaced from the cell mettler toledo ms6002s corrected for any gas that accumulated in the clear wells there was no imposed flow of water in these experiments the flow cell was lit from behind using an led light panel ledgo cn 1200h and covered in black fabric to block ambient light images were captured every 5 min using a digital camera canon eos rebel t3i placed in front of the cell to measure gas saturations by light transmission tidwell and glass 1994 niemet and selker 2001 according to 3 s e 1 s g s r 1 s r 1 ln i i s ln i r i s where s e is the effective saturation s g is the gas saturation s r is the residual water saturation i is the transmitted light intensity i s is the transmitted light intensity through the water saturated sand pack and i r is the transmitted light intensity through the sand pack at residual water saturation the ratio of transmitted light intensity through the water saturated and residual sand packs i r i s was treated as a uniform value over the entire pack van de ven et al 2020 and was fit using the mass of displaced water as representative of gas in the sand pack 2 4 intermediate scale flow cell experiment tc 1 was performed in a 150 150 2 inside thickness cm3 flow cell fig 1b packed with sand the flow cell was built from two glass plates sealed to a stainless steel frame using viton gaskets the lid was also sealed to the frame using a neoprene gasket mesh wrapped stainless steel perforated plates were used to create clear wells along the influent and effluent edges to promote uniform horizontal water flow in addition to influent and effluent ports attached to the clear wells four sampling ports were installed through the effluent edge of the flow cell fig 1b and attached to needles inserted 10 cm into the sand and at elevations of 75 95 115 and 135 cm above the bottom of the sand pack tce and nzvi solutions were injected using a gas tight syringe through a separate needle inserted through the influent edge with its tip located 15 cm above the bottom of the sand pack and 60 cm from the influent edge a tce saturated solution was prepared by slowly mixing water and tce dnapl for a period of 4 weeks 160 ml of water and 20 ml of dnapl were stirred in a 200 ml ptfe capped glass jar the resulting aqueous solution was considered to be in equilibrium with the headspace which consisted initially of atmospheric air and have an aqueous concentration of tce near the solubility limit of 1100 mg l at 25 c pankow and cherry 1996 after mixing a 50 ml sample of tce saturated solution was collected from the jar using a gas tight syringe and injected into the flow cell over approximately 3 min 120 ml of 1 g l nzvi was then injected through the same stainless steel needle into the tce plume over approximately 6 min the relatively rapid injection of these two solutions produced circular plumes centred on the needle tip gas production and mobilization was monitored qualitatively by backlighting the cell using a custom built led panel custom effects led solutions and capturing images using the same camera as used in the small scale flow cell experiments the flow cell was placed in a black enclosure during the experiment to reduce the effects of ambient lighting on the captured images 2 5 water flow sampling and analysis during experiment tc 1 water was pumped through the intermediate scale flow cell at 12 ml min average linear pore water velocity of 1 5 m day which is faster than in a typical field setting but within the darcy regime reynolds number of 0 15 water flow was stopped during tce and nzvi injection and restarted 14 h later and continued until 4 days after injection water samples were collected from each of the four effluent sampling ports in 4 ml and 20 ml glass vials for analysis of vocs and dissolved gases respectively every 2 h in the first 8 h following the start of water flow and then every 4 h afterwards with the last three samples taken at 7 h 10 h and 5 h intervals samples were analyzed by solid phase microextraction spme to determine dissolved tce concentrations using a modified method from usepa 2006 and to determine dissolved ethene and ethane concentrations using a modified headspace method kampbell and vandegrift 1998 caruso and santoro 2014 both by gas chromatography gc agilent technologies type 7890b with agilent 80 pal autosampler with a flame ionization detector fid the laboratory method detection limit mdl was 5 0 μg l for tce 0 04 μg l for ethene and 0 04 μg l for ethane the water samples were also analyzed for vinyl chloride chloroethane 1 1 dichloroethene trans 1 2 dichloroethene 1 1 dichloroethane cis 1 2 dichloroethene 1 1 1 trichloroethane and 1 2 dichloroethane blank samples control and control verification samples were analyzed throughout each sample run to ensure gc consistency and accuracy in addition to effluent sampling pre and post injection tracer tests were conducted to assess any changes in aqueous flow patterns during each test a 0 5 by volume solution of green dye loretta foods was pumped through the flow cell at 15 ml min images of the tracer were captured at 30 s intervals the post injection tracer test was conducted after all water samples had been collected 3 results and discussion 3 1 gas production and mobilization the injection of nabh4 experiments bh 1 and bh 6 and nzvi with nabh4 experiments nz 1 and nz 6 resulted in the production of 6 to 45 ml and 12 to 74 ml of gas in the sand packs respectively fig 2 additional gas that was produced accumulated in the clear wells the majority of the gas volumes is attributed to the reaction of nabh4 as the stoichiometric production of hydrogen from 10 ml of 1 g l nzvi would produce only 4 3 ml of gas neglecting dissolution in the aqueous phase as expected more gas was produced from higher concentrations of nabh4 with or without nzvi and more gas was produced from nzvi and nabh4 than from nabh4 alone gas production rates decreased with time in all experiments with production reaching a plateau after 60 min 120 min and 180 min in experiments nz 1 nz 6 and bh 1 respectively a plateau was not reached in experiment bh 6 after 600 min huang et al 2016 reported similar reaction times for hydrogen gas production for similar nzvi concentrations synthesized using the borohydride reduction method the gas volumes produced in experiments bh 1 bh6 nz 1 and nz 6 represent 60 450 120 and 740 of the pore space that corresponded to the 10 ml injection volumes therefore for nzvi concentrations and synthesis conditions typical of field applications bh 1 and nz 1 gas production can exceed the capillary trapping capacity of the porous medium in the target treatment zone particularly if the majority of gas is produced prior to the downstream transport of the injected solution and contact with a greater treatment volume the resulting distribution of the gas in the sand pack is shown in figs 3 and 4 calibration of the ratio of transmitted light through a residually saturated sand pack to a water saturated sand pack was used to match the volume of gas measured by water displacement to that measured by image analysis van de ven et al 2020 in experiments bh 1 and bh 6 fig 2 calibration was not possible for the nz 1 and nz 6 experiments because of gas that was obscured by the nzvi and the calibrated transmitted light intensity ratio from the nabh4 experiments equal to 0 6 was applied to those experiments to determine gas saturations outside of the nzvi region light intensities were averaged over a 1 mm 1 mm area for the calculation of local gas saturations following the injection of nabh4 in experiments bh 1 and bh 6 fig 3 gas formed in a circular region around the injection needle tip injection zone at gas saturations of approximately 12 and 22 respectively 15 min after injection with increasing time additional gas production resulted in gas migration in discontinuous channels that extended from the injection zone to the top of the flow cell gas saturations in these channels were approximately 2 to 10 discontinuous gas flow was confirmed by processing differences between sequential images to identify local regions of increasing and decreasing gas saturation indicative of gas fragmentation and mobilization hegele and mumford 2014 unstable upwards gas flow in the form of discontinuous channels is common e g brooks et al 1999 glass et al 2000 geistlinger et al 2006 and has been shown to occur in this sand for point injections at gas flow rates less than 10 ml min van de ven and mumford 2019 this is consistent with the initial gas production rates of 0 1 2 ml min in these experiments despite mobilization a gas phase remained in the injection zone at the end of experiments bh 1 and bh 6 the persistence of this trapped gas indicates that while the volume of gas produced is sufficient to cause mobilization trapping mechanisms will maintain gas saturations in an injection zone capable of reducing the aqueous phase permeability in that zone similar results were observed following the injection of nzvi and excess nabh4 in experiments nz 1 and nz 6 fig 4 in which a network of gas channels was formed starting at the injection zone trapped gas also remained in the injection zone following mobilization although decreases in transmitted light intensity in these experiments are due to both the presence of gas and iron hydroxides which prevented quantification of gas saturations in the injection zone even at later time when the nzvi settled due to gravity fig 4h in the higher concentration experiments bh 6 and nz 6 the higher volume of gas led to the formation of a gas pool below the lid of the flow cell in a larger homogeneous system it is expected that this gas would continue to migrate upwards as a network of discontinuous gas channels however these experiments with gas accumulation below the impermeable lid are an example of the potential effects of heterogeneity where lower permeability capillary barriers would create gas pools limiting the vertical migration of gas but enhancing its lateral spread as such gas production and migration can create new voc transport pathways in both the vertical and horizontal directions dictated by the site geology furthermore in a heterogeneous system vertical variations in soil texture can create multiple closely spaced capillary barriers and a vertical distribution of gas pools that can substantially decrease the average aqueous permeability as gas saturations increase limiting the ability for subsequent injections to reach the target treatment zone greater gas mobilization occurred in the intermediate scale flow cell experiment tc 1 as in the small scale flow cell experiments gas production originated in the injection zone the injection zone was visible as a black circle in images of the flow cell created by nzvi that blocked transmitted light fig 5 the gas then migrated upwards as a network of gas channels the approximate location of gas shown in fig 5 is based on differences between images and the initial water saturated image but local gas saturations were not quantified these gas channels formed rapidly with upward migration occurring soon after nzvi injection 90 s migration was also rapid reaching the full height of the flow cell 25 min after injection 3 2 impact on aqueous flow pathways images of the pre and post injection tracer test are shown in fig 6 similarities in the position of the tracer front above the injection zone show good reproducibility between tests with negligible impact of the gas channels on aqueous flow however inspection of the tracer front in the injection zone during the post injection tracer test shows considerable flow diversion with delayed tracer arrival immediately down gradient of the injection zone e g fig 6c compared to fig 6h visual inspection of the tracer front at a location 12 cm down gradient of the needle tip showed an approximately 11 h delay in tracer arrival this is attributed to a reduction in aqueous permeability caused by the presence of trapped gas consistent with reductions resulting from hydrogen gas exsolution and trapping from the reaction of nabh4 and water observed previously mohammed et al 2019 the presence of nzvi and precipitation of iron hydroxides may also have contributed to this reduction johnson et al 2008 jeen et al 2012 fronczyk and pawluk 2014 tosco et al 2014 but because the volume of gas generated was sufficient to overcome the trapping capacity of the sand and even small amounts of trapped gas can significantly reduce the aqueous permeability gas production alone is sufficient to explain the difference in tracer transport although the area affected by the trapped gas and the extent of the change in aqueous flow in experiment tc 1 were small they demonstrate the potential for larger scale effects in field scale nzvi applications for example for nzvi injections conducted at several horizontal and vertical positions within a target treatment zone the influence of trapped gas could be much greater due to the creation of larger regions of reduced aqueous permeability in addition as described in the discussion of experiments bh 6 and nz 6 the aqueous permeability would be further reduced and bypassing enhanced in the presence of capillary barriers that allowed the accumulation of higher gas saturations the impact of bypassing in three dimensional field scale nzvi applications will depend on the extent and distribution of gas occupied regions particularly with respect to proximity to target treatment zones these changes in flow pathways are particularly important in applications that require multiple successive nzvi injections as later injections can be blocked by gas produced during earlier injections 3 3 bubble facilitated voc transport dissolved tce ethane and ethene were detected in each of the four sampling ports in experiment tc 1 following gas production and migration fig 7 peak detection occurred at the 75 and 95 cm sampling locations 8 h after nzvi injection and at the 115 and 135 cm sampling locations 12 h after nzvi injection concentrations decreased to below detection limits after 24 to 36 h these peak arrival times are consistent with the expected breakthrough times between the horizontal position of the gas channels and sampling needles at an average linear pore water velocity of 1 5 m day no other vocs were detected as expected for tce degradation by beta elimination liu et al 2005 peak concentrations of tce in samples from the 75 95 115 and 135 cm locations were 896 230 58 and 40 μg l respectively these were detected at elevations well above the location of the injected tce solution centered on the needle tip 15 cm above the bottom of the sand pack and also well above the expected path for dissolved tce as it was transported with horizontal water flow to the flow cell s effluent edge this demonstrates substantial tce transport in the gas phase resulting from tce partitioning from the aqueous phase into the gas primarily hydrogen phase prior to complete tce degradation and subsequent partitioning back to the aqueous phase above the injection zone the decreasing tce concentrations with height above the injection zone are likely the result of increased stripping of tce from the gas phase as that gas phase migrated upwards detected concentrations of ethane and ethene highest peak concentrations of 0 56 and 0 36 μg l respectively show that some degradation of tce was occurring and that gaseous reaction products can also contribute to and be transported by gas migration the detection of tce at elevations greater than 1 m above the injection zone demonstrates that the extent of the gas channels and the short time required for their development creates conditions favourable for bubble facilitated voc transport sufficient gas was produced in the injection zone to exceed the trapping capacity resulting in gas mobilization in addition partitioning of tce to that gas occurred over time scales comparable to those required for tce degradation by nzvi as a result mobilized gas was able to transport tce to higher elevations well above the original location of the tce plume this has important implications for field scale nzvi applications where gas production and migration should be carefully considered to limit the potential for contaminant redistribution as well as to limit changes in aqueous flow pathways this can include limiting the amount of excess nabh4 used for the synthesis of fresh nzvi in the field and the use of sulfidated nzvi to limit gas production 4 summary and conclusions solutions of nzvi and nabh4 were injected into small scale 22 34 1 cm3 and intermediate scale 150 150 2 cm3 flow cells all experiments resulted in substantial gas production with 6 to 74 ml of gas produced in the small scale experiments using 1 35 g l or 6 35 g l nabh4 with or without 1 g l nzvi importantly this volume of gas was the same order of magnitude as the injected solution volume 10 ml resulting in trapped gas saturations in the injection zone of 12 to 22 and the mobilization of gas above the injection zone as a network of gas channels with gas saturations of 2 to 10 gas volumes were larger for the injection of higher nabh4 concentrations and for the combination of nzvi with nabh4 compared to nabh4 alone and corresponded to higher gas saturations and the formation of denser gas channel networks although these experiments were conducted in homogeneous sand packs evidence of gas pooling below the lid of the flow cell also highlights the potential role of capillary barriers in heterogeneous systems were gas accumulation could create higher gas saturations near the injection zone as well as create lateral gas flow pathways below those barriers in the intermediate scale experiment a comparison of pre and post injection tracer tests showed that gas production was sufficient to result in flow diversion around the injection zone in addition rapid gas production and vertical gas migration was able to transport tce and reaction products away from the injection zone centered 15 cm above the base of the sand pack which contained tce saturated solution to heights of 75 to 135 cm above the base of the sand pack detection of tce at concentrations up to 896 μg l was accompanied by detection of ethane and ethene products of the reduction of tce by nzvi this enhanced vertical transport which is much greater than that expected by vertical transverse dispersion is attributed to bubble facilitated transport of the tce and reaction products together these results show that hydrogen production should be considered alongside nzvi selectivity when assessing the impacts of nrd on an nzvi application even small amounts of gas production can result in trapped gas saturations that will reduce aqueous permeability and limit the subsequent delivery of nzvi to that injection zone as would be required for remediation approaches based on repeated injections the partitioning of background dissolved gases to that trapped gas e g van de ven and mumford 2020 will prolong its dissolution such that the limitation will persist even between infrequent injections if gas is produced in excess of the trapping capacity of the porous medium the mobilization of gas away from the injection zone creates a new and rapid transport pathway the partitioning of tce to that gas followed by its bubble facilitated transport can take place before complete reduction of the tce if not managed this enhanced transport has the potential to reduce treatment effectiveness by removing volatile target contaminants from the injection zone and increase risk to receptors at ground surface fortunately strategies to improve the selectivity of nzvi including sulfidation will also address these concerns both by reducing the amount of hydrogen produced through reaction with water and by lowering the rate of that reaction such that the hydrogen is produced over a greater volume of porous medium during migration of the injected solution in addition in applications where excess nabh4 is used for

1489,the injection of nanoscale zero valent iron nzvi can be an effective technique for the treatment of groundwater contaminants including chlorinated solvents however its effectiveness can be limited by natural reductant demand nrd reactions including the reduction of water resulting in the production of hydrogen gas this study presents results from a series of laboratory experiments to investigate gas production and mobilization following the injection of nzvi solutions along with sodium borohydride nabh4 that is used for nzvi synthesis experiments were performed in a thin two dimensional flow cell 22 34 1 cm3 to measure hydrogen gas volumes and local gas saturations and to investigate the distribution of gas within and above the injection zone an additional experiment was conducted in a larger flow cell 150 150 2 cm3 containing dissolved trichloroethene tce to assess changes in aqueous flow pathways and enhanced vertical transport of tce by mobilized gas the results showed substantial gas production 60 to 740 of the injected solution volume resulting in gas mobilization as a network of gas channels above the injection zone with more gas produced from greater excess nabh4 used during nzvi synthesis trapped gas saturations were sufficient to cause the diversion of aqueous flow around the nzvi injection zone in addition gas production and mobilization resulted in the bubble facilitated transport of tce and detectable concentrations of tce and reaction products ethane and ethene above the target treatment zone keywords nanoscale zero valent iron bubble facilitated transport gas dynamics hydrogen gas groundwater remediation light transmission visualization 1 introduction the injection of nanoscale zero valent iron nzvi is a promising technology for the remediation of chlorinated solvents and heavy metals in groundwater due to its large specific surface area and high reactivity although the rapid transformation of contaminants has been demonstrated in several laboratory studies zhang 2003 song and carraway 2005 liu et al 2005 liu and zhang 2010 sarathy et al 2010 hwang et al 2011 o carroll et al 2013 field scale applications can be challenging kanel et al 2008 phenrat et al 2010 kocur et al 2014 this is due in part to limited nzvi effectiveness caused by poor mobility o carroll et al 2013 kocur et al 2014 chowdhury et al 2015 and poor selectivity liu et al 2005 schöftner et al 2015 fan et al 2016a li et al 2018 vogel et al 2019 he et al 2020 poor selectivity is the result of reactions with dissolved oxygen and water often referred to as natural reductant demand nrd unlike natural oxidant demand nod which is typically used to describe non target reactions with naturally occurring species during in situ chemical oxidation isco applications e g mumford et al 2005 nrd impacts an nzvi application throughout injection and migration because of continuous contact with water fan et al 2016a as a result nrd reactions can lead to limited longevity of nzvi in the subsurface treatment of contaminants occurs alongside nrd reactions as determined by the electron efficiency which is typically dominated by the nrd reactions particularly at low contaminant concentrations schöftner et al 2015 fan et al 2016a the reaction of nzvi with for example trichloroethene tce occurs via beta elimination to acetylene with subsequent degradation to ethene and ethane or hydrogenolysis to ethene with subsequent degradation to ethane liu et al 2005 the reaction of nzvi with water produces hydrogen chen et al 2011 o carroll et al 2013 huang et al 2016 1 fe 0 2h 2 o fe 2 2oh h 2 in cases where nzvi is synthesized using the borohydride reduction method wang and zhang 1997 boparai et al 2011 chen et al 2011 2012 huang et al 2016 unreacted sodium borohydride nabh4 can also produce hydrogen by reaction with water gonçalves et al 2007 2 nabh 4 4h 2 o nab oh 4 4h 2 hydrogen gas production according to eq 2 will be increased if nabh4 is added in excess to promote complete reaction and uniform nzvi particle growth during synthesis zhang 2003 he and zhao 2007 yaacob et al 2012 leaving more unreacted nabh4 at the time of injection although hydrogen generation is used to measure electron efficiency liu et al 2005 schöftner et al 2015 previous studies have focused on the consumption of nzvi and the associated effects on contaminant removal and not on the effects of hydrogen production itself an increase in the dissolved hydrogen concentration in groundwater can lead to increased contaminant reduction either by nzvi liu et al 2005 or through increased anaerobic microbial activity where hydrogen is used as an electron donor for biodegradation o carroll et al 2013 shi et al 2015 however if hydrogen is produced in excess of its aqueous solubility it will form a gas phase with two potentially important effects on an nzvi application first gas trapping will reduce aqueous saturations and aqueous phase permeability this can lead to changes in aqueous flow pathways and bypassing of the target treatment zone this has been suggested as a mechanism that can limit nzvi mobility even when nzvi is stabilized to limit aggregation johnson et al 2013 mohammed et al 2019 demonstrated that the injection of nabh4 resulted in a decrease in aqueous phase relative permeability to as low as 0 23 second bubble facilitated transport of volatile organic compounds vocs can occur if sufficient gas is produced to exceed the trapping capacity of the porous medium this has the potential to redistribute volatile contaminants away from the treatment zone reducing the treatment effectiveness and creating new contaminant transport pathways bubble facilitated voc transport has been demonstrated in the context of vapour intrusion soucy and mumford 2017 chong and mayer 2017 ma et al 2019 and mass transfer from dense non aqueous phase liquid dnapl pools mumford et al 2010 and can both increase the voc mass flux from a source zone and transport vocs to previously uncontaminated groundwater strategies employed to improve the selectivity of nzvi include methods to modify nzvi using different additives and supports emulsified zero valent iron ezvi activated carbon supported nzvi ac nzvi and sulfidation are recognized as promising approaches quinn et al 2005 o hara et al 2006 tseng et al 2011 su et al 2012 fan et al 2013 2016a 2016b wu et al 2013 nunez garcia et al 2016 li et al 2018 guerra et al 2018 mortazavian et al 2018 liu et al 2019 vogel et al 2019 he et al 2020 these approaches will decrease the amount of hydrogen produced however the reduction of water will still occur with applications of ezvi and ac nzvi sulfidation on the other hand has been shown in proof of concept laboratory studies fan et al 2013 2016b nunez garcia et al 2016 to largely inhibit water reduction by nzvi the main source of nrd while maintaining reactivity with contaminants nevertheless until field scale applications of sulfidated nzvi become common an understanding of the effects of hydrogen gas production are important for the design operation and monitoring of nzvi applications there is a need to investigate the potential effects of hydrogen gas production on nzvi applications beyond the concept of nrd the objectives of this study were to i assess the volume and distribution of gas produced by the reaction of nzvi with water in sand ii determine the potential for trapped gas to affect aqueous flow pathways after nzvi injection and iii investigate bubble facilitated transport of vocs initiated by hydrogen gas production these objectives were addressed using a series of laboratory experiments conducted in thin flow cells to measure gas volumes and saturations visualize gas and aqueous flow and determine aqueous contaminant concentrations above a target treatment zone 2 material and methods 2 1 chemicals gases and porous media chemicals used included tce fisher scientific 99

cmc solution followed by additional deionized water to achieve the target concentrations a cmc concentration of 8 g l was used to prevent nanoparticle aggregation he and zhao 2007 liu et al 2007 sakulchaicharoen et al 2010 o carroll et al 2013 kocur et al 2014 kocur et al 2015 mondal et al 2018 analytical standards were prepared using separate sources of tce supelco 40 085 and ethane and ethene linde all water used in the experiments was deionized water in equilibrium with atmospheric air the sand used in all experiments was a clean uniform silica sand accusand 20 30 agsco with a median grain diameter of 0 71 mm schroth et al 1996 the sand was rinsed thoroughly with deionized water to remove fines prior to use the sand was packed into the flow cells using a wet packing technique in which a slurry of sand and water is poured continuously into a partially water filled cell while tapping the cell walls with a rubber mallet to promote a uniform initially water saturated pack 2 2 gas production and mobilization experiments three sets of experiments were performed to investigate the effects of hydrogen gas production and mobilization table 1 experiment names consist of a prefix to denote the injection of nabh4 solution into uncontaminated sand bh the injection of nzvi and nabh4 into uncontaminated sand nz or the injection of nzvi and nabh4 into sand that contained a dissolved tce plume tc the suffix 1 or 6 denotes the approximate nabh4 concentration in g l either injected or used during nzvi synthesis experiments bh 1 and bh 6 were conducted to measure gas volumes and saturations resulting from the injection of nabh4 solutions nabh4 was selected because its reaction with water produces hydrogen eq 2 but as a colourless solution it does not obscure visualization of the gas experiments nz 1 and nz 6 were conducted to measure gas volumes and assess the distribution of gas resulting from the injection of nzvi solutions an nzvi concentration of 1 g l was selected to match previous laboratory and field studies phenrat et al 2009 bennett et al 2010 johnson et al 2013 kocur et al 2014 chowdhury et al 2015 stefaniuk et al 2016 the nzvi solutions also contained unreacted nabh4 that remained following synthesis mondal et al 2018 an initial nabh4 concentration of 1 35 g l represents the nabh4 fe molar ratio of 2 1 recommended by he and zhao 2007 and commonly employed in laboratory and field nzvi applications zhang and elliott 2006 johnson et al 2013 kocur et al 2013 kocur et al 2014 this is greater than the stoichiometric nabh4 fe ratio of 1 2 for nzvi synthesis using ferrous sulfate and assuming complete reaction and no other losses would result in 1 02 g l of nabh4 remaining an initial nabh4 concentration of 6 35 g l represents a nabh4 fe ratio of 9 4 1 and was used to investigate the production of a large hydrogen gas volume assuming complete reaction and no other losses during synthesis this initial concentration would result in 6 02 g l of nabh4 remaining experiment tc 1 was conducted to investigate the mobilization of hydrogen gas over larger distances than in the previous experiments using a larger flow cell as well as the subsequent bubble facilitated transport of tce and changes in aqueous flow using the typical 2 1 nabh4 fe ratio 2 3 small scale flow cell experiments bh 1 bh 6 nz 1 and nz 6 were performed in a 22 34 1 inside thickness cm3 flow cell fig 1a packed with sand the flow cell was built from acrylic plastic with a removable aluminum lid fastened to the base of the cell using six exterior threaded rods and sealed to the top of the walls using a neoprene gasket four ports were installed along each of the two edges for water displacement and solution injection an additional four ports were installed in the base and equipped with hydrophilic nylon membranes 10 μm pore size emd millipore corporation to allow uniform drainage of the cell under vacuum to a residual water saturation the sand pack was separated from the inside edges of the cell by sections of stainless steel mesh creating influent and effluent clear wells to promote uniform flow during water displacement solutions of nabh4 experiments bh 1 and bh 6 or nzvi with nabh4 experiments nz 1 and nz 6 table 1 were injected 10 ml each through a stainless steel needle to a location 2 cm above the base of the pack the volume of gas produced in the sand pack during experiments in the small scale flow cell was determined by measuring the mass of water displaced from the cell mettler toledo ms6002s corrected for any gas that accumulated in the clear wells there was no imposed flow of water in these experiments the flow cell was lit from behind using an led light panel ledgo cn 1200h and covered in black fabric to block ambient light images were captured every 5 min using a digital camera canon eos rebel t3i placed in front of the cell to measure gas saturations by light transmission tidwell and glass 1994 niemet and selker 2001 according to 3 s e 1 s g s r 1 s r 1 ln i i s ln i r i s where s e is the effective saturation s g is the gas saturation s r is the residual water saturation i is the transmitted light intensity i s is the transmitted light intensity through the water saturated sand pack and i r is the transmitted light intensity through the sand pack at residual water saturation the ratio of transmitted light intensity through the water saturated and residual sand packs i r i s was treated as a uniform value over the entire pack van de ven et al 2020 and was fit using the mass of displaced water as representative of gas in the sand pack 2 4 intermediate scale flow cell experiment tc 1 was performed in a 150 150 2 inside thickness cm3 flow cell fig 1b packed with sand the flow cell was built from two glass plates sealed to a stainless steel frame using viton gaskets the lid was also sealed to the frame using a neoprene gasket mesh wrapped stainless steel perforated plates were used to create clear wells along the influent and effluent edges to promote uniform horizontal water flow in addition to influent and effluent ports attached to the clear wells four sampling ports were installed through the effluent edge of the flow cell fig 1b and attached to needles inserted 10 cm into the sand and at elevations of 75 95 115 and 135 cm above the bottom of the sand pack tce and nzvi solutions were injected using a gas tight syringe through a separate needle inserted through the influent edge with its tip located 15 cm above the bottom of the sand pack and 60 cm from the influent edge a tce saturated solution was prepared by slowly mixing water and tce dnapl for a period of 4 weeks 160 ml of water and 20 ml of dnapl were stirred in a 200 ml ptfe capped glass jar the resulting aqueous solution was considered to be in equilibrium with the headspace which consisted initially of atmospheric air and have an aqueous concentration of tce near the solubility limit of 1100 mg l at 25 c pankow and cherry 1996 after mixing a 50 ml sample of tce saturated solution was collected from the jar using a gas tight syringe and injected into the flow cell over approximately 3 min 120 ml of 1 g l nzvi was then injected through the same stainless steel needle into the tce plume over approximately 6 min the relatively rapid injection of these two solutions produced circular plumes centred on the needle tip gas production and mobilization was monitored qualitatively by backlighting the cell using a custom built led panel custom effects led solutions and capturing images using the same camera as used in the small scale flow cell experiments the flow cell was placed in a black enclosure during the experiment to reduce the effects of ambient lighting on the captured images 2 5 water flow sampling and analysis during experiment tc 1 water was pumped through the intermediate scale flow cell at 12 ml min average linear pore water velocity of 1 5 m day which is faster than in a typical field setting but within the darcy regime reynolds number of 0 15 water flow was stopped during tce and nzvi injection and restarted 14 h later and continued until 4 days after injection water samples were collected from each of the four effluent sampling ports in 4 ml and 20 ml glass vials for analysis of vocs and dissolved gases respectively every 2 h in the first 8 h following the start of water flow and then every 4 h afterwards with the last three samples taken at 7 h 10 h and 5 h intervals samples were analyzed by solid phase microextraction spme to determine dissolved tce concentrations using a modified method from usepa 2006 and to determine dissolved ethene and ethane concentrations using a modified headspace method kampbell and vandegrift 1998 caruso and santoro 2014 both by gas chromatography gc agilent technologies type 7890b with agilent 80 pal autosampler with a flame ionization detector fid the laboratory method detection limit mdl was 5 0 μg l for tce 0 04 μg l for ethene and 0 04 μg l for ethane the water samples were also analyzed for vinyl chloride chloroethane 1 1 dichloroethene trans 1 2 dichloroethene 1 1 dichloroethane cis 1 2 dichloroethene 1 1 1 trichloroethane and 1 2 dichloroethane blank samples control and control verification samples were analyzed throughout each sample run to ensure gc consistency and accuracy in addition to effluent sampling pre and post injection tracer tests were conducted to assess any changes in aqueous flow patterns during each test a 0 5 by volume solution of green dye loretta foods was pumped through the flow cell at 15 ml min images of the tracer were captured at 30 s intervals the post injection tracer test was conducted after all water samples had been collected 3 results and discussion 3 1 gas production and mobilization the injection of nabh4 experiments bh 1 and bh 6 and nzvi with nabh4 experiments nz 1 and nz 6 resulted in the production of 6 to 45 ml and 12 to 74 ml of gas in the sand packs respectively fig 2 additional gas that was produced accumulated in the clear wells the majority of the gas volumes is attributed to the reaction of nabh4 as the stoichiometric production of hydrogen from 10 ml of 1 g l nzvi would produce only 4 3 ml of gas neglecting dissolution in the aqueous phase as expected more gas was produced from higher concentrations of nabh4 with or without nzvi and more gas was produced from nzvi and nabh4 than from nabh4 alone gas production rates decreased with time in all experiments with production reaching a plateau after 60 min 120 min and 180 min in experiments nz 1 nz 6 and bh 1 respectively a plateau was not reached in experiment bh 6 after 600 min huang et al 2016 reported similar reaction times for hydrogen gas production for similar nzvi concentrations synthesized using the borohydride reduction method the gas volumes produced in experiments bh 1 bh6 nz 1 and nz 6 represent 60 450 120 and 740 of the pore space that corresponded to the 10 ml injection volumes therefore for nzvi concentrations and synthesis conditions typical of field applications bh 1 and nz 1 gas production can exceed the capillary trapping capacity of the porous medium in the target treatment zone particularly if the majority of gas is produced prior to the downstream transport of the injected solution and contact with a greater treatment volume the resulting distribution of the gas in the sand pack is shown in figs 3 and 4 calibration of the ratio of transmitted light through a residually saturated sand pack to a water saturated sand pack was used to match the volume of gas measured by water displacement to that measured by image analysis van de ven et al 2020 in experiments bh 1 and bh 6 fig 2 calibration was not possible for the nz 1 and nz 6 experiments because of gas that was obscured by the nzvi and the calibrated transmitted light intensity ratio from the nabh4 experiments equal to 0 6 was applied to those experiments to determine gas saturations outside of the nzvi region light intensities were averaged over a 1 mm 1 mm area for the calculation of local gas saturations following the injection of nabh4 in experiments bh 1 and bh 6 fig 3 gas formed in a circular region around the injection needle tip injection zone at gas saturations of approximately 12 and 22 respectively 15 min after injection with increasing time additional gas production resulted in gas migration in discontinuous channels that extended from the injection zone to the top of the flow cell gas saturations in these channels were approximately 2 to 10 discontinuous gas flow was confirmed by processing differences between sequential images to identify local regions of increasing and decreasing gas saturation indicative of gas fragmentation and mobilization hegele and mumford 2014 unstable upwards gas flow in the form of discontinuous channels is common e g brooks et al 1999 glass et al 2000 geistlinger et al 2006 and has been shown to occur in this sand for point injections at gas flow rates less than 10 ml min van de ven and mumford 2019 this is consistent with the initial gas production rates of 0 1 2 ml min in these experiments despite mobilization a gas phase remained in the injection zone at the end of experiments bh 1 and bh 6 the persistence of this trapped gas indicates that while the volume of gas produced is sufficient to cause mobilization trapping mechanisms will maintain gas saturations in an injection zone capable of reducing the aqueous phase permeability in that zone similar results were observed following the injection of nzvi and excess nabh4 in experiments nz 1 and nz 6 fig 4 in which a network of gas channels was formed starting at the injection zone trapped gas also remained in the injection zone following mobilization although decreases in transmitted light intensity in these experiments are due to both the presence of gas and iron hydroxides which prevented quantification of gas saturations in the injection zone even at later time when the nzvi settled due to gravity fig 4h in the higher concentration experiments bh 6 and nz 6 the higher volume of gas led to the formation of a gas pool below the lid of the flow cell in a larger homogeneous system it is expected that this gas would continue to migrate upwards as a network of discontinuous gas channels however these experiments with gas accumulation below the impermeable lid are an example of the potential effects of heterogeneity where lower permeability capillary barriers would create gas pools limiting the vertical migration of gas but enhancing its lateral spread as such gas production and migration can create new voc transport pathways in both the vertical and horizontal directions dictated by the site geology furthermore in a heterogeneous system vertical variations in soil texture can create multiple closely spaced capillary barriers and a vertical distribution of gas pools that can substantially decrease the average aqueous permeability as gas saturations increase limiting the ability for subsequent injections to reach the target treatment zone greater gas mobilization occurred in the intermediate scale flow cell experiment tc 1 as in the small scale flow cell experiments gas production originated in the injection zone the injection zone was visible as a black circle in images of the flow cell created by nzvi that blocked transmitted light fig 5 the gas then migrated upwards as a network of gas channels the approximate location of gas shown in fig 5 is based on differences between images and the initial water saturated image but local gas saturations were not quantified these gas channels formed rapidly with upward migration occurring soon after nzvi injection 90 s migration was also rapid reaching the full height of the flow cell 25 min after injection 3 2 impact on aqueous flow pathways images of the pre and post injection tracer test are shown in fig 6 similarities in the position of the tracer front above the injection zone show good reproducibility between tests with negligible impact of the gas channels on aqueous flow however inspection of the tracer front in the injection zone during the post injection tracer test shows considerable flow diversion with delayed tracer arrival immediately down gradient of the injection zone e g fig 6c compared to fig 6h visual inspection of the tracer front at a location 12 cm down gradient of the needle tip showed an approximately 11 h delay in tracer arrival this is attributed to a reduction in aqueous permeability caused by the presence of trapped gas consistent with reductions resulting from hydrogen gas exsolution and trapping from the reaction of nabh4 and water observed previously mohammed et al 2019 the presence of nzvi and precipitation of iron hydroxides may also have contributed to this reduction johnson et al 2008 jeen et al 2012 fronczyk and pawluk 2014 tosco et al 2014 but because the volume of gas generated was sufficient to overcome the trapping capacity of the sand and even small amounts of trapped gas can significantly reduce the aqueous permeability gas production alone is sufficient to explain the difference in tracer transport although the area affected by the trapped gas and the extent of the change in aqueous flow in experiment tc 1 were small they demonstrate the potential for larger scale effects in field scale nzvi applications for example for nzvi injections conducted at several horizontal and vertical positions within a target treatment zone the influence of trapped gas could be much greater due to the creation of larger regions of reduced aqueous permeability in addition as described in the discussion of experiments bh 6 and nz 6 the aqueous permeability would be further reduced and bypassing enhanced in the presence of capillary barriers that allowed the accumulation of higher gas saturations the impact of bypassing in three dimensional field scale nzvi applications will depend on the extent and distribution of gas occupied regions particularly with respect to proximity to target treatment zones these changes in flow pathways are particularly important in applications that require multiple successive nzvi injections as later injections can be blocked by gas produced during earlier injections 3 3 bubble facilitated voc transport dissolved tce ethane and ethene were detected in each of the four sampling ports in experiment tc 1 following gas production and migration fig 7 peak detection occurred at the 75 and 95 cm sampling locations 8 h after nzvi injection and at the 115 and 135 cm sampling locations 12 h after nzvi injection concentrations decreased to below detection limits after 24 to 36 h these peak arrival times are consistent with the expected breakthrough times between the horizontal position of the gas channels and sampling needles at an average linear pore water velocity of 1 5 m day no other vocs were detected as expected for tce degradation by beta elimination liu et al 2005 peak concentrations of tce in samples from the 75 95 115 and 135 cm locations were 896 230 58 and 40 μg l respectively these were detected at elevations well above the location of the injected tce solution centered on the needle tip 15 cm above the bottom of the sand pack and also well above the expected path for dissolved tce as it was transported with horizontal water flow to the flow cell s effluent edge this demonstrates substantial tce transport in the gas phase resulting from tce partitioning from the aqueous phase into the gas primarily hydrogen phase prior to complete tce degradation and subsequent partitioning back to the aqueous phase above the injection zone the decreasing tce concentrations with height above the injection zone are likely the result of increased stripping of tce from the gas phase as that gas phase migrated upwards detected concentrations of ethane and ethene highest peak concentrations of 0 56 and 0 36 μg l respectively show that some degradation of tce was occurring and that gaseous reaction products can also contribute to and be transported by gas migration the detection of tce at elevations greater than 1 m above the injection zone demonstrates that the extent of the gas channels and the short time required for their development creates conditions favourable for bubble facilitated voc transport sufficient gas was produced in the injection zone to exceed the trapping capacity resulting in gas mobilization in addition partitioning of tce to that gas occurred over time scales comparable to those required for tce degradation by nzvi as a result mobilized gas was able to transport tce to higher elevations well above the original location of the tce plume this has important implications for field scale nzvi applications where gas production and migration should be carefully considered to limit the potential for contaminant redistribution as well as to limit changes in aqueous flow pathways this can include limiting the amount of excess nabh4 used for the synthesis of fresh nzvi in the field and the use of sulfidated nzvi to limit gas production 4 summary and conclusions solutions of nzvi and nabh4 were injected into small scale 22 34 1 cm3 and intermediate scale 150 150 2 cm3 flow cells all experiments resulted in substantial gas production with 6 to 74 ml of gas produced in the small scale experiments using 1 35 g l or 6 35 g l nabh4 with or without 1 g l nzvi importantly this volume of gas was the same order of magnitude as the injected solution volume 10 ml resulting in trapped gas saturations in the injection zone of 12 to 22 and the mobilization of gas above the injection zone as a network of gas channels with gas saturations of 2 to 10 gas volumes were larger for the injection of higher nabh4 concentrations and for the combination of nzvi with nabh4 compared to nabh4 alone and corresponded to higher gas saturations and the formation of denser gas channel networks although these experiments were conducted in homogeneous sand packs evidence of gas pooling below the lid of the flow cell also highlights the potential role of capillary barriers in heterogeneous systems were gas accumulation could create higher gas saturations near the injection zone as well as create lateral gas flow pathways below those barriers in the intermediate scale experiment a comparison of pre and post injection tracer tests showed that gas production was sufficient to result in flow diversion around the injection zone in addition rapid gas production and vertical gas migration was able to transport tce and reaction products away from the injection zone centered 15 cm above the base of the sand pack which contained tce saturated solution to heights of 75 to 135 cm above the base of the sand pack detection of tce at concentrations up to 896 μg l was accompanied by detection of ethane and ethene products of the reduction of tce by nzvi this enhanced vertical transport which is much greater than that expected by vertical transverse dispersion is attributed to bubble facilitated transport of the tce and reaction products together these results show that hydrogen production should be considered alongside nzvi selectivity when assessing the impacts of nrd on an nzvi application even small amounts of gas production can result in trapped gas saturations that will reduce aqueous permeability and limit the subsequent delivery of nzvi to that injection zone as would be required for remediation approaches based on repeated injections the partitioning of background dissolved gases to that trapped gas e g van de ven and mumford 2020 will prolong its dissolution such that the limitation will persist even between infrequent injections if gas is produced in excess of the trapping capacity of the porous medium the mobilization of gas away from the injection zone creates a new and rapid transport pathway the partitioning of tce to that gas followed by its bubble facilitated transport can take place before complete reduction of the tce if not managed this enhanced transport has the potential to reduce treatment effectiveness by removing volatile target contaminants from the injection zone and increase risk to receptors at ground surface fortunately strategies to improve the selectivity of nzvi including sulfidation will also address these concerns both by reducing the amount of hydrogen produced through reaction with water and by lowering the rate of that reaction such that the hydrogen is produced over a greater volume of porous medium during migration of the injected solution in addition in applications where excess nabh4 is used for nzvi synthesis steps should be taken to limit that excess or allow hydrogen gas formed by the reaction of nabh4 with water to exsolve and escape prior to injection to reduce the effects of gas
