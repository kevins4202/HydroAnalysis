10685,the brazilian savanna locally known as cerrado native vegetation has been replaced by an agro pastoral land cover over the last few decades which has affected its hydrological cycle and the availability of its water resources reference evapotranspiration eto estimates are an important tool for water resources managements because they estimate the potential for atmospheric water loss the penman monteith method fao pm is recommended by fao due to its consistent results in different regions and climates but it requires a high data demand several empirical eto methods with less inputs have been tested around the world and machine learning approaches have been studied in the recent years therefore in the present paper 21 empirical methods classified as mass transfer based radiation based temperature based or combination methods and 4 equations generated by genetic algorithm ga were evaluated against the fao pm method radiation based methods were more accurate than the others especially de bruin keijman and priestley taylor methods which were the two models with best performance mass transfer based and temperature based models were deemed unsuitable due to their high errors and low correlation when compared to the other eto methods among the combination methods the copais method showed the fifth best result from all the empirical equations tested the ga equations were generated based on our results considering the mass transfer based and temperature based models however only one equation using air temperature and solar radiation as inputs presented a performance as good as the best methods found in our study therefore alternatives empirical equations and ga approach could meet eto estimates similar to the fao pm method using less inputs keywords reference evapotranspiration limited data genetic algorithm comparative analysis cerrado eddy covariance 1 introduction the cerrado is the largest savanna environment in south america composed by a mix of shrubs grasses and forests and covers about 24 of the total area of brazil garcia et al 2017 rodrigues et al 2014 this biome is characterized by a dry season that is five or six months long with a rainfall depth representing about 10 of the total precipitation rodrigues et al 2016b vourlitis and da rocha 2011 during the dry season evaporative demand is considerably higher and soil water availability becomes low causing drought stress for woody species bucci et al 2008 rodrigues et al 2014 2013 however the native vegetation of the cerrado has been replaced by agricultural crops and pastures over the last few decades beuchle et al 2015 oliveira et al 2014 sano et al 2010 silva et al 2019 and the climate and hydrological cycle have been highly affected due to human activities giambelluca et al 2009 nóbrega et al 2018 rodrigues et al 2014 assessing the effects of land cover change on the cerrado hydrological cycle is important for assessing how climate and land use affect water resources foley et al 2005 giambelluca et al 2009 nóbrega et al 2018 rodrigues et al 2014 because vegetation has an important influence on surface atmosphere energy and water exchange faria et al 2018 foley et al 2005 giambelluca et al 2009 one useful approach is to determine how changes in land use affect reference evapotranspiration eto doorenbos and pruitt 1977 huo et al 2013 shiri 2018 fao defines crop reference evapotranspiration eto as an evaporation of a hypothetical reference crop height of 0 12 m surface resistance of 70 s m 1 and an albedo of 0 23 allen et al 1998 the most accurate estimations of eto are obtained using lysimeters however this method is costly and limited sharifi and dinpashoh 2014 tabari et al 2013 xing et al 2008 eto estimates can be used to estimate crop water requirements and water budgets for any local considering only meteorological parameters doorenbos and pruitt 1977 huo et al 2013 shiri 2018 crop evapotranspiration etc is defined by a product of eto and an empirical crop coefficient kc for each cover type doorenbos and pruitt 1977 since a significant part of cerrado is classified as agro pastoral land beuchle et al 2015 brannstrom et al 2008 jepson et al 2010 eto estimates play a big role in the water resource management for this region the penman monteith method fao pm is recommended by fao to estimate eto and was tested and used globally without any local corrections dinpashoh et al 2011 droogers and allen 2002 gong et al 2006 shiri 2019 despite the acceptance of the fao pm model this method has a high data demand and for many locations the required input data are not available and or incomplete the data required for the fao pm equation are air temperature relative humidity wind speed and solar radiation allen et al 1998 proposed alternatives to the fao pm method when climatic data are missing however several authors aladenola and madramootoo 2014 čadro et al 2017 cai et al 2007 djaman et al 2016 jabloun and sahli 2008 popova et al 2006 tested these procedures outlined by fao and the findings showed the need for local empirical corrections besides the penman monteith equation fao considers two other methods to estimate eto i the hargreaves samani method hargreaves and samani 1985 when only temperature data are available and ii the pan evaporation method which consists in a pan observation multiplied by a conversion factor allen et al 1998 furthermore there are several alternative eto methods reported in the literature hargreaves 1975 jensen and haise 1963 makkink 1957 penman 1948 priestley and taylor 1972 turc 1961 and tested in different climates by many authors bourletsikas et al 2017 shiri 2019 tabari et al 2013 trajkovic and kolakovic 2009 xu et al 2013 zhang et al 2018 those alternatives methods are usually divided into categories pan evaporation mass transfer based radiation based temperature based and combination reference evapotranspiration is nonlinear and depends on several climatic variables and physical processes which makes it difficult to find and derive a simple formula that represents all of those processes ferreira et al 2019 wen et al 2015 and measurement instruments especially instrumentation for net radiation are costly therefore an ideal method is needed requiring as few input data variables as possible without affecting the accuracy of estimation feng et al 2017 machine learning models are potentially attractive alternatives because they generate less complex equations and use fewer inputs than the fao pm method based on the seasonal behavior of the area machine learning approaches using support vector machine svm artificial neural networks ann and genetic algorithm ga have been described and tested by many authors around the world alves sobrinho et al 2011 ferreira et al 2019 jovic et al 2018 kisi 2015 mattar 2018 mehdizadeh et al 2017 shiri 2019 tangune and escobedo 2018 wang et al 2017 zanetti et al 2007 of these three methods only ga has been found to generate consistently reliable results considering the importance of eto regarding water resources management for the cerrado and the fact that meteorological data are lacking for this region the objective of this study was to evaluate simpler eto methods compared to the fao pm equation for a grass mixed cerrado in this study we tested 21 commonly used eto equations represented in four categories i mass transfer based ii radiation based iii temperature based and iv combination additionally we also generated four eto equations using machine learning ga approach according to our results our overall goal is to provide a better understanding of the seasonal variation of climatic variables and how they affect eto for the cerrado region 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area this study was conducted at the fazenda miranda located 15 km sse of cuiaba mato grosso brazil fig 1 the vegetation is a mixed forest grassland locally known as campo sujo or dirty field cerrado rodrigues et al 2016b alvares et al 2013 reported that the climate in the study site according to the köppen climate classification is characterized as aw tropical semi humid with dry winters and wet summers the mean annual rainfall and temperature are 1420 mm and 26 5 c respectively and the dry season extends from may to october rodrigues et al 2014 vourlitis and da rocha 2011 the study site is on flat terrain at an altitude of 157 m above sea level 2 2 micrometeorological measurements micrometeorological measurements were conducted from march 2011 to february 2012

surface with one plate placed in a laterite soil type and the other placed in a sandy soil type which are typical soils of the local where the tower is placed rodrigues et al 2014 tsoil was measured by two temperature probes 108 temperature probe campbell scientific inc logan ut usa installed 1 cm below the ground level each probe placed in the soil types described previously sh2o was measured using two time domain reflectometry probes cs616 l50 campbell scientific inc logan ut usa installed 20 cm below the soil surface placed in both soil types as well soil moisture and temperature were computed as an average from both soil types data for duration of sunshine n were obtained from an off site automatic station of the national institute of meteorology inmet located 15 km away from the fazenda miranda 15 47 00 s 56 04 00 w 140 m 2 3 eddy covariance measurements h and le were quantified using eddy covariance sensors installed 10 m above ground level rodrigues et al 2014 wind direction was typically out of the nnw and nne the analysis of upwind fetch using the schuepp et al 1990 indicated that approximately 90 of the flux originated within 1 km upwind of the micrometeorological tower rodrigues et al 2016b the eddy covariance system is composed by an open path infrared gas analyzer li 7500 li cor inc lincoln ne usa to measure the mean and fluctuating quantities of h2o vapor and a 3d sonic anemometer thermometer csat 3 campbell scientific inc logan ut usa to measure the mean and fluctuating quantities of wind speed and temperature the sensors were oriented in the mean wind direction and data were collected at a rate of 10 hz raw data and 30 min average fluxes were stored and computed using a data logger cr1000 campbell scientific inc logan ut usa average h and le values were computed over a 30 min interval using the covariance between the fluctuations in vertical wind speed temperature and h2o vapor density respectively following a coordinate rotation of the wind vectors mcmillen 1988 water vapor flux was corrected for the simultaneous fluctuations in heat according to webb et al 1980 2 4 eto estimation methods 2 4 1 penman monteith method we used the penman monteith method fao pm as the benchmark in the current study to evaluate 21 other eto models the penman monteith model allen et al 1998 can be expressed as 1 e t o 0 408 δ r n g γ 900 t a 273 u 2 e s e a δ γ 1 0 34 u 2 where eto is the reference crop evapotranspiration mm day 1 δ is the slope of water vapor pressure curve kpa c 1 rn is the net radiation mj m 2 day

kpa and ea is the actual water vapor pressure kpa to estimate wind speed at 2 m height we used eq 2 allen et al 1998 2 u 2 u z 4 87 ln 67 8 z 5 42 where uz is the wind speed measured at z m above ground surface m s 1 and z is the height of measurement above ground surface m which is 10 m in our study 2 4 2 mass transfer based methods mass transfer based models utilize the fundamentals of dalton s law and the concept of eddy transfer of water vapor from an evaporating surface to the atmosphere singh and xu 1997 mass transfer methods consider the relations between the saturation water vapor pressure es and the actual water vapor pressure ea such as the vapor pressure deficit vpd which is the difference between es and ea we used 5 different mass transfer based equations to compare with the fao pm albrecht method albrecht 1950 3 e t o f e s e a where eto is in mm day 1 es and ea are in hpa f 0 4 if u2 1 m s 1 and f 0 1005 0 297 u 2 if u2 1 m s 1 and u2 is in m s 1 mahringher

only air temperature data are available in our research we considered three different temperature based methods to compare with the benchmark hargreaves method hargreaves 1975 20 e t o 0 0135 r s t a

eq 23 22 e t o 16 c 10 t a i a 23 c n 360 where eto is in mm day 1 ta is in c i is a thermal index eq 24 appointed by the local normal climatic temperature regime and a is a function of i eq 25 24 i t

consider solar radiation air temperature and relative humidity as inputs each of those equations were optimized accordingly to the study area of each research which have different climatic conditions

daily minimum temperature in c 2 5 statistical analysis the results from each method were compared with the penman monteith method fao pm which serves as the benchmark for eto we compared each model to the benchmark using simple linear regression the regressions were forced through the origin since eto estimates should be zero whenever there is no evapotranspiration the statistical methods used to evaluate model performance were willmott s index of agreement d willmott 1982 eq 31 correlation coefficient r eq 32 root mean square error rmse in mm day 1 eq 33 and mean bias error mbe in mm day 1 equation 34 31 d 1 i 1 n p i o i 2 i 1 n p i o o i o 2 32 r i 1 n p i p o i o i 1 n p i p 2 i 1 n o i o 2 33 rmse i 1 n o i p i 2 n 34 mbe i 1 n p i o i n where pi is the estimate value of the ith day mm day 1 oi is the observed value of the ith day mm day 1 p is the mean of estimated values mm day 1 o is the mean of observed values mm day 1 and n is the number of observed values willmott s index of agreement d was used to quantify the degree of correspondence between pi and oi where d 1 indicates complete correspondence and d 0 indicates no correspondence between measured and modeled values willmott 1982 the root mean square error rmse used to quantify the amount of error between the observed and estimated values willmott 1982 2 6 genetic algorithm genetic algorithm ga was presented in holland 1975 as an abstraction of biological evolution and it is a computational analogy of an adaptive system that is used to generate useful solutions to optimization and search problems ga is used to find optimal or good solutions by examining only a small fraction of the possible candidates mitchell 1998 here a candidate solution is an equation to estimate eto composed by mathematical operations addition subtraction multiplication and division mathematical functions sine cosine square root power exponential and log and coefficients ga creates an initial group of potential solutions randomly at each generation a fitness function evaluates the performance of each candidate solution this fitness function consist in three steps i find the best coefficients for the evaluated equation ii calculate eto with the new equation iii compare the result with eto estimated by fao 56 pm the rmse was used to evaluate the performance of the candidate the best candidates are selected based on the fitness function these candidates can have their terms merged with other candidates similar to the biological crossover operation generating new candidates the mutation operation can also be applied changing some candidate s terms all these operation create a new generation that is more evolved than the previous one after several generations better equations will be available the best candidate after several generations is selected as the equation to be used as a model to estimate eto to generate those equations we used micrometeorological data from march 2011 to february 2012 and we tested them using data between march 2012 and february 2013 3 results and discussion 3 1 micrometeorological conditions the climate of the study area showed a seasonal rainfall variation fig 2 b we considered the period with rainfall depth above 100 mm month as the wet season hutyra et al 2005 rodrigues et al 2014 the dry season was defined from april to october this period only showed 7 of the recorded rainfall the study period presented a total accumulated rainfall of 1030 mm which represents a rainfall depth 27 lower than the expected for this region vourlitis and da rocha 2011 fig 2a presents monthly mean eto computed using the benchmark model fao pm the average eto value sd was 3 35 1 22 mm day 1 we found lower eto values during the dry season air and soil temperatures fig 3 a showed higher variations during the dry season due to frequent cold fronts that usually comes from the south grace et al 1996 during the study period the mean sd temperature was 26 4 2 9 c the highest monthly mean ta value was in september 28 6 2 2 c and june was the month with the lowest air temperature 24 1 3 5 c the maximum and minimum temperatures recorded were 38 4 and 9 5 c respectively monthly mean soil temperature was slightly higher than air temperature during the study period variations in relative humidity fig 3b were higher during the dry season with the lowest values observed during the dry season and the lowest mean sd monthly value in august 52 8 15 6 the average sd rh during the study period was 71 3 14 7 fig 3b also presents the average monthly gravimetric soil moisture mass water mass dry soil sh2o varied between 4 8 during the wet season however in august and september the mean sd soil moisture values were 2 18 0 03 and 2 14 0 03 respectively these values are lower than other cerrado areas because the coarse soil textures of the study area drain rapidly and have a low water holding capacity rodrigues et al 2016a wind speed at 2 m height fig 3c did not show high seasonal variation during the study period u 2 average value sd was 1 2 0 4 m s 1 and the high standard deviation is due to sporadic nature of the wind which causes large daily variation rodrigues et al 2016a according to allen et al 1998 the winds in the study area were classified as light wind with u 2 1 m s 1 and moderate wind with 1 u 2 3 m s 1 the monthly mean values of vapor pressure deficit vpd i e the difference between saturation water vapor pressure es and the actual water vapor pressure ea are presented in fig 3c vpd values were higher in the dry season when air temperature and relative humidity were below average for the study period solar and net radiation fig 3d varied with a similar behavior except between the months of april and june this drop of rn in the dry season was due partially to an increase in surface albedo caused by a decrease in greenness when sh2o was low machado et al 2004 rodrigues et al 2014 we found higher standard deviations for rn during the wet season which indicates a larger day to day variation due to frequent cloud cover during those months machado et al 2004 sensible heat flux h and latent heat flux le varied seasonally throughout the study period fig 4 h was larger than le during the dry season reflecting the larger surface to air temperature gradient machado et al 2004 and the lower water availability that are typical of the dry season in south central mato grosso vourlitis et al 2008 ground heat flux g did not show a seasonal variation the bowen ratio β values defined as a ratio of h over le were higher than 1 from july to october i e during this period a big part of available energy were used to heat up the air betts et al 2007 rodrigues et al 2013 3 2 mass transfer based methods fig 5 shows the mass transfer based methods results compared with fao pm values we observed a pattern between those results where the five models tended to both overestimate and underestimate eto when vpd was both high and low during the dry season when humidity is lower fig 3b fao pm eto estimates showed lower values than the wet season fig 2a therefore the pattern presented by fig 5 with both overestimation and underestimation with high eto conditions is due to lack of influence of relative humidity on eto estimates for the cerrado region curado et al 2016 rodrigues et al 2016b tabari et al 2013 found similar results regarding mass transfer based models also the mass transfer based methods used in this study use constant values that may not be appropriate to our study area climate locally corrections with a larger time series are recommended to optimize eto results when using mass transfer based methods table 1 summarizes the results of statistical analysis of the mass transfer according to the mbe values albrecht and romanenko equations overestimated eto values while the other methods underestimated them however none of those methods showed a good performance mahringer equation showed the best results but its rmse value is too high when compared to other models with good results romanenko method showed the worst results in this study 3 3 radiation based methods most of the radiation based methods showed higher d and r values than the other categories however some of them performed as bad as the mass transfer based methods considering rmse and mbe values table 2 shows the statistical analysis values of those methods and fig 6 presents the comparison between radiation models and the fao pm results de bruin keijman fig 6c and priestley taylor fig 6i methods showed the best statistical results of our study while most of the other methods except the makkink model overestimated eto values statistically the mcguinness bordne equation showed the worst results higher rmse and bias lower d when compared to other radiation based models table 2 several studies bourletsikas et al 2017 sentelhas et al 2010 shiri 2019 tabari et al 2013 trajkovic and kolakovic 2009 showed the superiority of radiation based methods over the other models when compared to fao pm indicating the importance of radiation as an input for eto we can infer that rn values affect eto estimates more than rs priestley taylor method eq 17 use rn as its main variable debruin keijman equation eq 10 considers the relation rn g as the radiation input however it is possible to suppose g 0 on a daily basis allen et al 1998 therefore rn is the major input for this model fig 3d shows that rn and rs behaved different especially between april and june during those months since fao pm considers rn instead of rs the models that use rs as an input did not perform as well as those that relied on rn when compared with the benchmark 3 4 temperature based methods the results of the statistical analysis of the temperature based models are given in table 3 fig 7 shows the three methods used to estimate eto the hargreaves model showed the best linear fit compared to the other two models fig 7a but its coefficient 0 0135 may be not appropriate to the study area conditions since it generally overestimated the benchmark eto values a modified version of hargreaves model hargraves samani method is recommended by fao when only temperature data are available allen et al 1998 however its results showed a performance worse than the original hagreaves thornthwaite equation is originally a monthly based model mm month 1 therefore the correction factor may not be applicable to the local climate in addition thornthwaite method uses a local thermal index based on values obtained in the united states condition hargreaves and thornthwaite equations do not consider relative humidity therefore eto estimates during wet season were highly overestimated trajkovic and kolakovic 2009 and sentelhas et al 2010 found poor performance of those temperature based models as well 3 4 1 combination methods fig 8 presents the comparison of eto estimated by fao pm and combination methods valiantzas 1 and 2 methods performed worse than copais model table 4 copais equation showed high willmott s d value and low mbe but it did not show a high linear correlation when compared to other models especially radiation based methods copais method was developed using data from sites where the climate is classified as warm temperature with dry summer alexandris and kerkides 2003 however it performed well for our study area when compared to temperature and mass transfer based methods bourletsikas et al 2017 also found a good performance for copais method valiantzas 1 and 2 models were developed using data from locations with different climates valiantzas 2013 both models presented good d values when compared to the other models still the errors were too high and did not exhibit a good performance valipour 2015 reported good results for both methods 3 5 cross comparison of the eto methods the best 5 models according to rmse and mbe values ranked from first to fifth were de bruin keijman priestley taylor makkink hansen and copais fig 9 there was a clear dominance of solar radiation based models therefore methods using rs and rn as the main inputs are best suited for the cerrado region fig 10 presents the monthly behavior of eto estimates for those 5 methods and the benchmark during the dry season especially during may and april when fao pm estimates were low only the equations using rn de bruin keijman and priestley taylor showed results similar to the benchmark therefore rn is better than rs to estimate eto for the region and semi humid climate mass transfer based and temperature based methods performed poorly and are not adequate to estimate eto for the local climate 3 6 evaluation of ga models according to our results there was a lack of accurate mass transfer based and temperature based methods therefore we generated four different equations using genetic algorithm considering the following combination of variables a tmax and tmin b ta and rs c tmax tmin and ra and d es ea and u2 table 5 shows the equations generated by ga using linear regressions with the eto values from the ga equations calibrated with meteorological data from march 2011 to february 2012 against fao pm estimates the mean 95 confidence intercept and slope respectively were 1 81 and 0 46 for equation 35 r² 0 44 n 304 observations 1 28 and 0 62 for equation 36 r² 0 61 n 304 observations 1 56 and 0 53 for equation 37 r² 0 53 n 304 observations and 2 83 and 0 16 for equation 38 r² 0 16 n 304 observations our results for each equation were found using data from march 2012 to february 2013 fig 11 table 6 presents the statistical results of each model the equations presented an overall performance that was better than the mass transfer based and temperature based methods however only two of them showed rmse value under copais method which was the fifth best model and the eto estimates were underestimated during the wet season equation 36 showed the best performance with high d and r and low rmse values compared to the other methods and we considered it as the third best equation of our study equation 38 is a mass transfer based method and its performance based on rmse and mbe values was better than the other models considering vpd and wind speed however fig 11d shows a pattern that does not represent a good linear fit compared to the benchmark therefore equation 38 is not suitable to estimate eto equations 35 and 36 are methods that only depend on temperature measurements and their performance were better than the other three temperature based models we observed high variation of eto estimates when the values calculated by fao pm method were low fig 11a c that variation reduced with the increasing of eto values those equations are not adequate for low eto conditions especially during dry season when there is a larger day by day variation of air temperature but they may be suitable for the wet season 3 7 model selection considerations in a seasonal tropical environments there are few direct comparisons between eto models in cerrado and many of the studies have been short days weeks aimed at crop systems and not native vegetation mendonça et al 2003 rocha et al 2003 short term studies are often inadequate in cerrado because large seasonal variations in precipitation rodrigues et al 2013 vourlitis and da rocha 2011 cause correspondingly large seasonal variations in energy partitioning and canopy physiology giambelluca et al 2009 rodrigues et al 2016b 2014 that can be challenging to simplified models of et vourlitis et al 2015 thus eto models in some tropical seasonal climates may accurately estimate annual rates of eto but fail to capture seasonal variations shahidian et al 2013 we found that the de bruin keijman and priestley taylor models were nearly identical to the penman monteith estimates of eto during the dry season but consistently over estimated penman monteith during the wet season fig 10 one possible reason for the decline in wet season performance may be because these models do not explicitly consider humidity shahidian et al 2013 which varies markedly over seasonal periods in the cerrado domain rodrigues et al 2013 however none of the mass transfer models tested here which rely on vpd as an input variable were able to adequately capture seasonal eto dynamics while two best models de bruin and priestly taylor rely on the slope of the vapor pressure vs temperature curve δ and the psychrometric constant γ which have some information on atmospheric humidity furthermore other models e g hargreaves and thornthwaite also failed to adequately estimated eto over seasonal scales indicating that the seasonal changes in meteorology humidity radiation temperature and water availability represent challenges to simplified models of eto amarakoon et al 2000 bautista et al 2009 shahidian et al 2013 tabari et al 2013 one possible issue with all of these models is the use of constants that likely vary over seasonal cycles for example vourlitis et al 2015 calibrated the priestly taylor α normally set at 1 26 see eq 17 for a tropical seasonal forest using direct measurements of et from eddy covariance and found that α reached minimum values of 0 41 during the dry season and maximum values to 1 32 during the wet season allowing these values to vary seasonally such as with rainfall or some other proxy may be the best way to use simplified models of eto for the seasonal tropical environments 4 conclusions in this study we investigated 21 eto equations performance in a grass dominated cerrado when compared to the fao penman monteith model de bruin keijman and priestley taylor models showed the best results and are reliable options when penman monteith equation cannot be satisfied however net radiation data is more difficult to obtain than the other variables mass transfer based and temperature based models performed worse than the other methods combination equations especially copais method showed good linear correlation but high errors our equations generated by genetic algorithm showed a better performance than mass transfer based and temperature based methods however did not perform as well as the models using rn the ga model with the best result used rs as one of its inputs therefore investments in radiation research and measurement instrumentation can be useful to estimate eto with simplified models with less inputs than penman monteith method due to climate change and expansion

10685,the brazilian savanna locally known as cerrado native vegetation has been replaced by an agro pastoral land cover over the last few decades which has affected its hydrological cycle and the availability of its water resources reference evapotranspiration eto estimates are an important tool for water resources managements because they estimate the potential for atmospheric water loss the penman monteith method fao pm is recommended by fao due to its consistent results in different regions and climates but it requires a high data demand several empirical eto methods with less inputs have been tested around the world and machine learning approaches have been studied in the recent years therefore in the present paper 21 empirical methods classified as mass transfer based radiation based temperature based or combination methods and 4 equations generated by genetic algorithm ga were evaluated against the fao pm method radiation based methods were more accurate than the others especially de bruin keijman and priestley taylor methods which were the two models with best performance mass transfer based and temperature based models were deemed unsuitable due to their high errors and low correlation when compared to the other eto methods among the combination methods the copais method showed the fifth best result from all the empirical equations tested the ga equations were generated based on our results considering the mass transfer based and temperature based models however only one equation using air temperature and solar radiation as inputs presented a performance as good as the best methods found in our study therefore alternatives empirical equations and ga approach could meet eto estimates similar to the fao pm method using less inputs keywords reference evapotranspiration limited data genetic algorithm comparative analysis cerrado eddy covariance 1 introduction the cerrado is the largest savanna environment in south america composed by a mix of shrubs grasses and forests and covers about 24 of the total area of brazil garcia et al 2017 rodrigues et al 2014 this biome is characterized by a dry season that is five or six months long with a rainfall depth representing about 10 of the total precipitation rodrigues et al 2016b vourlitis and da rocha 2011 during the dry season evaporative demand is considerably higher and soil water availability becomes low causing drought stress for woody species bucci et al 2008 rodrigues et al 2014 2013 however the native vegetation of the cerrado has been replaced by agricultural crops and pastures over the last few decades beuchle et al 2015 oliveira et al 2014 sano et al 2010 silva et al 2019 and the climate and hydrological cycle have been highly affected due to human activities giambelluca et al 2009 nóbrega et al 2018 rodrigues et al 2014 assessing the effects of land cover change on the cerrado hydrological cycle is important for assessing how climate and land use affect water resources foley et al 2005 giambelluca et al 2009 nóbrega et al 2018 rodrigues et al 2014 because vegetation has an important influence on surface atmosphere energy and water exchange faria et al 2018 foley et al 2005 giambelluca et al 2009 one useful approach is to determine how changes in land use affect reference evapotranspiration eto doorenbos and pruitt 1977 huo et al 2013 shiri 2018 fao defines crop reference evapotranspiration eto as an evaporation of a hypothetical reference crop height of 0 12 m surface resistance of 70 s m 1 and an albedo of 0 23 allen et al 1998 the most accurate estimations of eto are obtained using lysimeters however this method is costly and limited sharifi and dinpashoh 2014 tabari et al 2013 xing et al 2008 eto estimates can be used to estimate crop water requirements and water budgets for any local considering only meteorological parameters doorenbos and pruitt 1977 huo et al 2013 shiri 2018 crop evapotranspiration etc is defined by a product of eto and an empirical crop coefficient kc for each cover type doorenbos and pruitt 1977 since a significant part of cerrado is classified as agro pastoral land beuchle et al 2015 brannstrom et al 2008 jepson et al 2010 eto estimates play a big role in the water resource management for this region the penman monteith method fao pm is recommended by fao to estimate eto and was tested and used globally without any local corrections dinpashoh et al 2011 droogers and allen 2002 gong et al 2006 shiri 2019 despite the acceptance of the fao pm model this method has a high data demand and for many locations the required input data are not available and or incomplete the data required for the fao pm equation are air temperature relative humidity wind speed and solar radiation allen et al 1998 proposed alternatives to the fao pm method when climatic data are missing however several authors aladenola and madramootoo 2014 čadro et al 2017 cai et al 2007 djaman et al 2016 jabloun and sahli 2008 popova et al 2006 tested these procedures outlined by fao and the findings showed the need for local empirical corrections besides the penman monteith equation fao considers two other methods to estimate eto i the hargreaves samani method hargreaves and samani 1985 when only temperature data are available and ii the pan evaporation method which consists in a pan observation multiplied by a conversion factor allen et al 1998 furthermore there are several alternative eto methods reported in the literature hargreaves 1975 jensen and haise 1963 makkink 1957 penman 1948 priestley and taylor 1972 turc 1961 and tested in different climates by many authors bourletsikas et al 2017 shiri 2019 tabari et al 2013 trajkovic and kolakovic 2009 xu et al 2013 zhang et al 2018 those alternatives methods are usually divided into categories pan evaporation mass transfer based radiation based temperature based and combination reference evapotranspiration is nonlinear and depends on several climatic variables and physical processes which makes it difficult to find and derive a simple formula that represents all of those processes ferreira et al 2019 wen et al 2015 and measurement instruments especially instrumentation for net radiation are costly therefore an ideal method is needed requiring as few input data variables as possible without affecting the accuracy of estimation feng et al 2017 machine learning models are potentially attractive alternatives because they generate less complex equations and use fewer inputs than the fao pm method based on the seasonal behavior of the area machine learning approaches using support vector machine svm artificial neural networks ann and genetic algorithm ga have been described and tested by many authors around the world alves sobrinho et al 2011 ferreira et al 2019 jovic et al 2018 kisi 2015 mattar 2018 mehdizadeh et al 2017 shiri 2019 tangune and escobedo 2018 wang et al 2017 zanetti et al 2007 of these three methods only ga has been found to generate consistently reliable results considering the importance of eto regarding water resources management for the cerrado and the fact that meteorological data are lacking for this region the objective of this study was to evaluate simpler eto methods compared to the fao pm equation for a grass mixed cerrado in this study we tested 21 commonly used eto equations represented in four categories i mass transfer based ii radiation based iii temperature based and iv combination additionally we also generated four eto equations using machine learning ga approach according to our results our overall goal is to provide a better understanding of the seasonal variation of climatic variables and how they affect eto for the cerrado region 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area this study was conducted at the fazenda miranda located 15 km sse of cuiaba mato grosso brazil fig 1 the vegetation is a mixed forest grassland locally known as campo sujo or dirty field cerrado rodrigues et al 2016b alvares et al 2013 reported that the climate in the study site according to the köppen climate classification is characterized as aw tropical semi humid with dry winters and wet summers the mean annual rainfall and temperature are 1420 mm and 26 5 c respectively and the dry season extends from may to october rodrigues et al 2014 vourlitis and da rocha 2011

fazenda miranda 15 47 00 s 56 04 00 w 140 m 2 3 eddy covariance measurements h and le were quantified using eddy covariance sensors installed 10 m above ground level rodrigues et al 2014 wind

micrometeorological tower rodrigues et al 2016b the eddy covariance system is composed by an open path infrared gas analyzer li 7500 li cor inc lincoln ne usa to measure the mean and fluctuating quantities of h2o vapor and a 3d sonic anemometer thermometer csat 3 campbell scientific inc logan ut usa to measure the mean and fluctuating quantities of wind speed and temperature the sensors were

usa average h and le values were computed over a 30 min interval using the covariance between the fluctuations in vertical wind speed temperature and h2o vapor density respectively following a coordinate rotation of the wind vectors mcmillen 1988 water vapor flux was corrected for the simultaneous fluctuations in heat according to webb et al 1980 2 4 eto estimation methods 2 4 1 penman monteith method we used the penman monteith method fao pm as the benchmark in the current study to evaluate 21 other eto models the penman monteith model allen et al 1998 can be expressed as 1 e t o 0

kpa and ea is the actual water vapor pressure kpa to estimate wind speed at 2 m height we used eq 2 allen et al 1998 2 u 2 u z 4 87 ln 67 8 z 5 42 where uz is the wind speed measured at z m above ground surface m s 1 and z is the height of measurement above ground surface m which is 10 m in our study 2 4 2 mass transfer based methods mass transfer based models utilize the fundamentals of dalton s law and the concept of eddy transfer of water vapor from an evaporating surface to the atmosphere singh and xu 1997 mass transfer methods consider the relations between the saturation water vapor pressure es and the actual water vapor pressure ea such as the vapor pressure deficit vpd which is the difference between es and ea we used 5 different mass transfer based equations to compare with the fao pm albrecht method albrecht 1950 3 e t o f e s e a where eto is in mm day 1 es and ea are in hpa f 0 4 if u2 1 m s 1 and f 0 1005 0 297 u 2 if u2 1 m s 1 and u2 is in m s 1 mahringher

only air temperature data are available in our research we considered three different temperature based methods to compare with the benchmark hargreaves method hargreaves 1975 20 e t o 0 0135 r s t a

to the benchmark using simple linear regression the regressions were forced through the origin since eto estimates should be zero whenever there is no evapotranspiration the statistical methods used to evaluate model performance were willmott s index of agreement d willmott 1982 eq 31 correlation coefficient r eq 32 root mean square error rmse in mm day 1 eq 33 and mean bias error mbe in mm day 1

mm day 1 oi is the observed value of the ith day mm day 1 p is the mean of estimated values mm day 1 o is the mean of observed values mm day 1 and n is the number of observed values willmott s index of agreement d was used to quantify the degree of correspondence between pi and oi where d 1 indicates complete correspondence and d 0 indicates no correspondence between measured and modeled values willmott 1982 the root mean square error rmse used to quantify the amount of error between the observed and estimated values willmott 1982 2 6 genetic algorithm genetic algorithm ga was presented in holland 1975 as an abstraction of biological evolution and it is a computational analogy of an adaptive system that is used to generate useful solutions to optimization and search problems ga is used to find optimal or good solutions by examining only a small fraction of the possible candidates mitchell 1998 here a candidate solution is an equation to estimate eto composed by mathematical operations addition subtraction multiplication and division mathematical functions sine cosine square root power exponential and log and coefficients ga creates an initial group of potential solutions randomly at each generation a fitness function evaluates the performance of each candidate solution this fitness function consist in three steps i find the best coefficients for the evaluated equation ii calculate eto with the new equation iii compare the result with eto estimated by fao 56 pm the rmse was used to evaluate the performance of the candidate the best candidates are selected based on the fitness function these candidates can have their terms merged with other candidates similar to the biological crossover operation generating new candidates the mutation operation can also be applied changing some candidate s terms all these operation create a new generation that is more evolved than the previous one after several generations better equations will be available the best candidate after several generations is selected as the equation to be used as a model to estimate eto to generate those equations we used micrometeorological data from march 2011 to february 2012 and we tested them using data between march 2012 and february 2013 3 results and discussion 3 1 micrometeorological conditions the climate of the study area showed a seasonal rainfall variation fig 2 b we considered the period with rainfall depth above 100 mm month as the wet season hutyra et al 2005 rodrigues et al 2014 the dry season was defined from april to october this period only showed 7 of the recorded rainfall the study period presented a total accumulated rainfall of 1030 mm which represents a rainfall depth 27 lower than the expected for this region vourlitis and da rocha 2011 fig 2a presents monthly mean eto computed using the benchmark model fao pm the average eto value sd was 3 35 1 22 mm day 1 we found lower eto values during the dry season air and soil temperatures fig 3 a showed higher variations during the dry season due to frequent cold fronts that usually comes from the south grace et al 1996 during the study period the mean sd temperature was 26 4 2 9 c the highest monthly mean ta value was in september 28 6 2 2 c and june was the month with the lowest air temperature 24 1 3 5 c the maximum and minimum temperatures recorded were 38 4 and 9 5 c respectively monthly mean soil temperature was slightly higher than air temperature during the study period variations in relative humidity fig 3b were higher during the dry season with the lowest values observed during the dry season and the lowest mean sd monthly value in august 52 8 15 6 the average sd rh during the study period was 71 3 14 7 fig 3b also presents the average monthly gravimetric soil moisture mass water mass dry soil sh2o varied between 4 8 during the wet season however in august and september the mean sd soil moisture values were 2 18 0 03 and 2 14 0 03 respectively these values are lower than other cerrado areas because the coarse soil textures of the study area drain rapidly and have a low water holding capacity rodrigues et al 2016a wind speed at 2 m height fig 3c did not show high seasonal variation during the study period u 2 average value sd was 1 2 0 4 m s 1 and the high standard deviation is due to sporadic nature of the wind which causes large daily variation rodrigues et al 2016a according to allen et al 1998 the winds in the study area were classified as light wind with u 2 1 m s 1 and moderate wind with 1 u 2 3 m s 1 the monthly mean values of vapor pressure deficit vpd i e the difference between saturation water vapor pressure es and the actual water vapor pressure ea are presented in fig 3c vpd values were higher in the dry season when air temperature and relative humidity were below average for the study period solar and net radiation fig 3d varied with a similar behavior except between the months of april and june this drop of rn in the dry season was due partially to an increase in surface albedo caused by a decrease in greenness when sh2o was low machado et al 2004 rodrigues et al 2014 we found higher standard deviations for rn during the wet season which indicates a larger day to day variation due to frequent cloud cover during those months machado et al 2004 sensible heat flux h and latent heat flux le varied seasonally throughout the study period fig 4 h was larger than le during the dry season reflecting the larger surface to air temperature gradient machado et al 2004 and the lower water availability that are typical of the dry season in south central mato grosso vourlitis et al 2008 ground heat flux g did not show a seasonal variation the bowen ratio β values defined as a ratio of h over le were higher than 1 from july to october i e during this period a big part of available energy were used to heat up the air betts et al 2007 rodrigues et al 2013 3 2 mass transfer based methods fig 5 shows the mass transfer based methods results compared with fao pm values we observed a pattern between those results where the five models tended to both overestimate and underestimate eto when vpd was both high and low during the dry season when humidity is lower fig 3b fao pm eto estimates showed lower values than the wet season fig 2a therefore the pattern presented by fig 5 with both overestimation and underestimation with high eto conditions is due to lack of influence of relative humidity on eto estimates for the cerrado region curado et al 2016 rodrigues et al 2016b tabari et al 2013 found similar results regarding mass transfer based models also the mass transfer based methods used in this study use constant values that may not be appropriate to our study area climate locally corrections with a larger time series are recommended to optimize eto results when using mass transfer based methods table 1 summarizes the results of statistical analysis of the mass transfer according to the mbe values albrecht and romanenko equations overestimated eto values while the other methods underestimated them however none of those methods showed a good performance mahringer equation showed the best results but its rmse value is too high when compared to other models with good results romanenko method showed the worst results in this study 3 3 radiation based methods most of the radiation based methods showed higher d and r values than the other categories however some of them performed as bad as the mass transfer based methods considering rmse and mbe values table 2 shows the statistical analysis values of those methods and fig 6 presents the comparison between radiation models and the fao pm results de bruin keijman fig 6c and priestley taylor fig 6i methods showed the best statistical results of our study while most of the other methods except the makkink model overestimated eto values statistically the mcguinness bordne equation showed the worst results higher rmse and bias lower d when compared to other radiation based models table 2 several studies bourletsikas et al 2017 sentelhas et al 2010 shiri 2019 tabari et al 2013 trajkovic and kolakovic 2009 showed the superiority of radiation based methods over the other models when compared to fao pm indicating the importance of radiation as an input for eto we can infer that rn values affect eto estimates more than rs priestley taylor method eq 17 use rn as its main variable debruin keijman equation eq 10 considers the relation rn g as the radiation input however it is possible to suppose g 0 on a daily basis allen et al 1998 therefore rn is the major input for this model fig 3d shows that rn and rs behaved different especially between april and june during those months since fao pm considers rn instead of rs the models that use rs as an input did not perform as well as those that relied on rn when compared with the benchmark 3 4 temperature based methods the results of the statistical analysis of the temperature based models are given in table 3 fig 7 shows the three methods used to estimate eto the hargreaves model showed the best linear fit compared to the other two models fig 7a but its coefficient 0 0135 may be not appropriate to the study area conditions since it generally overestimated the benchmark eto values a modified version of hargreaves model hargraves samani method is recommended by fao when only temperature data are available allen et al 1998 however its results showed a performance worse than the original hagreaves thornthwaite equation is originally a monthly based model mm month 1 therefore the correction factor may not be applicable to the local climate in addition thornthwaite method uses a local thermal index based on values obtained in the united states condition hargreaves and thornthwaite equations do not consider relative humidity therefore eto estimates during wet season were highly overestimated trajkovic and kolakovic 2009 and sentelhas et al 2010 found poor performance of those temperature based models as well 3 4 1 combination methods fig 8 presents the comparison of eto estimated by fao pm and combination methods valiantzas 1 and 2 methods performed worse than copais model table 4 copais equation showed high willmott s d value and low mbe but it did not show a high linear correlation when compared to other models especially radiation based methods copais method was developed using data from sites where the climate is classified as warm temperature with dry summer alexandris and kerkides 2003 however it performed well for our study area when compared to temperature and mass transfer based methods bourletsikas et al 2017 also found a good performance for copais method valiantzas 1 and 2 models were developed using data from locations with different climates valiantzas 2013 both models presented good d values when compared to the other models still the errors were too high and did not exhibit a good performance valipour 2015 reported good results for both methods 3 5 cross comparison of the eto methods the best 5 models according to rmse and mbe values ranked from first to fifth were de bruin keijman priestley taylor makkink hansen and copais fig 9 there was a clear dominance of solar radiation based models therefore methods using rs and rn as the main inputs are best suited for the cerrado region fig 10 presents the monthly behavior of eto estimates for those 5 methods and the benchmark during the dry season especially during may and april when fao pm estimates were low only the equations using rn de bruin keijman and priestley taylor showed results similar to the benchmark therefore rn is better than rs to estimate eto for the region and semi humid climate mass transfer based and temperature based methods performed poorly and are not adequate to estimate eto for the local climate 3 6 evaluation of ga models according to our results there was a lack of accurate mass transfer based and temperature based methods therefore we generated four different equations using genetic algorithm considering the following combination of variables a tmax and tmin b ta and rs c tmax tmin and ra and d es ea and u2 table 5 shows the equations generated by ga using linear regressions with the eto values from the ga equations calibrated with meteorological data from march 2011 to february 2012 against fao pm estimates the mean 95 confidence intercept and slope respectively were 1 81 and 0 46 for equation 35 r² 0 44 n 304 observations 1 28 and 0 62 for equation 36 r² 0 61 n 304 observations 1 56 and 0 53 for equation 37 r² 0 53 n 304 observations and 2 83 and 0 16 for equation 38 r² 0 16 n 304 observations our results for each equation were found using data from march 2012 to february 2013 fig 11 table 6 presents the statistical results of each model the equations presented an overall performance that was better than the mass transfer based and temperature based methods however only two of them showed rmse value under copais method which was the fifth best model and the eto estimates were underestimated during the wet season equation 36 showed the best performance with high d and r and low rmse values compared to the other methods and we considered it as the third best equation of our study equation 38 is a mass transfer based method and its performance based on rmse and mbe values was better than the other models considering vpd and wind speed however fig 11d shows a pattern that does not represent a good linear fit compared to the benchmark therefore equation 38 is not suitable to estimate eto equations 35 and 36 are methods that only depend on temperature measurements and their performance were better than the other three temperature based models we observed high variation of eto estimates when the values calculated by fao pm method were low fig 11a c that variation reduced with the increasing of eto values those equations are not adequate for low eto conditions especially during dry season when there is a larger day by day variation of air temperature but they may be suitable for the wet season 3 7 model selection considerations in a seasonal tropical environments there are few direct comparisons between eto models in cerrado and many of the studies have been short days weeks aimed at crop systems and not native vegetation mendonça et al 2003 rocha et al 2003 short term studies are often inadequate in cerrado because large seasonal variations in precipitation rodrigues et al 2013 vourlitis and da rocha 2011 cause correspondingly large seasonal variations in energy partitioning and canopy physiology giambelluca et al 2009 rodrigues et al 2016b 2014 that can be challenging to simplified models of et vourlitis et al 2015 thus eto models in some tropical seasonal climates may accurately estimate annual rates of eto but fail to capture seasonal variations shahidian et al 2013 we found that the de bruin keijman and priestley taylor models were nearly identical to the penman monteith estimates of eto during the dry season but consistently over estimated penman monteith during the wet season fig 10 one possible reason for the decline in wet season performance may be because these models do not explicitly consider humidity shahidian et al 2013 which varies markedly over seasonal periods in the cerrado domain rodrigues et al 2013 however none of the mass transfer models tested here which rely on vpd as an input variable were able to adequately capture seasonal eto dynamics while two best models de bruin and priestly taylor rely on the slope of the vapor pressure vs temperature curve δ and the psychrometric constant γ which have some information on atmospheric humidity furthermore other models e g hargreaves and thornthwaite also failed to adequately estimated eto over seasonal scales indicating that the seasonal changes in meteorology humidity radiation temperature and water availability represent challenges to simplified models of eto amarakoon et al 2000 bautista et al 2009 shahidian et al 2013 tabari et al 2013 one possible issue with all of these models is the use of constants that likely vary over seasonal cycles for example vourlitis et al 2015 calibrated the priestly taylor α normally set at 1 26 see eq 17 for a tropical seasonal forest using direct measurements of et from eddy covariance and found that α reached minimum values of 0 41 during the dry season and maximum values to 1 32 during the wet season allowing these values to vary seasonally such as with rainfall or some other proxy may be the best way to use simplified models of eto for the seasonal tropical environments 4 conclusions in this study we investigated 21 eto equations performance in a grass dominated cerrado when compared to the fao penman monteith model de bruin keijman and priestley taylor models showed the best results and are reliable options when penman monteith equation cannot be satisfied however net radiation data is more difficult to obtain than the other variables mass transfer based and temperature based models performed worse than the other methods combination equations especially copais method showed good linear correlation but high errors our equations generated by genetic algorithm showed a better performance than mass transfer based and temperature based methods however did not perform as well as the models using rn the ga model with the best result used rs as one of its inputs therefore investments in radiation research and measurement instrumentation can be useful to estimate eto with simplified models with less inputs than penman monteith method due to climate change and expansion

10686,the hydrus model can be used to evaluate the effects of different soil surface treatments at the bottom of the furrow different initial nitrogen fertilizer locations and different furrow irrigation rates on deep drainage and solute leaching in furrow irrigated systems this paper extends our 2012 study in which we considered only one irrigation cycle and ignored the effects of plants as a result of considering only one irrigation cycle a large amount of water was used to change the water storage in the transport domain and only limited deep drainage of water and leaching of fertilizer at the bottom of the domain occurred in most scenarios investigated to obtain a more realistic and complete picture we have in this study considered multiple irrigation cycles to reflect actual field practices better and accounted for root water and nitrogen uptake and plant transpiration as in our previous study soil surface treatments at the bottom of the furrow include untreated compacted and an impermeable membrane and fertilizer is initially placed at one of five different locations in the furrow or the ridge we have also evaluated 1 the effectiveness of triggering irrigation based on a pre set soil water pressure head at a specific location in the ridge compared with prescribed irrigation at a regular time interval to supply water and nitrogen and 2 the effects of plant water and nitrogen uptake on the furrow water balance infiltration soil evaporation deep drainage transpiration and nitrogen leaching our simulations show that deep drainage and nitrogen leaching can be substantially reduced by using an impermeable membrane on the bottom of the furrow and that a substantial additional reduction in leaching can be achieved by triggering irrigation rather than using a fixed time schedule we also show that the initial location of fertilizer has a substantial effect on nitrogen uptake and leaching keywords furrow irrigation triggered irrigation transpiration deep drainage solute transport nitrogen leaching soil evaporation hydrus 1 introduction about 90 of irrigated crops across the world are irrigated using surface irrigation including basin border or furrow irrigation methods tiercelin and vidal 2006 furrow irrigation is the most commonly used method due to its simplicity of design and low capital costs walker and skogerboe 1987 however unlike micro irrigation methods such as surface and subsurface drip irrigation furrow irrigation is much less effective in delivering the required amounts of water and nitrogen directly to the plant roots this results in large quantities of water and nitrogen being lost below the crop root zone consequently areas with furrow irrigation are often a major source of nitrate resulting in pollution of groundwater systems e g artiola 1991 pratt and jury 1984 improved management strategies that increase irrigation efficiency and reduce nitrogen losses by leaching to groundwater are therefore urgently needed for furrow irrigated crops bar yosef 1999 simulation models such as hydrus 2d 3d and its predecessors swms 2d chain 2d and hydrus 2d šimůnek et al 2008 2016b have been widely used to improve the design management and performance of various irrigation systems including surface and subsurface drip irrigation and furrow irrigation šimůnek et al 2016b identified more than 25 papers that used the above models to evaluate the effect of various factors on furrow irrigation systems and here we include a subset of the 25 references most relevant to this paper benjamin et al 1994 abbasi et al 2003a abbasi et al 2003b abbasi et al 2003c 2004 rocha et al 2006 wöhling et al 2004a b 2006 mailhol et al 2007 warrick et al 2007 wöhling and schmitz 2007 wöhling and mailhol 2007 crevoisier et al 2008 lazarovitch et al 2009 siyal et al 2012 soroush et al 2012 ebrahimian et al 2012 2013a b zerihun et al 2014 these models which simulate water flow and or solute transport in soils proved to be flexible and cost effective tools for analyzing and evaluating various management irrigation scenarios one of these studies was the study of siyal et al 2012 who evaluated the effects of different soil surface treatments at the bottom of the furrow different initial nitrogen fertilizer locations and different furrow irrigation rates on deep drainage and solute leaching in a furrow irrigated system siyal et al 2012 assumed that the soil at the bottom of the furrow was either a untreated it retained its normal surface features and soil hydraulic properties b compacted the soil hydraulic conductivity of the surface soil was reduced by 80 or c covered with an impermeable membrane so that the bottom of the furrow was impermeable to water flow siyal et al 2012 also assumed that the nitrogen fertilizer was initially located at one of 5 different locations ranging from the bottom of the furrow to the top of the ridge the strength of the siyal et al 2012 study was that it enabled evaluation of the worst case scenario in terms of deep drainage and nitrogen leaching in the absence of plants the main limitation of the siyal et al 2012 study was that it used only one irrigation cycle and the effects of plants were neglected their results showed that deep drainage and nitrogen leaching were significantly affected by the initial soil moisture conditions since a large amount of water was used to change the soil water storage in the root zone transport domain and only limited leaching occurred in most scenarios to obtain a more realistic and complete picture one must consider multiple irrigation cycles to reflect actual field practices better and account for plant water and nitrogen uptake which affect deep drainage and nitrogen leaching the reason for applying irrigation and fertilizer is to supply plants with water and nitrogen and a full analysis should consider how much of the applied water and fertilizer can be taken up by the plants the furrow irrigation model of siyal et al 2012 was further extended by šimůnek et al 2016a to consider a processes of precipitation and evaporation as a source loss of water from the furrow and b different timings of fertigation with irrigation water šimůnek et al 2016a then used this extended furrow irrigation model to evaluate the effects of different soil surface treatments at the bottom of the furrow and different timings of fertigation on root water and solute uptake deep drainage and solute leaching in a loamy soil to overcome the limitations of the study of siyal et al 2012 in this manuscript we expand their analysis by considering a multiple irrigation cycles during one month and b the effects plants have on deep drainage and leaching by accounting for root water and solute uptake this allows us to analyze how much of the applied water and nitrogen can be taken up by the plant roots rather than be leached from the crop root zone we also consider an irrigation strategy where irrigation is triggered when a critical soil water pressure head is reached at a specified location in the root zone dabach et al 2013 rather than being provided at regular time intervals the objectives of this study are i to evaluate the effectiveness of different furrow management strategies to improve supply of water to plants and to reduce water losses due to evaporation and deep drainage ii to evaluate the effects of different initial fertilizer locations on the supply of nitrogen to plants and leaching from the crop root zone iii to evaluate the effectiveness of triggered irrigations compared with prescribed irrigations to supply water and nitrogen to plants and limit leaching from the soil profile and iv to assess the combined effects of plant water and nitrogen uptake with different furrow management strategies and different irrigation strategies to minimize deep drainage and nitrogen leaching 2 material and methods 2 1 governing equations for water flow and solute transport the hydrus 2d 3d software package šimůnek et al 2008 was used to carry out computer simulations hydrus uses numerical solutions of the richards and convection dispersion equations for variably saturated water flow and solute transport in soils respectively 1 θ t x i k k i j a h x j k i z a s 2 θ c t x i θ d i j c x j q i c x i s c r in eq 1 θ is the volumetric water content l3l 3 h is the pressure head l s is a sink term accounting for plant water uptake t 1 xi i 1 2 are the spatial coordinates l t is time t kij a are components of a dimensionless anisotropy tensor k a and k is the unsaturated hydraulic conductivity function lt 1 given by the product of the relative hydraulic conductivity kr and the saturated hydraulic conductivity ks lt 1 in eq 2 c is the solute concentration ml 3 qi is the i th component of the volumetric flux density lt 1 dij is the dispersion coefficient tensor l2t 1 and cr is the concentration of the sink term ml 3 note that although hydrus 2d 3d solves a more general solute transport equation than eq 2 only terms considered in this study are given here numerical solution of the richards equation eq 1 requires as input the soil hydraulic parameters describing the soil water retention curve and the hydraulic conductivity function in this study we use the analytical model of van genuchten 1980 to describe these two functions the soil hydraulic parameters for a loamy soil were taken from the soil catalog provided by the hydrus software and are the same as those used by siyal et al 2012 and šimůnek et al 2016a the values of these parameters are the residual water content 0 078 the saturated water content 0 43 the shape parameters α and n are 0 036 cm 1 and 1 56 respectively and the saturated hydraulic conductivity 24 96 cm day 2 2 flow domain initial and boundary conditions the same flow domain and initial and boundary conditions as in siyal et al 2012 were used in this study fig 1 the transport domain was 100 cm wide and 100 cm high the ridge was 40 cm wide the furrow was 15 cm deep and 30 cm wide and the side of the furrow had a slope of 45 the initial pressure head varied linearly between 200 cm at the bottom of the domain and 300 cm at the top of the ridge boundary conditions imposed on the flow domain included an atmospheric boundary condition at the top of the ridge a free drainage boundary condition at the bottom of the soil profile a no flow boundary condition at both vertical sides and special boundary conditions were applied at the base of the furrow see section 2 4 below to reflect the different surface conditions being investigated 2 3 the furrow irrigation submodule the furrow irrigation submodule as developed in appendix a of siyal et al 2012 and extended by šimůnek et al 2016a was used to simulate furrow irrigation and dynamic position of the water level in the furrow during irrigation šimůnek et al 2016a extended the model of siyal et al 2012 by adding the atmospheric boundary condition at the water surface in the furrow and thus allowing evaporation from and precipitation to the water surface in this submodule the water level in the furrow is calculated from the water balance accounting for the applied irrigation infiltration and the change in water volume in the furrow when water is present in the furrow the time variable pressure head boundary condition is applied to the furrow boundary that is below the surface water level reflecting the dynamic nature of the water level in the furrow an atmospheric boundary condition is applied in the furrow when it is empty of water and above the water level in a furrow when it is not an atmospheric boundary condition considers precipitation p 0 and potential evapotranspiration etp ep tp 1 0 cm d fluxes potential evapotranspiration etp equal to 1 cm day corresponds to conditions in january in north queensland australia note that we assume that plant leaves cover only the ridge and that the leaf area index is about 3 5 which corresponds to a surface cover fraction of about 80 at the top of the ridge we assume that a fraction 80 of incoming energy etp ep tp 1 0 cm d is intercepted by plants potential transpiration tp 0 8 cm d and the remaining fraction 20 by the soil surface potential evaporation ep 0 2 cm d all incoming energy in the furrow reaches either the water level in the furrow during irrigation or the bottom of the furrow between irrigations ep etp 1 0 cm d 2 4 soil surface management and fertilizer placement strategies the same soil surface management and fertilizer placement strategies as in siyal et al 2012 were considered in this study see fig 2 it was assumed that the soil at the bottom of the furrow was either a untreated it retained its usual surface features and soil hydraulic properties s 0 b compacted its hydraulic conductivity was reduced by 80 while the retention parameters were considered to remain the same sc or c covered with an impermeable membrane so that the bottom of the furrow was impermeable sim nitrogen fertilizer was mixed into the top 1 3 cm of the soil a at the bottom and center of the furrow p 1 b on the sides of the furrow p 2 c on the bottom and sides of the furrow p 3 d on the furrow sides near the ridge top p 4 and e on the top and center of the ridge p 5 fig 2 while the hydrus model allows one to consider the fate and transport of multiple solutes of various properties subject to first order degradation chain reactions such as the nitrification chain from urea to ammonium and nitrite and nitrate e g hanson et al 2006 ramos et al 2012 li et al 2015 only one nonreactive solute species and dimensionless concentrations were used in our simulations the initial concentration of this nonreactive solute which could be considered as a surrogate for nitrate readily available for transport and plant uptake in the initial placement area was adjusted so that the initial solute mass in the soil profile was equal to 1 100 this enabled us quick evaluation of the fractions of nitrogen fertilizer that were used by plants leached from the soil root zone and remained in the soil profile 2 5 irrigation strategies water application rates of 1200 1400 1600 1800 and 2000 l h 1 furrow 1 for a 100 m long furrow corresponding to area based application rates of 12 14 16 18 and 20 mm h 1 or to rates of 60 70 80 90 and 100 cm2 h 1 in our two dimensional domain respectively were compared in this study the switch off depth which determines when the supply of irrigation water is stopped was set at 10 cm siyal et al 2012 irrigation was applied every five days for 30 days a second irrigation strategy where irrigation was triggered dabach et al 2013 2015 when the soil water pressure head in the middle of the ridge and 15 cm below the top of the ridge reached a pre set value of 500 cm was also included for comparative purposes an optimal location of the triggering point and an optimal triggering pressure head for different plants and soil types is a topic of ongoing research dabach et al 2013 2015 note that this triggering point is located in the middle of the root zone with the highest root density see fig 3 below according to the stress response function described in the next section irrigation is triggered when root water uptake is reduced by about 4 2 6 root water and nitrogen uptake the approach of feddes et al 1978 was used to describe plant water uptake 3 s h α h b x z l t t p where s is defined as the volume of water removed per unit time from a unit volume of soil due to root water uptake t 1 α h is a prescribed dimensionless water stress response function of the soil water pressure head 0 α 1 b x z is the normalized water uptake distribution function l 2 lt is the width l of the soil surface associated with the transpiration process lt 40 cm surface of the furrow ridge see the definition of the transport domain below and tp is the potential transpiration rate lt 1 tp 0 8 cm d water uptake is assumed to be zero close to saturation above h 1 and when the soil is dry for h h 4 the wilting point pressure head water uptake is considered optimal between pressure heads h 2 and h 3 whereas for pressure heads between h 3 and h 4 or h 1 and h 2 water uptake decreases or increases linearly with h feddes et al 1978 the following parameters of the stress response function typical for many crops were used in our study h 1 10 cm h 2 25 cm h 3 200 cm and h 4 8000 cm the spatial distribution of roots of a hypothetical plant is described using the two dimensional root distribution function b x z of vrugt et al 2001 2002 4 b x z 1 z z m 1 x x m e p z z m z z p x x m x x where xm and zm are the maximum rooting lengths in the x and z directions l respectively x and z are distances from the origin of the plant in the x and z directions l respectively and px pz x l and z l are empirical parameters the plant was assumed to be centered in the middle of the ridge the extent of roots in the vertical zm and horizontal xm direction was 60 and 35 cm respectively parameters x and z sometimes referred to as depth and radius of maximum intensity were 30 and 20 cm respectively and parameters px and pz were set at one 1 these parameters produced the root distribution function presented in fig 3 only passive root nitrogen uptake was considered šimůnek and hopmans 2009 i e cr in eq 2 was assumed to be equal to the nitrogen concentration at any particular location no compensation mechanisms that would increase root uptake in one part unstressed of the root zone in response to reduced uptake in another part stressed of the root zone were considered in our study in the simulations carried out in this study it is assumed that the parameters required to simulate root water and nitrogen uptake i e the spatial root distribution the water stress response function and potential transpiration are constant in time potential root water uptake and its spatial distribution are thus static the actual root water and nitrogen uptake and their spatial distributions are however dynamic as a result of temporal and spatial variable distributions of water content and nitrogen concentration in response to individual irrigation events actual transpiration and nitrogen uptake will therefore differ between different scenarios 3 results and discussion the results section is organized as follows the first section 3 1 deals with water balance in the furrow the difference between constant incoming irrigation during irrigation events and time variable infiltration produces time variable water levels in the furrow which are discussed in this section water fluxes associated with the subsurface are described next in section 3 2 we discuss infiltration which is an input into the soil profile water losses in terms of evaporation and deep drainage are discussed in sections 3 3 and 3 4 respectively next in section 3 5 we discuss the productive use of water i e transpiration root water uptake and irrigation water use efficiency defined here as a ratio of transpiration irrigation the change in water storage in the subsurface a component that closes the subsurface water balance is discussed in section 3 6 finally components of the nitrogen balance including nitrogen leaching plant nitrogen uptake and nitrogen storage in the crop root zone are discussed in the last section 3 7 3 1 furrow water balance the total amount of irrigation water applied during one irrigation cycle depends on several factors including soil surface management which affects the infiltration rate and the applied irrigation rate fig 4 shows water levels in the furrow for the three different soil surface conditions i e s 0 sc and sim for 5 different irrigation rates fig 5 shows cumulative irrigation and infiltration fluxes for the first scenario s 0 and different fluxes similar graphs could be produced for the other two soil surface conditions fig 4 shows that the switch off depth is reached fastest for the sim treatment with an impermeable bottom and slowest for the s 0 treatment with the standard untreated bottom it also shows that the switch off depth is reached faster for larger irrigation rates figs 4 and 5 indicate that most water is applied in each treatment when the lowest irrigation rate is used this is because when water is applied at a lower rate it is applied during a longer time period since infiltration rates are relatively similar fig 5 right the lowest irrigation rate produces the slowest increase in the water level in the furrow reaching the switch off depth much slower than the higher irrigation rates consequently irrigation water for smaller irrigation rates is applied longer resulting in more water being applied fig 5 left fig 6 shows water levels in the furrow for the three soil surface treatments i e s 0 sc and sim for five different irrigation rates when irrigations are triggered by the soil water status in the root zone this figure shows that irrigations are triggered less often for lower irrigation rates which as explained above provide larger amounts of applied water since larger amounts of water are applied when lower irrigation rates are used it takes longer for this water to be used by plants soil evaporation and deep drainage this figure also shows that irrigations are triggered later for treatment s 0 than for treatments sc and sim this is again because more water is applied to treatment s 0 in each irrigation cycle it should also be emphasized that four irrigation events were triggered for ir 80 ir 90 and ir 100 for all surface treatments on the other hand for ir 70 four irrigation events were triggered only for treatments sc and sim while only 3 irrigation events were triggered for treatment s 0 finally for ir 60 only three irrigation events were triggered for treatments s 0 and sc while four irrigation events were triggered for treatment sim however this irrigation event was not completed during the 30 d simulation this factor i e a different number of irrigation events for triggered irrigation scenarios can explain some of the nonlinearities and unexpected results discussed below 3 2 infiltration fig 7 shows cumulative infiltration during one month 30 days expressed in absolute values fig 7 top and as a percentage of potential evapotranspiration fig 7 bottom cumulative potential evapotranspiration etp is equal to 3000 cm2 i e 1 cm d 30 d 100 cm 3000 cm2 cumulative infiltration is displayed for different surface treatments different irrigation rates and irrigations applied at regular intervals or triggered by soil water status in the ridge total infiltration decreases with an increasing irrigation rate when the irrigation rate is low it takes much longer before the switch off depth is reached during which time the water infiltrates into the soil profile see fig 4 when the bottom of the furrow is compacted or impervious the switch off depth is reached much faster and less water is applied this is true for irrigation applied at a regular interval of 5 days or triggered by soil water conditions in the ridge the differences between different furrow surface treatments are much smaller when triggered irrigations are applied since in this case the soil profile controls how many irrigations are applied and at what time see fig 6 fig 7 which shows cumulative infiltration as a fraction of cumulative potential evapotranspiration etp indicates that triggered irrigation keeps the amount of applied water close to 100 etp or even below for the impermeable or compacted bottom of the furrow interestingly there were only small differences between applied irrigation volumes when irrigation was triggered by conditions in the soil and flow through the bottom of the furrow was restricted contrary to standard irrigation when irrigation volumes substantially increased with the decrease of the irrigation rate for normal conditions one would need to use either a lower switch off depth or a longer time interval between irrigations to get closer to 100 etp and to avoid significant leaching losses 3 3 evaporation fig 8 shows cumulative evaporation fluxes from the top of the ridge and the furrow during one month 30 days for different surface treatments different irrigation rates and irrigations applied at regular intervals or triggered by soil water status in the ridge cumulative actual evaporation from the top of the ridge fig 8 top can be compared with cumulative potential evaporation which is equal to 240 cm2 ep 0 2 cm d cum ep 0 2 cm d 40 cm 30 d 240 cm2 note that we set potential evaporation at 0 2 cm d at the top of the ridge because the remaining incoming energy is intercepted by the plant tp 0 8 cm d also note that for triggered irrigations evaporation losses are substantially reduced less than 50 of potential ep compared to irrigations at predetermined intervals in general evaporation losses for triggered irrigation are less than half of those for irrigations at predetermined intervals also note that evaporation losses are more or less independent of the soil surface treatment cumulative evaporation from the furrow bottom and sides fig 8 bottom can be compared with potential evaporation which is approximately equal to 1800 cm2 ep 1 0 cm d cum ep 1 0 cm d 60 cm 30 d 1800 cm2 note that this formula should exclude time about 1 d when the furrow bottom is flooded with water and evaporation does not occur directly from the furrow bottom cumulative potential evaporation for the sim treatment is 900 cm2 ep 1 0 cm d 30 cm 30 d 900 cm2 for the furrow we assume that all incoming energy is converted to potential evaporation ep 1 0 cm d note again that evaporation losses from the furrow are substantially reduced when we used triggered irrigation compared to irrigation at prescribed intervals evaporation losses from the furrow are lowest for the treatment with the impermeable membrane since in this case water can evaporate only from the sides of the furrow 3 4 deep drainage fig 9 shows drainage at the bottom of the soil profile during one month 30 days for different furrow surface treatments and different irrigation rates and irrigations applied at prescribed regular intervals or triggered by the soil water status in the ridge the drainage loss reflects the amount of irrigation water applied in the different treatments the largest drainage loss occurred in the treatment with standard soil surface features and soil hydraulic properties with lower applied rates of irrigation and for irrigations applied at a regular time interval drainage losses are dramatically reduced when the bottom of the furrow is covered with an impermeable membrane and even more so when irrigations are triggered according to the preset soil water status in the ridge it must be emphasized that triggered irrigations especially in the treatment with the impermeable membrane on the base of the furrow can practically eliminate drainage losses 3 5 transpiration the ultimate goal of irrigation is to supply crops with the right amount of water at the right place and at the right time to maximize plant transpiration and hence crop yield fig 10 shows the cumulative actual transpiration as an absolute value cumulative potential transpiration is 960 cm2 tp 0 8 cm d and cum tp 0 8 cm d 40 cm 30 d 960 cm2 during one month 30 days irrespective of different surface treatments different irrigation rates and irrigations applied at a regular interval or triggered by a pre set condition soil water pressure head in the ridge cumulative transpiration is large for all scenarios more than 90 of potential transpiration however cumulative transpiration values are smaller by about 6 for scenarios with triggered irrigation likely because of less irrigation water applied in these scenarios fig 7 since the loss in crop yield is often assumed to be directly correlated with the ratio of cumulative actual and potential transpirations e g klocke et al 2004 payero et al 2006 oster et al 2012 ragab et al 2015 the scenarios with triggered irrigation will thus likely lead to a slight loss of crop yield on average by about 6 scenarios with the impermeable membrane almost always show similar plant transpiration as the other soil surface treatments however this is achieved with much less water fig 11 shows the irrigation water use efficiency wue for the different surface treatments different irrigation rates and irrigations applied at regular intervals or triggered by soil water status in the ridge we define irrigation water use efficiency as the ratio of actual transpiration to the amount of applied irrigation water wue is always substantially higher for treatments with a reduced conductivity at the bottom of the furrow it is also markedly higher for the treatment with an impermeable membrane compared with the compacted soil treatment in general scenarios with triggered irrigations have higher wue than scenarios with irrigation at a regular time interval however this increase in wue for scenarios with triggered irrigation is accompanied by a slight decrease in actual transpiration fig 10 and correspondingly in crop yield relatively low wues even for triggered irrigation which have been shown to almost eliminate downward leaching are due to relatively large evaporation losses from the furrow and an increase in water storage in the soil profile while furrow irrigation efficiencies which can range from about 30 fahong et al 2004 up to about 65 arabiyat et al 1999 are in general much lower than well managed subsurface drip irrigation systems ayars et al 1999 furrow irrigation remains considerably cheaper than drip systems and thus widely used around the world note that in our simulations potential transpiration 0 8 cm d tp 40 cm ridge width 32 cm2 d is only about 30 of the incoming energy 1 0 cm d etp 100 cm surface with 100 cm2 d and wue of 40 is a relatively good outcome for these conditions 3 6 change in water storage the change in water storage in the soil profile fig 12 was similar for all scenarios with prescribed irrigation i e triggered while the initial soil water storage was about 1690 cm2 which reflected the average soil water content of about 0 18 cm3 cm 3 the pseudo steady state i e the same saturation conditions were obtained at the end of each irrigation cycle was reached after 2 irrigation cycles with the average water storage of about 2660 cm2 which reflected the average soil water content of about 0 28 cm3 cm 3 there were only small differences between different furrow surface treatments and different irrigation rates similar results were also obtained for a system with triggered irrigations and an impermeable membrane at the bottom of the furrow larger differences were only observed for systems with triggered irrigation and with original or compacted soil at the bottom of the furrow 3 7 nitrogen leaching plant nitrogen uptake and nitrogen storage while simulations evaluating water balance components were carried out for six different irrigation rates i e 60 70 80 90 and 100 cm2 h 1 applied either at a constant time interval of 5 days or triggered by conditions in the soil simulations evaluating solute balance components were carried out for five different initial solute placements but only one irrigation rate again at either a prescribed regular time interval of 5 days or triggered by the soil water status in the ridge of 90 cm2 d scenarios ir90 and ir90 tr discussed above the same irrigation rate was used as the base case in the study of siyal et al 2012 solute leaching decreased substantially with the decrease in permeability of the bottom of the furrow from untreated to compacted to impermeable fig 13 as expected leaching was largest when the nitrogen fertilizer was applied at the base base and sides and sides of the furrow leaching was minimal when fertilizer was applied at the top of the ridge these numerical results are in agreement with experimental studies of kemper et al 1975 hamlett et al 1990 clay et al 1992 mailhol et al 2001 and waddell and weil 2006 who all reported that placing fertilizer near the top of the ridge has a beneficial impact on both yield its increase and nitrogen leaching its decrease leaching also substantially decreased when irrigations were triggered by the soil water status in the ridge rather than prescribed at a regular time interval fig 14 shows plant nitrogen uptake as a function of the initial placement of fertilizer surface treatment and irrigation applied at regular intervals and triggered by the soil water status in the ridge the irrigation rate is 90 cm2 h 1 the initial location of the fertilizer exerts a major control on plant nitrogen uptake there is substantial nitrogen uptake when the fertilizer is placed at the top of the ridge either in the center about 90 of fertilizer is taken up by roots or on the sides about 80 of the ridge there is less uptake of nitrogen about 60 when the fertilizer is placed at the sides of the furrow much lower uptake 10 30 occurs when the fertilizer is placed at the bottom of the furrow as most of it is leached fig 13 when the fertilizer is initially placed at the bottom of the furrow it is mostly out of reach of plants and is mainly leached there are only relatively small differences in plant nitrogen uptake as a function of the soil surface treatment at the bottom of the furrow and when irrigations are triggered or applied at a regular time interval fig 15 shows the final solute storage in the soil profile as a function of the initial placement of fertilizer surface treatment and for irrigations applied at regular intervals and triggered with the irrigation rate of 90 cm2 h 1 the final fertilizer storage in the soil profile is more or less inversely proportional to the fertilizer leaching although the plant nitrogen uptake fig 14 was more or less independent of the surface treatment of the soil at the bottom of the furrow or whether irrigations were triggered or applied at a regular time interval more fertilizer remained in the soil profile with the decrease in permeability of the bottom of the furrow and would potentially be available for future uptake rather than leached especially when the fertilizer was initially placed at or close to the bottom of the furrow smaller differences in solute storage were recorded between different surface treatments when the fertilizer was initially placed at the top of the ridge 4 conclusions in this study we extended the original analysis of siyal et al 2012 by including multiple irrigation cycles improved irrigation scheduling based on the soil water status and root water and nutrient uptake to obtain a more realistic and complete picture of the overall water and nitrogen balance in furrow irrigated systems our simulations have shown that drainage from the root zone can be substantially reduced by modifying the soil surface properties of the bottom of the furrow when the bottom of the furrow was compacted drainage was reduced by almost half a further large reduction in drainage could be achieved by using an impermeable membrane on the base of the furrow an additional and substantial decrease in drainage can be achieved using triggered irrigation based on a pre set soil water status in the ridge using triggered irrigation can additionally also substantially reduce water losses through soil evaporation from both the top of the ridge and the sides and bottom of the furrow by about 50 or more this reduction in water loss by drainage and soil evaporation is accompanied by a relatively small decrease in transpiration from about 98 to about 92 compared with irrigation applied at a prescribed time interval the reduction in transpiration and water loss associated with triggered irrigation is accompanied by a substantial increase in irrigation water use efficiency overall our simulations indicate that significant savings of irrigation water and reduction in deep percolation and leaching can be achieved by modifying the soil surface properties of the bottom of the furrow solute leaching is driven by deep drainage from the crop root zone substantial amounts of nitrogen are leached when the fertilizer is initially placed at the bottom of the furrow but can be greatly reduced by modifying the soil surface properties of the bottom of the furrow when fertilizer is applied to the sides of the furrow or at the top of the ridge nitrogen leaching is essentially eliminated with about 60 80 of the nitrogen being taken up by the plant there are negligible differences in nitrogen uptake between the different soil surface treatments differences in root nitrogen uptake are mainly determined by the initial placement of the fertilizer the hydrus 2d 3d model coupled with the furrow module proved to be a powerful tool for analyzing water flow and solute transport processes in the crop root zone in furrow irrigation and in evaluating various factors affecting this system including irrigation rates soil hydraulic properties at the base of the furrow and root water and nitrogen uptake it must however be emphasized that this model considers processes only in two dimensions perpendicular to the actual furrow it cannot account for flow in the third dimension such as the advance or recession of irrigation water in the furrow nor can it account for the actual mixing of nitrogen with water in the furrow the development of a pseudo three dimensional model that accounts for water flow down the furrow and all subsurface soil processes discussed above is currently under development brunetti et al 2018 liu et al 2019 it should further be emphasized that the presented simulations were carried out for a single hypothetical soil plant fertilizer and weather scenario since several governing equations describing this system e g the richards equation or plant stress response functions are nonlinear obtained results cannot be directly transferred to other systems with different soils plants fertilizers and weather scenarios the

10686,the hydrus model can be used to evaluate the effects of different soil surface treatments at the bottom of the furrow different initial nitrogen fertilizer locations and different furrow irrigation rates on deep drainage and solute leaching in furrow irrigated systems this paper extends our 2012 study in which we considered only one irrigation cycle and ignored the effects of plants as a result of considering only one irrigation cycle a large amount of water was used to change the water storage in the transport domain and only limited deep drainage of water and leaching of fertilizer at the bottom of the domain occurred in most scenarios investigated to obtain a more realistic and complete picture we have in this study considered multiple irrigation cycles to reflect actual field practices better and accounted for root water and nitrogen uptake and plant transpiration as in our previous study soil surface treatments at the bottom of the furrow include untreated compacted and an impermeable membrane and fertilizer is initially placed at one of five different locations in the furrow or the ridge we have also evaluated 1 the effectiveness of triggering irrigation based on a pre set soil water pressure head at a specific location in the ridge compared with prescribed irrigation at a regular time interval to supply water and nitrogen and 2 the effects of plant water and nitrogen uptake on the furrow water balance infiltration soil evaporation deep drainage transpiration and nitrogen leaching our simulations show that deep drainage and nitrogen leaching can be substantially reduced by using an impermeable membrane on the bottom of the furrow and that a substantial additional reduction in leaching can be achieved by triggering irrigation rather than using a fixed time schedule we also show that the initial location of fertilizer has a substantial effect on nitrogen uptake and leaching keywords furrow irrigation triggered irrigation transpiration deep drainage solute transport nitrogen leaching soil evaporation hydrus 1 introduction about 90 of irrigated crops across the world are irrigated using surface irrigation including basin border or furrow irrigation methods tiercelin and vidal 2006 furrow irrigation is the most commonly used method due to its simplicity of design and low capital costs walker and skogerboe 1987 however unlike micro irrigation methods such as surface and subsurface drip irrigation furrow irrigation is much less effective in delivering the required amounts of water and nitrogen directly to the plant roots this results in large quantities of water and nitrogen being lost below the crop root zone consequently areas with furrow irrigation are often a major source of nitrate resulting in pollution of groundwater systems e g artiola 1991 pratt and jury 1984 improved management strategies that increase irrigation efficiency and reduce nitrogen losses by leaching to groundwater are therefore urgently needed for furrow irrigated crops bar yosef 1999 simulation models such as hydrus 2d 3d and its predecessors swms 2d chain 2d and hydrus 2d šimůnek et al 2008 2016b have been widely used to improve the design management and performance of various irrigation systems including surface and subsurface drip irrigation and furrow irrigation šimůnek et al 2016b identified more than 25 papers that used the above models to evaluate the effect of various factors on furrow irrigation systems and here we include a subset of the 25 references most relevant to this paper benjamin et al 1994 abbasi et al 2003a abbasi et al 2003b abbasi et al 2003c 2004 rocha et al 2006 wöhling et al 2004a b 2006 mailhol et al 2007 warrick et al 2007 wöhling and schmitz 2007 wöhling and mailhol 2007 crevoisier et al 2008 lazarovitch et al 2009 siyal et al 2012 soroush et al 2012 ebrahimian et al 2012 2013a b zerihun et al 2014 these models which simulate water flow and or solute transport in soils proved to be flexible and cost effective tools for analyzing and evaluating various management irrigation scenarios one of these studies was the study of siyal et al 2012 who evaluated the effects of different soil surface treatments at the bottom of the furrow different initial nitrogen fertilizer locations and different furrow irrigation rates on deep drainage and solute leaching in a furrow irrigated system siyal et al 2012 assumed that the soil at the bottom of the furrow was either a untreated it retained its normal surface features and soil hydraulic properties b compacted the soil hydraulic conductivity of the surface soil was reduced by 80 or c covered with an impermeable membrane so that the bottom of the furrow was impermeable to water flow siyal et al 2012 also assumed that the nitrogen fertilizer was initially located at one of 5 different locations ranging from the bottom of the furrow to the top of the ridge the strength of the siyal et al 2012 study was that it enabled evaluation of the worst case scenario in terms of deep drainage and nitrogen leaching in the absence of plants the main limitation of the siyal et al 2012 study was that it used only one irrigation cycle and the effects of plants were neglected their results showed that deep drainage and nitrogen leaching were significantly affected by the initial soil moisture conditions since a large amount of water was used to change the soil water storage in the root zone transport domain and only limited leaching occurred in most scenarios to obtain a more realistic and complete picture one must consider multiple irrigation cycles to reflect actual field practices better and account for plant water and nitrogen uptake which affect deep drainage and nitrogen leaching the reason for applying irrigation and fertilizer is to supply plants with water and nitrogen and a full analysis should consider how much of the applied water and fertilizer can be taken up by the plants the furrow irrigation model of siyal et al 2012 was further extended by šimůnek et al 2016a to consider a processes of precipitation and evaporation as a source loss of water from the furrow and b different timings of fertigation with irrigation water šimůnek et al 2016a then used this extended furrow irrigation model to evaluate the effects of different soil surface treatments at the bottom of the furrow and different timings of fertigation on root water and solute uptake deep drainage and solute leaching in a loamy soil to overcome the limitations of the study of siyal et al 2012 in this manuscript we expand their analysis by considering a multiple irrigation cycles during one month and b the effects plants have on deep drainage and leaching by accounting for root water and solute uptake this allows us to analyze how much of the applied water and nitrogen can be taken up by the plant roots rather than be leached from the crop root zone we also consider an irrigation strategy where irrigation is triggered when a critical soil water pressure head is reached at a specified location in the root zone dabach et al 2013 rather than being provided at regular time intervals the objectives of this study are i to evaluate the effectiveness of different furrow management strategies to improve supply of water to plants and to reduce water losses due to evaporation and deep drainage ii to evaluate the effects of different initial fertilizer locations on the supply of nitrogen to plants and leaching from the crop root zone iii to evaluate the effectiveness of triggered irrigations compared with prescribed irrigations to supply water and nitrogen to plants and limit leaching from the soil profile and iv to assess the combined effects of plant water and nitrogen uptake with different furrow management strategies and different irrigation strategies to minimize deep drainage and nitrogen leaching 2 material and methods 2 1 governing equations for water flow and solute transport the hydrus 2d 3d software package šimůnek et al 2008 was used to carry out computer simulations hydrus uses numerical solutions of the richards and convection dispersion equations for variably saturated water flow and solute transport in soils respectively 1 θ t x i k k i j a h x j k i z a s 2 θ c t x i θ d i j c x j q i c x i s c r in eq 1 θ is the volumetric water content l3l 3 h is the pressure head l s is a sink term accounting for plant water uptake t 1 xi i 1 2 are the spatial coordinates l t is time t kij a are components of a dimensionless anisotropy tensor k a and k is the unsaturated hydraulic conductivity function lt 1 given by the product of the relative hydraulic conductivity kr and the saturated hydraulic conductivity ks lt 1 in eq 2 c is the solute concentration ml 3 qi is the i th component of the volumetric flux density lt 1 dij is the dispersion coefficient tensor l2t 1 and cr is the concentration of the sink term ml 3 note that although hydrus 2d 3d solves a more general solute transport equation than eq 2 only terms considered in this study are given here numerical solution of the richards equation eq 1 requires as input the soil hydraulic parameters describing the soil water retention curve and the hydraulic conductivity function in this study we use the analytical model of van genuchten 1980 to describe these two functions the soil hydraulic parameters for a loamy soil were taken from the soil catalog provided by the hydrus software and are the same as those used by siyal et al 2012 and šimůnek et al 2016a the values of these parameters are the residual water content 0 078 the saturated water content 0 43 the shape parameters α and n are 0 036 cm 1 and 1 56 respectively and the saturated hydraulic conductivity 24 96 cm day 2 2 flow domain initial and boundary conditions the same flow domain and initial and boundary conditions as in siyal et al 2012 were used in this study fig 1 the transport domain was 100 cm wide and 100 cm high the ridge was 40 cm wide the furrow was 15 cm deep and 30 cm wide and the side of the furrow had a slope of 45 the initial pressure head varied linearly between 200 cm at the bottom of the domain and 300 cm at the top of the ridge boundary conditions imposed on the flow domain included an atmospheric boundary condition at the top of the ridge a free drainage boundary condition at the bottom of the soil profile a no flow boundary condition at both vertical sides and special boundary conditions were applied at the base of the furrow see section 2 4 below to reflect the different surface conditions being investigated 2 3 the furrow irrigation submodule the furrow irrigation submodule as developed in appendix a of siyal et al 2012 and extended by šimůnek et al 2016a was used to simulate furrow irrigation and dynamic position of the water level in the furrow during irrigation šimůnek et al 2016a extended the model of siyal et al 2012 by adding the atmospheric boundary condition at the water surface in the furrow and thus allowing evaporation from and precipitation to the water surface in this submodule the water level in the furrow is calculated from the water balance accounting for the applied irrigation infiltration and the change in water volume in the furrow when water is present in the furrow the time variable pressure head boundary condition is applied to the furrow boundary that is below the surface water level reflecting the dynamic nature of the water level in the furrow an atmospheric boundary condition is applied in the furrow when it is empty of water and above the water level in a furrow when it is not an atmospheric boundary condition considers precipitation p 0 and potential evapotranspiration etp ep tp 1 0 cm d fluxes potential evapotranspiration etp equal to 1 cm day corresponds to conditions in january in north queensland australia note that we assume that plant leaves cover only the ridge and that the leaf area index is about 3 5 which corresponds to a surface cover fraction of about 80 at the top of the ridge we assume that a fraction 80 of incoming energy etp ep tp 1 0 cm d is intercepted by plants potential transpiration tp 0 8 cm d and the remaining fraction 20 by the soil surface potential evaporation ep 0 2 cm d all incoming energy in the furrow reaches either the water level in the furrow during irrigation or the bottom of the furrow between irrigations ep etp 1 0 cm d 2 4 soil surface management and fertilizer placement strategies the same soil surface management and fertilizer placement strategies as in siyal et al 2012 were considered in this study see fig 2 it was assumed that the soil at the bottom of the furrow was either a untreated it retained its usual surface features and soil hydraulic properties s 0 b compacted its hydraulic conductivity was reduced by 80 while the retention parameters were considered to remain the same sc or c covered with an impermeable membrane so that the bottom of the furrow was impermeable sim nitrogen fertilizer was mixed into the top 1 3 cm of the soil a at the bottom and center of the furrow p 1 b on the sides of the furrow p 2 c on the bottom and sides of the furrow p 3 d on the furrow sides near the ridge top p 4 and e on the top and center of the ridge p 5 fig 2 while the hydrus model allows one to consider the fate and transport of multiple solutes of various properties subject to first order degradation chain reactions such as the nitrification chain from urea to ammonium and nitrite and nitrate e g hanson et al 2006 ramos et al 2012 li et al 2015 only one nonreactive solute species and dimensionless concentrations were used in our simulations the initial concentration of this nonreactive solute which could be considered as a surrogate for nitrate readily available for transport and plant uptake in the initial placement area was adjusted so that the initial solute mass in the soil profile was equal to 1 100 this enabled us quick evaluation of the fractions of nitrogen fertilizer that were used by plants leached from the soil root zone and remained in the soil profile 2 5 irrigation strategies water application rates of 1200 1400 1600 1800 and 2000 l h 1 furrow 1 for a 100 m long furrow corresponding to area based application rates of 12 14 16 18 and 20 mm h 1 or to rates of 60 70 80 90 and 100 cm2 h 1 in our two dimensional domain respectively were compared in this study the switch off depth which determines when the supply of irrigation water is stopped was set at 10 cm siyal et al 2012 irrigation was applied every five days for 30 days a second irrigation strategy where irrigation was triggered dabach et al 2013 2015 when the soil water pressure head in the middle of the ridge and 15 cm below the top of the ridge reached a pre set value of 500 cm was also included for comparative purposes an optimal location of the triggering point and an optimal triggering pressure head for different plants and soil types is a topic of ongoing research dabach et al 2013 2015 note that this triggering point is located in the middle of the root zone with the highest root density see fig 3 below according to the stress response function described in the next section irrigation is triggered when root water uptake is reduced by about 4 2 6 root water and nitrogen uptake the approach of feddes et al 1978 was used to describe plant water uptake 3 s h α h b x z l t t p where s is defined as the volume of water removed per unit time from a unit volume of soil due to root water uptake t 1 α h is a prescribed dimensionless water stress response function of the soil water pressure head 0 α 1 b x z is the normalized water uptake distribution function l 2 lt is the width l of the soil surface associated with the transpiration process lt 40 cm surface of the furrow ridge see the definition of the transport domain below and tp is the potential transpiration rate lt 1 tp 0 8 cm d water uptake is assumed to be zero close to saturation above h 1 and when the soil is dry for h h 4 the wilting point pressure head water uptake is considered optimal between pressure heads h 2 and h 3 whereas for pressure heads between h 3 and h 4 or h 1 and h 2 water uptake decreases or increases linearly with h feddes et al 1978 the following parameters of the stress response function typical for many crops were used in our study h 1 10 cm h 2 25 cm h 3 200 cm and h 4 8000 cm the spatial distribution of roots of a hypothetical plant is described using the two dimensional root distribution function b x z of vrugt et al 2001 2002 4 b x z 1 z z m 1 x x m e p z z m z z p x x m x x where xm and zm are the maximum rooting lengths in the x and z directions l respectively x and z are distances from the origin of the plant in the x and z directions l respectively and px pz x l and z l are empirical parameters the plant was assumed to be centered in the middle of the ridge the extent of roots in the vertical zm and horizontal xm direction was 60 and 35 cm respectively parameters x and z sometimes referred to as depth and radius of maximum intensity were 30 and 20 cm respectively and parameters px and pz were set at one 1 these parameters produced the root distribution function presented in fig 3 only passive root nitrogen uptake was considered šimůnek and hopmans 2009 i e cr in eq 2 was assumed to be equal to the nitrogen concentration at any particular location no compensation mechanisms that would increase root uptake in one part unstressed of the root zone in response to reduced uptake in another part stressed of the root zone were considered in our study in the simulations carried out in this study it is assumed that the parameters required to simulate root water and nitrogen uptake i e the spatial root distribution the water stress response function and potential transpiration are constant in time potential root water uptake and its spatial distribution are thus static the actual root water and nitrogen uptake and their spatial distributions are however dynamic as a result of temporal and spatial variable distributions of water content and nitrogen concentration in response to individual irrigation events actual transpiration and nitrogen uptake will therefore differ between different scenarios 3 results and discussion the results section is organized as follows the first section 3 1 deals with water balance in the furrow the difference between constant incoming irrigation during irrigation events and time variable infiltration produces time variable water levels in the furrow which are discussed in this section water fluxes associated with the subsurface are described next in section 3 2 we discuss infiltration which is an input into the soil profile water losses in terms of evaporation and deep drainage are discussed in sections 3 3 and 3 4 respectively next in section 3 5 we discuss the productive use of water i e transpiration root water uptake and irrigation water use efficiency defined here as a ratio of transpiration irrigation the change in water storage in the subsurface a component that closes the subsurface water balance is discussed in section 3 6 finally components of the nitrogen balance including nitrogen leaching plant nitrogen uptake and nitrogen storage in the crop root zone are discussed in the last section 3 7 3 1 furrow water balance the total amount of irrigation water applied during one irrigation cycle depends on several factors including soil surface management which affects the infiltration rate and the applied irrigation rate fig 4 shows water levels in the furrow for the three different soil surface conditions i e s 0 sc and sim for 5 different irrigation rates fig 5 shows cumulative irrigation and infiltration fluxes for the first scenario s 0 and different fluxes similar graphs could be produced for the other two soil surface conditions fig 4 shows that the switch off depth is reached fastest for the sim treatment with an impermeable bottom and slowest for the s 0 treatment with the standard untreated bottom it also shows that the switch off depth is reached faster for larger irrigation rates figs 4 and 5 indicate that most water is applied in each treatment when the lowest irrigation rate is used this is because when water is applied at a lower rate it is applied during a longer time period since infiltration rates are relatively similar fig 5 right the lowest irrigation rate produces the slowest increase in the water level in the furrow reaching the switch off depth much slower than the higher irrigation rates consequently irrigation water for smaller irrigation rates is applied longer resulting in more water being applied fig 5 left fig 6 shows water levels in the furrow for the three soil surface treatments i e s 0 sc and sim for five different irrigation rates when irrigations are triggered by the soil water status in the root zone this figure shows that irrigations are triggered less often for lower irrigation rates which as explained above provide larger amounts of applied water since larger amounts of water are applied when lower irrigation rates are used it takes longer for this water to be used by plants soil evaporation and deep drainage this figure also shows that irrigations are triggered later for treatment s 0 than for treatments sc and sim this is again because more water is applied to treatment s 0 in each irrigation cycle it should also be emphasized that four irrigation events were triggered for ir 80 ir 90 and ir 100 for all surface treatments on the other hand for ir 70 four irrigation events were triggered only for treatments sc and sim while only 3 irrigation events were triggered for treatment s 0 finally for ir 60 only three irrigation events were triggered for treatments s 0 and sc while four irrigation events were triggered for treatment sim however this irrigation event was not completed during the 30 d simulation this factor i e a different number of irrigation events for triggered irrigation scenarios can explain some of the nonlinearities and unexpected results discussed below 3 2 infiltration fig 7 shows cumulative infiltration during one month 30 days expressed in absolute values fig 7 top and as a percentage of potential evapotranspiration fig 7 bottom cumulative potential evapotranspiration etp is equal to 3000 cm2 i e 1 cm d 30 d 100 cm 3000 cm2 cumulative infiltration is displayed for different surface treatments different irrigation rates and irrigations applied at regular intervals or triggered by soil water status in the ridge total infiltration decreases with an increasing irrigation rate when the irrigation rate is low it takes much longer before the switch off depth is reached during which time the water infiltrates into the soil profile see fig 4 when the bottom of the furrow is compacted or impervious the switch off depth is reached much faster and less water is applied this is true for irrigation applied at a regular interval of 5 days or triggered by soil water conditions in the ridge the differences between different furrow surface treatments are much smaller when triggered irrigations are applied since in this case the soil profile controls how many irrigations are applied and at what time see fig 6 fig 7 which shows cumulative infiltration as a fraction of cumulative potential evapotranspiration etp indicates that triggered irrigation keeps the amount of applied water close to 100 etp or even below for the impermeable or compacted bottom of the furrow interestingly there were only small differences between applied irrigation volumes when irrigation was triggered by conditions in the soil and flow through the bottom of the furrow was restricted contrary to standard irrigation when irrigation volumes substantially increased with the decrease of the irrigation rate for normal conditions one would need to use either a lower switch off depth or a longer time interval between irrigations to get closer to 100 etp and to avoid significant leaching losses 3 3 evaporation fig 8 shows cumulative evaporation fluxes from the top of the ridge and the furrow during one month 30 days for different surface treatments different irrigation rates and irrigations applied at regular intervals or triggered by soil water status in the ridge cumulative actual evaporation from the top of the ridge fig 8 top can be compared with cumulative potential evaporation which is equal to 240 cm2 ep 0 2 cm d cum ep 0 2 cm d 40 cm 30 d 240 cm2 note that we set potential evaporation at 0 2 cm d at the top of the ridge because the remaining incoming energy is intercepted by the plant tp 0 8 cm d also note that for triggered irrigations evaporation losses are substantially reduced less than 50 of potential ep compared to irrigations at predetermined intervals in general evaporation losses for triggered irrigation are less than half of those for irrigations at predetermined intervals also note that evaporation losses are more or less independent of the soil surface treatment cumulative evaporation from the furrow bottom and sides fig 8 bottom can be compared with potential evaporation which is approximately equal to 1800 cm2 ep 1 0 cm d cum ep 1 0 cm d 60 cm 30 d 1800 cm2 note that this formula should exclude time about 1 d when the furrow bottom is flooded with water and evaporation does not occur directly from the furrow bottom cumulative potential evaporation for the sim treatment is 900 cm2 ep 1 0 cm d 30 cm 30 d 900 cm2 for the furrow we assume that all incoming energy is converted to potential evaporation ep 1 0 cm d note again that evaporation losses from the furrow are substantially reduced when we used triggered irrigation compared to irrigation at prescribed intervals evaporation losses from the furrow are lowest for the treatment with the impermeable membrane since in this case water can evaporate only from the sides of the furrow 3 4 deep drainage fig 9 shows drainage at the bottom of the soil profile during one month 30 days for different furrow surface treatments and different irrigation rates and irrigations applied at prescribed regular intervals or triggered by the soil water status in the ridge the drainage loss reflects the amount of irrigation water applied in the different treatments the largest drainage loss occurred in the treatment with standard soil surface features and soil hydraulic properties with lower applied rates of irrigation and for irrigations applied at a regular time interval drainage losses are dramatically reduced when the bottom of the furrow is covered with an impermeable membrane and even more so when irrigations are triggered according to the preset soil water status in the ridge it must be emphasized that triggered irrigations especially in the treatment with the impermeable membrane on the base of the furrow can practically eliminate drainage losses 3 5 transpiration the ultimate goal of irrigation is to supply crops with the right amount of water at the right place and at the right time to maximize plant transpiration and hence crop yield fig 10 shows the cumulative actual transpiration as an absolute value cumulative potential transpiration is 960 cm2 tp 0 8 cm d and cum tp 0 8 cm d 40 cm 30 d 960 cm2 during one month 30 days irrespective of different surface treatments different irrigation rates and irrigations applied at a regular interval or triggered by a pre set condition soil water pressure head in the ridge cumulative transpiration is large for all scenarios more than 90 of potential transpiration however cumulative transpiration values are smaller by about 6 for scenarios with triggered irrigation likely because of less irrigation water applied in these scenarios fig 7 since the loss in crop yield is often assumed to be directly correlated with the ratio of cumulative actual and potential transpirations e g klocke et al 2004 payero et al 2006 oster et al 2012 ragab et al 2015 the scenarios with triggered irrigation will thus likely lead to a slight loss of crop yield on average by about 6 scenarios with the impermeable membrane almost always show similar plant transpiration as the other soil surface treatments however this is achieved with much less water fig 11 shows the irrigation water use efficiency wue for the different surface treatments different irrigation rates and irrigations applied at regular intervals or triggered by soil water status in the ridge we define irrigation water use efficiency as the ratio of actual transpiration to the amount of applied irrigation water wue is always substantially higher for treatments with a reduced conductivity at the bottom of the furrow it is also markedly higher for the treatment with an impermeable membrane compared with the compacted soil treatment in general scenarios with triggered irrigations have higher wue than scenarios with irrigation at a regular time interval however this increase in wue for scenarios with triggered irrigation is accompanied by a slight decrease in actual transpiration fig 10 and correspondingly in crop yield relatively low wues even for triggered irrigation which have been shown to almost eliminate downward leaching are due to relatively large evaporation losses from the furrow and an increase in water storage in the soil profile while furrow irrigation efficiencies which can range from about 30 fahong et al 2004 up to about 65 arabiyat et al 1999 are in general much lower than well managed subsurface drip irrigation systems ayars et al 1999 furrow irrigation remains considerably cheaper than drip systems and thus widely used around the world note that in our simulations potential transpiration 0 8 cm d tp 40 cm ridge width 32 cm2 d is only about 30 of the incoming energy 1 0 cm d etp 100 cm surface with 100 cm2 d and wue of 40 is a relatively good outcome for these conditions 3 6 change in water storage the change in water storage in the soil profile fig 12 was similar for all scenarios with prescribed irrigation i e triggered while the initial soil water storage was about 1690 cm2 which reflected the average soil water content of about 0 18 cm3 cm 3 the pseudo steady state i e the same saturation conditions were obtained at the end of each irrigation cycle was reached after 2 irrigation cycles with the average water storage of about 2660 cm2 which reflected the average soil water content of about 0 28 cm3 cm 3 there were only small differences between different furrow surface treatments and different irrigation rates similar results were also obtained for a system with triggered irrigations and an impermeable membrane at the bottom of the furrow larger differences were only observed for systems with triggered irrigation and with original or compacted soil at the bottom of the furrow 3 7 nitrogen leaching plant nitrogen uptake and nitrogen storage while simulations evaluating water balance components were carried out for six different irrigation rates i e 60 70 80 90 and 100 cm2 h 1 applied either at a constant time interval of 5 days or triggered by conditions in the soil simulations evaluating solute balance components were carried out for five different initial solute placements but only one irrigation rate again at either a prescribed regular time interval of 5 days or triggered by the soil water status in the ridge of 90 cm2 d scenarios ir90 and ir90 tr discussed above the same irrigation rate was used as the base case in the study of siyal et al 2012 solute leaching decreased substantially with the decrease in permeability of the bottom of the furrow from untreated to compacted to impermeable fig 13 as expected leaching was largest when the nitrogen fertilizer was applied at the base base and sides and sides of the furrow leaching was minimal when fertilizer was applied at the top of the ridge these numerical results are in agreement with experimental studies of kemper et al 1975 hamlett et al 1990 clay et al 1992 mailhol et al 2001 and waddell and weil 2006 who all reported that placing fertilizer near the top of the ridge has a beneficial impact on both yield its increase and nitrogen leaching its decrease leaching also substantially decreased when irrigations were triggered by the soil water status in the ridge rather than prescribed at a regular time interval fig 14 shows plant nitrogen uptake as a function of the initial placement of fertilizer surface treatment and irrigation applied at regular intervals and triggered by the soil water status in the ridge the irrigation rate is 90 cm2 h 1 the initial location of the fertilizer exerts a major control on plant nitrogen uptake there is substantial nitrogen uptake when the fertilizer is placed at the top of the ridge either in the center about 90 of fertilizer is taken up by roots or on the sides about 80 of the ridge there is less uptake of nitrogen about 60 when the fertilizer is placed at the sides of the furrow much lower uptake 10 30 occurs when the fertilizer is placed at the bottom of the furrow as most of it is leached fig 13 when the fertilizer is initially placed at the bottom of the furrow it is mostly out of reach of plants and is mainly leached there are only relatively small differences in plant nitrogen uptake as a function of the soil surface treatment at the bottom of the furrow and when irrigations are triggered or applied at a regular time interval fig 15 shows the final solute storage in the soil profile as a function of the initial placement of fertilizer surface treatment and for irrigations applied at regular intervals and triggered with the irrigation rate of 90 cm2 h 1 the final fertilizer storage in the soil profile is more or less inversely proportional to the fertilizer leaching although the plant nitrogen uptake fig 14 was more or less independent of the surface treatment of the soil at the bottom of the furrow or whether irrigations were triggered or applied at a regular time interval more fertilizer remained in the soil profile with the decrease in permeability of the bottom of the furrow and would potentially be available for future uptake rather than leached especially when the fertilizer was initially placed at or close to the bottom of the furrow smaller differences in solute storage were recorded between different surface treatments when the fertilizer was initially placed at the top of the ridge 4 conclusions in this study we extended the original analysis of siyal et al 2012 by including multiple irrigation cycles improved irrigation scheduling based on the soil water status and root water and nutrient uptake to obtain a more realistic and complete picture of the overall water and nitrogen balance in furrow irrigated systems our simulations have shown that drainage from the root zone can be substantially reduced by modifying the soil surface properties of the bottom of the furrow when the bottom of the furrow was compacted drainage was reduced by almost half a further large reduction in drainage could be achieved by using an impermeable membrane on the base of the furrow an additional and substantial decrease in drainage can be achieved using triggered irrigation based on a pre set soil water status in the ridge using triggered irrigation can additionally also substantially reduce water losses through soil evaporation from both the top of the ridge and the sides and bottom of the furrow by about 50 or more this reduction in water loss by drainage and soil evaporation is accompanied by a relatively small decrease in transpiration from about 98 to about 92 compared with irrigation applied at a prescribed time interval the reduction in transpiration and water loss associated with triggered irrigation is accompanied by a substantial increase in irrigation water use efficiency overall our simulations indicate that significant savings of irrigation water and reduction in deep percolation and leaching can be achieved by modifying the soil surface properties of the bottom of the furrow solute leaching is driven by deep drainage from the crop root zone substantial amounts of nitrogen are leached when the fertilizer is initially placed at the bottom of the furrow but can be greatly reduced by modifying the soil surface properties of the bottom of the furrow when fertilizer is applied to the sides of the furrow or at the top of the ridge nitrogen leaching is essentially eliminated with about 60 80 of the nitrogen being taken up by the plant there are negligible differences in nitrogen uptake between the different soil surface treatments differences in root nitrogen uptake are mainly determined by the initial placement of the fertilizer the hydrus 2d 3d model coupled with the furrow module proved to be a powerful tool for analyzing water flow and solute transport processes in the crop root zone in furrow irrigation and in evaluating various factors affecting this system including irrigation rates soil hydraulic properties at the base of the furrow and root water and nitrogen uptake it must however be emphasized that this model considers processes only in two dimensions perpendicular to the actual furrow it cannot account for flow in the third dimension such as the advance or recession of irrigation water in the furrow nor can it account for the actual mixing of nitrogen with water in the furrow the development of a pseudo three dimensional model that accounts for water flow down the furrow and all subsurface soil processes discussed above is currently under development brunetti et al 2018 liu et al 2019 it should further be emphasized that the presented simulations were carried out for a single hypothetical soil plant fertilizer and weather scenario since several governing equations describing this system e g the richards equation or plant stress response functions are nonlinear obtained results cannot be directly transferred to other systems with different soils plants fertilizers and weather scenarios the simulation results discussed in this manuscript only present expected trends that would have to be confirmed by similar numerical simulations for these different conditions declaration of competing

10687,effective and efficient methods are needed to map agricultural subsurface drainage systems visible color vis c multispectral ms and thermal infrared tir imagery obtained by unmanned aerial vehicles uavs may provide a means for determining drainage pipe locations aerial surveys using a uav with vis c ms and tir cameras were conducted at 29 agricultural field sites in the midwest u s a to evaluate the potential of this technology for mapping buried drainage pipes overall results show vis c imagery detected at least some drain lines at 48 of the sites 14 out of 29 ms imagery detected drain lines at 59 of the sites 17 out of 29 and tir imagery detected drain lines at 69 of the sites 20 out of 29 three key findings listed as follows and emphasized in this article by site examples were extracted from the overall results 1 although tir generally worked best there were sites where either vis c or ms proved more effective than tir for mapping subsurface drainage systems consequently to ensure the greatest chance for successfully determining drainage pipe patterns in a field uav surveys need to be carried out with all three types of cameras vis c ms and tir 2 timing of uav surveys relative to recent rainfall can sometimes have an important impact on drainage pipe detection results 3 linear features representing drain lines and farm field operations can be confused with one another and are often both depicted on site aerial imagery knowledge of subsurface drainage system installation and farm field operations can be employed to distinguish linear features representing drain lines from those representing farm field operations the overall results and extracted key findings from this study clearly indicate that vis c ms and tir imagery obtained with uavs have significant potential for use in mapping agricultural drainage pipe systems keywords agricultural drainage pipes unmanned aerial vehicles uavs visible color vis c imagery multispectral ms imagery thermal infrared tir imagery 1 introduction 1 1 research rationale the widespread adoption of subsurface drainage practices to remove excess soil water has enabled the midwest u s a to become one of the most productive agricultural regions in the world a 1985 economic survey showed that several states within the midwest u s a illinois indiana iowa ohio minnesota michigan missouri and wisconsin had by that year approximately 12 5 million ha that contained subsurface drainage systems with cropland accounting for the vast majority of areas having these buried drainage pipe networks pavelis 1987 since 1985 a substantial amount of additional agricultural drainage pipe has been installed farmers within this region often need to repair drain lines that are not functioning correctly or install new drain lines between the old ones to improve soil water removal efficiency whether for system repairs or efficiency improvements locations of the preexisting drain lines are required however in most cases a map of the original subsurface drainage system installation is no longer available furthermore subsurface drainage practices can release substantial amounts of nitrate no3 and phosphate po4 3 from farm fields into adjacent waterways sims et al 1998 zucker and brown 1998 which in turn degrades surface water bodies on local regional and national scales risk assessment of this environmental hazard from the farm field perspective calls for some knowledge of the installed drainage pipe network including the extent of coverage and spacing distance between drain lines finding drain lines with heavy trenching equipment causes pipe damage requiring costly repairs while the alternative of using a hand held tile probe is both time consuming and extremely tedious subsurface drainage system patterns can be complex fig 1 further hampering efforts to map drain lines using traditional trenching or tile probe detection methods consequently there is a crucial necessity for effective efficient and nondestructive drainage pipe mapping methods visible vis multispectral ms and thermal infrared tir imagery obtained with unmanned aerial vehicles uavs may provide a solution 1 2 prior research into better methods for mapping subsurface drainage ground penetrating radar gpr has proven capable in many instances of locating buried drainage pipe under a range of soil conditions allred et al 2004 2005 allred and redman 2010 allred 2013 allred et al 2018a chow and rees 1989 but gpr is somewhat inefficient for providing detailed maps of subsurface drainage systems in large farm fields both visible vis i e wavelengths within the 400 nm 700 nm visible light portion of electromagnetic spectrum and color infrared comprised of green red and near infrared wavelengths photography from manned aircraft obtained outside the growing season have been tested to a limited extent for mapping subsurface drainage systems naz et al 2009 verma et al 1996 however scheduling an airplane to collect data when field conditions are optimal i e several days after a rainfall event equal or greater than 2 5 or 5 0 cm as suggested by these previous studies can be problematic alternatively scheduling an aerial survey with an uav is far more flexible and could solve this timing issue but uavs have not yet been extensively tested for drainage pipe mapping furthermore although some aerial vis and color infrared cir drainage pipe detection studies have been conducted there has been very little research on the use of tir imagery to map drainage pipes abdel hadi et al 1970 provides several excellent examples in which tir imagery detected subsurface features such as pipelines and buried stream channels thereby indicating that tir aerial surveys may have capability for drainage pipe mapping a laboratory experiment conducted by woo et al 2019 demonstrated the potential of tir imagery for locating a buried drainage pipe further implying that timing relative to rainfall can impact the success of using tir to map drain lines in a preliminary case study allred et al 2018b a uav with a tir camera detected roughly 60 of the subsurface drainage infrastructure known to be present at an agricultural field near mt gilead ohio in results obtained from the same field site used by allred et al 2018b freeland et al 2019 found that pairing of real time kinematic rtk global navigation satellite system gnss technology with the uav tir survey was essential for accurately locating buried drain lines in the field williamson et al 2019 utilized both uav multispectral ms and tir imagery in a complementary approach that mapped random drain lines in two conservation tillage farm fields near harlan indiana consequently rigorous investigation is certainly warranted on the use of uav surveys with vis ms narrow bands of blue green red red edge and near infrared wavelengths and especially tir sensors to map agricultural subsurface drainage systems 1 3 justification supporting the evaluation of uav vis ms and tir imaging technology the soil surface directly over top of a drain line is often drier than the soil surface between drain lines this phenomenon can be especially true a few days after a large rainfall because the soil over a drain line is dewatered faster than the soil between drain lines smedema et al 2004 dry soil surfaces reflect more vis and near infrared nir electromagnetic em radiation than wet soil surfaces jenson 2007 consequently given bare ground conditions outside the growing season between harvest and planting lighter shaded dry soil surface features i e increased reflected em radiation that appear linear may be representative of drain lines the stefan boltzmann and kirchhoff s laws stipulate that the thermal infrared radiation emitted from an object is a function of that object s temperature and emissivity kuenzer and dech 2013 due to the specific heat capacity of water the soil surface over a drain line may have a different temperature than the soil surface between drain lines the differences in emitted thermal radiation caused by these temperature differences can be detected with a tir camera there may also be emissivity differences between wet and dry soil surfaces that can be detected with a tir camera mira et al 2007 therefore outside the growing season when bare ground conditions exist with or without crop residue present uav vis ms and tir imagery can provide a means for mapping subsurface drainage systems during the growing season there often seems to be better crop corn soybeans wheat establishment and health directly above drain lines likely from better soil aeration conditions caused by the faster drainage that occurs over a drain line directly after rainfall events compared to between the drain lines in fact crops commonly become first established directly over drainage pipes which then show up as distinct green lines on visible color vis c aerial imagery obtained very early in the growing season regardless of the time during the growing season if the crop has become better established or is healthier over drain lines then high resolution uav vis imagery especially vis c rather than visible grayscale can conceivably indicate drainage pipe locations multispectral imagery blue green red red edge and nir wavelength bands obtained with uavs are commonly utilized to produce ndvi normalized difference vegetation index maps which depict spatial variations in crop establishment and or health stress jenson 2016 sayago et al 2017 thereby also providing a possible means to delineate drain line locations thermal infrared imagery has additionally been utilized to depict spatial variations in crop health stress kullberg et al 2017 sepulcre cantó et al 2007 sobrino et al 2005 consequently uav vis c ms and tir imagery acquired during the growing season can all potentially map agricultural subsurface drainage systems given that the crop is better established and or healthier over the drain lines 1 4 research focus the overall feasibility for employing a uav with vis c ms and tir cameras to map drainage pipe systems was evaluated at 29 agricultural field sites in four midwest u s a states indiana iowa michigan and ohio information collected from these uav surveys were expected to provide insight on 1 which type of camera works best vis c ms or tir 2 the importance of timing the uav survey in relation to recent rainfall and 3 distinguishing linear features from drain lines versus linear features resulting from farm field operations three hypotheses listed as follows were therefore tested with this study 1 thermal infrared imagery will work best overall for mapping drain lines however there will be cases in which vis c or ms provide superior results 2 the time at which a uav survey is conducted relative to recent rainfall can sometimes have an important impact on drainage pipe detection 3 knowledge of drainage system installation and farm field operations allow aerial imagery linear features due to drain lines to be differentiated from those produced by field operations 2 materials and methods 2 1 equipment a sensefly sa cheseaux sur lausanne switzerland ebee plus rtk ppk fixed wing uav was employed to carry out the vis c ms and tir aerial surveys in this study the equipment set up for the unmanned aerial vehicle uav system is shown in fig 2 a and includes the uav itself 110 cm wingspan the ground modem antenna mounted on a tripod and a computer the computer had an internal cellular modem that allowed field internet access the ground modem antenna connected to the computer provided communication between the computer and the uav the sensefly sa emotion3 software installed on the computer was used to plan control uav flight patterns along with managing the data collected during each survey during flight the uav typically achieved speeds of 37 56 km h 20 30 kn there were three camera payloads utilized in this study s o d a sensor optimized for drone applications sequoia and thermomap the sensefly sa s o d a camera was used to collect high resolution 20 mpx visible color vis c 400 700 nm wavelengths photos this camera had a 28 mm focal lens the uav as configured with the s o d a camera had real time kinematic rtk global navigation satellite system gnss functionality that provided survey grade positional accuracy 0 7 cm for the vis c photos obtained to use rtk gnss functionality with the uav s o d a configuration onsite connection via the internet was achieved with state indiana iowa michigan and ohio department of transportation virtual reference station networks the uav surveys conducted with the s o d a camera were flown approximately 122 m 400 ft above the ground with a surface resolution of 2 8 cm px a lateral photo overlap of 70 between adjacent flight lines and a longitudinal photo overlap of 60 along a flight line the parrot sa paris france sequoia multispectral ms camera captured 1 2 mpx photos in narrow bands of green 530 570 nm red 640 680 nm red edge 730 740 nm and near infrared nir 770 810 nm wavelengths the uav as configured with the sequoia camera did not have rtk gnss functionality and positional accuracy was approximately 4 m for the four photo types obtained the uav surveys conducted with the sequoia camera were flown approximately 122 m 400 ft above the ground with a surface resolution of 11 cm px a lateral photo overlap of 60 and a longitudinal photo overlap of 80 the sensefly sa thermomap thermal infrared tir camera captured 0 3 mpx 640 522 px images in a wavelength range of 8 5 11 5 μm 10 μm center wavelength the uav as configured with the thermomap camera did not have rtk gnss functionality and positional accuracy was approximately 4 m the uav surveys conducted with the thermomap camera were flown approximately 76 122 m 250 400 ft above the ground surface with a resolution of 14 23 cm px a lateral photo overlap of 70 and a longitudinal photo overlap of 90 when battery power needed to complete survey was not an issue lower altitudes were flown to improve resolution the ebee plus rtk ppk fixed wing uav could accommodate only one camera payload at a time so at each field site at least three uav surveys needed to be carried out one with the s o d a one with the sequoia and one with the thermomap propeller aero surry hills new south wales australia aeropoints fig 2b were used as cloud connected high precision ground control points gcps to confirm positional accuracy of the uav s o d a surveys and to greatly improve the positional accuracy of the uav sequoia surveys the aeropoints did not show up well on tir images so a 61 cm 24 in diameter aluminum pizza pan was placed next to each aeropoint in the field fig 2b the aluminum pizza pans show up well on both s o d a and thermomap images consequently the s o d a survey was used to obtain accurate positional coordinates for the pizza pans thereby allowing the pizza pans to be employed as precision gcps for the thermomap survey through this approach the locational accuracy of the thermomap imagery was much improved 2 2 data processing pix4d sa prilly switzerland software pix4dmapper pro was employed for initial data processing particularly stitching together of overlapping images obtained during a uav survey with a particular camera the end product of this stitching process was a set of vis c ms and tir georeferenced orthomosaic image maps of the complete site survey area over which the uav was flown all generated orthomosaics are based on the nad 83 2011 geodetic reference system with the s o d a camera pix4dmapper pro also produced a digital terrain model dtm of the site survey area additionally pix4dmapper pro was used to generate crop index orthomosaic maps from ms data including the normalized difference vegetation index ndvi and normalized difference red edge ndre orthomosaic maps were post processed using arcmap 10 2 desktop software environmental systems research institute redlands california u s a where annotations were added and the image then saved in a manageable format size further processing was accomplished using the free public access gnu image manipulation program gimp 2 10 10 image editor this software allowed for adjustment and enhancement of exposure color levels sharpness image size and resolution the vis c orthomosaics are a stitched color image of the site as would be seen from above with the human eye the ms and tir orthomosaics were generated in grayscale with lighter shaded features representing either greater reflection of green red red edge or nir electromagnetic em radiation or a greater emission of thermal infrared radiation false color orthomosaic image maps were created with arcmap 10 7 by combining orthomosaic maps from different ms wavelength bands or combining the tir orthomosaic with one or two ms orthomosaics in particular false color infrared cir orthomosaics were constructed by applying shades of blue to the ms green orthomosaic shades of green to the ms red orthomosaic shades of red to the ms nir orthomosaic followed then by combining all three of these altered orthomosaics into a single composite orthomosaic this product is referred to as a false cir orthomosaic image because it does not represent the continuous em spectrum from green to near infrared but rather is constructed of discrete wavelength bands of green 530 570 nm red 640 680 nm and nir 770 810 nm after being generated the various orthomosaics from a uav site survey were closely inspected to determine whether there were linear features present indicative of drain lines especially the lighter shaded linear features found on grayscale orthomosaics 2 3 field site information from february 2018 to july 2019 29 agricultural field sites were visited in indiana iowa michigan and ohio fig 3 to carry out subsurface drainage mapping using uav surveys many of these sites were visited at multiple occasions results from 11 uav site surveys were chosen as examples to emphasize key findings of this research for these 11 table 1 provides information on site survey location latitude and longitude date of uav survey daytime period over which the surveys were carried out area of the agricultural field and approximate total area covered by the uav survey includes orthomosaic area outside of field boundaries table 2 provides condition information for the 11 uav site surveys examples including prior rainfall surface characteristics bare ground weeds tillage crop residue and established crops and soil types present drainage maps were available for six of the example sites fig 4 3 results and discussion 3 1 overall outcome of uav surveys past studies have stated that the best time to obtain aerial imagery for drainage pipe mapping of a farm field is outside the growing season and two to three days after a heavy rainfall event equal or greater than 2 5 cm 1 in as indicated by naz et al 2009 or 5 0 cm 2 in or greater as indicated by verma et al 1996 while this approach may undoubtedly have merit strict adherence would have severely limited the number of sites that could have been visited over the year and a half data was collected during this investigation in the midwest u s a within a given year at a particular site there are likely only a few rainfall events of 2 5 cm or greater outside the growing season consequently even though our approach might not be considered ideal in order to visit as many sites as possible uav surveys were generally conducted when an opportunity arose to visit a location and without an overriding consideration of time of year or field wetness from prior rainfall table 2 shows that of the 11 example uav site surveys only two came close to fulfilling a standard of 2 5 cm or more of rainfall within three days prior to conducting the uav survey results from each of the 29 agricultural field sites are provided in table 3 and are summarized in fig 5 at least some drain lines were detected on the visible color vis c orthomosaics at 48 of the sites concerning the multispectral ms orthomosaics at least some drain lines were detected at 59 of the sites the overall thermal infrared tir results were even better with at least some drain lines detected at 69 of the sites several sites were visited multiple times but only the most successful uav site survey was chosen to be included in the overall results presented in table 3 and fig 5 for a particular orthomosaic vis c ms or tir from a certain site to be deemed successful at detecting drainage pipes 20 100 of the estimated drain lines need to have been identified even if only 20 of drain lines are depicted this amount of information can still be very useful in providing general insight on drainage pipe directional trends and patterns these overall results indicate even though much of the aerial imagery data was collected under less than ideal conditions regarding time of year and or prior rainfall vis c ms and tir cameras were all relatively successful at finding agricultural drainage pipe however of the three tested the tir camera worked at more sites 3 2 advantage for obtaining vis c ms and tir imagery at each site while tir did identify drainage pipes at more sites than vis c or ms this overall result certainly does not imply that at a particular site where drain lines were detected tir imagery always worked better than vis c and or ms imagery there were in fact several site surveys in this study where vis c and or ms imagery provided better insight on the drainage network pattern than tir imagery five example sets of uav site survey results are provided in figs 6 12 to emphasize that the drainage mapping effectiveness of vis c ms and tir imagery relative to one another was often dependent on the site visited and or the day the uav surveys were carried out in two of these sets tir imagery clearly worked best figs 6 and 8 figs 7 and 9 are the digital terrain model contour maps for the respective sites shown in figs 6 and 8 two example sets showed that vis c and or ms imagery definitely worked better figs 10 and 11 and there was one set where the combination of ms and tir imagery provided a more complete understanding of drain line patterns than either ms or tir imagery alone fig 12 unmanned aerial vehicle vis c ms and tir surveys at the morrow co site were first carried out on june 12 2017 and the results presented by allred et al 2018b in these first uav surveys the southwest portion of the field was not covered this site was again visited on may 1 2018 with the goal of obtaining results covering the entire field fig 6 field conditions on may 1 2018 were dry with bare ground partially covered by corn and soybean residue table 2 a map of the subsurface drainage system on the east side of the morrow co field site shows a complex pattern with both east west and north south trending drain lines fig 4a in the northwestern portion of the field there is a known set of north south drain lines there is no regular subsurface drainage system pattern in the southwestern portion of the field although a few random drain lines installed in the early 1900s may be present both here and elsewhere in the field in the enlarged inset of the northcentral portion of the field the tir orthomosaic fig 6a clearly shows lighter shaded linear features representing known east west drain lines to the east compare figs 4a and 6 a and known north south drain lines to the west furthermore as was understood beforehand the complete tir orthomosaic for the site depicts no regularly spaced drain lines in the southwestern portion of the field these results obtained with tir were not found or were not as clear in the vis c fig 6b false color infrared cir fig 6c and ms red edge fig 6d orthomosaics the north south closely spaced linear features most prevalent on the vis c false cir and ms red edge orthomosaics seem to be those associated with field operations harvest tillage planting etc the false cir orthomosaic is provided as means of showing the ms green red and near infrared nir results combined and to somewhat duplicate the cir approach employed by verma et al 1996 fig 6 clearly shows that at the morrow co site on may 1 2018 tir imagery worked much better than vis c and ms at determining drainage pipe locations interestingly tir imagery worked well at this site even though field conditions were dry and with partial coverage of the ground surface by corn and soybean residue these more recent results are very similar to the ones of allred et al 2018b however even though the vis c imagery obtained with the s o d a camera at the morrow co site did not work very well finding drainage pipes the uav s o d a configuration with rtk gnss functionality did provide the means to produce an accurate high resolution digital terrain model dtm of this field fig 7 note dtms can also be produced from the ms and tir imagery collected with the sequoia and thermomap cameras however the accuracy resolution of the dtms from these cameras would not be nearly as good as the s o d a dtm this accurate high resolution dtm is by itself extremely useful to drainage contractors accurate high resolution topographic information is needed by drainage contractors when repairing drain lines that are not functioning properly or installing new drain lines between the old ones to improve soil water removal efficiency consequently even though the s o d a vis c imagery might not always detect drainage pipes it is still beneficial regarding the topographic information acquired the hardin co n uav vis c ms and tir surveys were carried out on july 1 2019 and results are presented in fig 8 these uav surveys focused on the field area to the north of the east west waterway at the time of the uav surveys the field area north of the waterway was very dry with mostly bare ground present table 2 the known subsurface drainage system pattern within this field area is very complex some drain lines trending east west some trending north south and many trending essentially northwest southeast fig 4b inspection of the enlarged insets for the northwest portion of the field show that on this day july 1 2019 the tir imagery was able to map the northwest southeast trending drain lines while the vis c and ms false cir and red edge imagery did not fig 8 on an earlier date april 24 2019 at this site under wetter soil conditions results were much different with vis c ms and tir all effective at mapping drainage pipes furthermore it is interesting to note there were areas of the field that had high tir emission and low ms reflectance that seem somewhat gully like in configuration a contour map based on the dtm from the s o d a camera vis c imagery seems to confirm that these features especially on the western side of the field are indeed related to the presence of topographically subtle gully like channels formed by erosion the example hancock co uav vis c ms and tir surveys were carried out on april 17 2019 and results are presented in fig 10 at the time these uav surveys were carried out the soil was somewhat moist 1 5 cm of rainfall within the previous three days and the ground surface was mostly bare with some soybean residue present table 2 the subsurface drainage pattern for this site is quite complex fig 4c drain lines trend east west just north of the northeast southwest oriented waterway and just south of the waterway the drain lines trend north south in the far southwestern portion of the field drain lines trend north south while in the far southcentral and southeast portions of the field drain lines trend east west fig 4c this site had previously been visited several times to conduct uav surveys but without much success in delineating drainage pipes on april 17 2019 better results were achieved at this time the vis c imagery and especially ms imagery depicted drain lines but tir imagery did not in fig 10 the tir enlarged inset fig 10a shows only north south linear features associated with field operations the vis c fig 10b enlarged inset has subtle indications of the north south drain lines south of the waterway the enlarged insets for the ms false cir fig 10c and ms red edge fig 10d both clearly show north south linear features representative of drain lines just south of the waterway the enlarged insets for the false cir and red edge imagery also show subtle east west linear features representing drain lines just north of the waterway therefore at this particular site with respect to drainage pipe detection ms imagery was by far the best followed next by vis c while tir did not seem to work well at all the example ross co 1 uav vis c ms and tir surveys were carried out on april 11 2019 and results are presented in fig 11 at the time these uav surveys were carried out the soil was very dry 0 1 cm of rainfall within the previous week and although there were some bare patches of ground present most of the field was covered by well established wheat table 2 essentially all the drain lines in this field trend northwest southeast fig 4e inspection of enlarged field area insets in fig 11 show only a very subtle drainage pipe response for the tir imagery a much more pronounced drainage pipe response for the vis c imagery thin darker green lines trending northwest southeast and an extremely clear drainage pipe response for the normalized difference vegetation index ndvi orthomosasic map based on ms red and nir imagery therefore when a crop has become better established or is healthier directly over the drain lines then uav drainage mapping surveys can be successfully conducted during the growing season in which case vis c or ms plant establishment health index products like ndvi may work quite well locating the drainage pipes the hardin co n s uav site surveys were carried out on april 24 2019 and covered the complete field areas both north and south of the east west trending waterway while the previously described hardin co n uav surveys focused just on the field area north of the waterway at the time the hardin co n s uav site surveys were conducted the soil was somewhat moist 4 2 cm of rainfall in the previous week and there was a significant amount of bare ground across the site table 2 the north field area was tilled and had soybean residue present while the south field area had corn stubble along with established cover crops cereal rye crimson clover and oats table 2 the subsurface drainage map for the north field area is provided in fig 4b there was no subsurface drainage map available for the south field area the results presented in fig 12 are an example where the combination of ms and tir imagery provide better insight on drain line patterns than either ms or tir imagery alone the tir orthomosaic fig 12a worked better overall than ms nir fig 12b or the ms red edge fig 12c at mapping drain line locations in the north field area in particular within the north field area the previously described gullies do not obscure drain lines in the tir orthomosaic nearly to the degree that they are obscured in the nir or red edge orthomosaics again in the north field area the gullies have a dendritic pattern of high tir emission lighter shading and low ms reflectance darker shading conversely within the red circled portion of the south field area north south trending drain lines are more clearly depicted by the nir and red edge orthomosaics than they are with the tir orthomosaic a false color composite orthomosaic that combined tir nir and red edge is shown in fig 12d in this false color composite orthomosaic red edge imagery was assigned shades of blue tir imagery was assigned shades of green and nir imagery was assigned shades of red the enlarged field area insets of the northwest corner of the north field area show that the false color composite orthomosaic depict drain lines better overall than the tir nir or red edge orthomosaics alone fig 12 the tir inset shows the drain lines crossing through the gully while the nir and red edge orthomosaics do not although not depicted within the tir inset the nir and red edge insets clearly show a set of drain lines that make a tight 90 degree turn from north south to east west the false color composite inset comprised of tir nir and red edge show both drain lines crossing the gully and the set of drain lines that make a 90 degree turn however it should be noted this false color composite did not show the north south drain lines within the red circled portion of the south field area consequently hardin co n s uav site surveys indicate that some combination of vis c ms and tir imagery may in some cases provide better insight on drain line patterns than vis c ms or tir alone williamson et al 2019 at a field site near harlan indiana also found more than one type of imagery tir and ms to be complementary for determining drain line locations furthermore ms and tir imagery can be combined into false color orthomosaic products that in some instances provide an improved depiction of drainage patterns the results presented in figs 6 12 from five sets of uav site surveys have some important implications mentioned as follows thermal infrared imagery does not always work best at locating drainage pipe sometimes either vis c or ms imagery provides better insight on drain line patterns there will also be sites where a combination of imagery provides more information on the subsurface drainage system present than vis c alone ms alone or tir alone therefore the key finding from these results is that the best approach at any site is to conduct uav surveys to obtain all three types of imagery vis c ms and tir furthermore even if the vis c imagery does not detect drainage pipes this imagery is still valuable for providing topographic information that can be used by drainage contractors to repair or retrofit existing subsurface drainage systems in addition uav surveys can be employed not only outside the growing season but also during the growing season to map drain lines 3 3 timing of uav surveys relative to recent rainfall can in some cases strongly impact drainage pipe detection results as stated before the recommendation for successful mapping of subsurface drainage outside the growing season is to conduct aerial surveys two to three days after a rainfall event of 2 5 cm or greater naz et al 2009 the morrow co and hardin co n uav site surveys previously described plainly indicate that strict adherence to this recommendation is not always required in order to locate buried drainage pipes at both sites soil conditions were dry since there had been very little rainfall prior to conducting the uav surveys 1 2 cm of rainfall at morrow co site in previous ten days 1 1 cm of rainfall at the hardin co site in previous ten days however tir imagery figs 6a and 8 a clearly show the complex subsurface drainage pattern present at these two sites at this time the reason is unclear as to why the tir imagery at these two sites was able to detect drainage pipes under dry soil conditions therefore depending on the site there may be a much more extensive range of soil wetness dryness conditions than initially thought where uav surveys can be successfully employed to map subsurface drainage systems however during this study there were examples where the timing of the uav surveys relative to recent rainfall had an important impact regarding drainage pipe detection the results depicted in fig 13 for the seneca co site demonstrate that conducting uav surveys too soon after a large rainfall event may not allow sufficient time for the soil to drain directly over the drain lines thereby preventing detection of drainage pipe locations site soil surface conditions were wet with extensive bare ground and some soybean residue table 2 there was substantial rainfall 4 2 cm the night before the seneca co uav surveys were conducted as shown the orthomosaic from the vis c survey carried out at 10 30 the next morning did not reveal the presence of drain lines fig 13a while the vis c orthomosaic from approximately seven hours later clearly depicts the complex drain line pattern within the field fig 13b in just seven hours from morning to afternoon the soil directly over the drain lines had sufficiently drained and dried for the subsurface drainage system pattern to become readily apparent on vis c imagery results from somewhat different circumstances are exhibited in fig 14 at the time the clay co ia uav site surveys were conducted there was a limited amount of bare ground across the site table 2 corn stubble with early establishment of soybeans was present in the east part of the field and soybean stubble with early establishment of corn was present in the west part of the field table 2 the soil was dry during the june 13 2018 uav surveys and due to a 4 2 cm rainfall on june 14 the soil was very wet the following day june 15 during the second set of uav surveys table 2 the subsurface drainage map for the clay co ia site is provided in fig 4d with dry soil conditions prior to the large rainfall event drain lines are not evident in the tir orthomosaic fig 14a one day after the 4 2 cm rainfall the drain line pattern shown in the tir orthomosaic is unmistakable compare fig 4d with fig 14b note even the seneca co second vis c survey and clay co ia 2 tir site surveys did not completely follow uav timing recommendations concerning rainfall since each of these uav surveys were carried out one day after a large rainfall greater than 2 5 cm instead of two to three days after the rainfall it is certainly evident from the results presented in figs 13 and 14 that the timing of uav surveys relative to rainfall can be very important in regard to drainage pipe detection however the recommendation to only conduct uav surveys outside the growing season and two to three days after a large rainfall event while possibly ideal may be far too restrictive 3 4 distinguishing linear features in uav imagery that are due to drain lines from linear features produced by farm field operations linear features representing drain lines and annual farm field operations can be confused with one another and are often both depicted on site aerial imagery a significant proportion of the linear features related to farm field operations could be due to wheel tracks from either harvest tillage fertilizer or planting equipment the stalks and chaff expelled deposited behind combine harvesters may also produce linear features compacted soil wheel tracks and wide bands of crop residue may have different soil water content temperature or emissivity characteristics compared to the ground surface where these features are absent thereby causing the wheel tracks or crop residue bands to show up on vis ms and tir imagery for the uav imagery obtained in our study differentiating drain line linear features from farm field operation linear features is critical and this problem is emphasized in fig 15 showing the tir orthomosaic from the ross co 2 uav site survey this survey was conducted on august 23 2018 well after wheat harvest the soil was fairly wet and there were extensive amounts of bare ground with substantial wheat stubble across the field site table 2 at first glance the east west lighter shaded linear features shown in the fig 15 tir orthomosaic would appear to represent drain lines however the enlarged inset from the southwest corner of the field show that the tir linear features have edge of field u shaped turn around lines connecting one east west linear feature to another a configuration with edge of field turn arounds connecting linear features indicates that these linear features are due to field operations and not drain lines the following is a list of considerations that were employed with the uav imagery in this study to distinguish drainage pipe linear features from linear features produced from farm field operations 1 linear features that have a herringbone pattern as shown in fig 1b or a random pattern as shown in fig 1c are almost without doubt representative of a subsurface drainage system 2 harvest tillage fertilizer application and or planting operations especially in fields that have a somewhat elongated rectangular shape often have at least one path that follows the perimeter of the field and in addition a set of parallel straight line paths within the field to provide complete coverage for the operation the parallel set of paths within the field are commonly oriented with the long axis of the field conducting field operations in this manner is more efficient by reducing the number of edge of field turn arounds consequently linear features that follow this general pattern are likely the result of annual farm field operations 3 any edge of field turn arounds that connect linear features as is depicted in fig 15 are a sure sign that these linear features are due to farm field operations 4 drain lines are usually entirely straight so a set of linear features that have a wavy appearance may be the result of field operations 5 the spacing distance between drainage pipe laterals in older subsurface drainage systems averaged around 15 18 m 50 60 ft while for newer systems or a retrofit of an existing system the drain line spacing distance may be as small as 7 5 9 m 25 30 ft if a set of parallel linear features have a spacing distance substantially less than 7 5 m then these linear features more generally do not represent drain lines commonly when two sets of linear features are found superimposed on one another the one most likely associated with a set of drain lines is the one exhibiting the greatest spacing distance between adjacent lines 6 to improve soil water removal functionality drainage contractors often install drain lines at a 30 to 45 degree angle to the predominant orientation of the farm field operations therefore linear features that cross the field in a manner diagonal to field boundaries are probably characteristic of drain lines 7 linear features that continually show up at the same exact locations in aerial satellite imagery obtained at different times particularly over a number of years likely represent drain lines a sound approach for mapping drainage system patterns is to review of all available historical aerial satellite imagery from a site in conjunction with the more recent imagery obtained by the uav survey for the few uav site surveys in this research where drain line maps or any knowledge of the subsurface drainage system were unavailable these considerations proved useful differentiating drainage pipe responses from linear features produced from farm field operations the uav tir orthomosaics from the ross co 3 and defiance co site surveys are shown in fig 16 on dec 14 2018 when the ross co 3 uav surveys were carried out the soil was relatively dry and there were extensive amounts of bare ground with substantial soybean residue across the field site table 2 on may 8 2018 when the defiance co uav surveys were carried out the soil was dry and there were extensive amounts of bare ground with substantial crop residue across the field site table 2 throughout the field areas of both sites there seem to be two superimposed sets of linear features one likely from drain lines and one probably belonging to farm field operations in two parts of the field area at each site the previously listed considerations particularly as related to spacing distance and trends relative to field boundaries were employed to interpret drain line orientation solid yellow lines versus the orientation of linear features due to farm field operations dashed yellow lines the farmer land owner and a partial drainage map fig 4f found after the uav survey confirm the interpretations made for the ross co 3 site at the defiance co site these interpretations were verified as accurate by the farmer drainage contractor land owner consequently where the origin of linear features present in uav imagery is initially unclear knowledge of subsurface drainage system installation and farm field operations can be utilized to distinguish those representing drain lines versus those due to harvest tillage fertilizer and or planting efforts as a final note the 29 uav site surveys in this study covered a range of soil types common throughout the midwest u s a loamy fine sand to clay see table 2 different seasons of year fall winter spring and summer wet to dry soils and varied surface characteristics related to bare ground presence of crop residue existence of cover crops and corn soybean wheat establishment somewhat surprisingly given this wide array of site conditions uav vis c ms and tir imagery worked quite well overall at mapping agricultural subsurface drainage systems even if this technology is not successful at a particular site for finding drainage pipes it is still useful for the topographic information it can provide which in and of itself is valuable to drainage contractors installing or retrofitting subsurface drainage systems or for gaining insight on surface runoff attributes 3 5 future work the next major step planned for this research program is to develop specific guidelines as to when and where this uav technology can be best employed to map agricultural subsurface drainage systems to develop these guidelines additional uav vis c ms and tir surveys are planned at six farm field sites in indiana michigan and ohio specifically chosen so that there will be a wide range of soil types across the six sites each site is planned to be visited eight times over a two year period with this approach the range of site conditions soil type time of day within or outside of growing season soil wetness dryness and ground surface characteristics under which a particular type of imagery vis c ms or tir is effective at mapping drain lines can be determined all of this information can then be utilized to produce guidelines in the form of a decision tree or matrix that can used by farmers and drainage contractors to decide what type of imagery vis c ms or tir will work best for drainage mapping and when would be the best time to carry out such a uav survey to gain better insight on the ground surface thermal infrared emission response in farm fields soil temperature and emissivity measurements are planned to be obtained over time daily and yearly in a set of small test plots with variable soil types wetness dryness and surface cover i e bare ground crop residue etc furthermore advanced processing techniques can be evaluated to more clearly depict drain line responses in uav vis c ms and tir imagery in particular this advanced processing may include first stacking all the imagery bands and then conducting a decorrelation stretch minimum noise fraction transform or principal component transform on the multi band image for the purpose of suppressing noise components and thereby enhancing the drainage pipe response supervised machine learning algorithms may also be developed and employed to analyze uav imagery and automatically differentiate drain line responses from linear features produced from farm field operations 4 summary there are strong economic and environmental motivations for finding effective efficient and non destructive methods to map agricultural subsurface drainage systems the use of unmanned aerial vehicles uavs with visible color vis c multispectral ms and thermal infrared tir cameras may provide the solution to the drainage mapping problem this technology was tested at 29 different field sites in the midwest u s a states of indiana iowa michigan and ohio the uav vis c imagery detected at least some drain lines at 48 of the sites 15 out of 29 ms imagery detected drain lines at 59 of the sites 15 out of 29 and tir imagery detected drain lines at 69 of the sites 20 out of 29 three key findings regarding uav drainage pipe mapping were extracted from the overall results 1 although tir was effective at more of the sites there were individual sites where vis c and or ms worked better than tir for mapping subsurface drainage systems consequently to ensure the greatest chance for successfully determining drainage pipe patterns in a field uav surveys need to be carried out with all three types of cameras vis c ms and tir 2 the timing of uav surveys relative to rainfall can be critical regarding drainage pipe detection however the recommendation to only conduct uav surveys outside the growing season and two to three days after a large rainfall event while possibly ideal may be far too restrictive somewhat surprisingly there were examples in this study where the uav surveys identified drain lines even when there was an established crop in place or when the soil was very dry 3 where the origin of linear features present in uav imagery is initially unclear knowledge of subsurface drainage system installation and farm field operations can be utilized to distinguish linear features representing drain lines versus the linear features due to harvest tillage fertilizer and or planting efforts aside from these three key findings even if this technology is not successful at a particular site for finding drainage pipes it is still useful for the topographic information it can provide which in and of itself is valuable to drainage contractors installing or retrofitting subsurface drainage systems or for gaining insight on surface runoff attributes the overall results and extracted key findings from this study clearly indicate that vis c ms and tir imagery obtained with uavs have significant potential for use in mapping agricultural drainage pipe systems future work is planned to primarily focus on six indiana michigan and ohio farm field sites each of which is planned to be visited at eight times over a two year period for subsurface drainage mapping with uav vis c ms and tir cameras with this approach the range of site conditions soil type time of year wetness dryness and surface characteristics under which a particular type of imagery vis c ms or tir is effective at mapping drain lines can be determined these results can then be employed to develop specific guidelines on the use of uav vis c ms and tir

10687,effective and efficient methods are needed to map agricultural subsurface drainage systems visible color vis c multispectral ms and thermal infrared tir imagery obtained by unmanned aerial

ms imagery thermal infrared tir imagery 1 introduction 1 1 research rationale the widespread adoption of subsurface drainage practices to remove excess soil water has enabled the midwest u s a to become one of the most productive agricultural regions in the world a 1985 economic survey showed that several states within the midwest u s a illinois indiana iowa ohio minnesota michigan missouri and wisconsin had by that year approximately 12 5 million ha that contained subsurface drainage systems with cropland accounting for the vast majority of areas having these buried drainage pipe networks pavelis 1987 since 1985 a substantial amount of additional agricultural drainage pipe has been installed farmers within this region often need to repair drain lines that are not functioning correctly or install new drain lines between the old ones to improve soil water removal efficiency whether for system repairs or efficiency improvements locations of the preexisting drain lines are required however in most cases a map of the original subsurface drainage system installation is no longer available furthermore subsurface drainage practices can release substantial amounts of nitrate no3 and phosphate po4 3 from farm fields into adjacent waterways sims et al 1998 zucker and brown 1998 which in turn degrades surface water bodies on local regional and national scales risk assessment of this environmental hazard from the farm field perspective calls for some knowledge of the installed drainage pipe network including the extent of coverage and spacing distance between drain lines finding drain lines with heavy trenching equipment causes pipe damage requiring costly repairs while the alternative of using a hand held tile probe is both time consuming and extremely tedious subsurface drainage system patterns can be complex fig 1 further hampering efforts to map drain lines using traditional trenching or tile probe detection methods consequently there is a crucial necessity for effective efficient and nondestructive drainage pipe mapping methods visible vis multispectral ms and thermal infrared tir imagery obtained with unmanned aerial vehicles uavs may provide a solution 1 2 prior research into better methods for mapping subsurface drainage ground penetrating radar gpr has proven capable in many instances of locating buried drainage pipe under a range of soil conditions allred et al 2004 2005 allred and redman 2010 allred 2013 allred et al 2018a chow and rees 1989 but gpr is somewhat inefficient for providing detailed maps of subsurface drainage systems in large farm fields both visible vis i e wavelengths within the 400 nm 700 nm visible light portion of electromagnetic spectrum and color infrared comprised of green red and near infrared wavelengths photography from manned aircraft obtained outside the growing season have been tested to a limited extent for mapping subsurface drainage systems naz et al 2009 verma et al 1996 however scheduling an airplane to collect data when field conditions are optimal i e several days after a rainfall event equal or greater than 2 5 or 5 0 cm as suggested by these previous studies can be problematic alternatively scheduling an aerial survey with an uav is far more flexible and could solve this timing issue but uavs have not yet been extensively tested for drainage pipe mapping furthermore although some aerial vis and color infrared cir drainage pipe detection studies have been conducted there has been very little research on the use of tir imagery to map drainage pipes abdel hadi et al 1970 provides several excellent examples in which tir imagery detected subsurface features such as pipelines and buried stream channels thereby indicating that tir aerial surveys may have capability for drainage pipe mapping a laboratory experiment conducted by woo et al 2019 demonstrated the potential of tir imagery for locating a buried drainage pipe further implying that timing relative to rainfall can impact the success of using tir to map drain lines in a preliminary case study allred et al 2018b a uav with a tir camera detected roughly 60 of the subsurface drainage infrastructure known to be present at an agricultural field near mt gilead ohio in results obtained from the same field site used by allred et al 2018b freeland et al 2019 found that pairing of real time kinematic rtk global navigation satellite system gnss technology with the uav tir survey was essential for accurately locating buried drain lines in the field williamson et al 2019 utilized both uav multispectral ms and tir imagery in a complementary approach that mapped random drain lines in two conservation tillage farm fields near harlan indiana consequently rigorous investigation is certainly warranted on the use of uav surveys with vis ms narrow bands of blue green red red edge and near infrared wavelengths and especially tir sensors to map agricultural subsurface drainage systems 1 3 justification supporting the evaluation of uav vis ms and tir imaging technology the soil surface directly over top of a drain line is often drier than the soil surface between drain lines this phenomenon can be especially true a few days after a large rainfall because the soil over a drain line is dewatered faster than the soil between drain lines smedema et al 2004 dry soil surfaces reflect more vis and near infrared nir electromagnetic em radiation than wet soil surfaces jenson 2007 consequently given bare ground conditions outside the growing season between harvest and planting lighter shaded dry soil surface features i e increased reflected em radiation that appear linear may be representative of drain lines the stefan boltzmann and kirchhoff s laws stipulate that the thermal infrared radiation emitted from an object is a function of that object s temperature and emissivity kuenzer and dech 2013 due to the specific heat capacity of water the soil surface over a drain line may have a different temperature than the soil surface between drain lines the differences in emitted thermal radiation caused by these temperature differences can be detected with a tir camera there may also be emissivity differences between wet and dry soil surfaces that can be detected with a tir camera mira et al 2007 therefore outside the growing season when bare ground conditions exist with or without crop residue present uav vis ms and tir imagery can provide a means for mapping subsurface drainage systems during the growing season there often seems to be better crop corn soybeans wheat establishment and health directly above drain lines likely from better soil aeration conditions caused by the faster drainage that occurs over a drain line directly after rainfall events compared to between the drain lines in fact crops commonly become first established directly over drainage pipes which then show up as distinct green lines on visible color vis c aerial imagery obtained very early in the growing season regardless of the time during the growing season if the crop has become better established or is healthier over drain lines then high resolution uav vis imagery especially vis c rather than visible grayscale can conceivably indicate drainage pipe locations multispectral imagery blue green red red edge and nir wavelength bands obtained with uavs are commonly utilized to produce ndvi normalized difference vegetation index maps which depict spatial variations in crop establishment and or health stress jenson 2016 sayago et al 2017 thereby also providing a possible means to delineate drain line locations thermal infrared imagery has additionally been utilized to depict spatial variations in crop health stress kullberg et al 2017 sepulcre cantó et al 2007 sobrino et al 2005 consequently uav vis c ms and tir imagery acquired during the growing season can all potentially map agricultural subsurface drainage systems given that the crop is better established and or healthier over the drain lines 1 4 research focus the overall feasibility for employing a uav with vis c ms and tir cameras to map drainage pipe systems was evaluated at 29 agricultural field sites in four midwest u s a states indiana iowa michigan and ohio information collected from these uav surveys were expected to provide insight on 1 which type of camera works best vis c ms or tir 2 the importance of timing the uav survey in relation to recent rainfall and 3 distinguishing linear features from drain lines versus linear features resulting from farm field operations three hypotheses listed as follows were therefore tested with this study 1 thermal infrared imagery will work best overall for mapping drain lines however there will be cases in which vis c or ms provide superior results 2 the time at which a uav survey is conducted relative to recent rainfall can sometimes have an important impact on drainage pipe detection 3 knowledge of drainage system installation and farm field operations allow aerial imagery linear features due to drain lines to be differentiated from those produced by field operations 2 materials and methods 2 1

modem that allowed field internet access the ground modem antenna connected to the computer provided communication between the computer and the uav the sensefly sa emotion3 software installed on the

camera captured 0 3 mpx 640 522 px images in a wavelength range of 8 5 11 5 μm 10 μm center wavelength the uav as configured with the thermomap camera did not have rtk gnss functionality and positional accuracy was approximately 4 m the uav surveys conducted with the thermomap camera were flown approximately 76 122 m 250 400 ft above the ground surface with a resolution of 14 23 cm px a lateral photo overlap of 70 and a longitudinal photo overlap of 90 when battery power needed to complete survey was not an issue lower altitudes were flown to improve resolution the ebee plus rtk ppk fixed wing uav could accommodate only one camera payload at a time so at each field site at least three uav surveys needed to be carried out one with the s o d a one with the sequoia and one with the thermomap propeller aero surry hills new south wales australia aeropoints fig 2b were used as cloud connected high precision ground control points gcps to confirm positional accuracy of the uav s o d a surveys and to greatly improve the positional accuracy of the uav sequoia surveys the aeropoints did not show up well on tir images so a 61 cm 24 in diameter aluminum pizza pan was placed next to each aeropoint in the field fig 2b the aluminum pizza pans show up well on both s o d a and thermomap images consequently the s o d a survey was used to obtain accurate positional coordinates for the pizza pans thereby allowing the pizza pans to be employed as precision gcps for the thermomap survey through this approach the locational accuracy of the thermomap imagery was much improved 2 2 data processing pix4d sa prilly switzerland software pix4dmapper pro was employed for initial data processing particularly stitching together of overlapping images obtained during a uav survey with a particular camera the end product of this stitching process was a set of vis c ms and tir georeferenced orthomosaic image maps of the complete site survey area over which the uav was flown all generated orthomosaics are based on the nad 83 2011 geodetic reference system with the s o d a camera pix4dmapper pro also produced a digital terrain model dtm of the site survey area additionally pix4dmapper pro was used to generate crop index orthomosaic maps from ms data including the normalized difference vegetation index ndvi and normalized difference red edge ndre orthomosaic maps were post processed using arcmap 10 2 desktop software environmental systems research institute redlands california u s a where annotations were added and the image then saved in a manageable format size further processing was accomplished using the free public access gnu image manipulation program gimp 2 10 10 image editor this software allowed for adjustment and enhancement of exposure color levels sharpness image size and resolution the vis c orthomosaics are a stitched color image of the site as would be seen from above with the human eye the ms and tir orthomosaics were generated in grayscale with lighter shaded features representing either greater reflection of green red red edge or nir electromagnetic em radiation or a greater emission of thermal infrared radiation false color orthomosaic image maps were created with arcmap 10 7 by combining orthomosaic maps from different ms wavelength bands or combining the tir orthomosaic with one or two ms orthomosaics in particular false color infrared cir orthomosaics were constructed by applying shades of blue to the ms green orthomosaic shades of green to the ms red orthomosaic shades of red to the ms nir orthomosaic followed then by combining all three of these altered orthomosaics into a single composite orthomosaic this product is referred to as a false cir orthomosaic image because it does not represent the continuous em spectrum from green to near infrared but rather is constructed of discrete wavelength bands of green 530 570 nm red 640 680 nm and nir 770 810 nm after being generated the various orthomosaics from a uav site survey were closely inspected to determine whether there were linear features present indicative of drain lines especially the lighter shaded linear features found on grayscale orthomosaics 2 3 field site information from february 2018 to july 2019 29 agricultural field sites were visited in indiana iowa michigan and ohio fig 3 to carry out subsurface drainage mapping using uav surveys many of these sites were visited at multiple occasions results from 11 uav site surveys were chosen as examples to emphasize key findings of this research for these 11 table 1 provides information on site survey location latitude and longitude date of uav survey daytime period over which the surveys were carried out area of the agricultural field and approximate total area covered by the uav survey includes orthomosaic area outside of field boundaries table 2 provides condition information for the 11 uav site surveys examples including prior rainfall surface characteristics bare ground weeds tillage crop residue and established crops and soil types present drainage maps were available for six of the example sites fig 4 3 results and discussion 3 1 overall outcome of uav surveys past studies have stated that the best time to obtain aerial imagery for drainage pipe mapping of a farm field is outside the growing season and two to three days after a heavy rainfall event equal or greater than 2 5 cm 1 in as indicated by naz et al 2009 or 5 0 cm 2 in or greater as indicated by verma et al 1996 while this approach may undoubtedly have merit strict adherence would have severely limited the number of sites that could have been visited over the year and a half data was collected during this investigation in the midwest u s a within a given year at a particular site there are likely only a few rainfall events of 2 5 cm or greater outside the growing season consequently even though our approach might not be considered ideal in order to visit as many sites as possible uav surveys were generally conducted when an opportunity arose to visit a location and without an overriding consideration of time of year or field wetness from prior rainfall table 2 shows that of the 11 example uav site surveys only two came close to fulfilling a standard of 2 5 cm or more of rainfall within three days prior to conducting the uav survey results from each of the 29 agricultural field sites are provided in table 3 and are summarized in fig 5 at least some drain lines were detected on the visible color vis c orthomosaics at 48 of the sites concerning the multispectral ms orthomosaics at least some drain lines were detected at 59 of the sites the overall thermal infrared tir results were even better with at least some drain lines detected at 69 of the sites several sites were visited multiple times but only the most successful uav site survey was chosen to be included in the overall results presented in table 3 and fig 5 for a particular orthomosaic vis c ms or tir from a certain site to be deemed successful at detecting drainage pipes 20 100 of the estimated drain lines need to have been identified even if only 20 of drain lines are depicted this amount of information can still be very useful in providing general insight on drainage pipe directional trends and patterns these overall results indicate even though much of the aerial imagery data was collected under less than ideal conditions regarding time of year and or prior rainfall vis c ms and tir cameras were all relatively successful at finding agricultural drainage pipe however of the three tested the tir camera worked at more sites 3 2 advantage for obtaining vis c ms and tir imagery at each site while tir did identify drainage pipes at more sites than vis c or ms this overall result certainly does not imply that at a particular site where drain lines were detected tir imagery always worked better than vis c and or ms imagery there were in fact several site surveys in this study where vis c and or ms imagery provided better insight on the drainage network pattern than tir imagery five example sets of uav site survey results are provided in figs 6 12 to emphasize that the drainage mapping effectiveness of vis c ms and tir imagery relative to one another was often dependent on the site visited and or the day the uav surveys were carried out in two of these sets tir imagery clearly worked best figs 6 and 8 figs 7 and 9 are the digital terrain model contour maps for the respective sites shown in figs 6 and 8 two example sets showed that vis c and or ms imagery definitely worked better figs 10 and 11 and there was one set where the combination of ms and tir imagery provided a more complete understanding of drain line patterns than either ms or tir imagery alone fig 12 unmanned aerial vehicle vis c ms and tir surveys at the morrow co site were first carried out on june 12 2017 and the results presented by allred et al 2018b in these first uav surveys the southwest portion of the field was not covered this site was again visited on may 1 2018 with the goal of obtaining results covering the entire field fig 6 field conditions on may 1 2018 were dry with bare ground partially covered by corn and soybean residue table 2 a map of the subsurface drainage system on the east side of the morrow co field site shows a complex pattern with both east west and north south trending drain lines fig 4a in the northwestern portion of the field there is a known set of north south drain lines there is no regular subsurface drainage system pattern in the southwestern portion of the field although a few random drain lines installed in the early 1900s may be present both here and elsewhere in the field in the enlarged inset of the northcentral portion of the field the tir orthomosaic fig 6a clearly shows lighter shaded linear features representing known east west drain lines to the east compare figs 4a and 6 a and known north south drain lines to the west furthermore as was understood beforehand the complete tir orthomosaic for the site depicts no regularly spaced drain lines in the southwestern portion of the field these results obtained with tir were not found or were not as clear in the vis c fig 6b false color infrared cir fig 6c and ms red edge fig 6d orthomosaics the north south closely spaced linear features most prevalent on the vis c false cir and ms red edge orthomosaics seem to be those associated with field operations harvest tillage planting etc the false cir orthomosaic is provided as means of showing the ms green red and near infrared nir results combined and to somewhat duplicate the cir approach employed by verma et al 1996 fig 6 clearly shows that at the morrow co site on may 1 2018 tir imagery worked much better than vis c and ms at determining drainage pipe locations interestingly tir imagery worked well at this site even though field conditions were dry and with partial coverage of the ground surface by corn and soybean residue these more recent results are very similar to the ones of allred et al 2018b however even though the vis c imagery obtained with the s o d a camera at the morrow co site did not work very well finding drainage pipes the uav s o d a configuration with rtk gnss functionality did provide the means to produce an accurate high resolution digital terrain model dtm of this field fig 7 note dtms can also be produced from the ms and tir imagery collected with the sequoia and thermomap cameras however the accuracy resolution of the dtms from these cameras would not be nearly as good as the s o d a dtm this accurate high resolution dtm is by itself extremely useful to drainage contractors accurate high resolution topographic information is needed by drainage contractors when repairing drain lines that are not functioning properly or installing new drain lines between the old ones to improve soil water removal efficiency consequently even though the s o d a vis c imagery might not always detect drainage pipes it is still beneficial regarding the topographic information acquired the hardin co n uav vis c ms and tir surveys were carried out on july 1 2019 and results are presented in fig 8 these uav surveys focused on the field area to the north of the east west waterway at the time of the uav surveys the field area north of the waterway was very dry with mostly bare ground present table 2 the known subsurface drainage system pattern within this field area is very complex some drain lines trending east west some trending north south and many trending essentially northwest southeast fig 4b inspection of the enlarged insets for the northwest portion of the field show that on this day july 1 2019 the tir imagery was able to map the northwest southeast trending drain lines while the vis c and ms false cir and red edge imagery did not fig 8 on an earlier date april 24 2019 at this site under wetter soil conditions results were much different with vis c ms and tir all effective at mapping drainage pipes furthermore it is interesting to note there were areas of the field that had high tir emission and low ms reflectance that seem somewhat gully like in configuration a contour map based on the dtm from the s o d a camera vis c imagery seems to confirm that these features especially on the western side of the field are indeed related to the presence of topographically subtle gully like channels formed by erosion the example hancock co uav vis c ms and tir surveys were carried out on april 17 2019 and results are presented in fig 10 at the time these uav surveys were carried out the soil was somewhat moist 1 5 cm of rainfall within the previous three days and the ground surface was mostly bare with some soybean residue present table 2 the subsurface drainage pattern for this site is quite complex fig 4c drain lines trend east west just north of the northeast southwest oriented waterway and just south of the waterway the drain lines trend north south in the far southwestern portion of the field drain lines trend north south while in the far southcentral and southeast portions of the field drain lines trend east west fig 4c this site had previously been visited several times to conduct uav surveys but without much success in delineating drainage pipes on april 17 2019 better results were achieved at this time the vis c imagery and especially ms imagery depicted drain lines but tir imagery did not in fig 10 the tir enlarged inset fig 10a shows only north south linear features associated with field operations the vis c fig 10b enlarged inset has subtle indications of the north south drain lines south of the waterway the enlarged insets for the ms false cir fig 10c and ms red edge fig 10d both clearly show north south linear features representative of drain lines just south of the waterway the enlarged insets for the false cir and red edge imagery also show subtle east west linear features representing drain lines just north of the waterway therefore at this particular site with respect to drainage pipe detection ms imagery was by far the best followed next by vis c while tir did not seem to work well at all the example ross co 1 uav vis c ms and tir surveys were carried out on april 11 2019 and results are presented in fig 11 at the time these uav surveys were carried out the soil was very dry 0 1 cm of rainfall within the previous week and although there were some bare patches of ground present most of the field was covered by well established wheat table 2 essentially all the drain lines in this field trend northwest southeast fig 4e inspection of enlarged field area insets in fig 11 show only a very subtle drainage pipe response for the tir imagery a much more pronounced drainage pipe response for the vis c imagery thin darker green lines trending northwest southeast and an extremely clear drainage pipe response for the normalized difference vegetation index ndvi orthomosasic map based on ms red and nir imagery therefore when a crop has become better established or is healthier directly over the drain lines then uav drainage mapping surveys can be successfully conducted during the growing season in which case vis c or ms plant establishment health index products like ndvi may work quite well locating the drainage pipes the hardin co n s uav site surveys were carried out on april 24 2019 and covered the complete field areas both north and south of the east west trending waterway while the previously described hardin co n uav surveys focused just on the field area north of the waterway at the time the hardin co n s uav site surveys were conducted the soil was somewhat moist 4 2 cm of rainfall in the previous week and there was a significant amount of bare ground across the site table 2 the north field area was tilled and had soybean residue present while the south field area had corn stubble along with established cover crops cereal rye crimson clover and oats table 2 the subsurface drainage map for the north field area is provided in fig 4b there was no subsurface drainage map available for the south field area the results presented in fig 12 are an example where the combination of ms and tir imagery provide better insight on drain line patterns than either ms or tir imagery alone the tir orthomosaic fig 12a worked better overall than ms nir fig 12b or the ms red edge fig 12c at mapping drain line locations in the north field area in particular within the north field area the previously described gullies do not obscure drain lines in the tir orthomosaic nearly to the degree that they are obscured in the nir or red edge orthomosaics again in the north field area the gullies have a dendritic pattern of high tir emission lighter shading and low ms reflectance darker shading conversely within the red circled portion of the south field area north south trending drain lines are more clearly depicted by the nir and red edge orthomosaics than they are with the tir orthomosaic a false color composite orthomosaic that combined tir nir and red edge is shown in fig 12d in this false color composite orthomosaic red edge imagery was assigned shades of blue tir imagery was assigned shades of green and nir imagery was assigned shades of red the enlarged field area insets of the northwest corner of the north field area show that the false color composite orthomosaic depict drain lines better overall than the tir nir or red edge orthomosaics alone fig 12 the tir inset shows the drain lines crossing through the gully while the nir and red edge orthomosaics do not although not depicted within the tir inset the nir and red edge insets clearly show a set of drain lines that make a tight 90 degree turn from north south to east west the false color composite inset comprised of tir nir and red edge show both drain lines crossing the gully and the set of drain lines that make a 90 degree turn however it should be noted this false color composite did not show the north south drain lines within the red circled portion of the south field area consequently hardin co n s uav site surveys indicate that some combination of vis c ms and tir imagery may in some cases provide better insight on drain line patterns than vis c ms or tir alone williamson et al 2019 at a field site near harlan indiana also found more than one type of imagery tir and ms to be complementary for determining drain line locations furthermore ms and tir imagery can be combined into false color orthomosaic products that in some instances provide an improved depiction of drainage patterns the results presented in figs 6 12 from five sets of uav site surveys have some important implications mentioned as follows thermal infrared imagery does not always work best at locating drainage pipe sometimes either vis c or ms imagery provides better insight on drain line patterns there will also be sites where a combination of imagery provides more information on the subsurface drainage system present than vis c alone ms alone or tir alone therefore the key finding from these results is that the best approach at any site is to conduct uav surveys to obtain all three types of imagery vis c ms and tir furthermore even if the vis c imagery does not detect drainage pipes this imagery is still valuable for providing topographic information that can be used by drainage contractors to repair or retrofit existing subsurface drainage systems in addition uav surveys can be employed not only outside the growing season but also during the growing season to map drain lines 3 3 timing of uav surveys relative to recent rainfall can in some cases strongly impact drainage pipe detection results as stated before the recommendation for successful mapping of subsurface drainage outside the growing season is to conduct aerial surveys two to three days after a rainfall event of 2 5 cm or greater naz et al 2009 the morrow co and hardin co n uav site surveys previously described plainly indicate that strict adherence to this recommendation is not always required in order to locate buried drainage pipes at both sites soil conditions were dry since there had been very little rainfall prior to conducting the uav surveys 1 2 cm of rainfall at morrow co site in previous ten days 1 1 cm of rainfall at the hardin co site in previous ten days however tir imagery figs 6a and 8 a clearly show the complex subsurface drainage pattern present at these two sites at this time the reason is unclear as to why the tir imagery at these two sites was able to detect drainage pipes under dry soil conditions therefore depending on the site there may be a much more extensive range of soil wetness dryness conditions than initially thought where uav surveys can be successfully employed to map subsurface drainage systems however during this study there were examples where the timing of the uav surveys relative to recent rainfall had an important impact regarding drainage pipe detection the results depicted in fig 13 for the seneca co site demonstrate that conducting uav surveys too soon after a large rainfall event may not allow sufficient time for the soil to drain directly over the drain lines thereby preventing detection of drainage pipe locations site soil surface conditions were wet with extensive bare ground and some soybean residue table 2 there was substantial rainfall 4 2 cm the night before the seneca co uav surveys were conducted as shown the orthomosaic from the vis c survey carried out at 10 30 the next morning did not reveal the presence of drain lines fig 13a while the vis c orthomosaic from approximately seven hours later clearly depicts the complex drain line pattern within the field fig 13b in just seven hours from morning to afternoon the soil directly over the drain lines had sufficiently drained and dried for the subsurface drainage system pattern to become readily apparent on vis c imagery results from somewhat different circumstances are exhibited in fig 14 at the time the clay co ia uav site surveys were conducted there was a limited amount of bare ground across the site table 2 corn stubble with early establishment of soybeans was present in the east part of the field and soybean stubble with early establishment of corn was present in the west part of the field table 2 the soil was dry during the june 13 2018 uav surveys and due to a 4 2 cm rainfall on june 14 the soil was very wet the following day june 15 during the second set of uav surveys table 2 the subsurface drainage map for the clay co ia site is provided in fig 4d with dry soil conditions prior to the large rainfall event drain lines are not evident in the tir orthomosaic fig 14a one day after the 4 2 cm rainfall the drain line pattern shown in the tir orthomosaic is unmistakable compare fig 4d with fig 14b note even the seneca co second vis c survey and clay co ia 2 tir site surveys did not completely follow uav timing recommendations concerning rainfall since each of these uav surveys were carried out one day after a large rainfall greater than 2 5 cm instead of two to three days after the rainfall it is certainly evident from the results presented in figs 13 and 14 that the timing of uav surveys relative to rainfall can be very important in regard to drainage pipe detection however the recommendation to only conduct uav surveys outside the growing season and two to three days after a large rainfall event while possibly ideal may be far too restrictive 3 4 distinguishing linear features in uav imagery that are due to drain lines from linear features produced by farm field operations linear features representing drain lines and annual farm field operations can be confused with one another and are often both depicted on site aerial imagery a significant proportion of the linear features related to farm field operations could be due to wheel tracks from either harvest tillage fertilizer or planting equipment the stalks and chaff expelled deposited behind combine harvesters may also produce linear features compacted soil wheel tracks and wide bands of crop residue may have different soil water content temperature or emissivity characteristics compared to the ground surface where these features are absent thereby causing the wheel tracks or crop residue bands to show up on vis ms and tir imagery for the uav imagery obtained in our study differentiating drain line linear features from farm field operation linear features is critical and this problem is emphasized in fig 15 showing the tir orthomosaic from the ross co 2 uav site survey this survey was conducted on august 23 2018 well after wheat harvest the soil was fairly wet and there were extensive amounts of bare ground with substantial wheat stubble across the field site table 2 at first glance the east west lighter shaded linear features shown in the fig 15 tir orthomosaic would appear to represent drain lines however the enlarged inset from the southwest corner of the field show that the tir linear features have edge of field u shaped turn around lines connecting one east west linear feature to another a configuration with edge of field turn arounds connecting linear features indicates that these linear features are due to field operations and not drain lines the following is a list of considerations that were employed with the uav imagery in this study to distinguish drainage pipe linear features from linear features produced from farm field operations 1 linear features that have a herringbone pattern as shown in fig 1b or a random pattern as shown in fig 1c are almost without doubt representative of a subsurface drainage system 2 harvest tillage fertilizer application and or planting operations especially in fields that have a somewhat elongated rectangular shape often have at least one path that follows the perimeter of the field and in addition a set of parallel straight line paths within the field to provide complete coverage for the operation the parallel set of paths within the field are commonly oriented with the long axis of the field conducting field operations in this manner is more efficient by reducing the number of edge of field turn arounds consequently linear features that follow this general pattern are likely the result of annual farm field operations 3 any edge of field turn arounds that connect linear features as is depicted in fig 15 are a sure sign that these linear features are due to farm field operations 4 drain lines are usually entirely straight so a set of linear features that have a wavy appearance may be the result of field operations 5 the spacing distance between drainage pipe laterals in older subsurface drainage systems averaged around 15 18 m 50 60 ft while for newer systems or a retrofit of an existing system the drain line spacing distance may be as small as 7 5 9 m 25 30 ft if a set of parallel linear features have a spacing distance substantially less than 7 5 m then these linear features more generally do not represent drain lines commonly when two sets of linear features are found superimposed on one another the one most likely associated with a set of drain lines is the one exhibiting the greatest spacing distance between adjacent lines 6 to improve soil water removal functionality drainage contractors often install drain lines at a 30 to 45 degree angle to the predominant orientation of the farm field operations therefore linear features that cross the field in a manner diagonal to field boundaries are probably characteristic of drain lines 7 linear features that continually show up at the same exact locations in aerial satellite imagery obtained at different times particularly over a number of years likely represent drain lines a sound approach for mapping drainage system patterns is to review of all available historical aerial satellite imagery from a site in conjunction with the more recent imagery obtained by the uav survey for the few uav site surveys in this research where drain line maps or any knowledge of the subsurface drainage system were unavailable these considerations proved useful differentiating drainage pipe responses from linear features produced from farm field operations the uav tir orthomosaics from the ross co 3 and defiance co site surveys are shown in fig 16 on dec 14 2018 when the ross co 3 uav surveys were carried out the soil was relatively dry and there were extensive amounts of bare ground with substantial soybean residue across the field site table 2 on may 8 2018 when the defiance co uav surveys were carried out the soil was dry and there were extensive amounts of bare ground with substantial crop residue across the field site table 2 throughout the field areas of both sites there seem to be two superimposed sets of linear features one likely from drain lines and one probably belonging to farm field operations in two parts of the field area at each site the previously listed considerations particularly as related to spacing distance and trends relative to field boundaries were employed to interpret drain line orientation solid yellow lines versus the orientation of linear features due to farm field operations dashed yellow lines the farmer land owner and a partial drainage map fig 4f found after the uav survey confirm the interpretations made for the ross co 3 site at the defiance co site these interpretations were verified as accurate by the farmer drainage contractor land owner consequently where the origin of linear features present in uav imagery is initially unclear knowledge of subsurface drainage system installation and farm field operations can be utilized to distinguish those representing drain lines versus those due to harvest tillage fertilizer and or planting efforts as a final note the 29 uav site surveys in this study covered a range of soil types common throughout the midwest u s a loamy fine sand to clay see table 2 different seasons of year fall winter spring and summer wet to dry soils and varied surface characteristics related to bare ground presence of crop residue existence of cover crops and corn soybean wheat establishment somewhat surprisingly given this wide array of site conditions uav vis c ms and tir imagery worked quite well overall at mapping agricultural subsurface drainage systems even if this technology is not successful at a particular site for finding drainage pipes it is still useful for the topographic information it can provide which in and of itself is valuable to drainage contractors installing or retrofitting subsurface drainage systems or for gaining insight on surface runoff attributes 3 5 future work the next major step planned for this research program is to develop specific guidelines as to when and where this uav technology can be best employed to map agricultural subsurface drainage systems to develop these guidelines additional uav vis c ms and tir surveys are planned at six farm field sites in indiana michigan and ohio specifically chosen so that there will be a wide range of soil types across the six sites each site is planned to be visited eight times over a two year period with this approach the range of site conditions soil type time of day within or outside of growing season soil wetness dryness and ground surface characteristics under which a particular type of imagery vis c ms or tir is effective at mapping drain lines can be determined all of this information can then be utilized to produce guidelines in the form of a decision tree or matrix that can used by farmers and drainage contractors to decide what type of imagery vis c ms or tir will work best for drainage mapping and when would be the best time to carry out such a uav survey to gain better insight on the ground surface thermal infrared emission response in farm fields soil temperature and emissivity measurements are planned to be obtained over time daily and yearly in a set of small test plots with variable soil types wetness dryness and surface cover i e bare ground crop residue etc furthermore advanced processing techniques can be evaluated to more clearly depict drain line responses in uav vis c ms and tir imagery in particular this advanced processing may include first stacking all the imagery bands and then conducting a decorrelation stretch minimum noise fraction transform or principal component transform on the multi band image for the purpose of suppressing noise components and thereby enhancing the drainage pipe response supervised machine learning algorithms may also be developed and employed to analyze uav imagery and automatically differentiate drain line responses from linear features produced from farm field operations 4 summary there are strong economic and environmental motivations for finding effective efficient and non destructive methods to map agricultural subsurface drainage systems the use of unmanned aerial vehicles uavs with visible color vis c multispectral ms and thermal infrared tir cameras may provide the solution to the drainage mapping problem this technology was tested at 29 different field sites in the midwest u s a states of indiana iowa michigan and ohio the uav vis c imagery detected at least some drain lines at 48 of the sites 15 out of 29 ms imagery detected drain lines at 59 of the sites 15 out of 29 and tir imagery detected drain lines at 69 of the sites 20 out of 29 three key findings regarding uav drainage pipe mapping were extracted from the overall results 1 although tir was effective at more of the sites there were individual sites where vis c and or ms worked better than tir for mapping subsurface drainage systems consequently to ensure the greatest chance for successfully determining drainage pipe patterns in a field uav surveys need to be carried out with all three types of cameras vis c ms and tir 2 the timing of uav surveys relative to rainfall can be critical regarding drainage pipe detection however the recommendation to only conduct uav surveys outside the growing season and two to three days after a large rainfall event while possibly ideal may be far too restrictive somewhat surprisingly there were examples in this study where the uav surveys identified drain lines even when there was an established crop in place or when the soil was very dry 3 where the origin of linear features present in uav imagery is initially unclear knowledge of subsurface drainage system installation and farm field operations can be utilized to distinguish linear features representing drain lines versus the linear features due to harvest tillage fertilizer and or planting efforts aside from these three key findings even if this technology is not successful at a particular site for finding drainage pipes it is still useful for the topographic information it can provide which in and of itself is valuable to drainage contractors installing or retrofitting subsurface drainage systems or for gaining insight on surface runoff attributes the overall results and extracted key findings from this study clearly indicate that vis c ms and tir imagery obtained with uavs have significant potential for use in mapping agricultural drainage pipe systems future work is planned to primarily focus on six indiana michigan and ohio farm field sites each of which is planned to be visited at eight times over a two year period for subsurface drainage mapping with uav vis c ms and tir cameras with this approach the range of site conditions soil type time of year wetness dryness and surface characteristics under which a particular type of imagery vis c ms or tir is effective at mapping drain lines can be determined these results can then be employed to develop specific guidelines on the use of uav vis c ms and tir

pdmix800 macro in sas saxton 1998 3 results and discussion 3 1 climate and irrigation in season precipitation varied greatly among study years ranging from near record precipitation early in the season followed by prolonged drought conditions to early season drought conditions followed by well above average precipitation late in the growing season tables 1 and 2 fluctuations in seasonal variability is the norm within the trp although recorded precipitation was above average in three out of six years high seasonal variability was typically due to significant recorded events in one or two months rather than even distribution throughout the growing season above average precipitation was recorded during may prior to planting in four of six years which should have resulted in adequate stored soil moisture for early season production significant precipitation events occurred in july 2013 and 2014 near flowering which delayed irrigation initiation for low and medium treatments although rainfall was 5 fold greater in may 2015 than the historical average conditions resulted in a late planting date and below normal precipitation throughout the remainder of the growing season lint yield for each year is presented in fig 1 lint yields were greater in 2013 whereas no differences occurred among 2014 2016 and 2017 seasonal irrigation ranged from 127 to 400 mm during the 6 year study mean irrigation water applied during the growing season was 175 mm for low 220 mm for med and 292 mm for high irrigation treatments total in season water was 341 mm for low 386 mm for med and 458 mm for high table 1 in comparison wanjura et al 2002 found that an irrigation input of 580 mm or total water application of 740 mm was estimated to produce maximum lint yield in the texas southern high plains total in season water was numerically higher in 2017 due to 216 mm precipitation from 14 to 28 august followed by four additional days of irrigation in early september 3 2 irrigation timing and quantity irrigation treatments significantly affected lint yield p 0 0895 and irrigation water use efficiency iwue p 0 0017 table 3 cotton lint yield was 1337 kg ha 1 for the low treatment and 1511 kg ha 1 for the high treatment fig 2 a the high treatment resulted in greater lint yield than low but not med fig 2a applied irrigation water for high was 33 greater than med while med only reduced lint yields by 7 which is not significant wanjura et al 1996 found that delaying irrigation until squaring reduced the amount of irrigation by 30 while yield was increased by 8 schaefer et al 2018 concluded that early season irrigation deficits can be compensated for later in the growing season which allows for high boll retention throughout the plant they also concluded that irrigation deficit during the primary reproductive development or early flowering period has the most detrimental effect on both boll distribution and yield snowden et al 2014 determined that the early flowering growth stage of cotton was the most sensitive to drought stress in our study a higher irrigation rate med compensated for lack of early season irrigation and more closely met existing et conditions than a lower rate low on average 117 mm of irrigation water was applied with high prior to initiation of low or med initiating a greater irrigation rate at flowering was not different than applying irrigation early in the season to bank moisture irrigation early in the growing season to build up water in the soil profile and reduce late season water stress has shown to be an ineffective strategy using low energy precision application irrigation on clay loam soils of the texas southern high plains bordovsky et al 2015 within this environment irrigation quantity needs to be available during the period of cotton maturation to achieve the maximum benefit of applied irrigation and rainfall that occurs earlier in the cotton growing season bordovsky et al 2015 meeks et al 2017 found that pre bloom irrigation events can be lowered without impacting yield though episodic drought during flowering substantially reduces yield irrigation methods may also affect the efficiency of early season irrigation applications bordovsky et al 2015 indicated that irrigation evaporative losses could be eliminated by sdi systems which was hypothesized to be a major contributing factor to reductions in seasonal irrigation water use efficiency under low energy precise application irrigation reduced evaporative losses of irrigation water early in the season within the sdi system could partly explain lint yield differences observed between low and high treatments although high resulted in 12 significantly greater lint yields than low irrigation water applied was 67 greater for high compared to low a study conducted in israel reported that cotton yields were reduced due to excessive vegetative growth prior to peak blooming plaut et al 1988 wanjura et al 1996 concluded that delaying irrigation until squaring slightly decreasing early vegetative growth and proved beneficial for lint production when a pre plant irrigation was applied and subsequent in season irrigation was sufficient irrigation water use efficiency defined as kg lint produced per mm of irrigation water applied was significantly greater for low compared to all other treatments and iwue of med was significantly greater than high fig 2b lint produced per mm of irrigation water applied for low was 18 greater than med and 35 greater than high thus irrigating early in the season to build soil water in the profile reduced irrigation water efficiency compared to applying irrigation water at critical growth stages later in the year previous research has also shown that iwue tends to decrease as irrigation water increases in the texas high plains bordovsky et al 2011 and the trp delaune et al 2012 attia et al 2016 in southern arizona steger et al 1998 reported a pattern of decreased yield with increasing early season water stress and recommended irrigation timing should be based on plant or soil water status rather than date after planting using the simulation model gossym baumhardt et al 2009 found that with 100 field capacity water storage water use efficiency tended to decline because of diminishing marginal increases in lint yield with increased irrigation in contrast increasing irrigation rate from 2 5 mm d 1 to 3 75 or 5 0 mm d 1 increased lint yield and water use efficiency at 50 field capacity as recorded precipitation in may was well above average in four out of six years table 2 initial soil profile moisture conditions at planting were generally favorable resulting in marginal increases in lint yield with increasing irrigation when considering both lint yield and water usage low would be an acceptable alternative approach to early season watering 3 3 tillage lint yield p 0 0307 and iwue p 0 0090 were significantly affected by tillage but not the interaction of tillage and irrigation table 3 lint yields ranged from 1350 kg ha 1 for ct to 1484 kg ha 1 for nt w fig 3 a no till with a terminated wheat cover crop nt w resulted in significantly greater lint yields than st and ct fig 3a furthermore nt significantly improved lint yields compared to ct fig 3a pittelkow et al 2015 conducted a global meta analysis and showed that mean cotton yields remained similar under no till relative to conventional till practices a small grain cover crop did not hinder lint yields but increased lint yields by 7 over st and 9 over ct fig 3a this contrasts with results of delaune et al 2012 who reported tillage did not affect lint yields at the same study location however delaune et al 2012 results were observed during the transition phase from conventional tillage to conservation tillage 2008 2010 triplett and dick 2008 reported that the benefits of nt may not be realized for at least three years results from the current study were observed for years five to eleven of the tillage system indicating the benefit of a long term conservation tillage system when considering the long term impacts of no till pittelkow et al 2015 anticipated that yields would increase relative to ct in 10 years in contrast lewis et al 2018a reported that cotton lint yields were significantly greater for ct than nt with a terminated rye cover crop in two of three years in an established 15 year tillage system within the texas southern high plains however this reduction in yield could potentially be linked to greater root knot nematodes meloidogyne spp within nt with a rye cover crop compared to ct lewis et al 2018b in addition to increased lint yield nt w also significantly increased iwue compared with st and ct fig 3b similar to tillage effects on lint yield statistical differences mirrored tillage effects on iwue irrigation water use efficiency for nt was not significantly different than st and nt w but was significantly greater than ct no significant differences for iwue were observed between ct and st over a six year average iwue was 11 greater for nt w and 9 greater for nt compared with ct baumhardt et al 2013 reported that disc tilled cotton lint yields irrigated at 5 mm d 1 were typically less than nt and stubble mulch tillage cotton irrigated at 2 5 mm d 1 higher lint yield associated with nt were attributed to reduced evaporation and greater infiltration with nt residue from previous wheat cover crops continuous cotton systems return little residue to the soil surface boquet et al 2004 nouri et al 2019 hence implementing a cover crop could enhance soil function of nt research has shown that a wheat or rye cover crop significantly improved water infiltration early in the growing season of continuous cotton systems in the southern great plains delaune et al 2016 delaune et al 2019 nouri et al 2019 reported that improved soil physical quality under nt and cover crops was related to greater lint yield in nt than ct while soil water use by cover crops is a concern particularly for dryland environments long term 2001 2015 simulations using the dssat model by adhikari et al 2017 indicated that there was no substantial reduction in average seed cotton yield or soil water using winter wheat as a cover crop in dryland continuous cotton systems of the trp under sdi a wheat cover crop not only improved lint yields but has also improved net returns over ct delaune et al 2012 4 conclusions over a 6 yr period delaying irrigation until critical cotton growth stages as compared to banking water through pre season or early season irrigation reduced irrigation applications while not significantly reducing lint yields applying excess water early in the growing season should not be considered a best management practice with regard to water conservation although high irrigation increased lint yields by 12 over the low treatment 67 more water was required irrigation at a higher rate at flowering med resulted in similar yields as applying irrigation early in the season high lint yields were also increased by nt with and without a cover crop compared to ct implementing a wheat cover crop improved the nt system resulting in significantly greater lint yields and iwue than st and ct optimizing irrigation timing and implementing conservation tillage increased the amount of lint produced per quantity of irrigation water applied if well capacity is a concern and irrigation water is limited applying irrigation at critical growth stages provides the greatest irrigation water value conventional tillage resulted in significantly lower lint yields and iwue than nt and nt w thus nt systems should be considered for sustainable cotton production over the long term declaration

study least square means were calculated and means separation were considered significantly different for tested p values p 0 05 or 0 1 mean separation and letter groupings was produced by using the pdmix800 macro in sas saxton 1998 3 results and discussion 3 1 climate and irrigation in season precipitation varied greatly among study years ranging from near record precipitation early in the season followed by prolonged drought conditions to early season drought conditions followed by well above average precipitation late in the growing season tables 1 and 2 fluctuations in seasonal variability is the norm within the trp although recorded precipitation was above average in three out of six years high seasonal variability was typically due to significant recorded events in one or two months rather than even distribution throughout the growing season above average precipitation was recorded during may prior to planting in four of six years which should have resulted in adequate stored soil moisture for early season production significant precipitation events occurred in july 2013 and 2014 near flowering which delayed irrigation initiation for low and medium treatments although rainfall was 5 fold greater in may 2015 than the historical average conditions resulted in a late planting date and below normal precipitation throughout the remainder of the growing season lint yield for each year is presented in fig 1 lint yields were greater in 2013 whereas no differences occurred among 2014 2016 and 2017 seasonal irrigation ranged from 127 to 400 mm during the 6 year study mean irrigation water applied during the growing season was 175 mm for low 220 mm for med and 292 mm for high irrigation treatments total in season water was 341 mm for low 386 mm for med and 458 mm for high table 1 in comparison wanjura et al 2002 found that an irrigation input of 580 mm or total water application of 740 mm was estimated to produce maximum lint yield in the texas southern high plains total in season water was numerically higher in 2017 due to 216 mm precipitation from 14 to 28 august followed by four additional days of irrigation in early september 3 2 irrigation timing and quantity irrigation treatments significantly affected lint yield p 0 0895 and irrigation water use efficiency iwue p 0 0017 table 3 cotton lint yield was 1337 kg ha 1 for the low treatment and 1511 kg ha 1 for the high treatment fig 2 a the high treatment resulted in greater lint yield than low but not med fig 2a applied irrigation water for high was 33 greater than med while med only reduced lint yields by 7 which is not significant wanjura et al 1996 found that delaying irrigation until squaring reduced the amount of irrigation by 30 while yield was increased by 8 schaefer et al 2018 concluded that early season irrigation deficits can be compensated for later in the growing season which allows for high boll retention throughout the plant they also concluded that irrigation deficit during the primary reproductive development or early flowering period has the most detrimental effect on both boll distribution and yield snowden et al 2014 determined that the early flowering growth stage of cotton was the most sensitive to drought stress in our study a higher irrigation rate med compensated for lack of early season irrigation and more closely met existing et conditions than a lower rate low on average 117 mm of irrigation water was applied with high prior to initiation of low or med initiating a greater irrigation rate at flowering was not different than applying irrigation early in the season to bank moisture irrigation early in the growing season to build up water in the soil profile and reduce late season water stress has shown to be an ineffective strategy using low energy precision application irrigation on clay loam soils of the texas southern high plains bordovsky et al 2015 within this environment irrigation quantity needs to be available during the period of cotton maturation to achieve the maximum benefit of applied irrigation and rainfall that occurs earlier in the cotton growing season bordovsky et al 2015 meeks et al 2017 found that pre bloom irrigation events can be lowered without impacting yield though episodic drought during flowering substantially reduces yield irrigation methods may also affect the efficiency of early season irrigation applications bordovsky et al 2015 indicated that irrigation evaporative losses could be eliminated by sdi systems which was hypothesized to be a major contributing factor to reductions in seasonal irrigation water use efficiency under low energy precise application irrigation reduced evaporative losses of irrigation water early in the season within the sdi system could partly explain lint yield differences observed between low and high treatments although high resulted in 12 significantly greater lint yields than low irrigation water applied was 67 greater for high compared to low a study conducted in israel reported that cotton yields were reduced due to excessive vegetative growth prior to peak blooming plaut et al 1988 wanjura et al 1996 concluded that delaying irrigation until squaring slightly decreasing early vegetative growth and proved beneficial for lint production when a pre plant irrigation was applied and subsequent in season irrigation was sufficient irrigation water use efficiency defined as kg lint produced per mm of irrigation water applied was significantly greater for low compared to all other treatments and iwue of med was significantly greater than high fig 2b lint produced per mm of irrigation water applied for low was 18 greater than med and 35 greater than high thus irrigating early in the season to build soil water in the profile reduced irrigation water efficiency compared to applying irrigation water at critical growth stages later in the year previous research has also shown that iwue tends to decrease as irrigation water increases in the texas high plains bordovsky et al 2011 and the trp delaune et al 2012 attia et al 2016 in southern arizona steger et al 1998 reported a pattern of decreased yield with increasing early season water stress and recommended irrigation timing should be based on plant or soil water status rather than date after planting using the simulation model gossym baumhardt et al 2009 found that with 100 field capacity water storage water use efficiency tended to decline because of diminishing marginal increases in lint yield with increased irrigation in contrast increasing irrigation rate from 2 5 mm d 1 to 3 75 or 5 0 mm d 1 increased lint yield and water use efficiency at 50 field capacity as recorded precipitation in may was well above average in four out of six years table 2 initial soil profile moisture conditions at planting were generally favorable resulting in marginal increases in lint yield with increasing irrigation when considering both lint yield and water usage low would be an acceptable alternative approach to early season watering 3 3 tillage lint yield p 0 0307 and iwue p 0 0090 were significantly affected by tillage but not the interaction of tillage and irrigation table 3 lint yields ranged from 1350 kg ha 1 for ct to 1484 kg ha 1 for nt w fig 3 a no till with a terminated wheat cover crop nt w resulted in significantly greater lint yields than st and ct fig 3a furthermore nt significantly improved lint yields compared to ct fig 3a pittelkow et al 2015 conducted a global meta analysis and showed that mean cotton yields remained similar under no till relative to conventional till practices a small grain cover crop did not hinder lint yields but increased lint yields by 7 over st and 9 over ct fig 3a this contrasts with results of delaune et al 2012 who reported tillage did not affect lint yields at the same study location however delaune et al 2012 results were observed during the transition phase from conventional tillage to conservation tillage 2008 2010 triplett and dick 2008 reported that the benefits of nt may not be realized for at least three years results from the current study were observed for years five to eleven of the tillage system indicating the benefit of a long term conservation tillage system when considering the long term impacts of no till pittelkow et al 2015 anticipated that yields would increase relative to ct in 10 years in contrast lewis et al 2018a reported that cotton lint yields were significantly greater for ct than nt with a terminated rye cover crop in two of three years in an established 15 year tillage system within the texas southern high plains however this reduction in yield could potentially be linked to greater root knot nematodes meloidogyne spp within nt with a rye cover crop compared to ct lewis et al 2018b in addition to increased lint yield nt w also significantly increased iwue compared with st and ct fig 3b similar to tillage effects on lint yield statistical differences mirrored tillage effects on iwue irrigation water use efficiency for nt was not significantly different than st and nt w but was significantly greater than ct no significant differences for iwue were observed between ct and st over a six year average iwue was 11 greater for nt w and 9 greater for nt compared with ct baumhardt et al 2013 reported that disc tilled cotton lint yields irrigated at 5 mm d 1 were typically less than nt and stubble mulch tillage cotton irrigated at 2 5 mm d 1 higher lint yield associated with nt were attributed to reduced evaporation and greater infiltration with nt residue from previous wheat cover crops continuous cotton systems return little residue to the soil surface boquet et al 2004 nouri et al 2019 hence implementing a cover crop could enhance soil function of nt research has shown that a wheat or rye cover crop significantly improved water infiltration early in the growing season of continuous cotton systems in the southern great plains delaune et al 2016 delaune et al 2019 nouri et al 2019 reported that improved soil physical quality under nt and cover crops was related to greater lint yield in nt than ct while soil water use by cover crops is a concern particularly for dryland environments long term 2001 2015 simulations using the dssat model by adhikari et al 2017 indicated that there was no substantial reduction in average seed cotton yield or soil water using winter wheat as a cover crop in dryland continuous cotton systems of the trp under sdi a wheat cover crop not only improved lint yields but has also improved net returns over ct delaune et al 2012 4 conclusions over a 6 yr period delaying irrigation until critical cotton growth stages as compared to banking water through pre season or early season irrigation reduced irrigation applications while not significantly reducing lint yields applying excess water early in the growing season should not be considered a best management practice with regard to water conservation although high irrigation increased lint yields by 12 over the low treatment 67 more water was required irrigation at a higher rate at flowering med resulted in similar yields as applying irrigation early in the season high lint yields were also increased by nt with and without a cover crop compared to ct implementing a wheat cover crop improved the nt system resulting in significantly greater lint yields and iwue than st and ct optimizing irrigation timing and implementing conservation tillage increased the amount of lint produced per quantity of irrigation water applied if well capacity is a concern and irrigation water is limited applying irrigation at critical growth stages provides the greatest irrigation water value conventional tillage resulted in significantly lower lint yields and iwue than nt and nt w thus nt systems should be considered for sustainable cotton production over the long term declaration

10689,owing to contradicted scientific results trends in drought due to global warming have been assigned with medium confidence drought will likely continue inputting immense pressure on food security in fragile ecosystems like sub saharan africa ssa as an adaptation measure to severe drought events since the 1980s the overall goal of irrigated schemes foreign exchange earnings thus has been shifted to sustain food security this study assessed the impacts of such drought driven agricultural policy and future climate change on the performance of large irrigated schemes in ssa with special emphasis on the gezira scheme gs 0 88 mha sudan the optimized scenario of the baseline period developed in gams the general algebraic modeling system showed that the expansion of food crops on the expensive of cash crops resulted in a reduction of 83 in gross net benefits and loss of 63 in irrigation water in the gs since the severe drought of 1984 the biased corrected rainfall and temperature outputs of three randomly selected regional climate models rcms under unmitigated pathways rcp 8 5 suggested increased rainfall of 40 mm increased temperature of 3 3 c and 5 increase in reference evapotranspiration for the period 2040 2070 compared to the baseline 1960 1990 the predicted conditions experienced neither extreme drought nor extreme wet events however severe and moderately drought events remain a challenge up to 2060 due to climate change and current water management practices the fao aquacrop predicted reductions in crop yields and water productivity especially for cotton and sorghum of 40 and 29 respectively optimized future crop scenarios indicate that food crops such as sorghum and wheat are not viable cash cotton and soil fertility maintenance crops groundnuts would be better for sustaining economic viability the agricultural policy and water management practices thus should be revisited to keep pace with future climate changes keywords regional climate models optimization aquacrop eastern africa region 1 introduction trends in global drought due to global warming is a controversial scientific debate while studies like sheffield et al 2012 questioned the increasing trend in the global drought area the opposite holds for others dai et al 2004 trenberth 2011 hence trends in drought have been assigned with low confidence by the intergovernmental panel on climate change ipcc 2013 which has been updated recently to medium confidence by ipcc 2019 however based on the stationarity theorem drought events will keep putting immense pressure upon development in general and food security in particular for some fragile regions like ssa benson and clay 1994 hulme 2001 nicholson 2000 philip et al 2018 rejeskhar et al 2015 ipcc 2019 drought undeniably alters the land surface interactions energy and water partitioning offsetting the whole transfer processes to the atmospheric boundary layer chiel et al 2010 wu et al 2015 the question that why drought happens remains an open research area wang and eltahir 2000 simulated that a change of 20 in land covers has resulted in persistent droughts conditions supporting the finding of xu et al 2004 that changes in land cover drove reductions in rainfall in ssa the study of charney et al 1977 indicated that the low amount of rainfall has increased the evapotranspiration in semi arid regions synoptically drought mostly generates a vicious circle of poverty in natural resources especially water resources however little studies have reported on the drought impacts compared to the surfeit literature on drought detection and its driving forces in ssa in general and the eastern nile basin en egypt ethiopia sudan and south sudan in particular the ssa region is characterized by its high climate variability hwang et al 2013 the nexus between drought climate change and food security has become undeniable low 2013 estimated the annual cost of drought at 1 13 of the gross domestic product gdp in ssa moreover drought is not just low rainfall conditions limited water supply it is also impacted the water demand for example because of drought the land surface will reflect more solar energy changing the atmospheric boundary layer conditions sen roy et al 2011 modeled increases of 40 and 80 w m 2 respectively in latent and sensible heat fluxes due to dry conditions under irrigation fields which is ultimately increasing the climatic water demand i e evapotranspiration et zhang et al 2015 projected an increase of 20 in irrigation water due to future droughts in the united state of america the ipcc 2013 estimated an increase of 8 in the radiative forcing due to increased concentrations mainly carbon dioxide based on the cmip5 multi model projections under the rcp 4 5 the area that located between the equator and 30 n including sudan will experience a change of 0 20 0 35 mm day 1 in the term precipitation minus evaporation p e during the period 2016 2035 relative to the period 1986 2005 climate change drought and food security have become the major players in formulating agricultural policies in the eastern nile region the eastern nile irrigation and drainage study 2009 suggested a regional expansion of 69 in the irrigated areas with irrigation water requirements of 108 km3 yr 1 that is higher than the annual flow of the major surface water source the blue nile river 50 km3 yr 1 let alone hydropower generations and transboundary complications the independent report of blackmore and whittington 2008 stressed that any decision taken pertinent to the nile water would have profound effects on poverty development and security in the region thus irrigation water management grasps much attention especially during drought seasons globally irrigation is expected to play a major role in filling the gap in food productions de fraiture and wichelns 2010 estimated that irrigated schemes could provide 75 of the additional food supply needed by the year 2050 under the condition that crop productivity is improved however in ssa mostly the overall goal of irrigation schemes is to sustain foreign exchange earnings rather than food production inasmuch as rainfed agriculture sustains the production of food crops you 2008 however the ipcc 2007 predicted a decrease of 50 in the yield of rainfed crops due to climate change thus irrigation schemes would continue playing a substantial role in sustaining food security especially in arid and semi arid areas like sudan about 70 of sorghum the main staple food crop in sudan comes from rainfed agriculture fao 2010 this has rampantly been jeopardized because of drought farah et al 1997 hamid et al 1995 resulting in massive famine conflicts immigration this has triggered the massive cultivation of food crops into governmental irrigated schemes bearing in mind the low and fluctuated food crop prices the analysis for international food commodity prices has revealed the following characteristics of food prices miao et al 2011 slight long term decline very short term volatility large price hikes were normally followed by declines and rapid hikes were dominantly followed by prolonged and gradual declines the world bank 2000 has alarmed the decline in the economic performance of the gezira scheme sudan the largest irrigated scheme worldwide 0 88 mha mohamed et al 2011 estimated the irrigation efficiency in the gezira scheme at 22 with a low relative water supply ratio supply demand of 4 6 climate change impact studies are crucial especially where livelihood generations and food production depend on climate the general circulation models gcms provide plausible scenarios for future climatic conditions the direct use of gcms in impact studies however is limited by their coarse resolution systemic errors and disability to capture inter annual variability aich et al 2014 aloysius and saiers 2017 cannon et al 2015 giorgi et al 2009 haensler et al 2013 ipcc 2013 vetter et al 2017 wilby et al 2009 regional climate models rcms through dynamic and or statistical downscaling techniques have dismantled many of these limitations with the exception of systemic errors this calls for a further post processing step that is the bias correction trzaska and schnarr 2014 zhu and luo 2015 nikulin et al 2012 emphasized the paramount role of rcms in predicting rainfall which is the major driver for water supply and food security over africa however yet there was no broad consensus or a priori criteria upon which rcm is the best for a given area benestad et al 2017 the coordinated regional climate downscaling experiment in africa cordex africa provides good quality outputs of rcms spatial resolution of 50 km which were effectively used in simulating rainfall in varied spatial resolutions i e continental regional and catchment endris et al 2013 mutayoba and kashaigilli 2017 nikulin et al 2012 the ensemble mean is the best recommended technique for managing uncertainty in climate change aloysius and saiers 2017 aich et al 2014 giorgi et al 2009 ipcc 2013 haensler et al 2013 nawaz et al 2010 nikulin et al 2012 bearing in mind that the individual rcm can exhibit significant biases endris et al 2013 nikulin et al 2012 as a drought adaptation policy in sudan food crops have been extensively introduced into irrigated schemes at the expense of cash crops the objectives of this study were to assess the impacts of such food crops expansion in irrigated schemes due to drought and to predict the future impacts of climate change on the performance of the large irrigated schemes in ssa with special emphasis on the gezira scheme sudan 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area gezira scheme the story of large scale irrigated schemes in sudan has begun since the completion of sennar dam the blue nile river in 1925 for irrigating the gezira scheme fig 1 currently irrigation schemes provide about 50 of the country s food production the gezira scheme traverses dry and semi dry climatic zones rainfall lasts for three months june september coupled with a high evapotranspiration rate thereby irrigation is an indispensable input into sustaining agricultural productions the scheme has a large surface irrigation system of 0 15 million km in length which has been designed basically to serve a single cash crop that is cotton foreign exchange earnings under free silt conditions the canals can irrigate 25 of the command area at any point in time plusquellec 1990 other crops like sorghum groundnuts and wheat have used to be secondary i e sorghum for subsistence groundnuts for maintaining soil fertility and wheat for import substitution guvele 2002 the scheme has undergone several uprooted changes especially after the nile water agreement in 1959 that has praised sudan s share in nile water share to 18 5 km3 consequently the scheme s command area has been doubled and secondary crops have become official crops without violating the dominancy of cash crops table 1 in 2005 a water users association policy was being adopted for enabling the participation of farmers in water management and crop choices unfortunately non tangible outcomes were achieved in 2016 a newer institutional arrangement has taken place 2 2 data collection 2 2 1 climate change ensemble rainfall and temperature datasets were downloaded from the cordex africa domain the portal deploys datasets of 21 climate modeling institutes with about 20 driving models mezghani et al 2019 stated that the more the included gcms the more different behavior of climate change especially the rainfall accordingly different combinations subsamples of gcms may present different results however vano et al 2015 justified the practical need for using a small number of gcms in climate change impact studies i e reducing the computational cost as there was no guidance yet on which rcms has to be selected for a given climate change impact study lutz et al 2016 coupled with the limited computation facility in sudan the outputs of three randomly selected rcms from three modeling institutes were downloaded to encompass as much as possible a range of projected climatic change conditions the selected rcms were namely cccma canesm2 csiro mk3 and access 1 under the experiment rcp 8 5 the representative concentration pathways 8 5 w m 2 the worst climate change case for a short time slice 2040 2070 quality controlled observed datasets were collected from the climate research unit university of east anglia cru for the period 1960 1990 the cru datasets were compared with datasets of 11 meteorological stations in central sudan averaged using the thiessen polygons technique in arcmap 10 3 i e the number of stations is limited by the data availability table 2 2 3 datasets preparation rcms outputs cannot be directly used in climatic change impacts studies shamseddin and chaibi 2019 sippel et al 2016 cannon et al 2015 kurnik et al 2012 piani et al 2010a this is attributed to the large systemic errors in rcms due to the large scale variability internal variability and parametrization of the climate models themselves the removal of such systemic errors is usually carried out via the bias correction bc the hydrological climate change impact study of chen et al 2013 has shown that rcms were biased in simulating precipitation resulting in biased simulated stream discharge and all the applied bc methods have improved the rcm simulated precipitation 2 3 1 biased corrected rainfall rainfalls were bias corrected using two bc methods the quantile delta mapping qdm and the linear relationship lp that developed by piani et al 2010b the qdm generally tends to match the quantile of simulated rainfall value to the observed value at the same quantile using transformation functions cannon et al 2015 maurer and pierce 2014 kurnik et al 2012 piani et al 2010a in its most basic the qdm necessitates the generation of cumulative distribution functions cdfs of three datasets observed dataset 1960 1990 in this study rcms modeled rainfall for the historical period 1960 1990 and projected future rainfall 2040 2070 in this study the gamma distribution function gdf was used to generate the cdfs the scale and shape parameters needed in gdf were estimated using the maximum likelihood the lp bias correction is comparatively a simple method depending on plotting fitting and simplified linear transformation functions see piani et al 2010b watanabe et al 2012 2 3 2 bias corrected temperature the projected temperature were bias corrected using the delta method trzaska and schnarr 2014 1 t b c t o t p t h where t stands for temperature the subscripts bc o p and h stand for the bias corrected observed projected and historic temperature datasets 2 4 validation of predicted rainfall climate change projections represent plausible scenarios for the future with a range of assumptions the validation of those future scenarios thus remains complicated and controversial see randall et al 2007 koutsoyiannis 2006 believed that limitations in climate knowledge and observed datasets obligated much of climate change modelers to presume stationarity in time series milly et al 2008 have interpreted stationarity as the climatic variable concerned has a time invariant probability density function pdf whose properties can be estimated from the instrument record and the pdf errors are reducible by additional observations in line with this the easiest way for validating rcms outputs is to statistically test that whether or not observed and modeled precipitations follow the same chosen theoretical pdfs this was done via the kolmogorov smirnov goodness of fit test ks husak et al 2007 dosio and paruolo 2011 cannon et al 2015 the ks test reads mathematically as follows 2 d max cdfo cdfcorj the bias correction ratio bcr eq 3 was used to verify that to what extent the applied bc methods have resulted in realistic climatic change signals this ratio compares the magnitude of change in medians during the observed and modeled periods maurer and pierce 2014 the bcr 1 indicates that the bias correction reduces the model change and the vice versa is true maurer and pierce 2014 3 b c r o p e o 0 5 e m p e m 0 5 e where e stands for the early period 0 5 for the median and p for the percentile p 0 5 value of the new model median in the old model distribution 2 5 drought 2 5 1 drought detection numerous operational drought indices were developed dai et al 2004 wu et al 2005 among which the standardized precipitation index spi and the palmer drought severity index pdsi were the largely used ones the most recently developed drought index is the standardized precipitation evaporation index spei which counts for the water balance i e p et beguerıa et al 2014 sheffield et al 2009 emphasized the strong effect of the chosen drought index and time scale in scaling drought events trenberth et al 2014 attributed the contradicted results on the relationship between climate change and drought to the formulation of pdsi and datasets used in estimating evapotranspiration the spi was found to be the best index for the sahel region in general and eastern africa in particular ntale and gan 2003 the spi characterizes by its time flexibility as well as limited required inputs only rainfall hayes et al 2000 compared to pdsi and spei in this study the spi was used to detect the drought events during the rainy season in central sudan june october by simply transforming the cdfs into a standard normal random variable z i e equi probability transformation ntale and gan 2003 2 5 2 drought impacts the impacts of drought on the gezira irrigated scheme were assessed using two methods the optimization technique and the fao aquacrop model 2 5 2 1 optimization the optimization technique was developed using the gamside 24 8 3 software the objective function total revenues r reads as follows marques et al 2005 mckinney and savitsky 2003 4 r i c i a i y i j w r i j w d i j l i j subjected to land and water resources constraints 5 l a n d i a i a o 6 w a t e r i w r i j w o

available land wo is the total available water c is the crop farm gate price and y is the crop yield the actual released irrigation water wr was collected from the water management and irrigation institute university of gezira sudan provided by the ministry of irrigation and water resources the crop water requirements were estimated using the cropwat 8 0 program agricultural datasets e g cultivated areas crop farm gate prices and cost etc were derived by the gezira scheme statistical bureau 1979 2005 and omer 2005 the gross net benefits gnb were estimated using total revenues and cost t 7 g n b i n r i t i the applied irrigation depth i was calculated i as in zhang et al 2015 8 i w r a 2 5 2 2 the fao aquacrop model this model assesses the impact of climate change with the consideration of the elevated carbon dioxide level climate irrigation crop and soil files needed by the model were created to simulate crop yields under the future predicted conditions assuming no change in the current water management practices the predicted changes by the aquacrop e g crop yield were then used to generate the optimized cropping intensity under future conditions 3 results and discussion 3 1 projected rainfall and temperature 3 1 1 rainfall the selected bc methods resulted in contradicted rainfall signals relative to the projected ones agreeing with the results of several studies that reported on the rainfall in africa elshamy et al 2009 aich et al 2014 hargreaves and annan 2014 this is attributed to the complex relationship among the factors that influence rainfall as well as to the rcms configurations haensler et al 2013 the ensemble technique is very effective in improving the quality of rcms signals in africa nikulin et al 2013 according to haensler et al 2013 the robust projected climate change signal could be attained if at least 66 of the models agreed in a given direction of change in this study the ensemble mean was obtained from three rcms which were bias corrected using two bcs qdm and lp methods that is to say 3 rcms x 2 bcs 6 values per each grid fig 2 compares the projected and bias corrected rainfalls to observed ones throughout the rainy season the rcms underestimated the rainfall during the historical window relative to the baseline the historic signals of gcms represent the response to forcings e g emission scenarios without consideration of the natural variability of precipitation maurer and pierce 2014 this underestimated historic signal was not modified during the projection window 2040 2070 however the underestimated projected rainfall signal was flipped into increasing signals during the bias correction except for that of july in which the decreased signal remains valid hagemann et al 2011 attributed the differences between original and bias corrected signals to differences that the bc imparted to the projected precipitation cannon et al 2015 called that the qdm is good in preserving the projected signals compared with the quantile mapping and delta quantile mapping methods table 3 evaluates the performance of rcms in reducing or increasing the magnitude of modelled change relative to the baseline based on the bcr generally the obtained bcr values were 1 0 suggesting two main findings firstly the projected rainfalls have associated with a large variance than the baseline and secondly both bc methods qdm and lp have managed to reduce the modelled variance in rainfall accordingly the lesser the bcr value the larger the reduction in the projected variance by the bias correction the qdm and lp showed also slight differences in their bcr values a seasonal bcr value of 0 47 for the qdm and 0 44 for the lp excluding the bcr values of october which associates with odd bcr values attributed to the high number of zero rainfall events among the rcms the seasonal bcr values were 0 29 0 48 and 0 61 for cccma canesm2 csiro mk3 and access 1 respectively the csiro mk3 thus associates with showed the least variance in projected rainfalls the access 1 was the only rcm that shows bcr values greater than 1 in august which means that the modeled variance is less than the observed one and the bias correction has increased the model change the ensemble mean 3 rcms x 2 bc methods indicated an increase of 10 in the seasonal rainfall june october during the period 2040 2070 compared to the observed rainfall of 388 mm fig 3 compares the obtained ensemble mean of rainfall in central sudan with an unbiased corrected ensemble mean of 21 gcms hereafter known as the unbiased ensemble for the whole country for the period 2040 2059 under the rcp 8 5 downloaded from the world bank climate knowledge portal 2019 relative to the baseline the unbiased ensemble stated an increase of 7 in the seasonal rainfall june october compared to 9 for the bias corrected ensemble during the same period 2040 2059 thus both bias and unbiased datasets agreed in the increasing trend of rainfall in the nearest future in sudan despite that the unbiased and biased ensembles showed similar seasonal rainfall patterns with peak rainfall in august however the former projects a noticeable reduction increase in rainfall during the period july august june september and october noting that the increase outweighs the reduction on a seasonal basis this is in agreement with the general patterns of climate that stated by the ipcc 2013 that wet get wetter and dry get drier with exceptions in some dry regions which were projected to be wetter by some gcms for example the region of east africa adding that regions that warming more than the tropics as a whole tend to exhibit an increase in local precipitation ipcc 2013 3 1 2 surface air temperature surface air temperature is a key climatic element in agricultural production thornton et al 2010 called that temperature is the principal component in the crop yield variability in the eastern africa region fig 4 shows the bias corrected surface air temperature by the year 2070 an average increase of 3 3 c in the mean annual temperature is predicted relative to the baseline in central sudan warmer future conditions the unbiased ensemble mean of 21 gcms projected an increase of 2 2 and 3 2 c for the periods 2040 2059 and 2060 2079 respectively under the rcp 8 5 the range of bias corrected annual surface air temperature maximum minimum experienced a decrease of 4 due to the 2 fold increase in the minimum temperature 21 compared to the maximum temperature 10 this will massively impact the production of winter crops like wheat ultimately this increased air temperature will increase irrigation water demands since it relates the most important climatic variables in a solid physical basis allen et al 1998 the penman monteith pm has been stated to give the best estimation of reference evapotranspiration eto especially in arid and semi arid zones dehghanisanij et al 2004 however the pm requires too many inputs temperature relative humidity wind speed and sunshine which are very difficult to be available in developing countries ziese et al 2014 indicated the difficulty of using the pm in projecting future changes in eto due to climate change as yet there was no finer projected information available for its computation alternatively less inputs data eto models are recommended among which is the hargreaves model hg which requires the only temperature but with a tendency to underestimate and overestimate eto under windy and high relative humidity conditions respectively allen et al 1998 fig 5 illustrates the observed and projected eto based on pm and hg models respectively the hg underestimated the eto by 15 compared to the pm nevertheless the hg projected an increase of 5 in the eto by the year 2070 this will disturb current sowing dates water management and crop production in the gezira scheme bearing in mind that the response of eto to climate change remains a source of uncertainty wang et al 2015 3 1 3 validation the kolmogorov smirnov test ks resulted in accepting the null hypothesis that observed and bias corrected datasets come from the same distribution except for the csiro mk3 datasets of october because of its excessive projected zero rainfall events of 93 compared to 0 during the historical and baseline periods also based on the ks the bias corrected ensemble mean outperformed that of the individual rcm confirming the result of endris et al 2013 who indicated that the ensemble mean 10 rcms is better than that of the individual rcm in three sub regions in eastern africa based on the agreement with the observed datasets 3 2 drought events 3 2 1 historical drought fig 6 a presented the estimated spi in central sudan during the period 1979 2009 the results were in conformity with those detected by ayoub 1999 hulme 1987 2001 ntale and gan 2003 teklu et al 1991 zhang et al 2011 the majority of the studied seasons 68 experienced near normal conditions 0 99 spi 0 99 the remaining 32 were drought affected seasons 29 for moderately to severe drought 1 spi 1 99 and 3 for extreme drought spi 2 of a drought persistence concern drought events have lasted for one season at 56 of the studied seasons coupled with a slight increase in the drought frequency from 25 to 33 since 1979 onward 3 2 2 projected drought fig 6b demonstrates a tray of projected climatic conditions for the period 2040 2070 in central sudan based on the spi the near norm conditions are the dominant 83 of the seasons 7 for the moderate to very drought condition and 10 for the very to moderate wet conditions despite the increased annual rainfall the region shows neither extreme wet events nor extreme drought ones this result supports the finding of sheffield and wood 2008 that the severity of the drought has decreased globally meanwhile it contradicts the finding of van der chrier et al 2013 however moderate to severe drought conditions remain a challenge for central sudan especially during the period 2040 2060 with a probability of 33 3 3 assessment of drought impacts on gezira scheme the impacts of climatic change on the performance of the gezira irrigated scheme will be discussed below based on the optimization technique and fao aquacrop model 3 3 1 optimized impacts of historical drought events due to the severe drought in 1984 ayoub 1999 hulme hulme 2001 teklu et al 1991 zhang et al 2011 the governments of sudan have expanded the areas of food crops sorghum on the expensive of cash crops cotton in irrigated schemes the impact of such a drought driven policy on the performance of the gezira irrigated scheme during the historical period 1979 2005 was being assessed via the optimization technique eqs 4 7 following the severe drought of 1984 the irrigation water release has been tremendously increased fig 7 despite the decreasing trend in the cropped area except for sorghum areas table 4 this is generally coupled with decreasing trends in the crop yields except for some seasons 1997 2002 and 2005 as shown in fig 8 the resultant is very low gross net benefit 60 million us and high irrigation water consumptions of 1 35 m table 5 the former is attributed to the fluctuated and low prices of sorghum fig 9 and the later for the large miss use of water in sorghum fields due to the un attended irrigation practice ahmed et al 2002 ultimately the scheme has failed to meet the operation and maintenance cost of the surface irrigation system that has to be regularly desilted in order to maintain its efficiency bearing in mind the high silt amounts that enter the system during the rainy season see betrie et al 2011 the optimized conditions of the period 1979 2005 via the gams technique under the initial conditions that the optimized cropping intensity should include all the current four grown crops resulted in a cropping intensity of 80 10 for sorghum 25 for cotton 20 for wheat and 25 for groundnuts and gross net benefits of 350 million us therefore the massive introduction of food crops into the gezira scheme besides the mismanagement water practices that have resulted in a reduction of 83 in the net benefits and a loss of 63 in the irrigation water depth relative to the baseline see table 5 above this optimized area meets dual purposes it sustains the production of cash crops cotton and simultaneously it avails 30 of the cultivated area the production of food crops sorghum and wheat that would sustain the national food security on the other hand however the use of irrigation schemes as a drought adaptation measure prerequisites more subsidies and investment as well as an uprooted change in the agricultural policy which has been severely mistreated in ssa since the 1980s mittal 2009 3 3 2 climate change impacts the impacts of predicted climatic conditions 2040 2070 were being assessed via the fao aquacrop model assuming that the current agricultural and water management practices remain valid the predicted crop yields were 1 07 1 2 1 6 and 0 97 t ha 1 for cotton wheat groundnut and sorghum respectively overwhelmingly crop yields and water productivity experienced decreasing trends especially sorghum and cotton relative to the baseline table 6 these results agreed with the projection of müller et al 2010 who called that climate change will reduce the crop yields in sudan by 10 40 in the nearest future 2050 based on the without carbon dioxide scenario however the results contradicted the findings of adhikari et al 2015 that sorghum is a resilient crop to climate change in eight selected countries in ssa not including sudan in general the predicted increases in eto would outweigh the accrued benefits from the predicted increased rainfall amounts unless the current water management practices are improved in central sudan müller et al 2010 called that the crop yields in the tropical land could be increased via the adoption of a carbon dioxide fertilization scenario i e farmers manage to increase fertilizer inputs a further assessment step was being carried out to optimize the impact of future climatic conditions using the fao aquacrop predicted crop yields the result is an optimized cropping intensity of 57 only for cotton and groundnuts coupled with irrigation water consumption of 1 01 m and gross net benefits of 209 million us accordingly the food crops sorghum and wheat were no longer optimized for the future climatic conditions and only cash crop cotton and maintaining soil fertility crop groundnut were recommended as a response to the future climatic conditions however the current management practices shall be revisited to increase the gross net benefit 4 conclusion drought and its management as well as food security are the real challenges that face the sustainability of irrigated schemes in the ssa it is shown that the introduction of food crops into the irrigated scheme as an agricultural drought driven policy by the successive governments of sudan has managed to sustain the national food security but has failed to sustain the economic viability of the schemes inasmuch as food crops generally have shown fluctuated and low prices bearing in mind that current surface irrigation systems need a continuous silt clearance a very high cost to perform efficiently unless cash crops were grown dominantly the surface irrigation system will fail in meeting the irrigation water requirements while economic viability and food security seem to be a paradox in irrigated schemes the optimized cropped area in this study managed to meet both objectives climate change will add more cross cutting themes and further complications to the agricultural systems rcms provide future projected outputs in finer resolutions meanwhile their direct use in climate change impact studies is not recommended unless a bias correction process has taken place a priori step under the worst climate change scenario rcp 8 5 the predicted increased rainfall a decreased drought severity increased surface air temperature increased eto elevated carbon dioxide and current water management practices have aggregately decreased the crop yields coupled with increased irrigation water consumptions even under optimized conditions in the gezira scheme the current agricultural policies and water management practices thus have to be revisited in order to maintain the economic viability of the scheme bearing in mind the expected accrued benefits from the construction of the ethiopian renaissance dams e g regulation of the blue nile flow especially during the dry period november may and reduced silt amounts that have used to enter the irrigation network during the rainy season june october there is a dire need to improve also the performance of rainfed agriculture in producing food crops so as food crops do not compete with the production of cash crops in irrigated schemes declaration of competing interest this is to certify that there is no conflict of interest appendix a supplementary data supplementary material related to this article can be found in the online version at doi https doi org 10 1016 j agwat 2020

10689,owing to contradicted scientific results trends in drought due to global warming have been assigned with medium confidence drought will likely continue inputting immense pressure on food security in fragile ecosystems like sub saharan africa ssa as an adaptation measure to severe drought events since the 1980s the overall goal of irrigated schemes foreign exchange earnings thus has been shifted to sustain food security this study assessed the impacts of such drought driven agricultural policy and future climate change on the performance of large irrigated schemes in ssa with special emphasis on the gezira scheme gs 0 88 mha sudan the optimized scenario of the baseline period developed in gams the general algebraic modeling system showed that the expansion of food crops on the expensive of cash crops resulted in a reduction of 83 in gross net benefits and loss of 63 in irrigation water in the gs since the severe drought of 1984 the biased corrected rainfall and temperature outputs of three randomly selected regional climate models rcms under unmitigated pathways rcp 8 5 suggested increased rainfall of 40 mm increased temperature of 3 3 c and 5 increase in reference evapotranspiration for the period 2040 2070 compared to the baseline 1960 1990 the predicted conditions experienced neither extreme drought nor extreme wet events however severe and moderately drought events remain a challenge up to 2060 due to climate change and current water management practices the fao aquacrop predicted reductions in crop yields and water productivity especially for cotton and sorghum of 40 and 29 respectively optimized future crop scenarios indicate that food crops such as sorghum and wheat are not viable cash cotton and soil fertility maintenance crops groundnuts would be better for sustaining economic viability the agricultural policy and water management practices thus should be revisited to keep pace with future climate changes keywords regional climate models optimization aquacrop eastern africa region 1 introduction trends in global drought due to global warming is a controversial scientific debate while studies like sheffield et al 2012 questioned the increasing trend in the global drought area the opposite holds for others dai et al 2004 trenberth 2011 hence trends in drought have been assigned with low confidence by the intergovernmental panel on climate change ipcc 2013 which has been updated recently to medium confidence by ipcc 2019 however based on the stationarity theorem drought events will keep putting immense pressure upon development in general and food security in particular for some fragile regions like ssa benson and clay 1994 hulme 2001 nicholson 2000 philip et al 2018 rejeskhar et al 2015 ipcc 2019 drought undeniably alters the land surface interactions energy and water partitioning offsetting the whole transfer processes to the atmospheric boundary layer chiel et al 2010 wu et al 2015 the question that why drought happens remains an open research area wang and eltahir 2000 simulated that a change of 20 in land covers has resulted in persistent droughts conditions supporting the finding of xu et al 2004 that changes in land cover drove reductions in rainfall in ssa the study of charney et al 1977 indicated that the low amount of rainfall has increased the evapotranspiration in semi arid regions synoptically drought mostly generates a vicious circle of poverty in natural resources especially water resources however little studies have reported on the drought impacts compared to the surfeit literature on drought detection and its driving forces in ssa in general and the eastern nile basin en egypt ethiopia sudan and south sudan in particular the ssa region is characterized by its high climate variability hwang et al 2013 the nexus between drought climate change and food security has become undeniable low 2013 estimated the annual cost of drought at 1 13 of the gross domestic product gdp in ssa moreover drought is not just low rainfall conditions limited water supply it is also impacted the water demand for example because of drought the land surface will reflect more solar energy changing the atmospheric boundary layer conditions sen roy et al 2011 modeled increases of 40 and 80 w m 2 respectively in latent and sensible heat fluxes due to dry conditions under irrigation fields which is ultimately increasing the climatic water demand i e evapotranspiration et zhang et al 2015 projected an increase of 20 in irrigation water due to future droughts in the united state of america the ipcc 2013 estimated an increase of 8 in the radiative forcing due to increased concentrations mainly carbon dioxide based on the cmip5 multi model projections under the rcp 4 5 the area that located between the equator and 30 n including sudan will experience a change of 0 20 0 35 mm day 1 in the term precipitation minus evaporation p e during the period 2016 2035 relative to the period 1986 2005 climate change drought and food security have become the major players in formulating agricultural policies in the eastern nile region the eastern nile irrigation and drainage study 2009 suggested a regional expansion of 69 in the irrigated areas with irrigation water requirements of 108 km3 yr 1 that is higher than the annual flow of the major surface water source the blue nile river 50 km3 yr 1 let alone hydropower generations and transboundary complications the independent report of blackmore and whittington 2008 stressed that any decision taken pertinent to the nile water would have profound effects on poverty development and security in the region thus irrigation water management grasps much attention especially during drought seasons globally irrigation is expected to play a major role in filling the gap in food productions de fraiture and wichelns 2010 estimated that irrigated schemes could provide 75 of the additional food supply needed by the year 2050 under the condition that crop productivity is improved however in ssa mostly the overall goal of irrigation schemes is to sustain foreign exchange earnings rather than food production inasmuch as rainfed agriculture sustains the production of food crops you 2008 however the ipcc 2007 predicted a decrease of 50 in the yield of rainfed crops due to climate change thus irrigation schemes would continue playing a substantial role in sustaining food security especially in arid and semi arid areas like sudan about 70 of sorghum the main staple food crop in sudan comes from rainfed agriculture fao 2010 this has rampantly been jeopardized because of drought farah et al 1997 hamid et al 1995 resulting in massive famine conflicts immigration this has triggered the massive cultivation of food crops into governmental irrigated schemes bearing in mind the low and fluctuated food crop prices the analysis for international food commodity prices has revealed the following characteristics of food prices miao et al 2011 slight long term decline very short term volatility large price hikes were normally followed by declines and rapid hikes were dominantly followed by prolonged and gradual declines the world bank 2000 has alarmed the decline in the economic performance of the gezira scheme sudan the largest irrigated scheme worldwide 0 88 mha mohamed et al 2011 estimated the irrigation efficiency in the gezira scheme at 22 with a low relative water supply ratio supply demand of 4 6 climate change impact studies are crucial especially where livelihood generations and food production depend on climate the general circulation models gcms provide plausible scenarios for future climatic conditions the direct use of gcms in impact studies however is limited by their coarse resolution systemic errors and disability to capture inter annual variability aich et al 2014 aloysius and saiers 2017 cannon et al 2015 giorgi et al 2009 haensler et al 2013 ipcc 2013 vetter et al 2017 wilby et al 2009 regional climate models rcms through dynamic and or statistical downscaling techniques have dismantled many of these limitations with the exception of systemic errors this calls for a further post processing step that is the bias correction trzaska and schnarr 2014 zhu and luo 2015 nikulin et al 2012 emphasized the paramount role of rcms in predicting rainfall which is the major driver for water supply and food security over africa however yet there was no broad consensus or a priori criteria upon which rcm is the best for a given area benestad et al 2017 the coordinated regional climate downscaling experiment in africa cordex africa provides good quality outputs of rcms spatial resolution of 50 km which were effectively used in simulating rainfall in varied spatial resolutions i e continental regional and catchment endris et al 2013 mutayoba and kashaigilli 2017 nikulin et al 2012 the ensemble mean is the best recommended technique for managing uncertainty in climate change aloysius and saiers 2017 aich et al 2014 giorgi et al 2009 ipcc 2013 haensler et al 2013 nawaz et al 2010 nikulin et al 2012 bearing in mind that the individual rcm can exhibit significant biases endris et al 2013 nikulin et al 2012 as a drought adaptation policy in sudan food crops have been extensively introduced into irrigated schemes at the expense of cash crops the objectives of this study were to assess the impacts of such food crops expansion in irrigated schemes due to drought and to predict the future impacts of climate change on the performance of the large irrigated schemes in ssa with special emphasis on the gezira scheme sudan 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area gezira scheme the story of large scale irrigated schemes in sudan has begun since the completion of sennar dam the blue nile river in 1925 for irrigating the gezira scheme fig 1 currently irrigation schemes provide about 50 of the country s food production the gezira scheme traverses dry and semi dry climatic zones rainfall lasts for three months june september coupled with a high evapotranspiration rate thereby irrigation is an indispensable input into sustaining agricultural productions the scheme has a large surface irrigation system of 0 15 million km in length which has been designed basically to serve a single cash crop that is cotton foreign exchange earnings under free silt conditions the canals can irrigate 25 of the command area at any point in time plusquellec 1990 other crops like sorghum groundnuts and wheat have used to be secondary i e sorghum for subsistence groundnuts for maintaining soil fertility and wheat for import substitution guvele 2002 the scheme has undergone several uprooted changes especially after the nile water agreement in 1959 that has praised sudan s share in nile water share to 18 5 km3 consequently the scheme s command area has been doubled and secondary crops have become official crops without violating the dominancy of cash crops table 1 in 2005 a water users association policy was being adopted for enabling the participation of farmers in water management and crop choices unfortunately non tangible outcomes were achieved in 2016 a newer institutional arrangement has taken place 2 2 data collection 2 2 1 climate change ensemble rainfall and temperature datasets were downloaded from the cordex africa domain the portal deploys datasets of 21 climate modeling institutes with about 20 driving models mezghani et al 2019 stated that the more the included gcms the more different behavior of climate change especially the rainfall accordingly different combinations subsamples of gcms may present different results however vano et al 2015 justified the practical need for using a small number of gcms in climate change impact studies i e reducing the computational cost as there was no guidance yet on which rcms has to be selected for a given climate change impact study lutz et al 2016 coupled with the limited computation facility in sudan the outputs of three randomly selected rcms from three modeling institutes were downloaded to encompass as much as possible a range of projected climatic change conditions the selected rcms were namely cccma canesm2 csiro mk3 and access 1 under the experiment rcp 8 5 the representative concentration pathways 8 5 w m 2 the worst climate change case for a short time slice 2040 2070 quality controlled observed datasets were collected from the climate research unit university of east anglia cru for the period 1960 1990 the cru datasets were compared with datasets of 11 meteorological stations in central sudan averaged using the thiessen polygons technique in arcmap 10 3 i e the number of stations is limited by the data availability table 2 2 3 datasets preparation rcms outputs cannot be directly used in climatic change impacts studies shamseddin and chaibi 2019 sippel et al 2016 cannon et al 2015 kurnik et al 2012 piani et al 2010a this is attributed to the large systemic errors in rcms due to the large scale variability internal variability and parametrization of the climate models themselves the removal of such systemic errors is usually carried out via the bias correction bc the hydrological climate change impact study of chen et al 2013 has shown that rcms were biased in simulating precipitation resulting in biased simulated stream discharge and all the applied bc methods have improved the rcm simulated precipitation 2 3 1 biased corrected rainfall rainfalls were bias corrected using two bc methods the quantile delta mapping qdm and the linear relationship lp that developed by piani et al 2010b the qdm generally tends to match the quantile of simulated rainfall value to the observed value at the same quantile using transformation functions cannon et al 2015 maurer and pierce 2014 kurnik et al 2012 piani et al 2010a in its most basic the qdm necessitates the generation of cumulative distribution functions cdfs of three datasets observed dataset 1960 1990 in this study rcms modeled rainfall for the historical period 1960 1990 and projected future rainfall 2040 2070 in this study the gamma distribution function gdf was used to generate the cdfs the scale and shape parameters needed in gdf were estimated using the maximum likelihood the lp bias correction is comparatively a simple method depending on plotting fitting and simplified linear transformation functions see piani et al 2010b watanabe et al 2012 2 3 2 bias corrected temperature the projected temperature were bias corrected using the delta method trzaska and schnarr 2014 1 t b c t o t p t h where t stands for temperature the subscripts bc o p and h stand for the bias corrected observed projected and historic temperature datasets 2 4 validation of predicted rainfall climate change projections represent plausible scenarios for the future with a range of assumptions the validation of those future scenarios thus remains complicated and controversial see randall et al 2007 koutsoyiannis 2006 believed that limitations in climate knowledge and observed datasets obligated much of climate change modelers to presume stationarity in time series milly et al 2008 have interpreted stationarity as the climatic variable concerned has a time invariant probability density function pdf whose properties can be estimated from the instrument record and the pdf errors are reducible by additional observations in line with this the easiest way for validating rcms outputs is to statistically test that whether or not observed and modeled precipitations follow the same chosen theoretical pdfs this was done via the kolmogorov smirnov goodness of fit test ks husak et al 2007 dosio and paruolo 2011 cannon et al 2015 the ks test reads mathematically as follows 2 d max cdfo cdfcorj the bias correction ratio bcr eq 3 was used to verify that to what extent the applied bc methods have resulted in realistic climatic change signals this ratio compares the magnitude of change in medians during the observed and modeled periods maurer and pierce 2014 the bcr 1 indicates that the bias correction reduces the model change and the vice versa is true maurer and pierce 2014 3 b c r o p e o 0 5 e m p e m 0 5 e where e stands for the early period 0 5 for the median and p for the percentile p 0 5 value of the new model median in the old model distribution 2 5 drought 2 5 1 drought detection numerous operational drought indices were developed dai et al 2004 wu et al 2005 among which the standardized precipitation index spi and the palmer drought severity index pdsi were the largely used ones the most recently developed drought index is the standardized precipitation evaporation index spei which counts for the water balance i e p et beguerıa et al 2014 sheffield et al 2009 emphasized the strong effect of the chosen drought index and time scale in scaling drought events trenberth et al 2014 attributed the contradicted results on the relationship between climate change and drought to the formulation of pdsi and datasets used in estimating evapotranspiration the spi was found to be the best index for the sahel region in general and eastern africa in particular ntale and gan 2003 the spi characterizes by its time flexibility as well as limited required inputs only rainfall hayes et al 2000 compared to pdsi and spei in this study the spi was used to detect the drought events during the rainy season in central sudan june october by simply transforming the cdfs into a standard normal random variable z i e equi probability transformation ntale and gan 2003 2 5 2 drought impacts the impacts of drought on the gezira irrigated scheme were assessed using two methods the optimization technique and the fao aquacrop model 2 5 2 1 optimization the optimization technique was developed using the gamside 24 8 3 software the objective function total revenues r reads as follows marques et al 2005 mckinney and savitsky 2003 4 r i c i a i y i j w r i j w d i j l i j subjected to land and water resources constraints 5 l a n d i a i a o 6 w a t e r i w r i j w o

available land wo is the total available water c is the crop farm gate price and y is the crop yield the actual released irrigation water wr was collected from the water management and irrigation institute university of gezira sudan provided by the ministry of irrigation and water resources the crop water requirements were estimated using the cropwat 8 0 program agricultural datasets e g cultivated areas crop farm gate prices and cost etc were derived by the gezira scheme statistical bureau 1979 2005 and omer 2005 the gross net benefits gnb were estimated using total revenues and cost t 7 g n b i n r i t i the applied irrigation depth i was calculated i as in zhang et al 2015 8 i w r a 2 5 2 2 the fao aquacrop model this model assesses the impact of climate change with the consideration of the elevated carbon dioxide level climate irrigation crop and soil files needed by the model were created to simulate crop yields under the future predicted conditions assuming no change in the current water management practices the predicted changes by the aquacrop e g crop yield were then used to generate the optimized cropping intensity under future conditions 3 results and discussion 3 1 projected rainfall and temperature 3 1 1 rainfall the selected bc methods resulted in contradicted rainfall signals relative to the projected ones agreeing with the results of several studies that reported on the rainfall in africa elshamy et al 2009 aich et al 2014 hargreaves and annan 2014 this is attributed to the complex relationship among the factors that influence rainfall as well as to the rcms configurations haensler et al 2013 the ensemble technique is very effective in improving the quality of rcms signals in africa nikulin et al 2013 according to haensler et al 2013 the robust projected climate change signal could be attained if at least 66 of the models agreed in a given direction of change in this study the ensemble mean was obtained from three rcms which were bias corrected using two bcs qdm and lp methods that is to say 3 rcms x 2 bcs 6 values per each grid fig 2 compares the projected and bias corrected rainfalls to observed ones throughout the rainy season the rcms underestimated the rainfall during the historical window relative to the baseline the historic signals of gcms represent the response to forcings e g emission scenarios without consideration of the natural variability of precipitation maurer and pierce 2014 this underestimated historic signal was not modified during the projection window 2040 2070 however the underestimated projected rainfall signal was flipped into increasing signals during the bias correction except for that of july in which the decreased signal remains valid hagemann et al 2011 attributed the differences between original and bias corrected signals to differences that the bc imparted to the projected precipitation cannon et al 2015 called that the qdm is good in preserving the projected signals compared with the quantile mapping and delta quantile mapping methods table 3 evaluates the performance of rcms in reducing or increasing the magnitude of modelled change relative to the baseline based on the bcr generally the obtained bcr values were 1 0 suggesting two main findings firstly the projected rainfalls have associated with a large variance than the baseline and secondly both bc methods qdm and lp have managed to reduce the modelled variance in rainfall accordingly the lesser the bcr value the larger the reduction in the projected variance by the bias correction the qdm and lp showed also slight differences in their bcr values a seasonal bcr value of 0 47 for the qdm and 0 44 for the lp excluding the bcr values of october which associates with odd bcr values attributed to the high number of zero rainfall events among the rcms the seasonal bcr values were 0 29 0 48 and 0 61 for cccma canesm2 csiro mk3 and access 1 respectively the csiro mk3 thus associates with showed the least variance in projected rainfalls the access 1 was the only rcm that shows bcr values greater than 1 in august which means that the modeled variance is less than the observed one and the bias correction has increased the model change the ensemble mean 3 rcms x 2 bc methods indicated an increase of 10 in the seasonal rainfall june october during the period 2040 2070 compared to the observed rainfall of 388 mm fig 3 compares the obtained ensemble mean of rainfall in central sudan with an unbiased corrected ensemble mean of 21 gcms hereafter known as the unbiased ensemble for the whole country for the period 2040 2059 under the rcp 8 5 downloaded from the world bank climate knowledge portal 2019 relative to the baseline the unbiased ensemble stated an increase of 7 in the seasonal rainfall june october compared to 9 for the bias corrected ensemble during the same period 2040 2059 thus both bias and unbiased datasets agreed in the increasing trend of rainfall in the nearest future in sudan despite that the unbiased and biased ensembles showed similar seasonal rainfall patterns with peak rainfall in august however the former projects a noticeable reduction increase in rainfall during the period july august june september and october noting that the increase outweighs the reduction on a seasonal basis this is in agreement with the general patterns of climate that stated by the ipcc 2013 that wet get wetter and dry get drier with exceptions in some dry regions which were projected to be wetter by some gcms for example the region of east africa adding that regions that warming more than the tropics as a whole tend to exhibit an increase in local precipitation ipcc 2013 3 1 2 surface air temperature surface air temperature is a key climatic element in agricultural production thornton et al 2010 called that temperature is the principal component in the crop yield variability in the eastern africa region fig 4 shows the bias corrected surface air temperature by the year 2070 an average increase of 3 3 c in the mean annual temperature is predicted relative to the baseline in central sudan warmer future conditions the unbiased ensemble mean of 21 gcms projected an increase of 2 2 and 3 2 c for the periods 2040 2059 and 2060 2079 respectively under the rcp 8 5 the range of bias corrected annual surface air temperature maximum minimum experienced a decrease of 4 due to the 2 fold increase in the minimum temperature 21 compared to the maximum temperature 10 this will massively impact the production of winter crops like wheat ultimately this increased air temperature will increase irrigation water demands since it relates the most important climatic variables in a solid physical basis allen et al 1998 the penman monteith pm has been stated to give the best estimation of reference evapotranspiration eto especially in arid and semi arid zones dehghanisanij et al 2004 however the pm requires too many inputs temperature relative humidity wind speed and sunshine which are very difficult to be available in developing countries ziese et al 2014 indicated the difficulty of using the pm in projecting future changes in eto due to climate change as yet there was no finer projected information available for its computation alternatively less inputs data eto models are recommended among which is the hargreaves model hg which requires the only temperature but with a tendency to underestimate and overestimate eto under windy and high relative humidity conditions respectively allen et al 1998 fig 5 illustrates the observed and projected eto based on pm and hg models respectively the hg underestimated the eto by 15 compared to the pm nevertheless the hg projected an increase of 5 in the eto by the year 2070 this will disturb current sowing dates water management and crop production in the gezira scheme bearing in mind that the response of eto to climate change remains a source of uncertainty wang et al 2015 3 1 3 validation the kolmogorov smirnov test ks resulted in accepting the null hypothesis that observed and bias corrected datasets come from the same distribution except for the csiro mk3 datasets of october because of its excessive projected zero rainfall events of 93 compared to 0 during the historical and baseline periods also based on the ks the bias corrected ensemble mean outperformed that of the individual rcm confirming the result of endris et al 2013 who indicated that the ensemble mean 10 rcms is better than that of the individual rcm in three sub regions in eastern africa based on the agreement with the observed datasets 3 2 drought events 3 2 1 historical drought fig 6 a presented the estimated spi in central sudan during the period 1979 2009 the results were in conformity with those detected by ayoub 1999 hulme 1987 2001 ntale and gan 2003 teklu et al 1991 zhang et al 2011 the majority of the studied seasons 68 experienced near normal conditions 0 99 spi 0 99 the remaining 32 were drought affected seasons 29 for moderately to severe drought 1 spi 1 99 and 3 for extreme drought spi 2 of a drought persistence concern drought events have lasted for one season at 56 of the studied seasons coupled with a slight increase in the drought frequency from 25 to 33 since 1979 onward 3 2 2 projected drought fig 6b demonstrates a tray of projected climatic conditions for the period 2040 2070 in central sudan based on the spi the near norm conditions are the dominant 83 of the seasons 7 for the moderate to very drought condition and 10 for the very to moderate wet conditions despite the increased annual rainfall the region shows neither extreme wet events nor extreme drought ones this result supports the finding of sheffield and wood 2008 that the severity of the drought has decreased globally meanwhile it contradicts the finding of van der chrier et al 2013 however moderate to severe drought conditions remain a challenge for central sudan especially during the period 2040 2060 with a probability of 33 3 3 assessment of drought impacts on gezira scheme the impacts of climatic change on the performance of the gezira irrigated scheme will be discussed below based on the optimization technique and fao aquacrop model 3 3 1 optimized impacts of historical drought events due to the severe drought in 1984 ayoub 1999 hulme hulme 2001 teklu et al 1991 zhang et al 2011 the governments of sudan have expanded the areas of food crops sorghum on the expensive of cash crops cotton in irrigated schemes the impact of such a drought driven policy on the performance of the gezira irrigated scheme during the historical period 1979 2005 was being assessed via the optimization technique eqs 4 7 following the severe drought of 1984 the irrigation water release has been tremendously increased fig 7 despite the decreasing trend in the cropped area except for sorghum areas table 4 this is generally coupled with decreasing trends in the crop yields except for some seasons 1997 2002 and 2005 as shown in fig 8 the resultant is very low gross net benefit 60 million us and high irrigation water consumptions of 1 35 m table 5 the former is attributed to the fluctuated and low prices of sorghum fig 9 and the later for the large miss use of water in sorghum fields due to the un attended irrigation practice ahmed et al 2002 ultimately the scheme has failed to meet the operation and maintenance cost of the surface irrigation system that has to be regularly desilted in order to maintain its efficiency bearing in mind the high silt amounts that enter the system during the rainy season see betrie et al 2011 the optimized conditions of the period 1979 2005 via the gams technique under the initial conditions that the optimized cropping intensity should include all the current four grown crops resulted in a cropping intensity of 80 10 for sorghum 25 for cotton 20 for wheat and 25 for groundnuts and gross net benefits of 350 million us therefore the massive introduction of food crops into the gezira scheme besides the mismanagement water practices that have resulted in a reduction of 83 in the net benefits and a loss of 63 in the irrigation water depth relative to the baseline see table 5 above this optimized area meets dual purposes it sustains the production of cash crops cotton and simultaneously it avails 30 of the cultivated area the production of food crops sorghum and wheat that would sustain the national food security on the other hand however the use of irrigation schemes as a drought adaptation measure prerequisites more subsidies and investment as well as an uprooted change in the agricultural policy which has been severely mistreated in ssa since the 1980s mittal 2009 3 3 2 climate change impacts the impacts of predicted climatic conditions 2040 2070 were being assessed via the fao aquacrop model assuming that the current agricultural and water management practices remain valid the predicted crop yields were 1 07 1 2 1 6 and 0 97 t ha 1 for cotton wheat groundnut and sorghum respectively overwhelmingly crop yields and water productivity experienced decreasing trends especially sorghum and cotton relative to the baseline table 6 these results agreed with the projection of müller et al 2010 who called that climate change will reduce the crop yields in sudan by 10 40 in the nearest future 2050 based on the without carbon dioxide scenario however the results contradicted the findings of adhikari et al 2015 that sorghum is a resilient crop to climate change in eight selected countries in ssa not including sudan in general the predicted increases in eto would outweigh the accrued benefits from the predicted increased rainfall amounts unless the current water management practices are improved in central sudan müller et al 2010 called that the crop yields in the tropical land could be increased via the adoption of a carbon dioxide fertilization scenario i e farmers manage to increase fertilizer inputs a further assessment step was being carried out to optimize the impact of future climatic conditions using the fao aquacrop predicted crop yields the result is an optimized cropping intensity of 57 only for cotton and groundnuts coupled with irrigation water consumption of 1 01 m and gross net benefits of 209 million us accordingly the food crops sorghum and wheat were no longer optimized for the future climatic conditions and only cash crop cotton and maintaining soil fertility crop groundnut were recommended as a response to the future climatic conditions however the current management practices shall be revisited to increase the gross net benefit 4 conclusion drought and its management as well as food security are the real challenges that face the sustainability of irrigated schemes in the ssa it is shown that the introduction of food crops into the irrigated scheme as an agricultural drought driven policy by the successive governments of sudan has managed to sustain the national food security but has failed to sustain the economic viability of the schemes inasmuch as food crops generally have shown fluctuated and low prices bearing in mind that current surface irrigation systems need a continuous silt clearance a very high cost to perform efficiently unless cash crops were grown dominantly the surface irrigation system will fail in meeting the irrigation water requirements while economic viability and food security seem to be a paradox in irrigated schemes the optimized cropped area in this study managed to meet both objectives climate change will add more cross cutting themes and further complications to the agricultural systems rcms provide future projected outputs in finer resolutions meanwhile their direct use in climate change impact studies is not recommended unless a bias correction process has taken place a priori step under the worst climate change scenario rcp 8 5 the predicted increased rainfall a decreased drought severity increased surface air temperature increased eto elevated carbon dioxide and current water management practices have aggregately decreased the crop yields coupled with increased irrigation water consumptions even under optimized conditions in the gezira scheme the current agricultural policies and water management practices thus have to be revisited in order to maintain the economic viability of the scheme bearing in mind the expected accrued benefits from the construction of the ethiopian renaissance dams e g regulation of the blue nile flow especially during the dry period november may and reduced silt amounts that have used to enter the irrigation network during the rainy season june october there is a dire need to improve also the performance of rainfed agriculture in producing food crops so as food crops do not compete with the production of cash crops in irrigated schemes declaration of competing interest this is to certify that there is no conflict of interest appendix a supplementary data supplementary material related to this article can be found in the online version at doi https doi org 10 1016 j agwat 2020
