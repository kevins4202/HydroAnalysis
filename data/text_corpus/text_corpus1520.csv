7600,given uncertainty in precipitation gauge based gridded datasets over complex terrain we use multiple streamflow observations as an additional source of information about precipitation in order to identify spatial and temporal differences between a gridded precipitation dataset and precipitation inferred from streamflow we test whether gridded datasets capture across crest and regional spatial patterns of variability as well as year to year variability and trends in precipitation in comparison to precipitation inferred from streamflow we use a bayesian model calibration routine with multiple lumped hydrologic model structures to infer the most likely basin mean water year total precipitation for 56 basins with long term 30year streamflow records in the sierra nevada mountain range of california we compare basin mean precipitation derived from this approach with basin mean precipitation from a precipitation gauge based 1 16 gridded dataset that has been used to simulate and evaluate trends in western united states streamflow and snowpack over the 20th century we find that the long term average spatial patterns differ in particular there is less precipitation in the gridded dataset in higher elevation basins whose aspect faces prevailing cool season winds as compared to precipitation inferred from streamflow in a few years and basins there is less gridded precipitation than there is observed streamflow lower elevation southern and east of crest basins show better agreement between gridded and inferred precipitation implied actual evapotranspiration calculated as precipitation minus streamflow then also varies between the streamflow based estimates and the gridded dataset absolute uncertainty in precipitation inferred from streamflow is substantial but the signal of basin to basin and year to year differences are likely more robust the findings suggest that considering streamflow when spatially distributing precipitation in complex terrain may improve its representation particularly for basins whose orientations e g windward facing are favored for orographic precipitation enhancement keywords precipitation orographic enhancement streamflow mountain hydrology sierra nevada bayesian inference 1 introduction 1 1 approach for reducing uncertainty in distributed precipitation estimates in complex terrain mountainous areas in the mid latitudes develop snowpack that is critical for water resources and ecosystems services thus they serve as water towers for the world viviroli et al 2007 over complex terrain in the mid latitudes precipitation observations are generally limited to in situ gauge observations due to challenges in remote sensing of mountain precipitation with ground based radar westrick et al 1999 and satellite based methods lettenmaier et al 2015 as a result it has been necessary to develop methods to distribute or interpolate gauge based observations across the landscape to a grid e g daly et al 2008 newman et al 2015 thornton et al 1997 while attempting to account for the strong topographic influences on spatiotemporal patterns of precipitation roe 2005 large uncertainties can occur during estimation of spatially distributed precipitation e g gutmann et al 2012 livneh et al 2014 due to both sparse and uncertain gauge data in mountainous areas lundquist et al 2003 rasmussen et al 2011a sieck et al 2007 and uncertainty in the interpolation of gauge data to a grid clark and slater 2006 as a result it may be useful to apply other types of observations and estimates to infer precipitation in these areas and reduce potential errors in gridded datasets streamflow observations offer an additional method with which to infer precipitation patterns and evaluate gridded precipitation datasets streamflow has been used to correct gridded precipitation products for high elevation underestimation at the global scale adam et al 2006 to evaluate sources of precipitation data wayand et al 2013 and precipitation distribution schemes le moine et al 2015 livneh et al 2014 at the basin scale and to identify errors in precipitation forcing data in hydrologic models mcmillan et al 2011b renard et al 2010 in general these studies have shown that substantial errors in spatially distributed precipitation can be identified through a comparison with observed streamflow henn et al 2015 developed an approach for inferring basin mean precipitation from streamflow in the yosemite national park region of the sierra nevada mountain range of california and tested the sensitivity of the inferred precipitation from this approach to various assumptions their approach uses bayesian calibration of simple snow and hydrologic models to estimate the most likely water year total precipitation in a basin given daily streamflow observations this approach calibrates the models to match streamflow under uncertain precipitation inputs the models estimating the actual evapotranspiration et needed to close the basin s water balance they used a small ensemble of six hydrologic model structures to estimate the uncertainty of the inferred precipitation associated with model structural assumptions based on seven yosemite area basins tested in henn et al 2015 they concluded that streamflow allows for robustly inferring the climatological patterns of precipitation across the mountain range i e identifying wetter and dryer areas within the range streamflow also highlighted annual variability between wet and dry years they also found that long term inferred basin mean precipitation disagreed by up to 25 with parameter regression on independent slopes model prism daly et al 1994 2002 2008 precipitation climatology however the absolute amounts of inferred precipitation are sensitive to the model structures used to simulate the basins suggesting that this approach is only suited for identifying errors greater than 100mmyr 1 in spatially distributed precipitation estimates 1 2 study objectives and contents this paper further develops the approach of henn et al 2015 and extends it to a spatial domain encompassing a large mountain range we describe a streamflow dataset from the sierra nevada the method for inferring precipitation from streamflow and a set of experiments to compare inferred precipitation against the gridded precipitation dataset we apply the approach of inferring precipitation from streamflow in 56 basins in the sierra nevada that have largely unimpaired long term streamflow observations we do this to compare inferred precipitation against the hamlet et al 2010 1 16 gridded daily precipitation dataset hereafter h10 over water years 1950 2010 we choose this dataset as it has been used to resolve spatial patterns and trends in western united states snowpack and streamflow hamlet et al 2005 2007 and because it explicitly attempts to reduce temporal inhomogeneity by using long term station records to control trends in the precipitation data hamlet and lettenmaier 2005 it also utilizes prism precipitation climatology as its long term mean spatial pattern in order to account for topographic effects we do this to identify patterns of where and when precipitation estimates diverge in the sierra nevada based on examinations of differences between gridded precipitation datasets we hypothesize that areas of high elevation and complex terrain where precipitation gauge density is low may have substantial biases in gridded precipitation datasets and these biases can be identified by precipitation inferred from streamflow research on orographic precipitation has shown that properly oriented topography can induce steep spatial gradients in precipitation rates roe 2005 we hypothesize that these biases may be greatest in areas that are favorable for orographic precipitation enhancement where interpolation may tend to perform poorly we use precipitation inferred from streamflow to evaluate whether gridded precipitation datasets capture areas of orographic enhancement the ratios of windward to leeward precipitation i e rain shadows year to year variability in the spatial patterns of precipitation and long term trends in basin mean precipitation we are unaware of previous studies that have used many distributed streamflow observations to infer orographic precipitation patterns over a mountain range we use 56 stream gauges distributed over a 400km long mountain range both on the windward and leeward slopes and we use streamflow observations that span multiple decades at each gauge thus we are able to consider both annual spatial patterns of streamflow and precipitation as well as year to year variability and long term trends in those patterns unlike henn et al 2015 here we develop quantitative estimates of prior uncertainty in basin mean precipitation for bayesian inference by considering the agreement or lack thereof between independent precipitation data sources for each basin for example numerical weather prediction of precipitation over complex terrain has improved in fidelity as models have been run at higher resolution and with more process based microphysical parameterizations e g rasmussen et al 2011b the weather research and forecasting model wrf skamarock and klemp 2008 has been shown to generate precipitation estimates that are equal or better in terms of simulated hydrologic responses as compared to gauge based gridded precipitation in some mountain basins gutmann et al 2012 wayand et al 2013 thus we consider wrf precipitation as a source of information about the patterns of precipitation over complex terrain we also consider a gridded precipitation dataset newman et al 2015 that does not depend on prism climatology along with the h10 dataset as part of our prior estimate of basin mean precipitation sections 2 and 3 describe the data and models respectively used in the inference of precipitation from streamflow section 4 presents the results of the precipitation inference and the comparison against the gridded dataset section 5 discusses the implications of the differences between gridded and inferred precipitation and the potential value of streamflow observations for gridded precipitation datasets section 6 offers conclusions from the study 2 data in this section we describe the data used to compare h10 gridded precipitation with precipitation inferred from streamflow unimpaired daily streamflow observations basin topography and soils information gridded precipitation data from several sources and gridded temperature and evapotranspiration data 2 1 streamflow and basins for comparison against precipitation we identify 56 basins in the sierra nevada fig 1 table 1 in which daily streamflow observations have been made for extended periods of time forty one of the gauges are west of the crest of the sierra nevada and 15 are on the east slope streamflow observations included in this study have at least 30 water years of complete or nearly complete records between 1950 and 2010 in a few cases we include stream gauges with 20 30years of data because they are in areas with few gauges the southeastern sierra nevada thirty one of the 56 continue to operate and 34 are listed in the hydro climate data network hcdn of basins without significant regulation from dams or diversions to agricultural or domestic use slack and landwehr 1992 we also include 22 basins not in the hcdn but with relatively few or small impairments based on descriptions provided by the united states geological survey usgs water data reports for each site anderson et al 1996 rockwell et al 1996a 1996b in a few cases we include basins with upstream dam regulation so long as the storage was small compared to annual runoff volumes or the regulation effect could be removed from the streamflow record because complete storage records were available we exclude most stream gauges with observations that were described as having poor quality by the usgs 3 gauges in the southeastern sierra nevada rated poor big pine cr independence cr and cottonwood cr were included due to a lack of other gauges in this area all streamflow data were downloaded from the usgs national water information system web interface http waterdata usgs gov nwis sw with the exception of two basins cherry eleanor and the tuolumne river at hetch hetchy in which full natural flows were provided by the operator of the reservoirs at the basin outlets hetch hetchy water and power hhwp see supplemental material of henn et al 2015 more detailed information on the individual stream gauges and their associated basins is included in table 1 the usgs streamflow measurements are made by translating direct stream stage measurements into discharge via streamflow rating curves rating curves are developed and updated using manual measurements of discharge but they are subject to uncertainty discharge uncertainty due to rating curve errors have been estimated at 10 for observations of good quality and 15 for fair records rockwell et al 1996a in that 95 of the daily measurements should fall within the stated margin of error while studies of other rating curve based streamflow techniques have suggested uncertainties of up to 20 40 at very high flows baldassarre and montanari 2009 we are primarily interested in precipitation and runoff over timescales of a water year or longer and so we presume the usgs estimates to be a reasonable representation of uncertainty topographical boundaries of the basins are delineated based on 30m usgs elevation data which are also used to calculate basin area distributions within 100m elevation bands the basins areas table 1 range from 10 1km2 daggett cr to 3472km2 kings r the median basin area is 165km2 the basins mean elevations range from 744m white r to 3457m middle fork of bishop cr most basins span at least 1000m in elevation we use typical basin soil properties to provide information for the lumped hydrologic model in the inference of precipitation from streamflow section 3 most of the basins are near the crest of the sierra nevada and have steep topography that is underlain by granitic bedrock typical soils in glaciated areas near the crest are shallow and sandy with a depth of no more than 1m and a porosity of about 0 4 nrcs 2007 though water is likely available for evapotranspiration from deeper in the soil bedrock interface goulden et al 2012 rose et al 2003 field studies have indicated that soils in higher elevation areas of the sierra nevada have high porosities 0 3 0 55 and conductivities 1cm to 1md 1 typical of sand and gravel but that values decline with depth approaching the underlying bedrock and that soils are deeper and more heterogeneous in lower elevation areas further from the crest bales et al 2011 flint et al 2008 holbrook et al 2014 calibration ranges for the hydrologic model soil parameters section 3 reflect these values 2 2 gridded precipitation to force the hydrologic models time series of precipitation temperature and potential evapotranspiration pet are needed for each basin here we describe the gridded precipitation datasets that provide the precipitation forcing data temperature and pet data sources are described in section 2 3 2 2 1 h10 precipitation we use the h10 daily precipitation dataset as a basis for comparison with streamflow and precipitation inferred from streamflow the dataset uses national weather service cooperative observer nws coop daily precipitation gauge observations and the prism 1971 2000 monthly precipitation climatology daly et al 1994 2002 2008 as a topographic corrector in the interpolation of gauge precipitation over complex terrain we choose this dataset because of its relatively high spatial resolution 1 16 6km and long term span 1915 2010 over california and because h10 and its predecessors have been used to simulate snow and streamflow in western united states e g mote et al 2005 however we note that other long term daily gridded datasets livneh et al 2015 prism climate group 2015 are also available we use h10 data covering water years 1950 2010 water year 1949 is used for model spin up over a spatial domain which covers the streamflow basins from 121 5 w to 117 5 w and from 35 5 n to 40 n for each basin we calculate the fraction of each h10 grid cell that is within the basin and calculate the h10 basin mean time series as the weighted sum of the grid cells precipitation we use this daily time series of precipitation combined with a multiplicative precipitation scaling factor inferred in calibration to force the hydrologic and snow models that are the basis for inferring precipitation from streamflow for each basin see section 3 2 2 2 n15 wrf and other precipitation datasets in order to estimate the uncertainty of the h10 precipitation estimates and how the uncertainty varies across the sierra nevada we also examine independently generated gridded precipitation data a quantitative estimate of precipitation and its associated uncertainty is necessary for the bayesian inference of precipitation from streamflow see section 3 for one additional source of precipitation information we use the n15 dataset newman et al 2015 while it interpolates gauge data in a qualitatively similar manner to h10 it does not use prism precipitation climatology as a topographic corrector and thus may be a more independent estimate from h10 than other prism based datasets n15 is a 100 member ensemble dataset such that uncertainty in the data can be explicitly quantified n15 uses a 1 8 12km spatial grid and so there may be greater topographic smoothing compared to the 1 16 datasets second we use wrf model skamarock and klemp 2008 daily precipitation totals over california the regional wrf simulations were generated using wrf version 3 6 0 skamarock et al 2008 to dynamically downscale the north american regional reanalysis narr with a methodology very similar to that used in hughes et al 2012 the wrf downscaling has two nested domains with an outer 18km grid extending across the northeastern pacific and much of the u s intermountain west and a 6km grid domain that covers all of california similar to fig 1 of hughes et al 2012 both domains have 82 vertical levels with 50 75m vertical resolution within the lowest 2km of atmosphere with model top at 100hpa both domains use morrison double moment microphysics morrison et al 2009 dudhia shortwave radiation dudhia 1989 and rrtm longwave radiation mlawer et al 1997 called every 6min kain fritsch convective parameterization kain 2004 the yonsei university planetary boundary layer scheme hong et al 2006 and the noah land surface model tewari et al 2004 wrf data were generated for 11 calendar years 2004 2014 and over this time period the model was re initialized approximately every 5days using narr data with the first three hours of each 5 day period discarded as model spin up the model is run with a 30s 10s time step in the 18km 6km domain for precipitation output data are aggregated to daily totals for both the n15 and wrf precipitation gridded precipitation is aggregated to single time series for each basin using the fractional grid cells approach described above for h10 for comparison we also briefly examine two other gridded precipitation datasets livneh et al 2015 hereafter l15 and north american land data assimilation system phase 2 cosgrove et al 2003 mitchell et al 2004 xia et al 2012 hereafter nldas 2 we include these datasets to see whether patterns of differences between gridded and inferred precipitation are consistent across different gridding methodologies while each gauge based gridded dataset considered here varies in the set of precipitation gauges used all of them with the exception of n15 use prism climatology as a topographic corrector thus we hypothesize that spatial patterns of inferred precipitation may be fairly consistent across the gauge based datasets 2 3 temperature and potential evapotranspiration in addition to precipitation time series of daily mean temperature and pet are needed to force the hydrologic models that are run for each basin for temperature we calculate basin mean time series of daily high and low temperature from the h10 data in the same fashion as for precipitation and average the high and low temperatures to create a daily mean temperature series pet is estimated using the makkink equation which uses temperature and shortwave radiation as predictors e g cristea et al 2013 the bristow campbell parameterization is used to estimate shortwave radiation from temperature bristow and campbell 1984 we calibrate the bristow campbell and makkink methods using data from the dana meadows meteorological station 2987m above sea level in yosemite national park for water years 2003 through 2009 shortwave radiation and temperature are used to calibrate the bristow campbell coefficients a 0 7 and c 2 49 shortwave radiation wind speed temperature and relative humidity are applied to estimate pet using the penman monteith equation following the methods of allen et al 1998 this pet estimate is then used to calibrate the makkink coefficient 0 668 h10 daily high and low temperatures for each grid cell are used with the approach above to estimate daily pet at each grid cell in the spatial domain the grid cells pet are then aggregated to basin mean pet series for each basin due to reduced diurnal temperature range at higher elevations in the h10 data pet calculated in this way decreases somewhat with elevation such that 1000m elevation has roughly 20 more pet than 3000m elevation about 1200mmyr 1 vs 1000mmyr 1 though there is substantial grid cell variation for a given elevation henn et al 2015 found that inferred precipitation and inferred actual evapotranspiration are only mildly sensitive to pet presumably due to the largely water limited climate of the sierra nevada so we do not investigate the effects of pet further here 3 methods to infer basin mean water year total precipitation from daily streamflow observations the following steps are applied h10 based precipitation temperature and pet forcing data are used to drive snow and hydrologic models for each basin and produce simulated streamflow time series we simulate all water years from 1950 to 2010 for which streamflow observations are available for each basin at least one water year before the start of the analysis i e 1949 for basins with streamflow in 1950 is used for model spin up and is discarded the parameters of the models include a multiplicative error correction kavetski et al 2003 on the precipitation time series along with snow and soil parameters the simulated runoff is compared to the observed streamflow record and based on the goodness of fit of the streamflow and the prior likelihood of the model parameters the bayesian joint posterior distribution of the parameters is generated from the posterior distribution of the precipitation multiplier the corrected basin mean precipitation can then be calculated this section describes the snow and hydrologic models and the calibration routine used to infer precipitation from streamflow for a more detailed description of this approach see henn et al 2015 their fig 1 and their section 3 3 1 models 3 1 1 hydrologic model structures we use the framework for understanding structural errors fuse clark et al 2008 to provide a set of conceptual hydrologic models and to evaluate the effects of model structural uncertainty on inferred precipitation clark et al 2011 mcmillan et al 2011a fuse provides multiple options for representing soil moisture storage and fluxes such as et surface runoff and baseflow using a spatially lumped approach with upper and lower soil storages streamflow soil moisture and et time series are simulated at a daily time step in this study multiple fuse structures are included to estimate the uncertainty of the precipitation inferred from streamflow we use six model structures previously used to investigate the impact of structure on model performance in the mahurangi basin in new zealand clark et al 2011 mcmillan et al 2011a and to infer precipitation from streamflow observations for greater details on the fuse model structures see henn et al 2015 and clark et al 2008 3 1 2 snow model each fuse structure is coupled to a temperature index snow model based on snow 17 anderson 2006 which tracks snow water equivalent swe based on precipitation and melt precipitation is added to swe if the air temperature is below a threshold otherwise it is treated as rain snowmelt is initiated if the air temperature is above a threshold and is proportional to the temperature above that point 1 sm max min f t t 0 swe 0 where sm is snowmelt per time step f is the snowmelt factor t is the air temperature and t 0 is the melt threshold temperature the melt factor f varies in a sinusoidal manner over the year with minimum and maximum values on the winter and summer solstices respectively the rain snow partition temperature melt initiation temperature and winter and summer melt factors are all inferred parameters snowmelt is combined with rainfall and the two are routed to the soil model which otherwise simulates fluxes and storages independently of the snow model h10 basin mean precipitation is corrected for errors using a precipitation multiplier m t where the subscript t indicates the daily time step 2 p t m t p f t here p f t is the h10 basin mean precipitation m t is the multiplier and p t is the model input precipitation all at time t the multipliers are defined such that they are different for each water year but constant within the water year and each yearly multiplier is inferred in calibration in this way we infer water year precipitation from streamflow in order to simulate the strong elevation dependence of snow in the sierra nevada the snow model is run at 100m elevation bands for each basin unlike the soil model which is lumped over the entire basin for each band h10 temperature is lapsed to the ith band midpoint elevation 3 t i t f γ z i z f where t i is the ith band temperature t f is the h10 temperature z i is the band midpoint elevation z f is the basin s mean elevation because basin mean temperature forcing are used and γ is the temporally invariant temperature lapse rate 0 ckm 1 which is also inferred in calibration finally water fluxes to the lumped soil model are calculated by a weighted average of rain plus snowmelt from each elevation band 4 f soil i 1 n bands af i r i sm i where f soil is the flux of water to the soil model and af i is the fraction of the basin area r i is the rain and sm i is the snowmelt all from band i unlike in henn et al 2015 we do not use an orographic precipitation gradient opg to distribute precipitation to the basins elevation bands and infer intra basin precipitation distributions instead the multiplier corrected precipitation is distributed evenly to each elevation band this is done because the results of those studies indicated that the inference was likely not able to discern intra basin precipitation patterns almost all inferred opgs were at or near zero thus precipitation inferred from streamflow represents the basin mean amount for each water year the actual precipitation distribution is of course spatially variable within each basin and distributing the mean precipitation values from this study would be more complex in basins with greater topographic relief we choose to use a temperature index snow model instead of a full energy balance snow model we calibrate the precipitation forcing data which has large effects on the snow simulation e g raleigh et al 2015 the precipitation uncertainty likely overwhelms any improvement in snow simulation that might be gained from using an energy balance model additionally temperature index models have fewer tunable parameters than energy balance models the additional parameters of an energy balance model would increase the computational burden and parametric uncertainty in the bayesian inference described below 3 2 bayesian model calibration 3 2 1 bayesian inference of precipitation we infer basin mean precipitation from streamflow using bayes theorem with the bayesian total error analysis package batea kavetski et al 2006a the joint posterior probability density function pdfs of the multipliers m and other model parameters θ the snow and soil parameters and the lapse rate given observed precipitation p and streamflow q are described by 5 p m θ q p p q m θ p p m θ the first product term on the right hand side of 5 is the likelihood function which describes the probability distribution of the observed streamflow given particular values of m θ and the observed gauge precipitation p the likelihood function interprets the difference between observed and simulated streamflow using an error model the second product term in 5 is composed of the prior distributions of the precipitation multiplier and other model parameters the posterior distribution of the precipitation multiplier and the model parameters p m θ q p is an update of the prior distributions given streamflow and precipitation observations we use a weighted least squares wls residual error model to translate differences between modeled and observed streamflow into the likelihood of the corresponding parameter sets in the wls approach it is assumed that higher streamflow is subject to greater uncertainty unlike simple least squares in which all time steps are treated equally following thyer et al 2009 we assume that model residual streamflow errors follow a gaussian distribution with zero mean and a standard deviation that is a linear function of streamflow i e 6 σ t a q t b where a and b are residual error parameters inferred in the calibration and q t is the modeled streamflow at a given time step t the error model calculates likelihood inversely to the sum of the squared differences between observed and modeled streamflow which are first normalized at each time step by σ t the combination of the soil snow and yearly multiplier parameters results in a parameter space with 50 80 dimensions and so to sample the posterior probability distributions multiple start quasi newton optimization and a monte carlo markov chain mcmc routine are used within batea kavetski et al 2006b the result of the mcmc sampling routine is an ensemble of parameter sets with more samples clustered around parameter values of greater posterior probability 3 2 2 parameter prior distributions to constrain the inference within the bayesian framework prior distributions are placed on the multiplier and each hydrologic and snow model parameter we use similar snow and soil parameter distributions as in henn et al 2015 uniform distributions are used and when no information is available about a parameter in the study domain the distribution is set to the default limits for the fuse model clark et al 2008 for more details on the soil and snow model parameters see table 1 of henn et al 2015 the prior distributions of the precipitation multipliers are normal distributions and each yearly multiplier is independent of the others we use estimates of each basin s mean precipitation and the differences in precipitation estimates between h10 n15 and wrf to set the mean and standard deviation of the multipliers prior distribution for the mean of the prior distribution we use 7 μ m p h 10 p n 15 p wrf 3 p h 10 where p h 10 p n 15 and p wrf are the h10 n15 and wrf basin mean precipitation for the water year n15 precipitation is the mean of the ensembles for each basin 7 is applied over each water year from 2005 to 2010 and then averaged in other words the mean of the prior distribution for each basin is the average of the three datasets precipitation divided by the h10 precipitation this is an a priori guess of how h10 precipitation might be corrected before considering streamflow see h10 n15 and wrf precipitation in fig 2 a and b for the standard deviation of the distribution we use 8 σ m 1 p 1 3 p h 10 p 2 p n 15 p 2 p wrf p 2 where p is the mean precipitation of the three datasets or 9 p μ m p h 10 thus the standard deviation of the multiplier prior distribution is the standard deviation of basin precipitation in h10 n15 and wrf normalized by the mean of the three as with the mean 8 is applied to estimate the standard deviation for each year from 2005 to 2010 and then averaged this process is repeated for each of the basins thus we use the agreement between the three datasets or lack thereof to estimate the prior distribution of uncertainty in precipitation for a given basin all multipliers are drawn from the same prior distribution but each year s multiplier is unique and independent of the other years multipliers to illustrate this process for the cherry eleanor basin the three datasets precipitation time series are shown in fig 2a and are mapped for water year 2008 in fig 2b d the h10 precipitation is generally less than n15 and wrf and so the mean prior estimate of the multiplier is 1 48 for this basin the disagreement between the different datasets is also relatively high compared to other basins with the three sources of precipitation spanning 600 800mmyr 1 therefore the relative standard deviation of the prior distribution is set to reflect this at 0 26 together with the mean this indicates that prior to considering streamflow we expect basin mean precipitation to be between 0 97 and 1 99 times h10 precipitation with 95 confidence using water year 2008 as an example the prior distribution is plotted as a precipitation distribution for cherry eleanor in fig 2e i e as the product of the multiplier distribution and the 840mm of precipitation from h10 we also plot water year 2008 streamflow 790mm and n15 1052mm and wrf precipitation 1499mm showing that the prior distribution largely spans the three precipitation data sources 4 results 4 1 experimental approach first we examine the bayesian inference of precipitation comparing the prior distribution of the multiplier with the posterior distribution for each of the six fuse model structures this comparison allows us to evaluate whether the choice of prior distribution and precipitation uncertainty appears appropriate given the precipitation inferred from streamflow as well as the uncertainty in inferred precipitation associated with the choice of model structure next we compare h10 precipitation and precipitation inferred from streamflow across the 56 study basins in the sierra nevada at several timescales we present results for several water years focusing on those for which many streamflow gauges were operational 1983 and 1977 which allows for greater spatial comparison of precipitation we also compare inferred precipitation and streamflow to other gridded precipitation datasets to test whether the findings are consistent across different methodologies then we present long term average differences between gridded and inferred precipitation when testing the differences between gridded and inferred precipitation we consider their spatial patterns in terms of distribution with elevation and distribution topographically across the crest of the sierra nevada finally we consider the patterns of implied et from the gridded and inferred datasets across the range 4 2 precipitation multiplier prior and posterior distributions the precipitation inferred from streamflow by the six fuse model structures for cherry eleanor is shown in fig 2 the time series of the inferred precipitation ensemble shows substantial differences between fuse structures fig 2a but also robustly reflects yearly variability in streamflow in general the ensemble of precipitation inferred from streamflow is greater than h10 similar or greater than the n15 ensemble and contains the wrf precipitation in the water year 2008 distribution fig 2e the 95 confidence intervals of the inferred precipitation from each structure are shown with the mean indicated by the marker while the individual structures intervals are about 100mm wide the range of the ensemble is almost 800mm showing that structural uncertainty in inferred precipitation is more substantial than the individual structures imply this is consistent with the findings of henn et al 2015 the mean of the fuse ensemble is also shown 1332mm it is less than wrf but greater than h10 and n15 a qualitative examination of this basin and others indicates that the posterior precipitation amounts generally fall within reasonable 95 limits of the prior distributions this suggests that the prior distributions are not grossly incompatible with the posterior distributions inferred from streamflow using the fuse model structures when this is the case the specific choice of the prior distribution likely does not exert undue influence on the inferred precipitation a sensitivity analysis of the inferred precipitation posteriors not shown indicates that they are only somewhat sensitive to the choice of prior distribution parameters so long as the distribution is sufficiently wide as to span the posterior region thus including wrf precipitation estimates is significant as it tends to increase the spread of the prior distribution the posterior distributions of inferred precipitation largely reflect the best fit of the different model structures to streamflow precipitation uncertainty as measured by disagreement between the h10 n15 and wrf datasets appears greatest in the central sierra nevada when the difference between the datasets for each basin are normalized by the basin mean value and plotted spatially not shown greater relative uncertainty is seen in the tuolumne merced and san joaquin r basins differences for these basins frequently exceed 20 of the mean while in the southern sierra nevada differences are generally 10 15 or less and the northern sierra nevada has intermediate values however the spatial pattern of uncertainty may be dependent on the choice of the particular precipitation datasets used in the comparison 4 3 comparing h10 precipitation and inferred precipitation in wet and dry years for each of the 56 basins we compile the inferred precipitation from the fuse structures and calculate the mean of the fuse ensemble for each basin year we exclude the basin years in which model calibrations produced very poor fits to streamflow streamflow nash sutcliffe coefficient of 2 or less or about 8 of all basin years simulated we then compare the mean inferred precipitation to h10 basin mean precipitation for individual water years from 1950 to 2010 figs 3 and 4 show this comparison for two water years 1983 and 1977 water year 1983 was one of the wettest on record in the sierra nevada with many gauges reporting over 2000mm of precipitation h10 precipitation fig 3a reflects the heavy precipitation that year with most basins on the west slope of the sierra nevada north of 37 n averaging at least that much maximum accumulations are seen in the north fork of the american r and the south fork of the yuba r as well as in smaller adjacent basins h10 precipitation generally decreases to the south along the west slope of the sierra nevada in comparison inferred precipitation fig 3b shows a more spatially variable pattern while precipitation of 2500mm or greater is seen in the yuba and american basins similarly large accumulations are seen in the basins in the stanislaus tuolumne san joaquin kings and kaweah drainages water year 1983 streamflow fig 3c shows a similarly spatially variable pattern of particular note are the strong gradients in streamflow seen over the central sierra nevada with a local maxima over cherry eleanor and falls crs and much drier 1000mm less streamflow basins to the east in the walker r basin and to the southwest in the lower tuolumne r basin the spatial gradients are much less sharp in the h10 dataset than they are in streamflow but are not surprisingly reflected in the precipitation inferred from streamflow to check h10 and inferred precipitation we subtract observed streamflow from both datasets basin mean precipitation fig 3d and e h10 precipitation minus streamflow is negative in three basins in water year 1983 cherry eleanor 175mm the north fork of the stanislaus r 16mm and duncan cr 75mm several other basins have streamflow within about 100mm of h10 precipitation including the san joaquin r and its tributary granite cr on the other hand h10 precipitation minus streamflow is much greater for basins further from the crest of the sierra nevada for example the low elevation cosumnes and mokelumne basins have h10 precipitation more than 800mm greater than runoff inferred precipitation is greater than streamflow by more consistent amounts across the sierra nevada fig 3e typically 400 800mm though local variability exists finally we plot the difference between h10 and inferred precipitation fig 3f which highlights the different spatial patterns of precipitation from the two sources of information inferred precipitation is greater than h10 over most high elevation basins particularly in the central sierra nevada stanislaus tuolumne san joaquin kings and kaweah basins precipitation inferred from streamflow is similar to or less than h10 for many of the lower elevation basins and for many of the basins east of the crest of the range the equivalent water year 1977 comparison fig 4 shows spatial patterns during an anomalously dry year note different scale comparing figs 3 and 4 show that streamflow is on the order of 90 less in 1977 as compared to 1983 as a result the absolute differences in streamflow and precipitation between basins in 1977 are relatively small but as a fraction of water year totals and considering the value of water in california in a drought year they remain significant for example streamflow over 200mm was observed in some central and northern basins e g san joaquin cherry eleanor falls cr the stanislaus r basins and the yuba r as compared to the southern portion of the range where every basin west of the crest except the upper kaweah r had less than 200mm of streamflow fig 4c streamflow was also strongly elevation dependent with lower elevation basins producing less than 100mm the spatial pattern of h10 precipitation in 1977 is relatively smooth and the greatest basin mean precipitation is in the south in the kaweah r basin fig 4a in contrast inferred precipitation reflects the northerly and high elevation patterns of streamflow fig 4b thus h10 precipitation minus streamflow tends to be greater in the south than in the north while inferred precipitation minus streamflow is more spatially uniform fig 4d and e the north south difference is also highlighted in fig 4f we next investigate the differences in the long term mean spatial pattern between precipitation gauge based gridded datasets and precipitation inferred from streamflow to do so we use the prism 1971 2000 precipitation climatology which sets the long term spatial pattern in the h10 dataset we compare this against the mean annual inferred precipitation and streamflow using all years in which streamflow is available for each basin generally at least 30 for each basin while the resulting map fig 5 does not compare consistent time periods it is very similar to the map of h10 mean annual precipitation over the periods of streamflow data availability for each basin not shown because each basin has at least 30years of streamflow data it samples close to the full range of yearly variability the prism climatological precipitation pattern appears spatially smoother than the pattern of precipitation inferred from streamflow fig 5a and b the spatial pattern of average streamflow fig 5c shows the same strong gradients between windward and leeward basins seen in single water years while no basin has long term prism or h10 precipitation less than long term streamflow fig 5d streamflow does suggest very high runoff ratios based on prism precipitation for many windward high elevation basins fig 5f largely the same set of basins shows low values of prism climatological precipitation minus long term streamflow as in the 1983 case i e the san joaquin cherry eleanor and stanislaus basins 4 4 comparison to other precipitation gauge based gridded datasets for comparison we also plot the water year 1983 precipitation pattern of three other gridded datasets n15 l15 and nldas 2 against streamflow fig 6 qualitatively the patterns of precipitation across the three datasets are similar and are also similar to h10 though nldas 2 appears to have less precipitation across the sierra nevada than the other datasets and l15 appears to have somewhat more in fig 6d f a set of basins shows low values of precipitation minus streamflow the upper kaweah r basins the san joaquin r and granite cr cherry eleanor and falls cr the north fork of the stanislaus r and highland cr several of the small basins draining to lake tahoe duncan cr and the south fork of the yuba r this set of basins is quite similar to those with low h10 precipitation minus streamflow cf fig 3d suggesting that the spatial patterns of precipitation across different gridded datasets are relatively similar 4 5 cross range transects of precipitation and streamflow to resolve the spatial patterns of precipitation and streamflow with respect to the topography of the sierra nevada we plot them along two cross range transects fig 7 the first transect begins in the tuolumne r basin on the west slope and travels northeast through the walker r basin while the second begins in the mokelumne r basin passes through the north fork of the stanislaus r basin before crossing the range into the carson r basin given predominant cool season winds out of the southwest e g lundquist et al 2015 these transects pass from windward to leeward basins in the first transect fig 7b the greatest streamflow is found near the top of the windward slope in the cherry eleanor basin while steep declines to both the southwest big cr and in particular the northeast walker r are seen h10 precipitation generally places the greatest precipitation near the crest but the maximum is likely too little given observed streamflow fig 7c however h10 precipitation appears compatible with streamflow and nearly matches inferred precipitation in the big cr and the walker r basins in the second transect fig 7d streamflow also reaches its peak on the high windward face of the range in the north fork of the stanislaus r basin similar to the first transect h10 precipitation appears insufficient in this basin h10 precipitation is slightly less than streamflow in water year 1983 fig 7e also similar to the first transect the leeward basin east fork of the carson r has much better agreement between h10 and inferred precipitation but the lower elevation windward basin south fork of the mokelumne r has much greater h10 precipitation than inferred precipitation in both transects the higher elevation windward basins have generally southwest facing aspects winds from this direction encounter consistent upslope aspect and little upstream blocking conditions favorable for orographic enhancement roe 2005 4 6 interannual variability in spatial patterns of precipitation and streamflow by considering multiple stream gauges in the sierra nevada we can examine changes in the spatial pattern of streamflow and inferred precipitation from year to year for this analysis we select a subset of years and basins with complete records so differences between years are due to changes in streamflow and not due to changes in the set of basins we select 1974 1987 a period in which 43 basins have complete streamflow records fig 8 a within that set we identify 15 basins on the west slope of the sierra nevada that are potentially underestimated by the gridded datasets based on the findings in the previous sections and average these basins streamflow and precipitation to represent the windward portions of the range we identify 9 basins on the eastern side of the crest and average them to create a leeward group finally we divide the basins into northern and southern groups fig 8a the windward and leeward basins are also included in the appropriate northern and southern groups with these indices of streamflow and precipitation we can identify windward vs leeward and north vs south shifts between years in fig 8b and c we show windward leeward and north south ratios respectively of precipitation and streamflow streamflow is on average more than twice as great from the windward basins than from the leeward basins however the ratio varies from year to year with 1978 in particular showing greater windward streamflow relative to the lee of the range fig 8b this shift is reflected in the inferred precipitation which has a lower mean windward leeward ratio 1 7 but generally follows the variability in streamflow h10 windward leeward precipitation ratios however are between 1 25 and 1 5 suggesting a weaker rain shadow and show very little interannual variability north south ratios fig 8c shows substantial interannual variability with precipitation and streamflow twice as large in the northern portion of the range compared to the south in some years but near equal in others streamflow inferred precipitation and h10 precipitation track one another over this time period though agreement is worse during the 1976 and 1977 drought years the annual difference between precipitation and streamflow in the sierra nevada implies the actual evapotranspiration et as drainage to deep aquifers and changes in soil moisture storage are generally small compared to precipitation and streamflow in some studies et has been estimated from the differences between basin mean gridded precipitation and streamflow christensen et al 2008 lutz et al 2010 and so we plot implied et from the different basin groups under both h10 and inferred precipitation in fig 8d and e when considering windward leeward differences h10 precipitation implies that et is greater in the leeward basins than the windward basins fig 8d the difference between leeward and windward implied et in h10 is variable and appears larger in wetter water years 1978 1982 and 1983 however inferred precipitation implies that windward et is greater than leeward et by a fairly constant margin there is greater agreement between h10 and inferred precipitation regarding north south differences in implied et fig 8e both datasets generally show greater et in the northern basins though in some years this is not the case for the h10 dataset we discuss patterns of et in more detail in section 5 4 7 trends in precipitation and streamflow using a subset of basins with at least 90 complete streamflow records over the study period 1950 2010 we calculate trends in the water year totals of observed streamflow h10 basin mean precipitation and inferred basin mean precipitation while there are fewer basins with sufficiently long and complete records to conduct the trend analysis the spatial patterns of precipitation and streamflow trends can still be discerned fig 9 trends in h10 precipitation show a strong north south divide the kern and kaweah basins in the south have positive precipitation trends while all basins to the north have declines of 5 15 in contrast inferred precipitation fig 9b shows increases in precipitation over the central sierra nevada in the merced and san joaquin basins weaker trends in the southern portion of the domain and decreases in the northern basins in general this follows from the observed streamflow trends which are most positive over the central sierra nevada and are negative for all basins from the mokelumne r northward fig 9c the trends in h10 precipitation inferred precipitation and streamflow are all significantly correlated with latitude p 0 10 two tailed student s t test however the differences between the h10 and inferred precipitation trends are greatest over the central sierra nevada fig 9d thus from 1950 to 2010 streamflow appears to have increased over the sierra nevada from approximately yosemite national park southward while the northern sierra nevada has seen declines in precipitation streamflow and swe the h10 dataset appears to capture some though not all of these shifts in spatial patterns while it does show the positive trends in precipitation in the southern sierra nevada it does not capture the correct sign or magnitude of the increasing precipitation inferred over the central basins in particular the san joaquin merced and walker basins 5 discussion 5 1 precipitation minus streamflow and et estimates the approach used here to infer precipitation from streamflow essentially forces basin water balance closure and thus assumes that precipitation is the sum of observed streamflow and modeled actual et using the flexible precipitation input outlined in previous sections therefore inferred precipitation represents a physically based estimate of basin mean precipitation given streamflow observations fig 2 and earlier studies using this framework make it clear that this formulation does produce uncertainties in the absolute amounts of inferred precipitation due to uncertainties in hydrologic model structure and the parameterization of fluxes such as percolation and et the absolute inferred precipitation quantities presented here should be viewed with some care due to the uncertainty in inferred et however year to year and basin to basin variability of inferred precipitation appear more robust than the absolute amount of inferred precipitation henn et al 2015 while each fuse model structure has a bias relative to the others this bias is quite consistent across water years and basins so we interpret the spatial pattern of inferred precipitation as well as the yearly wet versus dry differences in inferred precipitation as based on physical signals in contrast gridded precipitation products such as h10 leverage available precipitation observations to produce interpolated patterns but interpolating gauge observations to a grid is a statistical process not a physical one and as such is subject to associated uncertainty given these considerations it is reasonable to check precipitation minus streamflow from both approaches against available observations and estimates of actual et over the sierra nevada however measurements of et over the sierra nevada are few and uncertainty is high observational studies have estimated actual et to be between 400 and 800mmyr 1 at the point scale goulden et al 2012 ichii et al 2009 kurpius et al 2003 stephenson 1998 studies of forest cover and soils have shown that deep rooting allows trees and vegetation to access water stored in weathered bedrock bales et al 2011 rose et al 2003 allowing for greater et and maintenance of forests despite shallow 1m soils and nearly precipitation free summers in the sierra nevada s mediterranean climate however et observations are exclusively made at the point scale in or over forest cover and the extrapolation to spatially distributed basin mean et has significant uncertainty goulden et al 2012 and goulden and bales 2014 developed a relationship between the normalized difference vegetation index ndvi observed by the moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer modis and observations of actual et at multiple flux towers in california and used it to estimate basin mean et and elevational gradients of et basin scale studies can also infer et through consideration of precipitation and streamflow but both must be known well since et is the remainder of two generally larger terms our findings suggest that in many basins gridded precipitation datasets may have too much uncertainty to apply this approach to reliably infer et a two year water balance study in the forested southern sierra critical zone observatory ssczo in the kings r basin bales et al 2011 estimated et to be 760mmyr 1 this suggests that basin mean et is generally less than point estimates made in forests presumably due to the areas of limited transpiration i e rock snow and grasses another two year water balance study of an above treeline kaweah basin found et of 400mmyr 1 kattelmann and elder 1991 the relationship between forest and basin mean et may depend on the fraction of forest cover in the basin in fig 10 we consider preciptiation minus streamflow from the different precipitation data sources against observation based estimates of et over the sierra nevada we plot long term average precipitation and streamflow against each basin s mean elevation in fig 10a the distribution of precipitation with elevation for h10 shows an increase at lower elevations then a maximum at perhaps 2000m followed by a slight decline above that elevation the pattern for streamflow and inferred precipitation is more sensitive to elevation streamflow increases rapidly from the lower elevation basins up to 2000 2500m there are few basins above this elevation inferred precipitation follows a similar pattern but with a positive offset from streamflow precipitation minus streamflow fig 10b for h10 shows a general decline with elevation with the negative values noted above apparent at 1800 2400m in elevation however inferred precipitation minus streamflow is much less sensitive to elevation with most values at all elevations between 400 and 800mmyr 1 presumably reflecting a relatively constant pattern of et in the fuse models across the basins point observations of et from the sierra nevada are plotted against elevation in fig 10c including estimates from ameriflux tower sites ichii et al 2009 kurpius et al 2003 and ssczo flux towers and basin water balance bales et al 2011 goulden et al 2012 we also apply the regression of et against modis ndvi from goulden et al 2012 to estimate basin mean et for each of the streamflow basin gray circles using the mean modis ndvi from water year 2003 collectively these observations show that et likely peaks in the middle elevations 1000 2000m with declines at higher and lower elevations we can interpret this difference given arguments about et over the elevation range of the sierra nevada while higher colder basin have shorter growing seasons and less pet they also have greater water availability compared to lower elevation basins due to greater precipitation given the sierra nevada s arid summers and shallow soils actual et is generally driven more by water availability than pet i e the climate is generally more water limited at all but the highest elevations the resulting tradeoffs appear to favor the greatest actual et in the middle elevations particularly on the windward side christensen et al 2008 goulden et al 2012 which is also where the greatest forest cover is located stephenson 1998 the ndvi based approach in particular suggests that there is less et 400mmyr 1 in high elevation and leeward basins however because goulden et al 2012 based their regression on flux towers that are located primarily at sites at lower elevations and in more arid regions than the high sierra nevada they note that it may underestimate et in energy limited alpine areas where ndvi is not a strong indicator of water availability for example studies of evaporation and sublimation from the snowpack in the sierra nevada have estimated it to be from near zero to 300 400mmyr 1 the substantial uncertainty is due to a lack of direct measurements leydecker and melack 1999 thus the ndvi based estimates are probably best considered as a lower bound of et in the higher elevation basins in the lower row of fig 10 we plot the spatial pattern of precipitation minus streamflow from h10 d inferred precipitation minus streamflow e and et from the ndvi based regression f the spatial patterns exhibit significant differences with h10 and inferred precipitation showing greater precipitation minus streamflow than ndvi based et over many of the higher elevation basins in the central and southern sierra nevada as well as east of the crest the different estimates also suggest that the precipitation inferred from streamflow using the fuse models may overestimate high elevation et in basins with little vegetative cover however the ndvi based approach does suggest that basins of similar elevation and forest cover e g the tuolumne and merced basins in the central portion of the range have similar amounts of et while the ndvi based et amounts are less than inferred precipitation minus streamflow these spatial patterns of variability fig 10e and f are more similar than the h10 pattern fig 10d the ndvi based approach does not support aspects of the h10 dataset in which certain basins e g cherry eleanor have much less precipitation minus streamflow than basins of similar elevation or that et is greater on the leeward slope of the sierra nevada as compared to the windward slope we interpret those features of the h10 dataset to be more likely due to underestimation of precipitation in grid interpolation 5 2 estimation of regional hydro climatology from streamflow data these findings contribute to our understanding of regional orographically driven precipitation patterns the basins with the highest rates of inferred precipitation tend to follow certain orientations specifically facing southwest on ridges that protrude west from the main crest of the sierra nevada this provides information about where upslope flow must occur during winter storms and may aid in validation of precipitation forecast models it also highlights the challenges in using interpolation approaches to map spatial patterns of precipitation over topography the maps figs 3 6 and transect plots fig 7 of the difference between gridded and inferred precipitation yield several consistent spatial patterns first the likely underestimation of precipitation by h10 occurs over higher elevation windward basins with generally southwest aspect duncan cr cole cr the north fork of the stanislaus r and highland cr cherry eleanor and falls cr granite cr and the san joaquin r and the marble fork and main stem of the kaweah r lower elevation basins on the west slope basins in the far southern sierra nevada and basins east of the crest generally show better agreement or even potential overestimation by h10 this pattern is illustrated in fig 7 which shows the greatest disagreement occurring in relatively high elevation windward basins the apparent enhancement and mainly southwestern aspect of these basins agrees with findings that the predominant moisture transport into the sierra nevada is from low level southwesterly winds during cool season storms e g lundquist et al 2015 given that these findings are essentially the result of basins with higher streamflow than others at similar elevation and latitude figs 3 5 7 and 10 the reliability of the streamflow observations deserves consideration streamflow measurements are subject to uncertainty in the rating curve and depth measurements which produce instantaneous errors in flow measurement and may lead to biases if not validated with reliable instream flow measurements however we consider the likelihood of large long term biases in streamflow data to be relatively small assuming that the gauges are well maintained and that the usgs considers the records to be of reasonable quality it is possible that any individual gauge has a substantial bias however the patterns of streamflow seen in figs 3 5 appear to be spatially coherent they exhibit as a generally north to south wet to dry pattern and appears to favor southwest facing basins with no upstream blocking the apparent enhancement in these topographically favored basins is supported by theoretical and observational studies of relatively small scale precipitation patterns in complex terrain anders et al 2007 frei and schar 1998 minder et al 2008 roe 2005 mountainous areas receiving the greatest precipitation generally are those in which prevailing moisture bearing winds are forced upslope due to favorable topographic aspect these factors suggest that the long term streamflow measurements are relatively robust the patterns appear also fairly consistent in time across the water years surveyed and in the long term average pattern thus there may be low bias in the spatial mean pattern of precipitation in the gridded datasets which in h10 and most similar datasets is set to match prism precipitation climatology other prism based gridded datasets l15 nldas 2 show relatively similar patterns of potential underestimation fig 6 suggesting that this climatology may be a source of the underestimation prism uses a detailed topographic interpolation scheme that reflects the spatially variable relationship between precipitation and elevation on slopes of different aspect and of different exposure to prevailing moisture sources however it ultimately relies on gauge observations as well as april 1 snow course observations in some cases where gauges are sparse in the sierra nevada to obtain the elevation precipitation relationship if there are few or no gauges on certain preferential slopes where air parcels are forced upward due to aspect and topographic convergence roe 2005 it will be difficult for the regression to capture these local maxima the central and southern sierra nevada have few gauges and high topographic complexity and as a result topographic interpolation may underestimate precipitation for some basins in these areas because many datasets use prism climatology to establish the mean spatial pattern of precipitation over complex terrain the potential biases seen in figs 3 6 do not just apply to the h10 dataset but to a broader array of gridded precipitation products in fact even the gridded precipitation dataset that does not rely on prism n15 shows a relatively similar spatial pattern of precipitation given these findings it appears that underestimation of local precipitation maxima in complex terrain could be a widespread feature of gridded precipitation datasets in contrast we note that wrf precipitation may better represent precipitation in some of the basins with high observed streamflow as seen in the cherry eleanor example and in sierra wide maps of water year total precipitation fig 2 the wrf simulation has greater precipitation than the gridded datasets particularly for northern and high elevation windward basins wrf patterns of precipitation minus streamflow did not show low values in the basins where underestimation is likely in h10 and the other gridded datasets this suggests that wrf is capturing the dynamics of local orographic enhancement and may better reproduce local maxima in streamflow some studies argue that wrf precipitation over mountains is generally too high caldwell et al 2009 grubišić et al 2005 and the wrf data shown here do produce high values of precipitation minus streamflow overall but given that gridded precipitation datasets are usually used to evaluate wrf it appears possible that the apparent wet biases in wrf in some areas actually may be dry biases in the gridded products 6 conclusions from the comparison between streamflow from 56 long term largely unimpaired sierra nevada stream gauges gridded precipitation and precipitation inferred from streamflow over water years 1950 2010 we draw the following conclusions 1 there are differences between the mean spatial pattern of gridded precipitation in h10 and other gridded datasets most of which are set by prism climatology and the spatial pattern of precipitation inferred from streamflow in particular streamflow implies greater precipitation in higher elevation southwest facing basins than is seen in h10 and other gridded datasets 2 the spatial and temporal variability of precipitation inferred from streamflow e g precipitation gradients over the crest of the sierra nevada is higher than in h10 gridded precipitation while absolute uncertainties in inferred precipitation are relatively high the spatial patterns are relatively robust such that the gradients in streamflow also likely represent gradients in the precipitation pattern 3 the relationship between implied actual et precipitation minus streamflow across the crest of the sierra nevada is different between the gridded precipitation dataset and inferred precipitation h10 implies actual et is similar or greater in a set of basins to the lee of the crest relative to a set on the windward side while implied actual et is greater on the windward side with inferred precipitation 4 1950 2010

7600,given uncertainty in precipitation gauge based gridded datasets over complex terrain we use multiple streamflow observations as an additional source of information about precipitation in order to identify spatial and temporal differences between a gridded precipitation dataset and precipitation inferred from streamflow we test whether gridded datasets capture across crest and regional spatial patterns of variability as well as year to year variability and trends in precipitation in comparison to precipitation inferred from streamflow we use a bayesian model calibration routine with multiple lumped hydrologic model structures to infer the most likely basin mean water year total precipitation for 56 basins with long term 30year streamflow records in the sierra nevada mountain range of california we compare basin mean precipitation derived from this approach with basin mean precipitation from a precipitation gauge based 1 16 gridded dataset that has been used to simulate and evaluate trends in western united states streamflow and snowpack over the 20th century we find that the long term average spatial patterns differ in particular there is less precipitation in the gridded dataset in higher elevation basins whose aspect faces prevailing cool season winds as compared to precipitation inferred from streamflow in a few years and basins there is less gridded precipitation than there is observed streamflow lower elevation southern and east of crest basins show better agreement between gridded and inferred precipitation implied actual evapotranspiration calculated as precipitation minus streamflow then also varies between the streamflow based estimates and the gridded dataset absolute uncertainty in precipitation inferred from streamflow is substantial but the signal of basin to basin and year to year differences are likely more robust the findings suggest that considering streamflow when spatially distributing precipitation in complex terrain may improve its representation particularly for basins whose orientations e g windward facing are favored for orographic precipitation enhancement keywords precipitation orographic enhancement

mid latitudes develop snowpack that is critical for water resources and ecosystems services thus they serve as water towers for the world viviroli et al 2007 over complex terrain in the mid latitudes precipitation observations are generally limited to in situ gauge observations due to challenges in remote sensing of mountain precipitation with ground based radar westrick et al 1999 and satellite based methods lettenmaier et al 2015 as a result it has been necessary to develop methods to distribute or interpolate gauge based observations across the landscape to a grid e g daly et al 2008 newman et al 2015 thornton et al 1997 while attempting to account for the strong topographic influences on spatiotemporal patterns of precipitation roe 2005 large uncertainties can occur during estimation of spatially distributed precipitation e g gutmann et al 2012 livneh et al 2014 due to both sparse and uncertain gauge data in mountainous areas lundquist et al 2003 rasmussen et al 2011a sieck et al 2007 and uncertainty in the interpolation of gauge data to a grid clark and slater 2006 as a result it may be useful to apply other types of observations and estimates to infer precipitation in these areas and reduce potential errors in gridded datasets streamflow observations offer an additional method with which to infer precipitation patterns and evaluate gridded precipitation datasets streamflow has been used to correct gridded precipitation products for high elevation underestimation at the global scale adam et al 2006 to evaluate sources of precipitation data wayand et al 2013 and precipitation distribution schemes le moine et al 2015 livneh et al 2014 at the basin scale and to identify errors in precipitation forcing data in hydrologic models mcmillan et al 2011b renard et al 2010 in general these studies have shown that substantial errors in spatially distributed precipitation can be identified through a comparison with observed streamflow henn et al 2015 developed an approach for inferring basin mean precipitation from streamflow in the yosemite national park region of the sierra nevada mountain range of california and tested the sensitivity of the inferred precipitation from this approach to various assumptions their approach uses bayesian calibration of simple snow and hydrologic models to estimate the most likely water year total precipitation in a basin given daily streamflow observations this approach calibrates the models to match streamflow under uncertain precipitation inputs the models estimating the actual evapotranspiration et needed to close the basin s water balance they used a small ensemble of six hydrologic model structures to estimate the uncertainty of the inferred precipitation associated with model structural assumptions based on seven yosemite area basins tested in henn et al 2015 they concluded that streamflow allows for robustly inferring the climatological patterns of precipitation across the mountain range i e identifying wetter and dryer areas within the range streamflow also highlighted annual variability between wet and dry years they also found that long term inferred basin mean precipitation disagreed by up to 25 with parameter regression on independent slopes model prism daly et al 1994 2002 2008 precipitation climatology however the absolute amounts of inferred precipitation are sensitive to the model structures used to simulate the basins suggesting that this approach is only suited for identifying errors greater than 100mmyr 1 in spatially distributed precipitation estimates 1 2 study objectives and contents this paper further develops the approach of henn et al 2015 and extends it to a spatial domain encompassing a large mountain range we describe a streamflow dataset from the sierra nevada the method for inferring precipitation from streamflow and a set of experiments to compare inferred precipitation against the gridded precipitation dataset we apply the approach of inferring precipitation from streamflow in 56 basins in the sierra nevada that have largely unimpaired long term streamflow observations we do this to compare inferred precipitation against the hamlet et al 2010 1 16 gridded daily precipitation dataset hereafter h10 over water years 1950 2010 we choose this dataset as it has been used to resolve spatial patterns and trends in western united states snowpack and streamflow hamlet et al 2005 2007 and because it explicitly attempts to reduce temporal inhomogeneity by using long term station records to control trends in the precipitation data hamlet and lettenmaier 2005 it also utilizes prism precipitation climatology as its long term mean spatial pattern in order to account for topographic effects we do this to identify patterns of where and when precipitation estimates diverge in the sierra nevada based on examinations of differences between gridded precipitation datasets we hypothesize that areas of high elevation and complex terrain where precipitation gauge density is low may have substantial biases in gridded precipitation datasets and these biases can be identified by precipitation inferred from streamflow research on orographic precipitation has shown that properly oriented topography can induce steep spatial gradients in precipitation rates roe 2005 we hypothesize that these biases may be greatest in areas that are favorable for orographic precipitation enhancement where interpolation may tend to perform poorly we use precipitation inferred from streamflow to evaluate whether gridded precipitation datasets capture areas of orographic enhancement the ratios of windward to leeward precipitation i e rain shadows year to year variability in the spatial patterns of precipitation and long term trends in basin mean precipitation we are unaware of previous studies that have used many distributed streamflow observations to infer orographic precipitation patterns over a mountain range we use 56 stream gauges distributed over a 400km long mountain range both on the windward and leeward slopes and we use streamflow observations that span multiple decades at each gauge thus we are able to consider both annual spatial patterns of streamflow and precipitation as well as year to year variability and long term trends in those patterns unlike henn et al 2015 here we develop quantitative estimates of prior uncertainty in basin mean precipitation for bayesian inference by considering the agreement or lack thereof between independent precipitation data sources for each basin for example numerical weather prediction of precipitation over complex terrain has improved in fidelity as models have been run at higher resolution and with more process based microphysical parameterizations e g rasmussen et al 2011b the weather research and forecasting model wrf skamarock and klemp 2008 has been shown to generate precipitation estimates that are equal or better in terms of simulated hydrologic responses as compared to gauge based gridded precipitation in some mountain basins gutmann et al 2012 wayand et al 2013 thus we consider wrf precipitation as a source of information about the patterns of precipitation over complex terrain we also consider a gridded precipitation dataset newman et al 2015 that does not depend on prism climatology along with the h10 dataset as part of our prior estimate of basin mean precipitation sections 2 and 3 describe the data and models respectively used in the inference of precipitation from streamflow section 4 presents the results of the precipitation inference and the comparison against the gridded dataset section 5 discusses the implications of the differences between gridded and inferred precipitation and the potential value of streamflow observations for gridded precipitation datasets section 6 offers conclusions from the study 2 data in this section we describe the data used to compare h10 gridded precipitation with precipitation inferred from streamflow unimpaired daily streamflow observations basin topography and soils information gridded precipitation data from several sources and gridded temperature and evapotranspiration data 2 1 streamflow and basins for comparison against precipitation we identify 56 basins in the sierra nevada fig 1 table 1 in which daily streamflow observations have been made for extended periods of time forty one of the gauges are west of the crest of the sierra nevada and 15 are on the east slope streamflow observations included in this study have at least 30 water years of complete or nearly complete records between 1950 and 2010 in a few cases we include stream gauges with 20 30years of data because they are in areas with few gauges the southeastern sierra nevada thirty one of the 56 continue to operate and 34 are listed in the hydro climate data network hcdn of basins without significant regulation from dams or diversions to agricultural or domestic use slack and landwehr 1992 we also include 22 basins not in the hcdn but with relatively few or small impairments based on descriptions provided by the united states geological survey usgs water data reports for each site anderson et al 1996 rockwell et al 1996a 1996b in a few cases we include basins with upstream dam regulation so long as the storage was small compared to annual runoff volumes or the regulation effect could be removed from the streamflow record because complete storage records were available we exclude most stream gauges with observations that were described as having poor quality by the usgs 3 gauges in the southeastern sierra nevada rated poor big pine cr independence cr and cottonwood cr were included due to a lack of other gauges in this area all streamflow data were downloaded from the usgs national water information system web interface http waterdata usgs gov nwis sw with the exception of two basins cherry eleanor and the tuolumne river at hetch hetchy in which full natural flows were provided by the operator of the reservoirs at the basin outlets hetch hetchy water and power hhwp see supplemental material of henn et al 2015 more detailed information on the individual stream gauges and their associated basins is included in table 1 the usgs streamflow measurements are made by translating direct stream stage measurements into discharge via streamflow rating curves rating curves are developed and updated using manual measurements of discharge but they are subject to uncertainty discharge uncertainty due to rating curve errors have been estimated at 10 for observations of good quality and 15 for fair records rockwell et al 1996a in that 95 of the daily measurements should fall within the stated margin of error while studies of other rating curve based streamflow techniques have suggested uncertainties of up to 20 40 at very high flows baldassarre and montanari 2009 we are primarily interested in precipitation and runoff over timescales of a water year or longer and so we presume the usgs estimates to be a reasonable representation of uncertainty topographical boundaries of the basins are delineated based on 30m usgs elevation data which are also used to calculate basin area distributions within 100m elevation bands the basins areas table 1 range from 10 1km2 daggett cr to 3472km2 kings r the median basin area is 165km2 the basins mean elevations range from 744m white r to 3457m middle fork of bishop cr most basins span at least 1000m in elevation we use typical basin soil properties to provide information for the lumped hydrologic model in the inference of precipitation from streamflow section 3 most of the basins are near the crest of the sierra nevada and have steep topography that is underlain by granitic bedrock typical soils in glaciated areas near the crest are shallow and sandy with a depth of no more than 1m and a porosity of about 0 4 nrcs 2007 though water is likely available for evapotranspiration from deeper in the soil bedrock interface goulden et al 2012 rose et al 2003 field studies have indicated that soils in higher elevation areas of the sierra nevada have high porosities 0 3 0 55 and conductivities 1cm to 1md 1 typical of sand and gravel but that values decline with depth approaching the underlying bedrock and that soils are deeper and more heterogeneous in lower elevation areas further from the crest bales et al 2011 flint et al 2008 holbrook et al 2014 calibration ranges for the hydrologic model soil parameters section 3 reflect these values 2 2 gridded precipitation to force the hydrologic models time series of precipitation temperature and potential evapotranspiration pet are needed for each basin here we describe the gridded precipitation datasets that provide the precipitation forcing data temperature and pet data sources are described in section 2 3 2 2 1 h10 precipitation we use the h10 daily precipitation dataset as a basis for comparison with streamflow and precipitation inferred from streamflow the dataset uses national weather service cooperative observer nws coop daily precipitation gauge observations and the prism 1971 2000 monthly precipitation climatology daly et al 1994 2002 2008 as a topographic corrector in the interpolation of gauge precipitation over complex terrain we choose this dataset because of its relatively high spatial resolution 1 16 6km and long term span 1915 2010 over california and because h10 and its predecessors have been used to simulate snow and streamflow in western united states e g mote et al 2005 however we note that other long term daily gridded datasets livneh et al 2015 prism climate group 2015 are also available we use h10 data covering water years 1950 2010 water year 1949 is used for model spin up over a spatial domain which covers the streamflow basins from 121 5 w to 117 5 w and from 35 5 n to 40 n for each basin we calculate the fraction of each h10 grid cell that is within the basin and calculate the h10 basin mean time series as the weighted sum of the grid cells precipitation we use this daily time series of precipitation combined with a multiplicative precipitation scaling factor inferred in calibration to force the hydrologic and snow models that are the basis for inferring precipitation from streamflow for each basin see section 3 2 2 2 n15 wrf and other precipitation datasets in order to estimate the uncertainty of the h10 precipitation estimates and how the uncertainty varies across the sierra nevada we also examine independently generated gridded precipitation data a quantitative estimate of precipitation and its associated uncertainty is necessary for the bayesian inference of precipitation from streamflow see section 3 for one additional source of precipitation information we use the n15 dataset newman et al 2015 while it interpolates gauge data in a qualitatively similar manner to h10 it does not use prism precipitation climatology as a topographic corrector and thus may be a more independent estimate from h10 than other prism based datasets n15 is a 100 member ensemble dataset such that uncertainty in the data can be explicitly quantified n15 uses a 1 8 12km spatial grid and so there may be greater topographic smoothing compared to the 1 16 datasets second we use wrf model skamarock and klemp 2008 daily precipitation totals over california the regional wrf simulations were generated using wrf version 3 6 0 skamarock et al 2008 to dynamically downscale the north american regional reanalysis narr with a methodology very similar to that used in hughes et al 2012 the wrf downscaling has two nested domains with an outer 18km grid extending across the northeastern pacific and much of the u s intermountain west and a 6km grid domain that covers all of california similar to fig 1 of hughes et al 2012 both domains have 82 vertical levels with 50 75m vertical resolution within the lowest 2km of atmosphere with model top at 100hpa both domains use morrison double moment microphysics morrison et al 2009 dudhia shortwave radiation dudhia 1989 and rrtm longwave radiation mlawer et al 1997 called every 6min kain fritsch convective parameterization kain 2004 the yonsei university planetary boundary layer scheme hong et al 2006 and the noah land surface model tewari et al 2004 wrf data were generated for 11 calendar years 2004 2014 and over this time period the model was re initialized approximately every 5days using narr data with the first three hours of each 5 day period discarded as model spin up the model is run with a 30s 10s time step in the 18km 6km domain for precipitation output data are aggregated to daily totals for both the n15 and wrf precipitation gridded precipitation is aggregated to single time series for each basin using the fractional grid cells approach described above for h10 for comparison we also briefly examine two other gridded precipitation datasets livneh et al 2015 hereafter l15 and north american land data assimilation system phase 2 cosgrove et al 2003 mitchell et al 2004 xia et al 2012 hereafter nldas 2 we include these datasets to see whether patterns of differences between gridded and inferred precipitation are consistent across different gridding methodologies while each gauge based gridded dataset considered here varies in the set of precipitation gauges used all of them with the exception of n15 use prism climatology as a topographic corrector thus we hypothesize that spatial patterns of inferred precipitation may be fairly consistent across the gauge based datasets 2 3 temperature and potential evapotranspiration in addition to precipitation time series of daily mean temperature and pet are needed to force the hydrologic models that are run for each basin for temperature we calculate basin mean time series of daily high and low temperature from the h10 data in the same fashion as for precipitation and average the high and low temperatures to create a daily mean temperature series pet is estimated using the makkink equation which uses temperature and shortwave radiation as predictors e g cristea et al 2013 the bristow campbell parameterization is used to estimate shortwave radiation from temperature bristow and campbell 1984 we calibrate the bristow campbell and makkink methods using data from the dana meadows meteorological station 2987m above sea level in yosemite national park for water years 2003 through 2009 shortwave radiation and temperature are used to calibrate the bristow campbell coefficients a 0 7 and c 2 49 shortwave radiation wind speed temperature and relative humidity are applied to estimate pet using the penman monteith equation following the methods of allen et al 1998 this pet estimate is then used to calibrate the makkink coefficient 0 668 h10 daily high and low temperatures for each grid cell are used with the approach above to estimate daily pet at each grid cell in the spatial domain the grid cells pet are then aggregated to basin mean pet series for each basin due to reduced diurnal temperature range at higher elevations in the h10 data pet calculated in this way decreases somewhat with elevation such that 1000m elevation has roughly 20 more pet than 3000m elevation about 1200mmyr 1 vs 1000mmyr 1 though there is substantial grid cell variation for a given elevation henn et al 2015 found that inferred precipitation and inferred actual evapotranspiration are only mildly sensitive to pet presumably due to the largely water limited climate of the sierra nevada so we do not investigate the effects of pet further here 3 methods to infer basin mean water year total precipitation from daily streamflow observations the following steps are applied h10 based precipitation temperature and pet forcing data are used to drive snow and hydrologic models for each basin and produce simulated streamflow time series we simulate all water years from 1950 to 2010 for which streamflow observations are available for each basin at least one water year before the start of the analysis i e 1949 for basins with streamflow in 1950 is used for model spin up and is discarded the parameters of the models include a multiplicative error correction kavetski et al 2003 on the precipitation time series along with snow and soil parameters the simulated runoff is compared to the observed streamflow record and based on the goodness of fit of the streamflow and the prior likelihood of the model parameters the bayesian joint posterior distribution of the parameters is generated from the posterior distribution of the precipitation multiplier the corrected basin mean precipitation can then be calculated this section describes the snow and hydrologic models and the calibration routine used to infer precipitation from streamflow for a more detailed description of this approach see henn et al 2015 their fig 1 and their section 3 3 1 models 3 1 1 hydrologic model structures we use the framework for understanding structural errors fuse clark et al 2008 to provide a set of conceptual hydrologic models and to evaluate the effects of model structural uncertainty on inferred precipitation clark et al 2011 mcmillan et al 2011a fuse provides multiple options for representing soil moisture storage and fluxes such as et surface runoff and baseflow using a spatially lumped approach with upper and lower soil storages streamflow soil moisture and et time series are simulated at a daily time step in this study multiple fuse structures are included to estimate the uncertainty of the precipitation inferred from streamflow we use six model structures previously used to investigate the impact of structure on model performance in the mahurangi basin in new zealand clark et al 2011 mcmillan et al 2011a and to infer precipitation from streamflow observations for greater details on the fuse model structures see henn et al 2015 and clark et al 2008 3 1 2 snow model each fuse structure is coupled to a temperature index snow model based on snow 17 anderson 2006 which tracks snow water equivalent swe based on precipitation and melt precipitation is added to swe if the air temperature is below a threshold otherwise it is treated as rain snowmelt is initiated if the air temperature is above a threshold and is proportional to the temperature above that point 1 sm max min f t t 0 swe 0 where sm is snowmelt per time step f is the snowmelt factor t is the air temperature and t 0 is the melt threshold temperature the melt factor f varies in a sinusoidal manner over the year with minimum and maximum values on the winter and summer solstices respectively the rain snow partition temperature melt initiation temperature and winter and summer melt factors are all inferred parameters snowmelt is combined with rainfall and the two are routed to the soil model which otherwise simulates fluxes and storages independently of the snow model h10 basin mean precipitation is corrected for errors using a precipitation multiplier m t where the subscript t indicates the daily time step 2 p t m t p f t here p f t is the h10 basin mean precipitation m t is the multiplier and p t is the model input precipitation all at time t the multipliers are defined such that they are different for each water year but constant within the water year and each yearly multiplier is inferred in calibration in this way we infer water year precipitation from streamflow in order to simulate the strong elevation dependence of snow in the sierra nevada the snow model is run at 100m elevation bands for each basin unlike the soil model which is lumped over the entire basin for each band h10 temperature is lapsed to the ith band midpoint elevation 3 t i t f γ z i z f where t i is the ith band temperature t f is the h10 temperature z i is the band midpoint elevation z f is the basin s mean elevation because basin mean temperature forcing are used and γ is the temporally invariant temperature lapse rate 0 ckm 1 which is also inferred in calibration finally water fluxes to the lumped soil model are calculated by a weighted average of rain plus snowmelt from each elevation band 4 f soil i 1 n bands af i r i sm i where f soil is the flux of water to the soil model and af i is the fraction of the basin area r i is the rain and sm i is the snowmelt all from band i unlike in henn et al 2015 we do not use an orographic precipitation gradient opg to distribute precipitation to the basins elevation bands and infer intra basin precipitation distributions instead the multiplier corrected precipitation is distributed evenly to each elevation band this is done because the results of those studies indicated that the inference was likely not able to discern intra basin precipitation patterns almost all inferred opgs were at or near zero thus precipitation inferred from streamflow represents the basin mean amount for each water year the actual precipitation distribution is of course spatially variable within each basin and distributing the mean precipitation values from this study would be more complex in basins with greater topographic relief we choose to use a temperature index snow model instead of a full energy balance snow model we calibrate the precipitation forcing data which has large effects on the snow simulation e g raleigh et al 2015 the precipitation uncertainty likely overwhelms any improvement in snow simulation that might be gained from using an energy balance model additionally temperature index models have fewer tunable parameters than energy balance models the additional parameters of an energy balance model would increase the computational burden and parametric uncertainty in the bayesian inference described below 3 2 bayesian model calibration 3 2 1 bayesian inference of precipitation we infer basin mean precipitation from streamflow using bayes theorem with the bayesian total error analysis package batea kavetski et al 2006a the joint posterior probability density function pdfs of the multipliers m and other model parameters θ the snow and soil parameters and the lapse rate given observed precipitation p and streamflow q are described by 5 p m θ q p p q m θ p p m θ the first product term on the right hand side of 5 is the likelihood function which describes the probability distribution of the observed streamflow given particular values of m θ and the observed gauge precipitation p the likelihood function interprets the difference between observed and simulated streamflow using an error model the second product term in 5 is composed of the prior distributions of the precipitation multiplier and other model parameters the posterior distribution of the precipitation multiplier and the model parameters p m θ q p is an update of the prior distributions given streamflow and precipitation observations we use a weighted least squares wls residual error model to translate differences between modeled and observed streamflow into the likelihood of the corresponding parameter sets in the wls approach it is assumed that higher streamflow is subject to greater uncertainty unlike simple least squares in which all time steps are treated equally following thyer et al 2009 we assume that model residual streamflow errors follow a gaussian distribution with zero mean and a standard deviation that is a linear function of streamflow i e 6 σ t a q t b where a and b are residual error parameters inferred in the calibration and q t is the modeled streamflow at a given time step t the error model calculates likelihood inversely to the sum of the squared differences between observed and modeled streamflow which are first normalized at each time step by σ t the combination of the soil snow and yearly multiplier parameters results in a parameter space with 50 80 dimensions and so to sample the posterior probability distributions multiple start quasi newton optimization and a monte carlo markov chain mcmc routine are used within batea kavetski et al 2006b the result of the mcmc sampling routine is an ensemble of parameter sets with more samples clustered around parameter values of greater posterior probability 3 2 2 parameter prior distributions to constrain the inference within the bayesian framework prior distributions are placed on the multiplier and each hydrologic and snow model parameter we use similar snow and soil parameter distributions as in henn et al 2015 uniform distributions are used and when no information is available about a parameter in the study domain the distribution is set to the default limits for the fuse model clark et al 2008 for more details on the soil and snow model parameters see table 1 of henn et al 2015 the prior distributions of the precipitation multipliers are normal distributions and each yearly multiplier is independent of the others we use estimates of each basin s mean precipitation and the differences in precipitation estimates between h10 n15 and wrf to set the mean and standard deviation of the multipliers prior distribution for the mean of the prior distribution we use 7 μ m p h 10 p n 15 p wrf 3 p h 10 where p h 10 p n 15 and p wrf are the h10 n15 and wrf basin mean precipitation for the water year n15 precipitation is the mean of the ensembles for each basin 7 is applied over each water year from 2005 to 2010 and then averaged in other words the mean of the prior distribution for each basin is the average of the three datasets precipitation divided by the h10 precipitation this is an a priori guess of how h10 precipitation might be corrected before considering streamflow see h10 n15 and wrf precipitation in fig 2 a and b for the standard deviation of the distribution we use 8 σ m 1 p 1 3 p h 10 p 2 p n 15 p 2 p wrf p 2 where p is the mean precipitation of the three datasets or 9 p μ m p h 10 thus the standard deviation of the multiplier prior distribution is the standard deviation of basin precipitation in h10 n15 and wrf normalized by the mean of the three as with the mean 8 is applied to estimate the standard deviation for each year from 2005 to 2010 and then averaged this process is repeated for each of the basins thus we use the agreement between the three datasets or lack thereof to estimate the prior distribution of uncertainty in precipitation for a given basin all multipliers are drawn from the same prior distribution but each year s multiplier is unique and independent of the other years multipliers to illustrate this process for the cherry eleanor basin the three datasets precipitation time series are shown in fig 2a and are mapped for water year 2008 in fig 2b d the h10 precipitation is generally less than n15 and wrf and so the mean prior estimate of the multiplier is 1 48 for this basin the disagreement between the different datasets is also relatively high compared to other basins with the three sources of precipitation spanning 600 800mmyr 1 therefore the relative standard deviation of the prior distribution is set to reflect this at 0 26 together with the mean this indicates that prior to considering streamflow we expect basin mean precipitation to be between 0 97 and 1 99 times h10 precipitation with 95 confidence using water year 2008 as an example the prior distribution is plotted as a precipitation distribution for cherry eleanor in fig 2e i e as the product of the multiplier distribution and the 840mm of precipitation from h10 we also plot water year 2008 streamflow 790mm and n15 1052mm and wrf precipitation 1499mm showing that the prior distribution largely spans the three precipitation data sources 4 results 4 1 experimental approach first we examine the bayesian inference of precipitation comparing the prior distribution of the multiplier with the posterior distribution for each of the six fuse model structures this comparison allows us to evaluate whether the choice of prior distribution and precipitation uncertainty appears appropriate given the precipitation inferred from streamflow as well as the uncertainty in inferred precipitation associated with the choice of model structure next we compare h10 precipitation and precipitation inferred from streamflow across the 56 study basins in the sierra nevada at several timescales we present results for several water years focusing on those for which many streamflow gauges were operational 1983 and 1977 which allows for greater spatial comparison of precipitation we also compare inferred precipitation and streamflow to other gridded precipitation datasets to test whether the findings are consistent across different methodologies then we present long term average differences between gridded and inferred precipitation when testing the differences between gridded and inferred precipitation we consider their spatial patterns in terms of distribution with elevation and distribution topographically across the crest of the sierra nevada finally we consider the patterns of implied et from the gridded and inferred datasets across the range 4 2 precipitation multiplier prior and posterior distributions the precipitation inferred from streamflow by the six fuse model structures for cherry eleanor is shown in fig 2 the time series of the inferred precipitation ensemble shows substantial differences between fuse structures fig 2a but also robustly reflects yearly variability in streamflow in general the ensemble of precipitation inferred from streamflow is greater than h10 similar or greater than the n15 ensemble and contains the wrf precipitation in the water year 2008 distribution fig 2e the 95 confidence intervals of the inferred precipitation from each structure are shown with the mean indicated by the marker while the individual structures intervals are about 100mm wide the range of the ensemble is almost 800mm showing that structural uncertainty in inferred precipitation is more substantial than the individual structures imply this is consistent with the findings of henn et al 2015 the mean of the fuse ensemble is also shown 1332mm it is less than wrf but greater than h10 and n15 a qualitative examination of this basin and others indicates that the posterior precipitation amounts generally fall within reasonable 95 limits of the prior distributions this suggests that the prior distributions are not grossly incompatible with the posterior distributions inferred from streamflow using the fuse model structures when this is the case the specific choice of the prior distribution likely does not exert undue influence on the inferred precipitation a sensitivity analysis of the inferred precipitation posteriors not shown indicates that they are only somewhat sensitive to the choice of prior distribution parameters so long as the distribution is sufficiently wide as to span the posterior region thus including wrf precipitation estimates is significant as it tends to increase the spread of the prior distribution the posterior distributions of inferred precipitation largely reflect the best fit of the different model structures to streamflow precipitation uncertainty as measured by disagreement between the h10 n15 and wrf datasets appears greatest in the central sierra nevada when the difference between the datasets for each basin are normalized by the basin mean value and plotted spatially not shown greater relative uncertainty is seen in the tuolumne merced and san joaquin r basins differences for these basins frequently exceed 20 of the mean while in the southern sierra nevada differences are generally 10 15 or less and the northern sierra nevada has intermediate values however the spatial pattern of uncertainty may be dependent on the choice of the particular precipitation datasets used in the comparison 4 3 comparing h10 precipitation and inferred precipitation in wet and dry years for each of the 56 basins we compile the inferred precipitation from the fuse structures and calculate the mean of the fuse ensemble for each basin year we exclude the basin years in which model calibrations produced very poor fits to streamflow streamflow nash sutcliffe coefficient of 2 or less or about 8 of all basin years simulated we then compare the mean inferred precipitation to h10 basin mean precipitation for individual water years from 1950 to 2010 figs 3 and 4 show this comparison for two water years 1983 and 1977 water year 1983 was one of the wettest on record in the sierra nevada with many gauges reporting over 2000mm of precipitation h10 precipitation fig 3a reflects the heavy precipitation that year with most basins on the west slope of the sierra nevada north of 37 n averaging at least that much maximum accumulations are seen in the north fork of the american r and the south fork of the yuba r as well as in smaller adjacent basins h10 precipitation generally decreases to the south along the west slope of the sierra nevada in comparison inferred precipitation fig 3b shows a more spatially variable pattern while precipitation of 2500mm or greater is seen in the yuba and american basins similarly large accumulations are seen in the basins in the stanislaus tuolumne san joaquin kings and kaweah drainages water year 1983 streamflow fig 3c shows a similarly spatially variable pattern of particular note are the strong gradients in streamflow seen over the central sierra nevada with a local maxima over cherry eleanor and falls crs and much drier 1000mm less streamflow basins to the east in the walker r basin and to the southwest in the lower tuolumne r basin the spatial gradients are much less sharp in the h10 dataset than they are in streamflow but are not surprisingly reflected in the precipitation inferred from streamflow to check h10 and inferred precipitation we subtract observed streamflow from both datasets basin mean precipitation fig 3d and e h10 precipitation minus streamflow is negative in three basins in water year 1983 cherry eleanor 175mm the north fork of the stanislaus r 16mm and duncan cr 75mm several other basins have streamflow within about 100mm of h10 precipitation including the san joaquin r and its tributary granite cr on the other hand h10 precipitation minus streamflow is much greater for basins further from the crest of the sierra nevada for example the low elevation cosumnes and mokelumne basins have h10 precipitation more than 800mm greater than runoff inferred precipitation is greater than streamflow by more consistent amounts across the sierra nevada fig 3e typically 400 800mm though local variability exists finally we plot the difference between h10 and inferred precipitation fig 3f which highlights the different spatial patterns of precipitation from the two sources of information inferred precipitation is greater than h10 over most high elevation basins particularly in the central sierra nevada stanislaus tuolumne san joaquin kings and kaweah basins precipitation inferred from streamflow is similar to or less than h10 for many of the lower elevation basins and for many of the basins east of the crest of the range the equivalent water year 1977 comparison fig 4 shows spatial patterns during an anomalously dry year note different scale comparing figs 3 and 4 show that streamflow is on the order of 90 less in 1977 as compared to 1983 as a result the absolute differences in streamflow and precipitation between basins in 1977 are relatively small but as a fraction of water year totals and considering the value of water in california in a drought year they remain significant for example streamflow over 200mm was observed in some central and northern basins e g san joaquin cherry eleanor falls cr the stanislaus r basins and the yuba r as compared to the southern portion of the range where every basin west of the crest except the upper kaweah r had less than 200mm of streamflow fig 4c streamflow was also strongly elevation dependent with lower elevation basins producing less than 100mm the spatial pattern of h10 precipitation in 1977 is relatively smooth and the greatest basin mean precipitation is in the south in the kaweah r basin fig 4a in contrast inferred precipitation reflects the northerly and high elevation patterns of streamflow fig 4b thus h10 precipitation minus streamflow tends to be greater in the south than in the north while inferred precipitation minus streamflow is more spatially uniform fig 4d and e the north south difference is also highlighted in fig 4f we next investigate the differences in the long term mean spatial pattern between precipitation gauge based gridded datasets and precipitation inferred from streamflow to do so we use the prism 1971 2000 precipitation climatology which sets the long term spatial pattern in the h10 dataset we compare this against the mean annual inferred precipitation and streamflow using all years in which streamflow is available for each basin generally at least 30 for each basin while the resulting map fig 5 does not compare consistent time periods it is very similar to the map of h10 mean annual precipitation over the periods of streamflow data availability for each basin not shown because each basin has at least 30years of streamflow data it samples close to the full range of yearly variability the prism climatological precipitation pattern appears spatially smoother than the pattern of precipitation inferred from streamflow fig 5a and b the spatial pattern of average streamflow fig 5c shows the same strong gradients between windward and leeward basins seen in single water years while no basin has long term prism or h10 precipitation less than long term streamflow fig 5d streamflow does suggest very high runoff ratios based on prism precipitation for many windward high elevation basins fig 5f largely the same set of basins shows low values of prism climatological precipitation minus long term streamflow as in the 1983 case i e the san joaquin cherry eleanor and stanislaus basins 4 4 comparison to other precipitation gauge based gridded datasets for comparison we also plot the water year 1983 precipitation pattern of three other gridded datasets n15 l15 and nldas 2 against streamflow fig 6 qualitatively the patterns of precipitation across the three datasets are similar and are also similar to h10 though nldas 2 appears to have less precipitation across the sierra nevada than the other datasets and l15 appears to have somewhat more in fig 6d f a set of basins shows low values of precipitation minus streamflow the upper kaweah r basins the san joaquin r and granite cr cherry eleanor and falls cr the north fork of the stanislaus r and highland cr several of the small basins draining to lake tahoe duncan cr and the south fork of the yuba r this set of basins is quite similar to those with low h10 precipitation minus streamflow cf fig 3d suggesting that the spatial patterns of precipitation across different gridded datasets are relatively similar 4 5 cross range transects of precipitation and streamflow to resolve the spatial patterns of precipitation and streamflow with respect to the topography of the sierra nevada we plot them along two cross range transects fig 7 the first transect begins in the tuolumne r basin on the west slope and travels northeast through the walker r basin while the second begins in the mokelumne r basin passes through the north fork of the stanislaus r basin before crossing the range into the carson r basin given predominant cool season winds out of the southwest e g lundquist et al 2015 these transects pass from windward to leeward basins in the first transect fig 7b the greatest streamflow is found near the top of the windward slope in the cherry eleanor basin while steep declines to both the southwest big cr and in particular the northeast walker r are seen h10 precipitation generally places the greatest precipitation near the crest but the maximum is likely too little given observed streamflow fig 7c however h10 precipitation appears compatible with streamflow and nearly matches inferred precipitation in the big cr and the walker r basins in the second transect fig 7d streamflow also reaches its peak on the high windward face of the range in the north fork of the stanislaus r basin similar to the first transect h10 precipitation appears insufficient in this basin h10 precipitation is slightly less than streamflow in water year 1983 fig 7e also similar to the first transect the leeward basin east fork of the carson r has much better agreement between h10 and inferred precipitation but the lower elevation windward basin south fork of the mokelumne r has much greater h10 precipitation than inferred precipitation in both transects the higher elevation windward basins have generally southwest facing aspects winds from this direction encounter consistent upslope aspect and little upstream blocking conditions favorable for orographic enhancement roe 2005 4 6 interannual variability in spatial patterns of precipitation and streamflow by considering multiple stream gauges in the sierra nevada we can examine changes in the spatial pattern of streamflow and inferred precipitation from year to year for this analysis we select a subset of years and basins with complete records so differences between years are due to changes in streamflow and not due to changes in the set of basins we select 1974 1987 a period in which 43 basins have complete streamflow records fig 8 a within that set we identify 15 basins on the west slope of the sierra nevada that are potentially underestimated by the gridded datasets based on the findings in the previous sections and average these basins streamflow and precipitation to represent the windward portions of the range we identify 9 basins on the eastern side of the crest and average them to create a leeward group finally we divide the basins into northern and southern groups fig 8a the windward and leeward basins are also included in the appropriate northern and southern groups with these indices of streamflow and precipitation we can identify windward vs leeward and north vs south shifts between years in fig 8b and c we show windward leeward and north south ratios respectively of precipitation and streamflow streamflow is on average more than twice as great from the windward basins than from the leeward basins however the ratio varies from year to year with 1978 in particular showing greater windward streamflow relative to the lee of the range fig 8b this shift is reflected in the inferred precipitation which has a lower mean windward leeward ratio 1 7 but generally follows the variability in streamflow h10 windward leeward precipitation ratios however are between 1 25 and 1 5 suggesting a weaker rain shadow and show very little interannual variability north south ratios fig 8c shows substantial interannual variability with precipitation and streamflow twice as large in the northern portion of the range compared to the south in some years but near equal in others streamflow inferred precipitation and h10 precipitation track one another over this time period though agreement is worse during the 1976 and 1977 drought years the annual difference between precipitation and streamflow in the sierra nevada implies the actual evapotranspiration et as drainage to deep aquifers and changes in soil moisture storage are generally small compared to precipitation and streamflow in some studies et has been estimated from the differences between basin mean gridded precipitation and streamflow christensen et al 2008 lutz et al 2010 and so we plot implied et from the different basin groups under both h10 and inferred precipitation in fig 8d and e when considering windward leeward differences h10 precipitation implies that et is greater in the leeward basins than the windward basins fig 8d the difference between leeward and windward implied et in h10 is variable and appears larger in wetter water years 1978 1982 and 1983 however inferred precipitation implies that windward et is greater than leeward et by a fairly constant margin there is greater agreement between h10 and inferred precipitation regarding north south differences in implied et fig 8e both datasets generally show greater et in the northern basins though in some years this is not the case for the h10 dataset we discuss patterns of et in more detail in section 5 4 7 trends in precipitation and streamflow using a subset of basins with at least 90 complete streamflow records over the study period 1950 2010 we calculate trends in the water year totals of observed streamflow h10 basin mean precipitation and inferred basin mean precipitation while there are fewer basins with sufficiently long and complete records to conduct the trend analysis the spatial patterns of precipitation and streamflow trends can still be discerned fig 9 trends in h10 precipitation show a strong north south divide the kern and kaweah basins in the south have positive precipitation trends while all basins to the north have declines of 5 15 in contrast inferred precipitation fig 9b shows increases in precipitation over the central sierra nevada in the merced and san joaquin basins weaker trends in the southern portion of the domain and decreases in the northern basins in general this follows from the observed streamflow trends which are most positive over the central sierra nevada and are negative for all basins from the mokelumne r northward fig 9c the trends in h10 precipitation inferred precipitation and streamflow are all significantly correlated with latitude p 0 10 two tailed student s t test however the differences between the h10 and inferred precipitation trends are greatest over the central sierra nevada fig 9d thus from 1950 to 2010 streamflow appears to have increased over the sierra nevada from approximately yosemite national park southward while the northern sierra nevada has seen declines in precipitation streamflow and swe the h10 dataset appears to capture some though not all of these shifts in spatial patterns while it does show the positive trends in precipitation in the southern sierra nevada it does not capture the correct sign or magnitude of the increasing precipitation inferred over the central basins in particular the san joaquin merced and walker basins 5 discussion 5 1 precipitation minus streamflow and et estimates the approach used here to infer precipitation from streamflow essentially forces basin water balance closure and thus assumes that precipitation is the sum of observed streamflow and modeled actual et using the flexible precipitation input outlined in previous sections therefore inferred precipitation represents a physically based estimate of basin mean precipitation given streamflow observations fig 2 and earlier studies using this framework make it clear that this formulation does produce uncertainties in the absolute amounts of inferred precipitation due to uncertainties in hydrologic model structure and the parameterization of fluxes such as percolation and et the absolute inferred precipitation quantities presented here should be viewed with some care due to the uncertainty in inferred et however year to year and basin to basin variability of inferred precipitation appear more robust than the absolute amount of inferred precipitation henn et al 2015 while each fuse model structure has a bias relative to the others this bias is quite consistent across water years and basins so we interpret the spatial pattern of inferred precipitation as well as the yearly wet versus dry differences in inferred precipitation as based on physical signals in contrast gridded precipitation products such as h10 leverage available precipitation observations to produce interpolated patterns but interpolating gauge observations to a grid is a statistical process not a physical one and as such is subject to associated uncertainty given these considerations it is reasonable to check precipitation minus streamflow from both approaches against available observations and estimates of actual et over the sierra nevada however measurements of et over the sierra nevada are few and uncertainty is high observational studies have estimated actual et to be between 400 and 800mmyr 1 at the point scale goulden et al 2012 ichii et al 2009 kurpius et al 2003 stephenson 1998 studies of forest cover and soils have shown that deep rooting allows trees and vegetation to access water stored in weathered bedrock bales et al 2011 rose et al 2003 allowing for greater et and maintenance of forests despite shallow 1m soils and nearly precipitation free summers in the sierra nevada s mediterranean climate however et observations are exclusively made at the point scale in or over forest cover and the extrapolation to spatially distributed basin mean et has significant uncertainty goulden et al 2012 and goulden and bales 2014 developed a relationship between the normalized difference vegetation index ndvi observed by the moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer modis and observations of actual et at multiple flux towers in california and used it to estimate basin mean et and elevational gradients of et basin scale studies can also infer et through consideration of precipitation and streamflow but both must be known well since et is the remainder of two generally larger terms our findings suggest that in many basins gridded precipitation datasets may have too much uncertainty to apply this approach to reliably infer et a two year water balance study in the forested southern sierra critical zone observatory ssczo in the kings r basin bales et al 2011 estimated et to be 760mmyr 1 this suggests that basin mean et is generally less than point estimates made in forests presumably due to the areas of limited transpiration i e rock snow and grasses another two year water balance study of an above treeline kaweah basin found et of 400mmyr 1 kattelmann and elder 1991 the relationship between forest and basin mean et may depend on the fraction of forest cover in the basin in fig 10 we consider preciptiation minus streamflow from the different precipitation data sources against observation based estimates of et over the sierra nevada we plot long term average precipitation and streamflow against each basin s mean elevation in fig 10a the distribution of precipitation with elevation for h10 shows an increase at lower elevations then a maximum at perhaps 2000m followed by a slight decline above that elevation the pattern for streamflow and inferred precipitation is more sensitive to elevation streamflow increases rapidly from the lower elevation basins up to 2000 2500m there are few basins above this elevation inferred precipitation follows a similar pattern but with a positive offset from streamflow precipitation minus streamflow fig 10b for h10 shows a general decline with elevation with the negative values noted above apparent at 1800 2400m in elevation however inferred precipitation minus streamflow is much less sensitive to elevation with most values at all elevations between 400 and 800mmyr 1 presumably reflecting a relatively constant pattern of et in the fuse models across the basins point observations of et from the sierra nevada are plotted against elevation in fig 10c including estimates from ameriflux tower sites ichii et al 2009 kurpius et al 2003 and ssczo flux towers and basin water balance bales et al 2011 goulden et al 2012 we also apply the regression of et against modis ndvi from goulden et al 2012 to estimate basin mean et for each of the streamflow basin gray circles using the mean modis ndvi from water year 2003 collectively these observations show that et likely peaks in the middle elevations 1000 2000m with declines at higher and lower elevations we can interpret this difference given arguments about et over the elevation range of the sierra nevada while higher colder basin have shorter growing seasons and less pet they also have greater water availability compared to lower elevation basins due to greater precipitation given the sierra nevada s arid summers and shallow soils actual et is generally driven more by water availability than pet i e the climate is generally more water limited at all but the highest elevations the resulting tradeoffs appear to favor the greatest actual et in the middle elevations particularly on the windward side christensen et al 2008 goulden et al 2012 which is also where the greatest forest cover is located stephenson 1998 the ndvi based approach in particular suggests that there is less et 400mmyr 1 in high elevation and leeward basins however because goulden et al 2012 based their regression on flux towers that are located primarily at sites at lower elevations and in more arid regions than the high sierra nevada they note that it may underestimate et in energy limited alpine areas where ndvi is not a strong indicator of water availability for example studies of evaporation and sublimation from the snowpack in the sierra nevada have estimated it to be from near zero to 300 400mmyr 1 the substantial uncertainty is due to a lack of direct measurements leydecker and melack 1999 thus the ndvi based estimates are probably best considered as a lower bound of et in the higher elevation basins in the lower row of fig 10 we plot the spatial pattern of precipitation minus streamflow from h10 d inferred precipitation minus streamflow e and et from the ndvi based regression f the spatial patterns exhibit significant differences with h10 and inferred precipitation showing greater precipitation minus streamflow than ndvi based et over many of the higher elevation basins in the central and southern sierra nevada as well as east of the crest the different estimates also suggest that the precipitation inferred from streamflow using the fuse models may overestimate high elevation et in basins with little vegetative cover however the ndvi based approach does suggest that basins of similar elevation and forest cover e g the tuolumne and merced basins in the central portion of the range have similar amounts of et while the ndvi based et amounts are less than inferred precipitation minus streamflow these spatial patterns of variability fig 10e and f are more similar than the h10 pattern fig 10d the ndvi based approach does not support aspects of the h10 dataset in which certain basins e g cherry eleanor have much less precipitation minus streamflow than basins of similar elevation or that et is greater on the leeward slope of the sierra nevada as compared to the windward slope we interpret those features of the h10 dataset to be more likely due to underestimation of precipitation in grid interpolation 5 2 estimation of regional hydro climatology from streamflow data these findings contribute to our understanding of regional orographically driven precipitation patterns the basins with the highest rates of inferred precipitation tend to follow certain orientations specifically facing southwest on ridges that protrude west from the main crest of the sierra nevada this provides information about where upslope flow must occur during winter storms and may aid in validation of precipitation forecast models it also highlights the challenges in using interpolation approaches to map spatial patterns of precipitation over topography the maps figs 3 6 and transect plots fig 7 of the difference between gridded and inferred precipitation yield several consistent spatial patterns first the likely underestimation of precipitation by h10 occurs over higher elevation windward basins with generally southwest aspect duncan cr cole cr the north fork of the stanislaus r and highland cr cherry eleanor and falls cr granite cr and the san joaquin r and the marble fork and main stem of the kaweah r lower elevation basins on the west slope basins in the far southern sierra nevada and basins east of the crest generally show better agreement or even potential overestimation by h10 this pattern is illustrated in fig 7 which shows the greatest disagreement occurring in relatively high elevation windward basins the apparent enhancement and mainly southwestern aspect of these basins agrees with findings that the predominant moisture transport into the sierra nevada is from low level southwesterly winds during cool season storms e g lundquist et al 2015 given that these findings are essentially the result of basins with higher streamflow than others at similar elevation and latitude figs 3 5 7 and 10 the reliability of the streamflow observations deserves consideration streamflow measurements are subject to uncertainty in the rating curve and depth measurements which produce instantaneous errors in flow measurement and may lead to biases if not validated with reliable instream flow measurements however we consider the likelihood of large long term biases in streamflow data to be relatively small assuming that the gauges are well maintained and that the usgs considers the records to be of reasonable quality it is possible that any individual gauge has a substantial bias however the patterns of streamflow seen in figs 3 5 appear to be spatially coherent they exhibit as a generally north to south wet to dry pattern and appears to favor southwest facing basins with no upstream blocking the apparent enhancement in these topographically favored basins is supported by theoretical and observational studies of relatively small scale precipitation patterns in complex terrain anders et al 2007 frei and schar 1998 minder et al 2008 roe 2005 mountainous areas receiving the greatest precipitation generally are those in which prevailing moisture bearing winds are forced upslope due to favorable topographic aspect these factors suggest that the long term streamflow measurements are relatively robust the patterns appear also fairly consistent in time across the water years surveyed and in the long term average pattern thus there may be low bias in the spatial mean pattern of precipitation in the gridded datasets which in h10 and most similar datasets is set to match prism precipitation climatology other prism based gridded datasets l15 nldas 2 show relatively similar patterns of potential underestimation fig 6 suggesting that this climatology may be a source of the underestimation prism uses a detailed topographic interpolation scheme that reflects the spatially variable relationship between precipitation and elevation on slopes of different aspect and of different exposure to prevailing moisture sources however it ultimately relies on gauge observations as well as april 1 snow course observations in some cases where gauges are sparse in the sierra nevada to obtain the elevation precipitation relationship if there are few or no gauges on certain preferential slopes where air parcels are forced upward due to aspect and topographic convergence roe 2005 it will be difficult for the regression to capture these local maxima the central and southern sierra nevada have few gauges and high topographic complexity and as a result topographic interpolation may underestimate precipitation for some basins in these areas because many datasets use prism climatology to establish the mean spatial pattern of precipitation over complex terrain the potential biases seen in figs 3 6 do not just apply to the h10 dataset but to a broader array of gridded precipitation products in fact even the gridded precipitation dataset that does not rely on prism n15 shows a relatively similar spatial pattern of precipitation given these findings it appears that underestimation of local precipitation maxima in complex terrain could be a widespread feature of gridded precipitation datasets in contrast we note that wrf precipitation may better represent precipitation in some of the basins with high observed streamflow as seen in the cherry eleanor example and in sierra wide maps of water year total precipitation fig 2 the wrf simulation has greater precipitation than the gridded datasets particularly for northern and high elevation windward basins wrf patterns of precipitation minus streamflow did not show low values in the basins where underestimation is likely in h10 and the other gridded datasets this suggests that wrf is capturing the dynamics of local orographic enhancement and may better reproduce local maxima in streamflow some studies argue that wrf precipitation over mountains is generally too high caldwell et al 2009 grubišić et al 2005 and the wrf data shown here do produce high values of precipitation minus streamflow overall but given that gridded precipitation datasets are usually used to evaluate wrf it appears possible that the apparent wet biases in wrf in some areas actually may be dry biases in the gridded products 6 conclusions from the comparison between streamflow from 56 long term largely unimpaired sierra nevada stream gauges gridded precipitation and precipitation inferred from streamflow over water years 1950 2010 we draw the following conclusions 1 there are differences between the mean spatial pattern of gridded precipitation in h10 and other gridded datasets most of which are set by prism climatology and the spatial pattern of precipitation inferred from streamflow in particular streamflow implies greater precipitation in higher elevation southwest facing basins than is seen in h10 and other gridded datasets 2 the spatial and temporal variability of precipitation inferred from streamflow e g precipitation gradients over the crest of the sierra nevada is higher than in h10 gridded precipitation while absolute uncertainties in inferred precipitation are relatively high the spatial patterns are relatively robust such that the gradients in streamflow also likely represent gradients in the precipitation pattern 3 the relationship between implied actual et precipitation minus streamflow across the crest of the sierra nevada is different between the gridded precipitation dataset and inferred precipitation h10 implies actual et is similar or greater in a set of basins to the lee of the crest relative to a set on the windward side while implied actual et is greater on the windward side with inferred precipitation 4 1950 2010

skillful forecasts of tc rainfall with lead times up to 48h without a consistently best or worst nwp model keywords tropical cyclones rainfall numerical weather predictions north atlantic short term forecasting 1 introduction north atlantic tropical cyclones tcs are responsible for significant societal and economic impacts over the 1900 2005 period the average annual normalized damage associated with tcs in the continental united states is about 10 billion value normalized to 2005 monetary value pielke et al 2008 overall this damage accounts for close to half table 1 in smith and katz 2013 of the total weather and climate disasters over the period of 1981 2011 much more than the damage associated with any other type of weather related disasters tcs are associated with multiple hazards including strong winds storm surges heavy rainfall and flooding while the effects of winds and surge are mostly felt along the coastal areas near the landfall location heavy rainfall and flooding are responsible for significant damage over much larger areas even hundreds of kilometers from the coast more than 50 of the fatalities associated with tcs between 1970 and 2004 were caused by fresh water flooding http www nws noaa gov os water ahps pdfs inlandfloodbrochure7f pdf over the period 1963 2012 rappaport 2014 showed that almost 50 of the u s landfalling tcs have at least one fatality related

landfalling tcs are responsible for major flood events over large areas east of the rocky mountains in particular along the eastern and central united states and along the coastal regions on the gulf of mexico villarini and smith 2010 2013 villarini et al 2011 2014 although precipitation directly associated with tcs is less than 25 of the annual precipitation even in the most affected regions the impacts can be extremely significant e g kunkel et al 2010 jiang and zipser 2010 barlow 2011 despite these negative socio economic impacts landfalling tcs have also been found to play a significant role as drought busters e g elsberry 2002 maxwell et al 2012 2013 kam et al 2013 torrential rainfall associated with tcs occasionally can have the effect of breaking a prolonged drought by recharging reservoirs and elevating soil moisture in these situations tc rainfall mitigates one environmental stressor even as the potential for damage associated with the extreme rainfall high speed wind and ocean surge remain e g kam et al 2013 maxwell et al 2013 khouakhi and villarini 2016 because rainfall associated with tcs has both significant positive and negative impacts on our society it is critical that we understand how skillful current forecasting systems are in predicting rainfall associated with these storms to help us improve our preparedness and mitigation efforts numerical weather prediction nwp models provide forecasts of a number of weather related variables e g precipitation temperature at different levels for different lead times e g lorenc 1986 bougeault et al 2010 however quantitative information about the skill of nwp models in forecasting tc rainfall is still limited marchok et al 2007 mohanty et al 2014 for a skillful prediction of tc rainfall the models must predict the strength and distribution of the rainfall rate and wind fields together with the track and intensity of the tc system see halperin et al 2013 for a discussion on the genesis forecasting of north atlantic tcs therefore precipitation forecasts from nwp models in general and for tcs in particular are inherently uncertain and subject to three types of error localization timing and intensity of precipitation events e g marchok et al 2007 in this study our goal is to evaluate the skill of nwp models in forecasting tc rainfall by quantifying their errors with respect to a reference rain gauge based dataset moreover five additional observational remote sensing based datasets are also compared to the reference dataset the skill of the nwp models in forecasting tc rainfall is quantified for different lead times and discussed and interpreted with respect to the performance of these observational products in this paper the description of data and methodology is provided in section 2 followed by results and discussion in section 3 section 4 summarizes the main points of the study and concludes the paper 2 data and methodology we use the climate prediction

from a number of different networks and sources the national oceanic and atmospheric administration noaa s national climate data center ncdc daily coop stations daily accumulations from hourly precipitation datasets and the cpc dataset it includes data from river forecast centers and 1st order stations the spatial resolution is 0 25 decimal degree over the continental united states there

precipitation dataset is produced by noaa ncep lin and mitchell 2005 it has 4 km and hourly resolution and is obtained by merging ground based radars across the united states and rain gauge

tmpa rt and research version tmpa rv huffman et al 2010 precipitation estimation from remotely sensed information using artificial neural networks persiann sorooshian et al 2000 cpc morphing technique cmorph joyce et al 2004 these satellite based products have a resolution coarser than stage iv 3 hourly and 0 25 degree and tmpa research version is the only product for which a monthly bias correction with respect to rain gauges is applied the rainfall products have different spatial resolutions stage iv has the highest spatial resolution 4km the four satellite based remote sensing products and the cpc data have 0 25 0 25 degree lat lon spatial resolution whereas all the nwp model output we have explored are on a 0 5 degree lat lon spatial resolution grid the default resolution in the tigge archive because our focus is on the nwp models all the products were regridded into 0 5 degree resolution to establish uniformity in the analysis with the expectation that both the agreement between observational estimates and the forecasting skill will increase as we coarsen the spatial resolution e g lavers and villarini 2013 results are based only on rainfall over land we focus on the evaluation of the precipitation associated with north atlantic tcs that affected the continental united states over the period 2007 2012 and examine 15 storms that came within 500km of the coast of the united states we consider tc rainfall the rainfall that occurred within a 500 km buffer around the center of circulation of a given storm we compare the storm total rainfall obtained from the cpc data our reference against the rainfall forecasts from the five nwp models to quantify how close or far these forecasts are from the reference data we also use rainfall estimates from the five remote sensing products to give a range of potentially acceptable results the availability of these remote sensing products allows us to complement the absolute evaluation of the performance of the nwp models with an assessment that is relative to what obtained when using observational records for instance we could use the correlation coefficient as skill metric and obtain a value of 0 4 between cpc and forecast rainfall while we can interpret this number in an absolute sense i e 0 4 on a scale from 1 to 1 we can also interpret it in a relative sense the 0 4 correlation value has a different interpretation if the range of values we get from the remote sensing products is between 0 9 and 0 95 rather than between 0 3 and 0 45 therefore it will provide us with an additional way of benchmarking the nwp models here we use hurricane irene 2011 as an example of our approach and methodology fig 1 the results for the other 14 storms are in supplementary figs s1 s14 our approach is to examine the skill of the forecasts starting from the first time the center of circulation of the storm is within 500km from the u s coastline we will refer to this as the 0 h lead time in the example in fig 1 the 0 h lead time represents the storm total rainfall from 27 august 2011 at 12 utc to 31 august 2011 at 12 utc we will refer to the 12 h lead time the forecast for the period from 27 august 2011 at 12 utc to 31 august 2011 at 12 utc initialized on 27 august 2011 at 0 utc longer lead times will follow the same rationale we compute rainfall errors with respect to the reference data cpc at each 0 5 degree pixel by subtracting cpc rainfall accumulations from the rainfall accumulations obtained from each of the remote sensing products and the nwp models at each 0 5 degree pixel an examination of the skill of nwp in forecasting storm total tc rainfall is based on both visual and quantitative evaluations visual inspection was performed by plotting storm total rainfall and rainfall errors for each of the storms for all the products statistical analysis of the rainfall errors was performed by computing the probability density function pdf and the first three moments of the error distributions for each of the statistical measures we used in the process of skill evaluation we develop envelopes from the five remote sensing products and then use them as the range to quantify and evaluate the skills of the nwp models in addition to the analyses focused on the storm total rainfall we also verify the skill of the nwp models in forecasting tc daily rainfall we quantify the accuracy of the forecasts relative to climatology used as reference using the mean square error mse skill score ssmse e g hashino et al 2007 the skill of a perfect forecast is equal to 1 with smaller values pointing to a decreasing forecast skill when the skill value is equal to 0 it means that the forecast accuracy is the same as the one we would have obtained resorting to climatology as our forecast accuracy worse than the climatology forecast is represented by negative values we can decompose the value of ssmse into three components murphy and winkler 1992 1 ss mse ρ fo 2 ρ fo σ f σ o 2 μ f μ o σ o 2 where ρ fo is the correlation coefficient between forecasts observations and quantifies the degree of linear dependence between the two μf and μo are the forecast and observation means respectively σf and σo are the forecast and observation standard deviations respectively based on this decomposition the correlation coefficient or its squared counterpart the coefficient of determination reflects the forecast accuracy only in the absence of biases and it represents the potential skill ps however without a proper accounting of the potential biases the forecast skill would be inflated the second and third terms in the right hand side of eq 1 quantify the conditional and unconditional biases respectively the former is referred to as slope reliability srel and quantifies the departures from the 1 1 line in terms of slope the unconditional bias the last term in eq 1 is referred to as the standardized mean error sme therefore the sum of the bias terms srel and sme quantifies the differences between potential ps and actual ss skill in a sense representing the room for improvement by the forecast system e g boer et al 2013 younas and tang 2013 3 results we start the evaluation of the skill of the nwp models based on the visual examination of the storm total rainfall fields and on the quantitative analysis of the error characteristics as an example of the type of analyses we have performed we focus on the results for hurricane irene 2011 the results for the other 14 storms are in supplementary figs s1 s14 according to the nhc report http www nhc noaa gov data tcr al092011 irene pdf irene caused 41 direct deaths in the united states among which six fatalities were due to storm surge 15 were related to high wind and 21 were due to rainfall induced floods based on the national flood insurance program the nhc reported that the total damage caused by the irene was 15 8billion out of which 7 2billion of the damage was related to inland flooding and surge only avila and cangialosi 2011 mccallum et al 2012 hurricane irene affected large areas of the eastern united states from north carolina to maine fig 1 fig 2 summarizes the total rainfall accumulation during hurricane irene according to the five remote sensing products and the five nwp models the results for the other 14 storms are in supplementary figs s15 s28 these results show that there is a relatively large range of variability in the observational products top row in fig 2 as a first step each panel in fig 2 is visually compared with cpc rainfall accumulation fig 1 this visual comparison provides qualitative information about the capability of each of these products in estimating rainfall associated with tcs overall stage iv is the product that more closely resembles the observational data both in terms of magnitude and location of the areas with the largest rainfall accumulations see also villarini et al 2011 on the other hand the satellite based estimates tend to have smaller rainfall values generally spread over larger areas this is particularly true for persiann as mentioned before we will use this variability in rainfall estimates from observational systems ground and space based sensors as a way of bounding what we can consider acceptable for the nwp models we will deem as satisfactory nwp rainfall forecasts that are within the range of outcomes from the remote sensing products the tc rainfall forecasts appear to capture reasonably well the observed storm total rainfall both in location and magnitude this is particularly true for the shortest lead time with the performance decreasing as we increase the lead time to five days as mentioned before this has to do with the fact that we are expecting the models to not only correctly forecast the rainfall fields around the center of circulation of the storms but also to correctly track these storms e g marchok et al 2007 this issue is clear for instance for the 5 day lead time where the models were not able to correctly forecast the storm track our expectations of the rainfall forecasts from the nwp models are admittedly very high but necessary to improve our confidence in them furthermore we compute rainfall errors using an additive formulation by subtracting the storm total rainfall from cpc from each of the remote sensing products and nwp models the results in fig 3 are for hurricane irene while those for the other 14 tcs are presented in figs s29 s42 stage iv shows the smallest discrepancies with respect to cpc likely due to the bias correction performed using rain gauges on the other hand the results for the four satellite based products show areas with consistent over and under estimation similar to what observed for the nwp models for tmpa and cmorph our results are generally consistent with yu et al 2009 villarini et al 2011 chen et al 2013 and deo et al 2016 who found an over under estimation of the tc rainfall in areas characterized by lower higher rain rates on the other hand for the forecasting models these patterns can be likely ascribed to errors in the forecast tracks the magnitude of the differences between cpc and the nwp models increases as we increase the lead time with results up to the 2 day lead time that are comparable to the range of accuracy both quantity and location wise of the observational products that is the nwp models up to the 48 h lead time were at least as skillful at predicting rainfall as the least accurate remote sensing product we considered these findings are generally consistent across all the 15 tcs considered in this study among the nwp models we did not see any one model performing consistently best or worst for all lead times a more quantitative examination of the skill of nwp models is achieved by computing the pdf of the rainfall errors from each product fig 4 shows the pdf of the rainfall errors for the ecmwf model for all the storms together with the results obtained using the satellite products for a given lead time if the pdf from any nwp model and lead times falls within the range of variability from the observational products gray envelope in fig 4 we can infer that the model at that lead time was capable of predicting the tc rainfall with a skill comparable to the range of results from our five observational products taking into account all the challenges associated with the forecasting of tc rainfall i e correctly forecasting both the storm track and the rainfall around the center of circulation of these storms the results in fig 4 are rather promising overall the error distributions for these 15 tcs are comparable to the error distributions from the remote sensing products moreover the distribution are highly peaked with most of the values concentrated around 0 this is particularly true for the shortest lead times with the results for the 5 day lead time that appear to be much smoother than the others these results are consistent across all nwp models supplementary figs s43 s46 in addition to the entire error distribution we have also computed the first three moments mean standard deviation and skewness of the error distributions and compared them across nwp models and remote sensing products fig 5 a models is considered to have better performance if the expected value of the errors is close to zero unbiased in the left column of fig 5 the expected values of the errors are closer to zero for the ecmwf followed by ukmo and ncep in general we would consider a successful forecast one for which the statistical properties of the error are within what we obtain from the remote sensing products for instance in the case of superstorm sandy 2012 the average error for ukmo ecmwf and cmc is close to zero across different lead times with error characteristics that are almost better than what we obtain from the remote sensing products more generally with the exception of tropical storm lee 2011 and tropical storm debby 2012 the average errors are close to zero or at least within the uncertainties from the remote sensing products up to the 2 day lead time the standard deviations of the errors from the nwp models show in general more variability than what obtained from the remote sensing products fig 5 middle column the main exception is represented by ncep which shows variability that is comparable with that of the observational products therefore these results indicate that the distribution of the errors while generally unbiased for the nwp models tends to be flatter than what we would expect from a range of remote sensing products finally the skewness of the errors from the nwp models is well within the results obtained from the observational data across the different models and lead times fig 5 right column depending on the tc nwp model or lead time the error distributions tend to be skewed in particular negatively skewed therefore our quantitative evaluation of the forecast errors suggests that the nwp models are capable of representing the error structure obtained from remote sensing products in particular for lead times up to two days even though the error distribution tends to be flatter than what observed from the observational datasets up to this point we have focused on the evaluation of the skill of the nwp models in forecasting storm total rainfall we have also performed analyses quantifying the skill of these models in forecasting tc rainfall at the daily scale based on the decomposition in eq 1 fig 6 the potential skill ps of the remote sensing products is generally very high with values ranging from 0 6 to 0 8 for most of the storms consistent with chen et al 2013 who evaluated the daily tmpa measurements for tcs affecting australia between 1998 and 2011 the values of ps for the nwp models are lower in particular at the longer lead times with the results for the shorter lead times up to 1day that are within the bounds from the remote sensing products this is particularly true for the cmc model for which the ps values for the 2 and 5 day forecasts are much lower than those for the shorter lead times among the five nwp models ncep has overall larger potential skill and weaker dependence on lead time compared to the other four nwp models in interpreting these results it is worth recalling that ps represents the coefficient of determination this means that a value of 0 25 corresponds to a correlation coefficient of 0 5 therefore the overall skill of these models is rather promising the second and third columns in fig 6 quantify conditional and unconditional biases overall the values of srel and sme are very small for the remote sensing products indicating that the observed variability with respect to cpc tends to be around the 1 1 line the results for the nwp models are comparable with the remote sensing products with small values of srel and sme given the limited biases the values of the skill score ss and potential skill for the observational products are very similar and generally larger than 0 6 on the other hand the nwp models exhibit positive values of ss in the majority of the cases in particular for the shorter lead times this indicates that these models are skillful compared to climatology used as reference because of a combination of small biases and good potential skill overall we have tried to present some general findings that are shared by the remote sensing products and the nwp models across the different storms e g stage iv is the product that most closely resembles the observations the skill of the nwp models decreases for longer lead times however it is worth highlighting that there was variability across storms as well see figures in the supplementary material it is likely that some of these differences are due to the different size of the tc rain shield the amount of rainfall associated with them and to the skill of the nwp models in forecasting the track of the storms future studies based on a larger number of tcs should examine the dependence of the forecast skill on these and other factors all the analyses so far have focused on 15 north atlantic tcs coming at least within 500km of the u s coastline during the 2007 2012 here we include some results related to the skill of nwp models in forecasting rainfall associated with a more recent storm hurricane joaquin 2015 which was indirectly responsible for catastrophic flooding in south carolina the center of circulation was never less than 500km from the u s coastline on 1 october 2015 a cut off low developed over the southeastern united states pulling moisture from this hurricane leading to multiple days of heavy rainfall and major flooding in south carolina consult berg 2016 for more details as shown in fig 7 large coastal areas of south carolina experienced rainfall in excess of 13in leading to major flooding in charleston and columbia all of the remote sensing products capture the large rainfall amounts in south carolina fig 8 even though stage iv is the product that once again performs the best with respect to cpc the four satellite based datasets underestimate the rainfall amounts along the u s east coast with underestimations in excess of 5in in south carolina and overestimations in northern florida and alabama supplementary fig s47 the location of the high rainfall amounts was identified by all of the nwp models at the shortest lead times i e up to one day even though the forecasts at the 2 and 5 day lead times generally did not correctly forecast the areas at the highest risk of high rainfall from this storm 4 conclusion in this study we have examined the skill of five state of the art nwp models european centre for medium range weather forecasts ecmwf uk met office ukmo national centers for environmental prediction ncep china meteorological administration cma and canadian meteorological center cmc in forecasting rainfall associated with 15 u s landfalling tcs during the 2007 2012 period these forecasts with a lead time up to five days were compared against gridded rain gauge based measurements we used rainfall estimates from five remote sensing products as a way of quantifying the fidelity we can expect from different observational datasets the main findings of this study can be summarized as follows among the remote sensing products stage iv showed the closest resemblance with the cpc dataset likely because of the use of rain gauge information for bias correction among other remote sensing products persiann consistently underestimated the tc rainfall overall the performance of the nwp models was comparable to the difference between remote sensing based products and the reference dataset particularly at shorter lead times while quantitatively the forecasts were comparable to the reference data a substantial error in the precipitation predictions appears to have been related to predictions of the storm track itself track relative analyses as those performed in marchok et al 2007 would alleviate this issue but were not performed here because of the lack of forecast track we have quantified the accuracy of the daily forecasts decomposing the mean square error skill score into potential skill conditional and unconditional biases the nwp models exhibit small biases and good potential skill especially at the shortest lead times leading to an overall positive skill score i e the quality of the forecasts is better than climatology used as reference while we have tried to draw general conclusions about the skill of the nwp models it is worth highlighting that there is inter storm variability future studies should examine the dependence of these conclusions on different tc characteristics e g size translational velocity in interpreting these results it is important to remember that we are evaluating the performance for a very challenging target we are asking the nwp models not only to correctly forecast the storm track but also to correctly characterize the rainfall distribution around this track when we consider that the errors from the remote sensing products observations are comparable to the forecast errors the results from the nwp are rather encouraging overall our findings indicate that skillful forecasting of storm total rainfall associated with north atlantic tcs making landfall along the u s coast is possible up to two days prior to landfall acknowledgments this material is based upon work supported by the national science foundation under grants

7601,the goal of this study is the evaluation of the skill of five state of the art numerical weather prediction nwp systems european centre for medium range weather forecasts ecmwf uk met office ukmo national centers for environmental prediction ncep china meteorological administration cma and canadian meteorological center cmc in forecasting rainfall from north atlantic tropical cyclones tcs analyses focus on 15 north atlantic tcs that made landfall along the u s coast over the 2007 2012 period as reference data we use gridded rainfall provided by the climate prediction center cpc we consider forecast lead times up to five days to benchmark the skill of these models we consider rainfall estimates from one radar based stage iv and four satellite based tropical rainfall measuring mission multi satellite precipitation analysis tmpa both real time and research version precipitation estimation from remotely sensed information using artificial neural networks persiann the cpc morphing technique cmorph rainfall products daily and storm total rainfall fields from each of these remote sensing products are compared to the reference data to obtain information about the range of errors we can expect from observational data the skill of the nwp models is quantified 1 by visual examination of the distribution of the errors in storm total rainfall for the different lead times and numerical examination of the first three moments of the error distribution 2 relative to climatology at the daily scale considering these skill metrics we conclude that the nwp models can provide skillful forecasts of tc rainfall with lead times up to 48h without a consistently best or worst nwp model keywords tropical cyclones rainfall numerical weather predictions north atlantic short term forecasting 1 introduction north atlantic tropical cyclones tcs are responsible for significant societal and economic impacts over the 1900 2005 period the average annual normalized damage associated with tcs in the continental united states is about 10 billion value normalized to 2005 monetary value pielke et al 2008 overall this damage accounts for close to half table 1 in smith and katz 2013 of the total weather and climate disasters over the period of 1981 2011 much more than the damage associated with any other type of weather related disasters tcs are associated with multiple hazards including strong winds storm surges heavy rainfall and flooding while the effects of winds and surge are mostly felt along the coastal areas near the landfall location heavy rainfall and flooding are responsible for significant damage over much larger areas even hundreds of kilometers from the coast more than 50 of the fatalities associated with tcs between 1970 and 2004 were caused by fresh water flooding http www nws noaa gov os water ahps pdfs inlandfloodbrochure7f pdf over the period 1963 2012 rappaport 2014 showed that almost 50 of the u s landfalling tcs have at least one fatality related to rain hurricane ivan 2004 alone accounted for two thirds of the total flood insurance payments made by the federal government in that year impacting 23 different states czajkowski et al 2013 u s landfalling tcs are responsible for major flood events over large areas east of the rocky mountains in particular along the eastern and central united states and along the coastal regions on the gulf of mexico villarini and smith 2010 2013 villarini et al 2011 2014 although precipitation directly associated with tcs is less than 25 of the annual precipitation even in the most affected regions the impacts can be extremely significant e g kunkel et al 2010 jiang and zipser 2010 barlow 2011 despite these negative socio economic impacts landfalling tcs have also been found to play a significant role as drought busters e g elsberry 2002 maxwell et al 2012 2013 kam et al 2013 torrential rainfall associated with tcs occasionally can have the effect of breaking a prolonged drought by recharging reservoirs and elevating soil moisture in these situations tc rainfall mitigates one environmental stressor even as the potential for damage associated with the extreme rainfall high speed wind and ocean surge remain e g kam et al 2013 maxwell et al 2013 khouakhi and villarini 2016 because rainfall associated with tcs has both significant positive and negative impacts on our society it is critical that we understand how skillful current forecasting systems are in predicting rainfall associated with these storms to help us improve our preparedness and mitigation efforts numerical weather prediction nwp models provide forecasts of a number of weather related variables e g precipitation temperature at different levels for different lead times e g lorenc 1986 bougeault et al 2010 however quantitative information about the skill of nwp models in forecasting tc rainfall is still limited marchok et al 2007 mohanty et al 2014 for a skillful prediction of tc rainfall the models must predict the strength and distribution of the rainfall rate and wind fields together with the track and intensity of the tc system see halperin et al 2013 for a discussion on the genesis forecasting of north atlantic tcs therefore precipitation forecasts from nwp models in general and for tcs in particular are inherently uncertain and subject to three types of error localization timing and intensity of precipitation events e g marchok et al 2007 in this study our goal is to evaluate the skill of nwp models in forecasting tc rainfall by quantifying their errors with respect to a reference rain gauge based dataset moreover five additional observational remote sensing based datasets are also compared to the reference dataset the skill of the nwp models in forecasting tc rainfall is quantified for different lead times and discussed and interpreted with respect to the performance of these observational products in this paper the description of data and methodology is provided in section 2 followed by results and discussion in section 3 section 4 summarizes the main points of the study and concludes the paper 2 data and methodology we use the climate prediction center cpc unified gauge based analysis of daily precipitation over the continental united states these data represent daily accumulations and are obtained by interpolating rain gauge measurements from a number of different networks and sources the national oceanic and atmospheric administration noaa s national climate data center ncdc daily coop stations daily accumulations from hourly precipitation datasets and the cpc dataset it includes data from river forecast centers and 1st order stations the spatial resolution is 0 25 decimal degree over the continental united states there are different quality control steps that are implemented to remove duplicate and overlapping stations buddy checks are used to eliminate extreme values and standard deviation checks are used to compare the daily precipitation data against a daily climatology higgins et al 2000 for the north atlantic tc track information date time latitude and longitude of all recorded storms with a 6 h resolution we use the noaa hurricane research division s hurricane database hurdat 2 landsea and franklin 2013 we evaluate the forecast rainfall produced by five state of art nwp models european centre for medium range weather forecasts ecmwf buizza et al 2007 uk met office ukmo bowler et al 2008 national centers for environmental prediction ncep toth and kalnay 1997 china meteorological administration cma and canadian meteorological center cmc houtekamer et al 2009 data for nwp models have been archived from the thorpex interactive grand global ensemble tigge bougeault et al 2010 to benchmark the skill of these nwp models we consider rainfall estimates from five remote sensing products one ground based radar and four satellite based rainfall products stage iv multi sensor precipitation dataset is produced by noaa ncep lin and mitchell 2005 it has 4 km and hourly resolution and is obtained by merging ground based radars across the united states and rain gauge measurements are used to perform bias correction the four satellite based rainfall products we use are tropical rainfall measuring mission multi satellite precipitation analysis tmpa both real time tmpa rt and research version tmpa rv huffman et al 2010 precipitation estimation from remotely sensed information using artificial neural networks persiann sorooshian et al 2000 cpc morphing technique cmorph joyce et al 2004 these satellite based products have a resolution coarser than stage iv 3 hourly and 0 25 degree and tmpa research version is the only product for which a monthly bias correction with respect to rain gauges is applied the rainfall products have different spatial resolutions stage iv has the highest spatial resolution 4km the four satellite based remote sensing products and the cpc data have 0 25 0 25 degree lat lon spatial resolution whereas all the nwp model output we have explored are on a 0 5 degree lat lon spatial resolution grid the default resolution in the tigge archive because our focus is on the nwp models all the products were regridded into 0 5 degree resolution to establish uniformity in the analysis with the expectation that both the agreement between observational estimates and the forecasting skill will increase as we coarsen the spatial resolution e g lavers and villarini 2013 results are based only on rainfall over land we focus on the evaluation of the precipitation associated with north atlantic tcs that affected the continental united states over the period 2007 2012 and examine 15 storms that came within 500km of the coast of the united states we consider tc rainfall the rainfall that occurred within a 500 km buffer around the center of circulation of a given storm we compare the storm total rainfall obtained from the cpc data our reference against the rainfall forecasts from the five nwp models to quantify how close or far these forecasts are from the reference data we also use rainfall estimates from the five remote sensing products to give a range of potentially acceptable results the availability of these remote sensing products allows us to complement the absolute evaluation of the performance of the nwp models with an assessment that is relative to what obtained when using observational records for instance we could use the correlation coefficient as skill metric and obtain a value of 0 4 between cpc and forecast rainfall while we can interpret this number in an absolute sense i e 0 4 on a scale from 1 to 1 we can also interpret it in a relative sense the 0 4 correlation value has a different interpretation if the range of values we get from the remote sensing products is between 0 9 and 0 95 rather than between 0 3 and 0 45 therefore it will provide us with an additional way of benchmarking the nwp models here we use hurricane irene 2011 as an example of our approach and methodology fig 1 the results for the other 14 storms are in supplementary figs s1 s14 our approach is to examine the skill of the forecasts starting from the first time the center of circulation of the storm is within 500km from the u s coastline we will refer to this as the 0 h lead time in the example in fig 1 the 0 h lead time represents the storm total rainfall from 27 august 2011 at 12 utc to 31 august 2011 at 12 utc we will refer to the 12 h lead time the forecast for the period from 27 august 2011 at 12 utc to 31 august 2011 at 12 utc initialized on 27 august 2011 at 0 utc longer lead times will follow the same rationale we compute rainfall errors with respect to the reference data cpc at each 0 5 degree pixel by subtracting cpc rainfall accumulations from the rainfall accumulations obtained from each of the remote sensing products and the nwp models at each 0 5 degree pixel an examination of the skill of nwp in forecasting storm total tc rainfall is based on both visual and quantitative evaluations visual inspection was performed by plotting storm total rainfall and rainfall errors for each of the storms for all the products statistical analysis of the rainfall errors was performed by computing the probability density function pdf and the first three moments of the error distributions for each of the statistical measures we used in the process of skill evaluation we develop envelopes from the five remote sensing products and then use them as the range to quantify and evaluate the skills of the nwp models in addition to the analyses focused on the storm total rainfall we also verify the skill of the nwp models in forecasting tc daily rainfall we quantify the accuracy of the forecasts relative to climatology used as reference using the mean square error mse skill score ssmse e g hashino et al 2007 the skill of a perfect forecast is equal to 1 with smaller values pointing to a decreasing forecast skill when the skill value is equal to 0 it means that the forecast accuracy is the same as the one we would have obtained resorting to climatology as our forecast accuracy worse than the climatology forecast is represented by negative values we can decompose the value of ssmse into three components murphy and winkler 1992 1 ss mse ρ fo 2 ρ fo σ f σ o 2 μ f μ o σ o 2 where ρ fo is the correlation coefficient between forecasts observations and quantifies the degree of linear dependence between the two μf and μo are the forecast and observation means respectively σf and σo are the forecast and observation standard deviations respectively based on this decomposition the correlation coefficient or its squared counterpart the coefficient of determination reflects the forecast accuracy only in the absence of biases and it represents the potential skill ps however without a proper accounting of the potential biases the forecast skill would be inflated the second and third terms in the right hand side of eq 1 quantify the conditional and unconditional biases respectively the former is referred to as slope reliability srel and quantifies the departures from the 1 1 line in terms of slope the unconditional bias the last term in eq 1 is referred to as the standardized mean error sme therefore the sum of the bias terms srel and sme quantifies the differences between potential ps and actual ss skill in a sense representing the room for improvement by the forecast system e g boer et al 2013 younas and tang 2013

the five nwp models ncep has overall larger potential skill and weaker dependence on lead time compared to the other four nwp models in interpreting these results it is worth recalling that ps represents the coefficient of determination this means that a value of 0 25 corresponds to a correlation coefficient of 0 5 therefore the overall skill of these models is rather promising the second and third columns in fig 6 quantify conditional and unconditional biases overall the values of srel and sme are very small for the remote sensing products indicating that the observed variability with respect to cpc tends to be around the 1 1 line the results for the nwp models are comparable with the remote sensing products with small values of srel and sme given the limited biases the values of the skill score ss and potential skill for the observational products are very similar and generally larger than 0 6 on the other hand the nwp models exhibit positive values of ss in the majority of the cases in particular for the shorter lead times this indicates that these models are skillful compared to climatology used as reference because of a combination of small biases and good potential skill overall we have tried to present some general findings that are shared by the remote sensing products and the nwp models across the different storms e g stage iv is the product that most closely resembles the observations the skill of the nwp models decreases for longer lead times however it is worth highlighting that there was variability across storms as well see figures in the supplementary material it is likely that some of these differences are due to the different size of the tc rain shield the amount of rainfall associated with them and to the skill of the nwp models in forecasting the track of the storms future studies based on a larger number of tcs should examine the dependence of the forecast skill on these and other factors all the analyses so far have focused on 15 north atlantic tcs coming at least within 500km of the u s coastline during the 2007 2012 here we include some results related to the skill of nwp models in forecasting rainfall associated with a more recent storm hurricane joaquin 2015 which was indirectly responsible for catastrophic flooding in south carolina the center of circulation was never less than 500km from the u s coastline on 1 october 2015 a cut off low developed over the southeastern united states pulling moisture from this hurricane leading to multiple days of heavy rainfall and major flooding in south carolina consult berg 2016 for more details as shown in fig 7 large coastal areas of south carolina experienced rainfall in excess of 13in leading to major flooding in charleston and columbia all of the remote sensing products capture the large rainfall amounts in south carolina fig 8 even though stage iv is the product that once again performs the best with respect to cpc the four satellite based datasets underestimate the rainfall amounts along the u s east coast with underestimations in excess of 5in in south carolina and overestimations in northern florida and alabama supplementary fig s47 the location of the high rainfall amounts was identified by all of the nwp models at the shortest lead times i e up to one day even though the forecasts at the 2 and 5 day lead times generally did not correctly forecast the areas at the highest risk of high rainfall from this storm 4 conclusion in this study we have examined the skill of five state of the art nwp models european centre for medium range weather forecasts ecmwf uk met office ukmo national centers for environmental prediction ncep china meteorological administration cma and canadian meteorological center cmc in forecasting rainfall associated with 15 u s landfalling tcs during the 2007 2012 period these forecasts with a lead time up to five days were compared against gridded rain gauge based measurements we used rainfall estimates from five remote sensing products as a way of quantifying the fidelity we can expect from different observational datasets the main findings of this study can be summarized as follows among the remote sensing products stage iv showed the closest resemblance with the cpc dataset likely because of the use of rain gauge information for bias correction among other remote sensing products persiann consistently underestimated the tc rainfall overall the performance of the nwp models was comparable to the difference between remote sensing based products and the reference dataset particularly at shorter lead times while quantitatively the forecasts were comparable to the reference data a substantial error in the precipitation predictions appears to have been related to predictions of the storm track itself track relative analyses as those performed in marchok et al 2007 would alleviate this issue but were not performed here because of the lack of forecast track we have quantified the accuracy of the daily forecasts decomposing the mean square error skill score into potential skill conditional and unconditional biases the nwp models exhibit small biases and good potential skill especially at the shortest lead times leading to an overall positive skill score i e the quality of the forecasts is better than climatology used as reference while we have tried to draw general conclusions about the skill of the nwp models it is worth highlighting that there is inter storm variability future studies should examine the dependence of these conclusions on different tc characteristics e g size translational velocity in interpreting these results it is important to remember that we are evaluating the performance for a very challenging target we are asking the nwp models not only to correctly forecast the storm track but also to correctly characterize the rainfall distribution around this track when we consider that the errors from the remote sensing products observations are comparable to the forecast errors the results from the nwp are rather encouraging overall our findings indicate that skillful forecasting of storm total rainfall associated with north atlantic tcs making landfall along the u s coast is possible up to two days prior to landfall acknowledgments this material is based upon work supported by the national science foundation under grants

7602,atmospheric rivers ars play a central role in the hydrology and hydroclimatology of the central united states more than 25 of the annual rainfall is associated with ars over much of this region with many large flood events tied to their occurrence despite the relevance of these storms for flood hydrology and water budget the characteristics of rainfall associated with ars over the central united has not been investigated thus far this study fills this major scientific gap by describing the rainfall during ars over the central united states using five remote sensing based precipitation products over a 12 year study period the products we consider are stage iv tropical rainfall measuring mission multi satellite precipitation analysis tmpa both real time and research version precipitation estimation from remotely sensed information using artificial neural networks persiann the cpc morphing technique cmorph as part of the study we evaluate these products against a rain gauge based dataset using both graphical and metrics based diagnostics based on our analyses stage iv is found to better reproduce the reference data hence we use it for the characterization of rainfall in ars most of the ar rainfall is located in a narrow region within 150km on both sides of the ar major axis in this region rainfall has a pronounced positive relationship with the magnitude of the water vapor transport moreover we have also identified a consistent increase in rainfall intensity with duration or persistence of ar conditions however there is not a strong indication of diurnal variability in ar rainfall these results can be directly used in developing flood protection strategies during ars further weather prediction agencies can benefit from the results of this study to achieve higher skill of resolving precipitation processes in their models keywords atmospheric rivers rainfall characterization extreme rainfall remote sensing based precipitation evaluation 1 introduction atmospheric rivers ars are increasingly recognized among the key processes that govern the variability in climate water budget and hydrology in different regions around the globe first observed by newell et al 1992 ars represent filamentary regions of high water vapor flux in the atmosphere subsequently zhu and newell 1994 used the term atmospheric river for such regions to reflect narrow and long river like features in the atmosphere while ars occupy less than 10 of the global longitude at a particular latitude more than 90 of the meridional water vapor flux in the extratropics occurs within them ars are generally present in extratropical cyclones within the warm conveyor belt in the warm sector ahead of the surface cold front in the lower levels of the troposphere e g ralph et al 2004 this region is characterized by the presence of high water vapor content and low level jet llj browning and pardoe 1973 ralph et al 2004 resulting in high water vapor transport towards the extratropics although much of the transport occurs directly from the tropics to the extratropics recent studies suggest that this is not always the case as some moisture is added along the path of the system by evaporation from surface and local convergence bao et al 2006 dacre et al 2015 ars have been shown to play a central role in the hydrology and water budget of many regions in the global midlatitudes water resources of the state of california are strongly dependent on year to year variability of ars dettinger et al 2011 dettinger et al 2011 showed that ars contributed between 20 and 50 to the total annual precipitation and streamflow in california and much of the u s west coast over the 1998 2008 period lavers and villarini 2015 obtained similar results when examining the ar contribution to total precipitation over the 1979 2012 period they also expanded the analyses to the central and eastern united states and europe in these regions the fractional contribution to monthly average precipitation was estimated to be 25 30 guan et al 2010 studied snowfall events in 2004 2010 cold seasons october to march over sierra nevada california and found that ars provided between 24 and 53 of the seasonal snow water equivalent this brief overview highlights the fact that ars are significant sources of atmospheric moisture to water resources in addition to this they also play a critical role in flood hydrology for example over the northern part of the u s west coast rutz et al 2014 showed that a large fraction 60 of cold season extreme daily 90th percentile precipitation events are linked to ars ralph et al 2006 focused on the russian river california and found that ars were responsible for all the seven floods that crossed the flood stage threshold from the year 1997 2006 strong influence of ars was also observed over western washington by neiman et al 2011 who showed that more than 95 of the floods from 1980 to 2009 were associated with ars while most of the studies have focused on the u s west coast ars also play a major role in the hydrologic extremes of the central united states nakamura et al 2013 studied 20 extreme floods in spring over large ohio river basins watershed areas larger than 1000km2 from 1901 to 2008 in all the 20 floods large moisture transports were observed from atlantic and gulf of mexico features reminiscent of ar characteristic over the central united states lavers and villarini 2013 showed that more than 60 of the annual maximum floods during 1979 2011 period were associated with ars over much of the central united states with seven out of the ten largest floods associated with these storms moreover ars are the mechanisms responsible for some of the most devastating flooding events over this region in recent decades including the floods of july 1993 dirmeyer and kinter 2009 june 2008 floods over eastern iowa budikova et al 2010 smith et al 2013 may 2010 flood in nashville tennessee and surrounding areas moore et al 2012 and the flood of april 2013 over chicago and eastern iowa campos and wang 2015 nayak et al 2016 despite the central role ars play in producing floods over the central united states little is known about the distribution of rainfall within ars over this area to the best of our knowledge only nayak et al 2016 provide preliminary insights on the distribution of rainfall during ars over the central united states even though the results are limited to a very small sample size a study period of 66days in april june 2013 in which only three ars occurred the lack of knowledge regarding the rainfall distribution in ars is a major gap in the understanding of the science of ars filling this gap serves the motivation for present study the primary goal of this study is to understand the rainfall distribution during ars using high resolution remote sensing based precipitation products specifically the research questions we address are where is the heaviest rainfall located in ars how quickly does it decrease as we move away from the areas of the most intense transport within these storms what is the relationship between rainfall intensity and the magnitude of the moisture transport how does this relationship vary within the ars and across the central united states how does ar rainfall change with the duration of these events over the u s west coast for example ralph et al 2013 found that long duration ars produce significantly larger amounts of rainfall and streamflow than short duration events likely due to the continuous supply of water vapor available for rainout over the u s west coast orographic lifting of moisture laden air masses results in intense rainfalls ralph et al 2004 and references therein whereas over the central united states mesoscale convective systems mcss and frontal systems associated with extratropical cyclones are the main drivers of extreme precipitation events kunkel et al 2012 stevenson and schumacher 2014 although the rain producing mechanisms over the central united states are different than those over the u s west coast it is reasonable to assume that as the duration of the ars increase the rainfall may increase here as well the impact of the duration of ars on rainfall intensity over central united states is addressed in this study how does the ar rainfall magnitude differ during the course of the day an important characteristics observed in rainfall extremes across the great plains is their diurnal cycle this cycle is the most pronounced in the summer season when most of the extreme rainfall events occur from mid night to the early morning e g dai et al 1999 wallace 1975 in winter on the other hand the diurnal cycle is weak here we examine whether the ar rainfall magnitudes vary during the day to carry out the analyses and address the research questions listed above we will use quantitative precipitation estimates qpe from remote sensing products over the past decade we have seen the development of several datasets providing qpe each with different strengths and weaknesses as part of this study we will focus on one radar based and four satellite based rainfall products and perform a comprehensive evaluation with respect to a rain gauge based reference product while the evaluation of remote sensing product is topic addressed in several previous studies for example aghakouchak et al 2011 cai et al 2015 chen et al 2013 derin and yilmaz 2014 prat and nelson 2015 puca et al 2014 vila et al 2009 villarini and krajewski 2007 villarini et al 2009 zhang et al 2015 how well different products can represent ar rainfall is a topic that requires further investigation aghakouchak et al 2011 compared four satellite products and concluded that none of the products can be treated as best suited to characterize extreme rainfalls further the performance of the products decreases as the events become more extreme a more recent study by prat and nelson 2015 also highlights the poor performance of satellite and remote sensing products in capturing extreme rainfall further challenges arise due to the peculiar structure of narrow and long rain bands that have been observed in some ars studied over the central united states for example moore et al 2012 nayak et al 2016 hence from an ar perspective it is important to evaluate different remote sensing products to select the best product before performing rainfall characterization in ars the paper is organized as follows the data used in this study are described in section 2 followed by section 3 where we describe the methodology in section 4 we present the major outcomes of the study finally the conclusions of this work are presented in section 5 2 data the data for detecting ars are retrieved from atmospheric reanalysis dataset by the national aeronautics and space administration nasa s modern era retrospective analysis for research and applications merra rienecker et al 2011 specifically we retrieved specific humidity q zonal and meridional winds u and v respectively the data are at 6 hourly temporal resolution 0 5 0 667 horizontal resolution and at 72 pressure levels from the surface 976 62hpa to 0 015hpa the data are available over the entire globe from 1979 to the present however here we identify ars only over the 2002 2014 period consistent with the data availability of the precipitation products we evaluated one ground based and four satellite based products for characterizing rainfall during ars 1 national centers for environmental prediction ncep stage iv precipitation product lin

simplicity throughout the paper we will address trmm 3b42 v7 as trmm and trmm 3b42rt v7 as trmmrt stage iv precipitation data can be obtained at hourly 6 hourly and daily temporal resolutions the data are available from 2002 to the present over most of the conterminous united states at approximately 4km 4km horizontal resolution the data are a mosaicked analysis performed at ncep from precipitation estimates produced by 12 regional forecasting centers rfcs across the united states all the rfcs that encompass the central united states use multi sensor precipitation estimates from weather surveillance radar 1988 doppler wsr 88d radars merged with hourly rain gauge measurements the hourly rain gauge data for these rfcs come from either all or some of the real time gauges of the hydrometeorological automated data system hads gauges the automated surface observing system asos and the automated airport weather stations awos reports see hou et al 2014 for further details on stage iv analysis a manual quality control is performed at each rfc the two tmpa datasets trmm and trmmrt are available from 1998 and 2000 respectively both datasets are at 3 hourly temporal resolution and 0 25 0 25 horizontal resolution trmmrt estimates are obtained by calibrating and merging passive microwave data and 10μm band infra red ir data from sensors on different satellites the passive microwave data are obtained from trmm microwave imager tmi on trmm satellite the special sensor microwave imager ssm i on defense meteorological satellite program dmsp satellites the advanced microwave sounding unit b amsu b on the national oceanic and atmospheric administration noaa satellites and the advanced microwave scanning radiometer earth observing system amsr e on aqua the ir data are obtained from the international constellation of geosynchronous earth orbit geo satellites for the research version trmm monthly gauge based precipitation data from global precipitation climatological center gpcc rudolf 1993 and the climate assessment and monitoring system cams xie et al 1996 are used to adjust this product on a monthly basis for detailed information regarding tmpa estimates refer to huffman et al 2007 cmorph and persiann data are available at 0 25 0 25 horizontal resolution the finest temporal resolution for cmorph is 3 hourly and data are available from december 2002 to the present persiann data are available at 3 hourly 6 hourly and daily temporal resolutions from march 2002 to the present the reference data used to evaluate the remote sensing products is cpc s gauge based precipitation over the conterminous united states higgins et al 2000 the data are at daily temporal resolution and 0 25 0 25 horizontal resolution and are available from 1948 to the present presently cpc extracts daily rainfall data from daily rainfall reports provided by about 13 000 15 000 stations higgins et al 2000 rfcs provide daily reports at about 8000 stations and around 4000 are independently provided by national climatic data center hou et al 2014 hou et al 2014 estimate that out of the 8000 stations provided by rfcs 90 have data available at hourly temporal resolution which could have been used to obtain the stage iv hourly estimates as well this implies that cpc and stage iv data are not completely independent even though there are differences because of the use of different quality controls at each rfc and the availability of 4000 additional independent stations in cpc with that said we expect stage iv and trmm to show closer agreements to the reference cpc data 3 methods 3 1 ar identification two common atmospheric variables that are used to identify ars are integrated vapor transport ivt and column integrated water vapor iwv in this study we used ivt because it has a stronger relationship with rainfall than iwv lavers and villarini 2015 rutz et al 2014 ivt magnitude kgm 1 s 1 is calculated as follows 1 ivt 1 g 1000 300 qu dp 2 1 g 1000 300 qv dp 2 where q u and v are layer averaged specific humidity kgkg 1 zonal and meridional wind components ms 1 respectively g is the acceleration due to gravity 9 81ms 2 and dp pa is the difference in pressure between two adjacent vertical levels in the atmosphere because most of the water vapor content in the atmosphere is within the first 5km altitude from the surface we used data from the surface to 300hpa 28 vertical levels in merra to calculate ivt this is consistent with other studies over the central united states lavers and villarini 2013 nayak et al 2014 for identifying ars we followed the same methodology that is used in nayak et al 2016 first we calculate the daily ivt threshold between 85 w and 100 w at latitude 40 n the longitude 85 100 w is used to define central united states the latitude 40 n is chosen to capture ars that progress well within the central united states ivt thresholds to identify ars are calculated as follows at each grid point from 85 w to 100 w at 40 n we calculate the average daily ivt taken from the four 6 hourly time steps from 1979 to 2014 from the ivt values the maximum ivt value over this transect is taken for each day and then a 15 day smoothing is performed this creates a timeseries of daily maximum ivt from 1979 to 2014 in the transect the threshold for each day of the year is calculated as the 85th percentile of the smoothed maximum values the use of daily thresholds takes into account the seasonal variations that are present in ivt magnitude over the year after the daily thresholds are calculated each time step of each day from 1979 to 2014 is examined to identify ars for each time step if the maximum ivt between 85 w and 100 w at 40 n is below the threshold for that day the algorithm stops and we move the next time step on the other hand if the maximum ivt is above the threshold the ivt value and the corresponding latitude and longitude are recorded at this point we move one grid point south i e to 39 5 n at this latitude the grid point with maximum ivt is identified if its location is within two grid points either to the east or to the west of the longitude of the maximum ivt found at 40 n we continue the search southward the displacement condition of searching two grid points east and west is to ensure spatial homogeneity a useful characteristic of ivt in ars if the maximum ivt values of all the grid points from 40 n to 30 5 n exceed the threshold and if they satisfy the displacement condition then we consider the time step an ar step the same procedure is repeated from south to north to confirm the correct latitude longitude of the maximum ivts where the latitude longitude points do not match we take the points from the backward i e starting at 30 5 n search method the same procedure is repeated for latitude bands 31 0 40 5 n 31 5 41 0 n and 32 0 41 5 n to include ar time steps near the vicinity of the central united states we merge all ar time steps from all the searches to get the final list of ar time steps for an identified ar the set of maximum ivt grid points is referred to as the ar major axis the length criterion for ars is the distance between 40 n and 30 5 n which is more than 1050km similar to nayak et al 2014 if three consecutive time steps 18h are identified as ar steps we consider the collection of the ar steps as a persistent ar or simply an ar this methodology was extensively evaluated in nayak et al 2016 3 2 evaluation methods we evaluate and compare all the precipitation products for a common period of 12years from 2003 to 2014 data from cmorph are available only after december 2002 so we start evaluation from 2003 first all the products are brought to a common spatial and temporal resolutions of 0 25 0 25 and 1200utc to 1200utc respectively for visual comparison we calculate total rainfall and rainfall associated with ar for the 12 year period from cpc and the five remote sensing products we refer to the rainfall within a 250km buffer around the ar major axis as the rainfall associated with the ar or ar related rainfall we perform different quantitative evaluations to get a better idea of any under or over estimation by the remote sensing products daily rainfall estimates from remote sensing products are compared with cpc rainfall amounts at each grid point over the central united states 30 50 n and 85 100 w with the help of boxplots and scatter plots further objective evaluation measures are also considered including pearson s product moment correlation coefficient correlation coefficient from here onwards mean absolute error mae and mean squared error mse for each of the five products we calculate these measures at each grid point from daily rainfall data of 12years these analyses are performed for rainfall associated with ars as well 3 3 rainfall distribution in ars to understand how rainfall is distributed within ars we consider three separate regions around the ar major axis the first region the one closest to the ar major axis covers the area within 75km on both sides of the major axis i e on east side and west side of the major axis the second region is the area from 75km to 150km while the third region is from 150km to 300km in all the three regions we calculate 4 h accumulated rainfall 2h before the ar time step and 2h after the ar time step for all the ars from 2002 to 2014 this is possible because we use stage iv which is the product that shows the closest agreement with cpc as discussed in the next section these accumulations are obtained for each latitude point from 30 n to 40 n which is the latitudinal range used to define ars another important question is related to the relationship between ivt magnitude in ars and the corresponding rainfall magnitude we expect higher rainfall amounts corresponding to large ivt magnitudes even though this depends on precipitation efficiency and the location of cold fronts for the lift to examine this at each latitude we calculate the spearman correlation coefficient between ivt and rainfall magnitudes during ars to quantify monotonic relationship between the two variables to understand the impact of ar duration on rainfall for each ar time step 4 h rainfall accumulations are calculated 2h before the ar time step and 2h after it within a 250km buffer around the major axis the first time step of an ar defines the start of the event as the ar duration increases the time steps increase the accumulated rainfall for each ar time step is divided by the number of grid cells encompassed by the 250km buffer to give 4 h rainfall intensities the rainfall corresponding to each ar time step is averaged across all ars from 2002 to 2014 hence we get an average 4 h rainfall per pixel for each ar time step we can compare the rainfall intensity of different ar time steps providing us with an insight on the effect of ar duration on rainfall the final question of the study is concerned with the diurnal variation in the rainfall associated with ars for this we consider four times for which merra provides data i e 0000utc 0600utc 1200utc and 1800utc at each of these time steps we compare rainfall amounts in the region closest to the major axis i e the area within the 75km buffer around the major axis at each latitude point from 30 n to 40 n moreover at each of the four times of the day we calculate the spearman correlation coefficient between rainfall and ivt magnitudes to detect any time dependent relationship between the two variables 4 results and discussion 4 1 evaluation of remote sensing products the average annual rainfall and the contribution from ars using cpc for the 2003 2014 period are shown in fig 1 distinct spatial variations can be observed in the average annual rainfall with areas receiving less than 500mm on the west part of the central united states east of the rockies and areas receiving more than 1700mm around the gulf of mexico fig 1 top left panel a large stretch of the central united states receives significant contribution to the annual rainfall from ars fig 1 top right and bottom left panels generally regions characterized by large rainfall have relatively large fractions about 25 35 contributed by ars these areas also resemble reasonably well the regions of high ar density fig 1 bottom right panel defined here as the average frequency of ar days per year over the period 2003 2014 as can be expected from the ar characteristics the shape of the areas with the largest ar contributions resembles extratropical storm track on the west side of the appalachian mountains the magnitude and the spatial structure of average annual rainfall and ar contribution from the remote sensing products are shown in fig 2 and can be compared with cpc fig 1 stage iv is the product that most closely resembles the cpc results followed by trmm fig 2 top panels the other three products trmmrt cmorph and persiann show overestimation over much of the great plains including the states of iowa missouri kansas and arkansas similar to what was found for the average annual rainfall these three products underestimate the fractional contribution from ars to annual rainfall over much of the central united states which is instead much better captured by stage iv and trmm fig 2 middle and bottom panels overall the visual examination of these figures indicates that stage iv most closely resembles the reference data followed by trmm these findings also underline the importance of the bias correction of the remote sensing based precipitation estimates fig 3 shows 2 d histograms of the daily rainfall left panels and ar related rainfall most of the points in the stage iv panels fig 3 top row are scattered symmetrically around and close to the 1 1 line there is a lack of symmetry for the other products both for the overall and ar related rainfall this suggests that stage iv has the lowest bias another feature that distinguishes stage iv from the rest of the products is the smallest spread in its scatter pointing to its higher precision fig 4 shows the boxplots of the errors in daily rainfall per pixel top panel and ar related rainfall bottom panel the errors are calculated as the difference between remote sensing product and cpc rainfalls reference all products except stage iv show positive biases stage iv and trmm have lower variances i e higher precision than the other products when focusing on the ar rainfall stage iv and trmm show the best performance although trmmrt has the lowest bias its variance is quite high cmorph and persiann both show negative biases i e underestimation and large variances it is interesting to note that cmorph and persiann show an underestimation in daily rainfall and overestimation in ar related rainfall quantitative comparisons between the remote sensing based products and cpc rainfall are plotted for daily rainfall and ar related rainfall in figs 5 and 6 respectively when considering stage iv the correlation coefficients top panels are larger than 0 9 over much of the central united states similarly mae and mse middle and bottom panels respectively are small 1mm day and 3mm2 day2 respectively over this area these results indicate that there is a strong agreement between cpc and stage iv daily rainfall estimates likely the results of the bias correction with respect to the rain gauges among the other products trmm shows a better performance over most of the region even though the results are worse than what were observed for stage iv as seen earlier in the graphical comparisons the other three products show limited performance over much of the great plains the results for the daily rainfall fig 5 hold for the ar rainfall fig 6 note that since ars generally result in high magnitude rainfalls 10 7mm per day per grid cell as compared to 2 6mm daily average in a year the error scales are higher figs 4 6 from the results of this section it is clear and not surprising that stage iv is the product that most closely reproduces the observed rainfall this is true with respect to both daily and ar related rainfall the superior performance and the fact that stage iv has high temporal and spatial resolutions makes this product well suited for characterizing the rainfall distribution during ars 4 2 rainfall characteristics during ars fig 7 shows the rainfall distribution in the three regions around the ar major axis see section 3 3 as a function of latitude in general most of the rainfall occurs in the mid latitudes from 33 n to 38 n with peak rainfall amounts at around 35 5 n in the closest region to the ar major axis 10mm 4 h at each grid cell in all the three regions the rainfall gradually decreases as we move away from 35 5 n an evident feature in fig 7 is the decrease in rainfall as we move from the closest region to the ar major axis left panel to the region farthest away from it right panel we performed multiple comparisons using two sample student s t tests to statistically test whether the decrease in rainfall in the three regions is statistically significant bonferroni adjustments are performed to take into account multiple comparisons instead of a single comparison at each latitude three comparisons are performed 1 rainfall in the first region is greater than rainfall in the second region 2 rainfall in the second region is greater than rainfall in the farthest region and 3 rainfall in the first region is greater than the rainfall in the farthest region fig 8 shows the bonferroni adjusted p values corresponding to each comparison at each latitude based on these results there is strong statistical evidence p value smaller than 0 01 that on average the ar rainfall decreases as we move away from the major axis in particular between 29 n and 42 n the difference extends beyond this latitude band albeit with lesser evidence to support it the results in figs 7 and 8 show that the largest differences are between the third region and regions one and two further indicating the narrow nature of ars in terms of rainfall with most of the rainfall concentrated within 150km around the ar major axis in fig 7 we also plot spearman rank correlation between ivt and rainfall magnitudes as a function of latitude ivt and rainfall show the largest values of spearman correlation coefficient in the first region within 75km of the ar major axis and between 30 n and 40 n this relationship weakens as we move further away from the major axis and this latitudinal band pearson s correlation coefficient which measures the strength of linear relationships also shows similar trends in all the three regions not shown these results suggest that in the region closest to ar major axis higher rainfall may be expected with higher amounts of water vapor transported ar duration has a major effect on the rainfall associated with these events fig 9 we used a maximum duration of 90h in our plot because only three ars lasted longer there is a strong dependence of ar rainfall on its duration with on average twice as much rainfall in storms lasting three days compared to one day ars from an impact perspective these results suggest that when ars persist for longer durations heavy flood producing rainfall events can be expected moreover the rainfall intensity does not decrease even when the duration has reached 90h this is different from what is observed in the western united states where rainfall intensity decreases quickly after much shorter durations than observed here fig 7 ralph et al 2013 finally we examine whether there are differences in ars during the course of the day focusing on the areas closest to the ar major axis fig 10 there is a marginal difference between the rainfall magnitudes at 0000utc and 1800utc however by performing one way analysis of variance anova tests we do not see a major difference in rainfall magnitudes among the four times of the day this suggests that a weak or zero diurnal variation exists in rainfall associated with ars earlier studies have shown that diurnal variations in extreme rainfall over the central united states are predominant in summer and have a weaker signature in winter dai et al 1999 wallace 1975 also observed that the diurnal variations in heavy rainfall events during winter over the u s midwest had smaller amplitude in the winter than in the summer because ar frequency is the largest in winter and spring and the smallest in summer lavers and villarini 2013 our findings of weak or no diurnal variations in ar related rainfall are consistent with past observations and physical understanding of ars fig 10 also shows that the relationship between ar related rainfall and ivt magnitudes is similar across all the times of the day with larger rainfall magnitudes in the mid latitudes 5 conclusions in this study we have focused on the characterization of rainfall associated with ars that affected the central united states over 2002 2014 period the main findings of our work can be summarized as follows the fractional contribution of ars to annual rainfall over the central united states can be as high as 35 for characterizing the ar rainfall a suite of remote sensing based precipitation products are evaluated stage iv showed the closest agreement with the reference rainfall data in terms of both total rainfall and rainfall associated with ars trmm turned out to be the next best product most of the rainfall during ars is located within about 150km around the ar major axis over the central united states ar rainfall magnitude has a significant monotonic relationship with ivt magnitude rainfall as well as its relationship with ivt vary as a function of latitude with peak rainfall magnitudes in the latitude band 32 36 n ar duration is an important factor in determining the intensity of rainfall as the ar duration increases rainfall intensity increases weak diurnal variations are observed in the rainfall around the ar major axis with marginally larger rainfall at evening and night hours as compared to daytime hours the results from this study provide significant contribution to the scientific knowledge about rainfall in ars improved understanding of the distribution of rainfall during ars and how it relates to water vapor transport can help to better model or constrain the precipitation process in regional and numerical weather prediction models over the central united states numerical weather prediction models forecast ars with good skill up to a lead time of 7days nayak et al 2014 the results from the present study therefore can have a direct impact on developing flood protection strategies during ars as once we know the ar location and duration it is possible to anticipate the location and intensity of maximum rainfall acknowledgments munir a nayak gratefully acknowledges support by nasa headquarters under the nasa earth and space science fellowship program grant nnx14ak78h gabriele

7602,atmospheric rivers ars play a central role in the hydrology and hydroclimatology of the central united states more than 25 of the annual rainfall is associated with ars over much of this region with many large flood events tied to their occurrence despite the relevance of these storms for flood hydrology and water budget the characteristics of rainfall associated with ars over the central united has not been investigated thus far this study fills this major scientific gap by describing the rainfall during ars over the central united states using five remote sensing based precipitation products over a 12 year study period the products we consider are stage iv tropical rainfall measuring mission multi satellite precipitation analysis tmpa both real time and research version precipitation estimation from remotely sensed information using artificial neural networks persiann the cpc morphing technique cmorph as part of the study we evaluate these products against a rain gauge based dataset using both graphical and metrics based diagnostics based on our analyses stage iv is found to better reproduce the reference data hence we use it for the characterization of rainfall in ars most of the ar rainfall is located in a narrow region within 150km on both sides of the ar major axis in this region rainfall has a pronounced positive relationship with the magnitude of the water vapor transport moreover we have also identified a consistent increase in rainfall intensity with duration or persistence of ar conditions however there is not a strong indication of diurnal variability in ar rainfall these results can be directly used in developing flood protection strategies during ars further weather prediction agencies can benefit from the results of this study to achieve higher skill of resolving precipitation processes in their models keywords atmospheric rivers rainfall characterization extreme rainfall remote sensing based precipitation evaluation 1 introduction atmospheric rivers ars are increasingly recognized among the key processes that govern the variability in climate water budget and hydrology in different regions around the globe first observed by newell et al 1992 ars represent filamentary regions of high water vapor flux in the atmosphere subsequently zhu and newell 1994 used the term atmospheric river for such regions to reflect narrow and long river like features in the atmosphere while ars occupy less than 10 of the global longitude at a particular latitude more than 90 of the meridional water vapor flux in the extratropics occurs within them ars are generally present in extratropical cyclones within the warm conveyor belt in the warm sector ahead of the surface cold front in the lower levels of the troposphere e g ralph et al 2004 this region is characterized by the presence of high water vapor content and low level jet llj browning and pardoe 1973 ralph et al 2004 resulting in high water vapor transport towards the extratropics although much of the transport occurs directly from the tropics to the extratropics recent studies suggest that this is not always the case as some moisture is added along the path of the system by evaporation from surface and local convergence bao et al 2006 dacre et al 2015 ars have been shown to play a central role in the hydrology and water budget of many regions in the global midlatitudes water resources of the state of california are strongly dependent on year to year variability of ars dettinger et al 2011 dettinger et al 2011 showed that ars contributed between 20 and 50 to the total annual precipitation and streamflow in california and much of the u s west coast over the 1998 2008 period lavers and villarini 2015 obtained similar results when examining the ar contribution to total precipitation over the 1979 2012 period they also expanded the analyses to the central and eastern united states and europe in these regions the fractional contribution to monthly average precipitation was estimated to be 25 30 guan et al 2010 studied snowfall events in 2004 2010 cold seasons october to march over sierra nevada california and found that ars provided between 24 and 53 of the seasonal snow water equivalent this brief overview highlights the fact that ars are significant sources of atmospheric moisture to water resources in addition to this they also play a critical role in flood hydrology for example over the northern part of the u s west coast rutz et al 2014 showed that a large fraction 60 of cold season extreme daily 90th percentile precipitation events are linked to ars ralph et al 2006 focused on the russian river california and found that ars were responsible for all the seven floods that crossed the flood stage threshold from the year 1997 2006 strong influence of ars was also observed over western washington by neiman et al 2011 who showed that more than 95 of the floods from 1980 to 2009 were associated with ars while most of the studies have focused on the u s west coast ars also play a major role in the hydrologic extremes of the central united states nakamura et al 2013 studied 20 extreme floods in spring over large ohio river basins watershed areas larger than 1000km2 from 1901 to 2008 in all the 20 floods large moisture transports were observed from atlantic and gulf of mexico features reminiscent of ar characteristic over the central united states lavers and villarini 2013 showed that more than 60 of the annual maximum floods during 1979 2011 period were associated with ars over much of the central united states with seven out of the ten largest floods associated with these storms moreover ars are the mechanisms responsible for some of the most devastating flooding events over this region in recent decades including the floods of july 1993 dirmeyer and kinter 2009 june 2008 floods over eastern iowa budikova et al 2010 smith et al 2013 may 2010 flood in nashville tennessee and surrounding areas moore et al 2012 and the flood of april 2013 over chicago and eastern iowa campos and wang 2015 nayak et al 2016 despite the central role ars play in producing floods over the central united states little is known about the distribution of rainfall within ars over this area to the best of our knowledge only nayak et al 2016 provide preliminary insights on the distribution of rainfall during ars over the central united states even though the results are limited to a very small sample size a study period of 66days in april june 2013 in which only three ars occurred the lack of knowledge regarding the rainfall distribution in ars is a major gap in the understanding of the science of ars filling this gap serves the motivation for present study the primary goal of this study is to understand the rainfall distribution during ars using high resolution remote sensing based precipitation products specifically the research questions we address are where is the heaviest rainfall located in ars how quickly does it decrease as we move away from the areas of the most intense transport within these storms what is the relationship between rainfall intensity and the magnitude of the moisture transport how does this relationship vary within the ars and across the central united states how does ar rainfall change with the duration of these events over the u s west coast for example ralph et al 2013 found that long duration ars produce significantly larger amounts of rainfall and streamflow than short duration events likely due to the continuous supply of water vapor available for rainout over the u s west coast orographic lifting of moisture laden air masses results in intense rainfalls ralph et al 2004 and references therein whereas over the central united states mesoscale convective systems mcss and frontal systems associated with extratropical cyclones are the main drivers of extreme precipitation events kunkel et al 2012 stevenson and schumacher 2014 although the rain producing mechanisms over the central united states are different than those over the u s west coast it is reasonable to assume that as the duration of the ars increase the rainfall may increase here as well the impact of the duration of ars on rainfall intensity over central united states is addressed in this study how does the ar rainfall magnitude differ during the course of the day an important characteristics observed in rainfall extremes across the great plains is their diurnal cycle this cycle is the most pronounced in the summer season when most of the extreme rainfall events occur from mid night to the early morning e g dai et al 1999 wallace 1975 in winter on the other hand the diurnal cycle is weak here we examine whether the ar rainfall magnitudes vary during the day to carry out the analyses and address the research questions listed above we will use quantitative precipitation estimates qpe from remote sensing products over the past decade we have seen the development of several datasets providing qpe each with different strengths and weaknesses as part of this study we will focus on one radar based and four satellite based rainfall products and perform a comprehensive evaluation with respect to a rain gauge based reference product while the evaluation of remote sensing product is topic addressed in several previous studies for example aghakouchak et al 2011 cai et al 2015 chen et al 2013 derin and yilmaz 2014 prat and nelson 2015 puca et al 2014 vila et al 2009 villarini and krajewski 2007 villarini et al 2009 zhang et al 2015 how well different products can represent ar rainfall is a topic that requires further investigation aghakouchak et al 2011 compared four satellite products and concluded that none of the products can be treated as best suited to characterize extreme rainfalls further the performance of the products decreases as the events become more extreme a more recent study by prat and nelson 2015 also highlights the poor performance of satellite and remote sensing products in capturing extreme rainfall further challenges arise due to the peculiar structure of narrow and long rain bands that have been observed in some ars studied over the central united states for example moore et al 2012 nayak et al 2016 hence from an ar perspective it is important to evaluate different remote sensing products to select the best product before performing rainfall characterization in ars the paper is organized as follows the data used in this study are described in section 2 followed by section 3 where we describe the methodology in section 4 we present the major outcomes of the study finally the conclusions of this work are presented in section 5 2 data the data for detecting ars are retrieved from atmospheric reanalysis dataset by the national aeronautics and space administration nasa s modern era retrospective analysis for research and applications merra rienecker et al 2011 specifically we retrieved specific humidity q zonal and meridional winds u and v respectively the data are at 6 hourly temporal resolution 0 5 0 667 horizontal resolution and at 72 pressure levels from the surface 976 62hpa to 0 015hpa the data are available over the entire globe from 1979 to the present however here we identify ars only over the 2002 2014 period consistent with the data availability of the precipitation products we evaluated one ground based and four satellite based products for characterizing rainfall during ars 1 national centers for environmental prediction ncep stage iv precipitation product lin

simplicity throughout the paper we will address trmm 3b42 v7 as trmm and trmm 3b42rt v7 as trmmrt stage iv precipitation data can be obtained at hourly 6 hourly and daily temporal resolutions the data are available from 2002 to the present over most of the conterminous united states at approximately 4km 4km horizontal resolution the data are a mosaicked analysis performed at ncep from precipitation estimates produced by 12 regional forecasting centers rfcs across the united states all the rfcs that encompass the central united states use multi sensor precipitation estimates from weather surveillance radar 1988 doppler wsr 88d radars merged with hourly rain gauge measurements the hourly rain gauge data for these rfcs come from either all or some of the real time gauges of the hydrometeorological automated data system hads gauges the automated surface observing system asos and the automated airport weather stations awos reports see hou et al 2014 for further details on stage iv analysis a manual quality control is performed at each rfc the two tmpa datasets trmm and trmmrt are available from 1998 and 2000 respectively both datasets are at 3 hourly temporal resolution and 0 25 0 25 horizontal resolution trmmrt estimates are obtained by calibrating and merging passive microwave data and 10μm band infra red ir data from sensors on different satellites the passive microwave data are obtained from trmm microwave imager tmi on trmm satellite the special sensor microwave imager ssm i on defense meteorological satellite program dmsp satellites the advanced microwave sounding unit b amsu b on the national oceanic and atmospheric administration noaa satellites and the advanced microwave scanning radiometer earth observing system amsr e on aqua the ir data are obtained from the international constellation of geosynchronous earth orbit geo satellites for the research version trmm monthly gauge based precipitation data from global precipitation climatological center gpcc rudolf 1993 and the climate assessment and monitoring system cams xie et al 1996 are used to adjust this product on a monthly basis for detailed information regarding tmpa estimates refer to huffman et al 2007 cmorph and persiann data are available at 0 25 0 25 horizontal resolution the finest temporal resolution for cmorph is 3 hourly and data are available from december 2002 to the present persiann data are available at 3 hourly 6 hourly and daily temporal resolutions from march 2002 to the present the reference data used to evaluate the remote sensing products is cpc s gauge based precipitation over the conterminous united states higgins et al 2000 the data are at daily temporal resolution and 0 25 0 25 horizontal resolution and are available from 1948 to the present presently cpc extracts daily rainfall data from daily rainfall reports provided by about 13 000 15 000 stations higgins et al 2000 rfcs provide daily reports at about 8000 stations and around 4000 are independently provided by national climatic data center hou et al 2014 hou et al 2014 estimate that out of the 8000 stations provided by rfcs 90 have data available at hourly temporal resolution which could have been used to obtain the stage iv hourly estimates as well this implies that cpc and stage iv data are not completely independent even though there are differences because of the use of different quality controls at each rfc and the availability of 4000 additional independent stations in cpc with that said we expect stage iv and trmm to show closer agreements to the reference cpc data 3 methods 3 1 ar identification two common atmospheric variables that are used to identify ars are integrated vapor transport ivt and column integrated water vapor iwv in this study we used ivt because it has a stronger relationship with rainfall than iwv lavers and villarini 2015 rutz et al 2014 ivt magnitude kgm 1 s 1 is calculated as follows 1 ivt 1 g 1000 300 qu dp 2 1 g 1000 300 qv dp 2 where q u and v are layer averaged specific humidity kgkg 1 zonal and meridional wind components ms 1 respectively g is the acceleration due to gravity 9 81ms 2 and dp pa is the difference in pressure between two adjacent vertical levels in the atmosphere because most of the water vapor content in the atmosphere is within the first 5km altitude from the surface we used data from the surface to 300hpa 28 vertical levels in merra to calculate ivt this is consistent with other studies over the central united states lavers and villarini 2013 nayak et al 2014 for identifying ars we followed the same methodology that is used in nayak et al 2016 first we calculate the daily ivt threshold between 85 w and 100 w at latitude 40 n the longitude 85 100 w is used to define central united states the latitude 40 n is chosen to capture ars that progress well within the central united states ivt thresholds to identify ars are calculated as follows at each grid point from 85 w to 100 w at 40 n we calculate the average daily ivt taken from the four 6 hourly time steps from 1979 to 2014 from the ivt values the maximum ivt value over this transect is taken for each day and then a 15 day smoothing is performed this creates a timeseries of daily maximum ivt from 1979 to 2014 in the transect the threshold for each day of the year is calculated as the 85th percentile of the smoothed maximum values the use of daily thresholds takes into account the seasonal variations that are present in ivt magnitude over the year after the daily thresholds are calculated each time step of each day from 1979 to 2014 is examined to identify ars for each time step if the maximum ivt between 85 w and 100 w at 40 n is below the threshold for that day the algorithm stops and we move the next time step on the other hand if the maximum ivt is above the threshold the ivt value and the corresponding latitude and longitude are recorded at this point we move one grid point south i e to 39 5 n at this latitude the grid point with maximum ivt is identified if its location is within two grid points either to the east or to the west of the longitude of the maximum ivt found at 40 n we continue the search southward the displacement condition of searching two grid points east and west is to ensure spatial homogeneity a useful characteristic of ivt in ars if the maximum ivt values of all the grid points from 40 n to 30 5 n exceed the threshold and if they satisfy the displacement condition then we consider the time step an ar step the same procedure is repeated from south to north to confirm the correct latitude longitude of the maximum ivts where the latitude longitude points do not match we take the points from the backward i e starting at 30 5 n search method the same procedure is repeated for latitude bands 31 0 40 5 n 31 5 41 0 n and 32 0 41 5 n to include ar time steps near the vicinity of the central united states we merge all ar time steps from all the searches to get the final list of ar time steps for an identified ar the set of maximum ivt grid points is referred to as the ar major axis the length criterion for ars is the distance between 40 n and 30 5 n which is more than 1050km similar to nayak et al 2014 if three consecutive time steps 18h are identified as ar steps we consider the collection of the ar steps as a persistent ar or simply an ar this methodology was extensively evaluated in nayak et al 2016 3 2 evaluation methods we evaluate and compare all the precipitation products for a common period of 12years from 2003 to 2014 data from cmorph are available only after december 2002 so we start evaluation from 2003 first all the products are brought to a common spatial and temporal resolutions of 0 25 0 25 and 1200utc to 1200utc respectively for visual comparison we calculate total rainfall and rainfall associated with ar for the 12 year period from cpc and the five remote sensing products we refer to the rainfall within a 250km buffer around the ar major axis as the rainfall associated with the ar or ar related rainfall we perform different quantitative evaluations to get a better idea of any under or over estimation by the remote sensing products daily rainfall estimates from remote sensing products are compared with cpc rainfall amounts at each grid point over the central united states 30 50 n and 85 100 w with the help of boxplots and scatter plots further objective evaluation measures are also considered including pearson s product moment correlation coefficient correlation coefficient from here onwards mean absolute error mae and mean squared error mse for each of the five products we calculate these measures at each grid point from daily rainfall data of 12years these analyses are performed for rainfall associated with ars as well 3 3 rainfall distribution in ars to understand how rainfall is distributed within ars we consider three separate regions around the ar major axis the first region the one closest to the ar major axis covers the area within 75km on both sides of the major axis i e on east side and west side of the major axis the second region is the area from 75km to 150km while the third region is from 150km to 300km in all the three regions we calculate 4 h accumulated rainfall 2h before the ar time step and 2h after the ar time step for all the ars from 2002 to 2014 this is possible because we use stage iv which is the product that shows the closest agreement with cpc as discussed in the next section these accumulations are obtained for each latitude point from 30 n to 40 n which is the latitudinal range used to define ars another important question is related to the relationship between ivt magnitude in ars and the corresponding rainfall magnitude we expect higher rainfall amounts corresponding to large ivt magnitudes even though this depends on precipitation efficiency and the location of cold fronts for the lift to examine this at each latitude we calculate the spearman correlation coefficient between ivt and rainfall magnitudes during ars to quantify monotonic relationship between the two variables to understand the impact of ar duration on rainfall for each ar time step 4 h rainfall accumulations are calculated 2h before the ar time step and 2h after it within a 250km buffer around the major axis the first time step of an ar defines the start of the event as the ar duration increases the time steps increase the accumulated rainfall for each ar time step is divided by the number of grid cells encompassed by the 250km buffer to give 4 h rainfall intensities the rainfall corresponding to each ar time step is averaged across all ars from 2002 to 2014 hence we get an average 4 h rainfall per pixel for each ar time step we can compare the rainfall intensity of different ar time steps providing us with an insight on the effect of ar duration on rainfall the final question of the study is concerned with the diurnal variation in the rainfall associated with ars for this we consider four times for which merra provides data i e 0000utc 0600utc 1200utc and 1800utc at each of these time steps we compare rainfall amounts in the region closest to the major axis i e the area within the 75km buffer around the major axis at each latitude point from 30 n to 40 n moreover at each of the four times of the day we calculate the spearman correlation coefficient between rainfall and ivt magnitudes to detect any time dependent relationship between the two variables 4 results and discussion 4 1 evaluation of remote sensing products the average annual rainfall and the contribution from ars using cpc for the 2003 2014 period are shown in fig 1 distinct spatial variations can be observed in the average annual rainfall with areas receiving less than 500mm on the west part of the central united states east of the rockies and areas receiving more than 1700mm around the gulf of mexico fig 1 top left panel a large stretch of the central united states receives significant contribution to the annual rainfall from ars fig 1 top right and bottom left panels generally regions characterized by large rainfall have relatively large fractions about 25 35 contributed by ars these areas also resemble reasonably well the regions of high ar density fig 1 bottom right panel defined here as the average frequency of ar days per year over the period 2003 2014 as can be expected from the ar characteristics the shape of the areas with the largest ar contributions resembles extratropical storm track on the west side of the appalachian mountains the magnitude and the spatial structure of average annual rainfall and ar contribution from the remote sensing products are shown in fig 2 and can be compared with cpc fig 1 stage iv is the product that most closely resembles the cpc results followed by trmm fig 2 top panels the other three products trmmrt cmorph and persiann show overestimation over much of the great plains including the states of iowa missouri kansas and arkansas similar to what was found for the average annual rainfall these three products underestimate the fractional contribution from ars to annual rainfall over much of the central united states which is instead much better captured by stage iv and trmm fig 2 middle and bottom panels overall the visual examination of these figures indicates that stage iv most closely resembles the reference data followed by trmm these findings also underline the importance of the bias correction of the remote sensing based precipitation estimates fig 3 shows 2 d histograms of the daily rainfall left panels and ar related rainfall most of the points in the stage iv panels fig 3 top row are scattered symmetrically around and close to the 1 1 line there is a lack of symmetry for the other products both for the overall and ar related rainfall this suggests that stage iv has the lowest bias another feature that distinguishes stage iv from the rest of the products is the smallest spread in its scatter pointing to its higher precision fig 4 shows the boxplots of the errors in daily rainfall per pixel top panel and ar related rainfall bottom panel the errors are calculated as the difference between remote sensing product and cpc rainfalls reference all products except stage iv show positive biases stage iv and trmm have lower variances i e higher precision than the other products when focusing on the ar rainfall stage iv and trmm show the best performance although trmmrt has the lowest bias its variance is quite high cmorph and persiann both show negative biases i e underestimation and large variances it is interesting to note that cmorph and persiann show an underestimation in daily rainfall and overestimation in ar related rainfall quantitative comparisons between the remote sensing based products and cpc rainfall are plotted for daily rainfall and ar related rainfall in figs 5 and 6 respectively when considering stage iv the correlation coefficients top panels are larger than 0 9 over much of the central united states similarly mae and mse middle and bottom panels respectively are small 1mm day and 3mm2 day2 respectively over this area these results indicate that there is a strong agreement between cpc and stage iv daily rainfall estimates likely the results of the bias correction with respect to the rain gauges among the other products trmm shows a better performance over most of the region even though the results are worse than what were observed for stage iv as seen earlier in the graphical comparisons the other three products show limited performance over much of the great plains the results for the daily rainfall fig 5 hold for the ar rainfall fig 6 note that since ars generally result in high magnitude rainfalls 10 7mm per day per grid cell as compared to 2 6mm daily average in a year the error scales are higher figs 4 6 from the results of this section it is clear and not surprising that stage iv is the product that most closely reproduces the observed rainfall this is true with respect to both daily and ar related rainfall the superior performance and the fact that stage iv has high temporal and spatial resolutions makes this product well suited for characterizing the rainfall distribution during ars 4 2 rainfall characteristics during ars fig 7 shows the rainfall distribution in the three regions around the ar major axis see section 3 3 as a function of latitude in general most of the rainfall occurs in the mid latitudes from 33 n to 38 n with peak rainfall amounts at around 35 5 n in the closest region to the ar major axis 10mm 4 h at each grid cell in all the three regions the rainfall gradually decreases as we move away from 35 5 n an evident feature in fig 7 is the decrease in rainfall as we move from the closest region to the ar major axis left panel to the region farthest away from it right panel we performed multiple comparisons using two sample student s t tests to statistically test whether the decrease in rainfall in the three regions is statistically significant bonferroni adjustments are performed to take into account multiple comparisons instead of a single comparison at each latitude three comparisons are performed 1 rainfall in the first region is greater than rainfall in the second region 2 rainfall in the second region is greater than rainfall in the farthest region and 3 rainfall in the first region is greater than the rainfall in the farthest region fig 8 shows the bonferroni adjusted p values corresponding to each comparison at each latitude based on these results there is strong statistical evidence p value smaller than 0 01 that on average the ar rainfall decreases as we move away from the major axis in particular between 29 n and 42 n the difference extends beyond this latitude band albeit with lesser evidence to support it the results in figs 7 and 8 show that the largest differences are between the third region and regions one and two further indicating the narrow nature of ars in terms of rainfall with most of the rainfall concentrated within 150km around the ar major axis in fig 7 we also plot spearman rank correlation between ivt and rainfall magnitudes as a function of latitude ivt and rainfall show the largest values of spearman correlation coefficient in the first region within 75km of the ar major axis and between 30 n and 40 n this relationship weakens as we move further away from the major axis and this latitudinal band pearson s correlation coefficient which measures the strength of linear relationships also shows similar trends in all the three regions not shown these results suggest that in the region closest to ar major axis higher rainfall may be expected with higher amounts of water vapor transported ar duration has a major effect on the rainfall associated with these events fig 9 we used a maximum duration of 90h in our plot because only three ars lasted longer there is a strong dependence of ar rainfall on its duration with on average twice as much rainfall in storms lasting three days compared to one day ars from an impact perspective these results suggest that when ars persist for longer durations heavy flood producing rainfall events can be expected moreover the rainfall intensity does not decrease even when the duration has reached 90h this is different from what is observed in the western united states where rainfall intensity decreases quickly after much shorter durations than observed here fig 7 ralph et al 2013 finally we examine whether there are differences in ars during the course of the day focusing on the areas closest to the ar major axis fig 10 there is a marginal difference between the rainfall magnitudes at 0000utc and 1800utc however by performing one way analysis of variance anova tests we do not see a major difference in rainfall magnitudes among the four times of the day this suggests that a weak or zero diurnal variation exists in rainfall associated with ars earlier studies have shown that diurnal variations in extreme rainfall over the central united states are predominant in summer and have a weaker signature in winter dai et al 1999 wallace 1975 also observed that the diurnal variations in heavy rainfall events during winter over the u s midwest had smaller amplitude in the winter than in the summer because ar frequency is the largest in winter and spring and the smallest in summer lavers and villarini 2013 our findings of weak or no diurnal variations in ar related rainfall are consistent with past observations and physical understanding of ars fig 10 also shows that the relationship between ar related rainfall and ivt magnitudes is similar across all the times of the day with larger rainfall magnitudes in the mid latitudes 5 conclusions in this study we have focused on the characterization of rainfall associated with ars that affected the central united states over 2002 2014 period the main findings of our work can be summarized as follows the fractional contribution of ars to annual rainfall over the central united states can be as high as 35 for characterizing the ar rainfall a suite of remote sensing based precipitation products are evaluated stage iv showed the closest agreement with the reference rainfall data in terms of both total rainfall and rainfall associated with ars trmm turned out to be the next best product most of the rainfall during ars is located within about 150km around the ar major axis over the central united states ar rainfall magnitude has a significant monotonic relationship with ivt magnitude rainfall as well as its relationship with ivt vary as a function of latitude with peak rainfall magnitudes in the latitude band 32 36 n ar duration is an important factor in determining the intensity of rainfall as the ar duration increases rainfall intensity increases weak diurnal variations are observed in the rainfall around the ar major axis with marginally larger rainfall at evening and night hours as compared to daytime hours the results from this study provide significant contribution to the scientific knowledge about rainfall in ars improved understanding of the distribution of rainfall during ars and how it relates to water vapor transport can help to better model or constrain the precipitation process in regional and numerical weather prediction models over the central united states numerical weather prediction models forecast ars with good skill up to a lead time of 7days nayak et al 2014 the results from the present study therefore can have a direct impact on developing flood protection strategies during ars as once we know the ar location and duration it is possible to anticipate the location

corresponding author graphical abstract impact of air temperature on the maximum precipitation mp estimation through change in moisture holding capacity of air was investigated a series of previous studies have estimated the mp of 72 h basin average precipitation over the american river watershed arw in northern california by means of the maximum precipitation mp estimation approach which utilizes a physically based regional atmospheric model for the mp estimation they have selected 61 severe storm events for the arw and have maximized them by means of the atmospheric boundary condition shifting abcs and relative humidity maximization rhm methods this study conducted two types of numerical experiments in addition to the mp estimation by the previous studies first the air temperature on the entire lateral boundaries of the outer model domain was increased uniformly by 0 0 8 0 c with 0 5 c increments for the two severest maximized historical storm events in addition to application of the abcs rhm method to investigate the sensitivity of the basin average precipitation over the arw to air temperature rise in this investigation a monotonous increase was found in the maximum 72 h basin average precipitation over the arw with air temperature rise for both of the storm events the second numerical experiment used specific amounts of air temperature rise that is assumed to happen under future climate change conditions air temperature was increased by those specified amounts uniformly on the entire lateral boundaries in addition to application of the abcs rhm method to investigate the impact of air temperature on the mp estimate over the arw under changing climate the results in the second numerical experiment show that temperature increases in the future climate may amplify the mp estimate over the arw the mp estimate may increase by 14 6 in the middle of the 21st century and by 27 3 in the end of the 21st century compared to the historical period keywords probable maximum precipitation pmp regional atmospheric model dynamical downscaling climate change hydraulic structure design atmospheric river 1 introduction estimates of the extreme flood discharges are required to design large hydraulic structures such as dams and flood protection structures in hydraulic structure design the extreme flood discharge is supposed to be the physical upper bound of flow discharge at the drainage area of the targeted hydraulic structure namely at the targeted watershed however it is not simple to obtain the physical upper bound of flow discharge due to the non linearity and complexity of its physical mechanisms streamflow is a component of hydrological processes but it is also influenced by atmospheric phenomena especially precipitation is a major input of water from atmospheric processes to hydrological processes and frequently dominates the amount of flow discharge at a watershed therefore understanding of physical mechanisms of the extreme precipitation is necessary to estimate the extreme flood discharge at a targeted watershed in other words estimating the physical upper bound of precipitation over a targeted watershed with consideration of its physical mechanisms will be the first step for the extreme flood estimation the probable maximum precipitation pmp approach has been widely used to estimate the extreme precipitation e g casas et al 2011 corrigan et al 1999 fernando and wickramasuriya 2011 kulkarni et al 2010 u s weather bureau 1961 1966 zhan and zhou 1984 which was achieved by collaborative efforts among hydrologists and meteorologists since the middle of 1930s stallings et al 1986 according to world meteorological organization wmo 1986 pmp is defined as the meteorologically possible upper bound of precipitation over a targeted size of storm area at a particular location at a certain time of the year without long term climatic trend the pmp approach basically utilizes observed precipitation and maximizes precipitation based on the observed values by means of simple physical relationships between precipitation and other observable variables such as dew point temperature and wind speed despite many applications however there are some fundamental issues on the pmp approach pmp estimates are excessively sensitive to availability of the observation data papalexiou and koutsoyiannis 2006 a simple physical relationship between precipitation and other variables may be unable to describe complicated precipitation mechanisms abbs 1999 although the traditional pmp approach has been very useful as a tool for hydraulic structure design it was originally developed many decades ago when computational resources were considerably limited the dynamical downscaling technique with a physically based atmospheric model is nowadays a useful tool not only in atmospheric science but also in hydrological engineering although the dynamical downscaling technique requires large computational resources recent development in the information technology has enabled the dynamical downscaling technique to be applied to various hydrological problems e g kavvas et al 2013 kay et al 2006 kure et al 2013 markus et al 2011 trinh et al 2016 yoshitani et al 2009 for the estimation of maximum precipitation over a watershed an approach has recently been developed based on the dynamical downscaling technique to estimate the physical upper bound of precipitation over the targeted watershed by means of a physically based regional atmospheric model ishida et al 2015a 2015b ohara et al 2011 this approach first investigates storm systems that caused severe precipitation over the targeted watershed after selecting a sufficient number of severe storm events through the investigation of the historical storm systems this approach maximizes precipitation over the targeted watershed for each of the selected storm events with respect to their physical mechanisms by means of a regional atmospheric model then the largest value of precipitation among the maximized results for all the storm events is considered as the upper bound of precipitation over the targeted watershed the physical upper bound of precipitation estimated by this approach is referred to as maximum precipitation mp to differentiate it from the aforementioned traditional pmp accordingly this fully physically based approach is called the mp estimation approach or the physically based pmp physpmp approach as an alternative to the widely known traditional pmp approach due to the use of a regional atmospheric model the mp estimation approach requires no observations except for those limited observations that are necessary for the calibration and validation of the regional atmospheric model like the traditional pmp approach the mp estimation approach also requires methods to maximize precipitation over a targeted watershed after the preliminary study of ohara et al 2011 ishida et al 2015a 2015b developed two methods with a regional atmospheric model to maximize the contribution of storm systems to precipitation over a targeted watershed first the path of a storm system during a selected storm event is optimized by shifting the atmospheric boundary conditions of the regional atmospheric model over the target watershed in space with respect to latitude and longitude in order to maximize the contribution of the storm system to precipitation over the target watershed after the optimization of the path of the storm system the moisture of the storm system is maximized by setting relative humidity on the boundaries of the regional atmospheric model at 100 in order to maximize the potential of the storm system with respect to moisture the former method is called the atmospheric boundary condition shifting abcs method and the latter is the relative humidity maximization rhm method when the rhm method is applied together with the abcs method the combined method is referred to as the abcs rhm method in this paper the abcs method and the rhm method may be essential for the mp estimation approach because the path and moisture of a storm system have significant effects on the precipitation depth over the targeted watershed meanwhile other atmospheric variables may also influence precipitation depth especially air temperature may be of great interest because global warming is a major aspect of climate change according to an analysis on future climate projection data by kunkel et al 2013 the magnitudes of the maximum precipitable water will increase with air temperature rise magnifying the extreme precipitation in the future in this context this study focuses on air temperature among various atmospheric variables and investigates its impact on the mp estimation through change in moisture holding capacity of air as the target watershed the american river watershed arw in northern california is selected it is one of the three target watersheds in the previous mp estimation studies by ishida et al 2015a 2015b two types of numerical experiments will be conducted to investigate the impact of air temperature on the mp estimate of 72 h basin average precipitation over the arw that was obtained by the abcs rhm method in the previous studies ishida et al 2015a 2015b first the air temperature on the entire lateral boundaries of the domains of a regional atmospheric model will be gradually increased uniformly along the lateral boundaries in addition to the application of the abcs rhm method in order to investigate the influence of air temperature on the mp estimate through increase in the moisture holding capacity of air over the arw secondly the air temperature will be raised to some specific values that are assumed to represent future conditions under changing climate since air temperature is a major indicator of climate change the second numerical experiment is assumed to result in the mp estimate over the arw under future climate change conditions 2 methodology this study investigates the impact of air temperature on the mp estimate through change in the moisture holding capacity of air by several numerical experiments for the numerical experiments air temperature is raised uniformly at the entire lateral boundaries of the outer model domain of a regional atmospheric model to increase the moisture holding capacity of a storm system that brings moisture from the outside of the outer model domain to the targeted watershed this method is referred to as the air temperature adjustment ata method it is noted that all the methods for the mp estimation should be applied only to the boundaries of the outer model domain except at the initial state in order to conserve mass momentum and energy within the model domains during the simulation in this study numerical experiments with the ata method were conducted in addition to the mp estimation by the abcs rhm method of the previous studies ishida et al 2015a 2015b since air temperature rise expands the capacity of moisture in the air air temperature is an important factor that influences precipitation depth if the air contains more moisture a storm system may be able to produce heavier precipitation however air temperature rise alone does not increase the amount of moisture in the air and may reduce relative humidity less relative humidity may cause less precipitation to magnify precipitation depth by the ata method therefore relative humidity has to be taken into account as such it is recommended that the ata method is utilized together with the rhm method for the mp estimation this combined use of the ata method and the rhm method raises air temperature while keeping relative humidity at 100 on the entire model lateral boundaries which results in increase in the air moisture on the model boundaries consequently this combined use increases the moisture of atmospheric flows at synoptic scale that come from the outside into the outer model regional scale domain during the model simulation as explained in ishida et al 2015b in detail the rhm method is run together with the abcs method in mp estimation so that the impact of the rhm method can be concentrated on enhancing the contribution of a specific storm system to precipitation over a targeted watershed in the same manner the ata method with the rhm method is also applied together with the abcs method to increase the moisture of a specific storm system that historically caused severe precipitation over the target watershed 3 targeted watershed and model configuration the arw is located over the west slope of sierra nevada mountain range in northern california in the united states fig 1 there is a large reservoir at the outlet of the arw which is called folsom lake folsom lake is formed by folsom dam folsom dam plays an important role in flood protection because it is located at just upstream of sacramento the capital city of california this study utilizes the same regional atmospheric model the same configuration of the regional atmospheric model and the same global atmospheric data for its original initial and boundary conditions in the previous mp estimation studies of ishida et al 2015a 2015b which were calibrated and validated in ohara et al 2011 and ishida et al 2015a by comparing the model simulations under various configurations with the corresponding observation data the selected regional atmospheric model is the fifth generation penn state national center for atmospheric research ncar mesoscale model mm5 grell et al 1994 fig 2 shows the four nested domains for the mm5 the four nested domains consist of 24 22 horizontal grid points at 81km resolution 37 31 horizontal grid points at 27km resolution 73 49 horizontal grid points at 9km resolution and 175 109 horizontal grid points at 3km resolution respectively with 24 vertical levels the mm5 was configured with the following model options kain fritsch 2 scheme kain and fritsch 1993 for the cumulus parameterization reisner graupel scheme reisner et al 1998 for the microphysics processes medium range forecast scheme hong and pan 1996 for the planetary boundary layer processes the cloud radiation scheme ncar 2005 for a radiation processes and five layer soil model dudhia 1996 for the land surface processes the mp estimation approach with a regional atmospheric model requires global atmospheric data for the model s initial and boundary conditions which are to be adjusted by the aforementioned methods as the global atmospheric data ncar national centers for environmental prediction ncep reanalysis i dataset kalnay et al 1996 was employed 4 application the mp estimation approach requires severe storm events over a targeted watershed to maximize precipitation over the watershed ishida et al 2015a selected 61 severe storm events for the arw from 61 water years from october 1 1950 through september 30 2011 based on the simulation of precipitation fields over arw during this historical period the selected storm events are shown in table 1 the name of the storm events consists of the letter a of the arw two digits of the year and two digits of the months of the storm events when there are more than two storm events in the same month of the same year the storm event names are differentiated by a suffix these 61 selected severe storm events for the arw in the previous studies were also used in this study severe precipitation is mostly caused by a high moisture synoptic scale atmospheric flow the so called atmospheric river ar in northern california where the arw is located ishida et al 2015a focused on 72 h basin average precipitation because 72 h precipitation or 72 h flood discharge is generally used for hydraulic structure design in california then they shifted the atmospheric river to the optimal path to maximize the 72 h basin average precipitation over the arw for each of the 61 selected storm events by the abcs atmospheric boundary condition shifting method after the application of the abcs method ishida et al 2015b utilized the rhm relative humidity maximization method to maximize the moisture of the atmospheric river in addition to the abcs rhm method this study applies the ata atmospheric temperature adjustment method to the selected storm events for the arw by means of the mm5 with the aforementioned configuration in order to investigate the impact of air temperature on the mp estimate over the arw the ata method together with the rhm method will provide more moisture than by the rhm method alone for the atmospheric rivers that strike the arw by the abcs method the ata method in addition to the abcs rhm method is first applied to two of the 61 selected severe storm events the a9701a and the a9501 storm events air temperature on the boundaries is increased uniformly by 0 0 c to 8 0 c with 0 5 c intervals by the ata method in addition to the abcs rhm method in order to investigate the sensitivity of basin average precipitation over the arw to air temperature rise for simplification each case of the numerical experiments is referred to as ata with a specific increase in air temperature for example ata2 5 means that air temperature on the entire lateral boundaries is increased by 2 5 c uniformly by the ata method in addition to the abcs rhm method while ata0 0 means a case that uses only the abcs rhm method the a9701a storm event is one of the most severe historical storm events and the second largest storm event by the abcs rhm method ishida et al 2015b the period of the a9701a storm event is from december 26 1996 through january 6 1997 fig 3 shows the precipitable water over the pacific ocean at 6 00h on january 1 1997 a large atmospheric river that was originally a remnant of a tropical cyclone came from the west sector of the pacific ocean another large atmospheric river came from the middle sector of the tropical zone of the pacific ocean those two large atmospheric rivers merged together over the pacific ocean and became a single huge atmospheric river before it hit the west coast of the united states the a9501 storm event produced the largest storm event with respect to basin average precipitation after application of the abcs rhm method ishida et al 2015b the a9501 storm event started on january 4 1995 and ended on january 18 1995 the atmospheric river of the a9501 storm event was narrow compared to that of the a9701a storm event as illustrated in fig 4 although the atmospheric river of the a9501 storm event historically caused intense precipitation over some parts of northern california secondly the ata method in addition to the abcs rhm method is applied to all the 61 selected storm events to investigate the impact of air temperature on the mp estimate over the arw under changing climate jang et al 2012 assessed future climate change effects on air temperature in northern california based on future climate projections that climate change assessment study states that air temperature will increase by 1 36 c by water year 2055 and by 3 16 c by water year 2099 over the arw compared to water year 2010 the amount of air temperature rise that was estimated in that climate change assessment study is for the inner model domain and not on the boundaries of the outer model domain and is not based on the air temperature during each storm event however the magnitude of air temperature rise over the arw in that future climate change study may be informative for the investigation of the impact of air temperature rise on the mp estimate under changing climate therefore in this study the air temperature is increased uniformly by 1 36 c and 3 16 c on the entire lateral boundaries of the outer domain for the 61 selected severe storm events by the ata method in addition to the abcs rhm method during numerical experiments for the estimation of the maximum 72 h basin average precipitation over arw 5 results and discussion 5 1 sensitivity of mp estimate to air temperature fig 5 shows the amplified maximum 72 h basin average precipitation over the arw during the a9701a and the a9501 storm events by increasing the air temperature uniformly on the entire boundaries of the outer domain with the ata method in addition to the abcs rhm method the peak of the 72 h basin average precipitation increases over the arw for both of the storm events by the rise in air temperature the mp estimate of the 72 h basin average precipitation over the arw by the abcs rhm method ata0 0 was 686mm for the a9701a storm event ishida et al 2015b the mp estimate by the original absc rhm approach increases to 798mm by the additional ata2 0 935mm by the additional ata4 0 1056mm by the additional ata6 0 and 1199mm by the additional ata8 0 the percentage increases in the mp estimate are 16 5 36 5 54 1 and 74 9 respectively compared to the result by ata0 0 the mp estimate by the abcs rhm method ata0 0 was 738mm for the a9501 storm event ishida et al 2015b the mp estimate by the original absc rhm approach increases to 878mm by the additional ata2 0 929mm by the additional ata4 0 1055mm by the additional ata6 0 and 1330mm by the additional ata8 0 the percentage increases from the results of ata0 0 are 18 9 25 9 42 9 and 80 2 respectively the 72 h basin average precipitation increases almost linearly for the a9701a storm event by the additional ata method whereas there are some perturbations on the results for the a9501 storm event fig 6 shows the hourly basin average precipitation and its 72 h moving summation for the amplified results over the arw for the a9701a storm event by the ata method in addition to the abcs rhm method hourly basin average precipitation increases monotonously during each peak over the arw as air temperature rises on the entire lateral boundaries uniformly as a consequence of the increase of the hourly basin average precipitation during each peak the 72 h moving summation in basin average precipitation is also amplified fig 7 shows the precipitation fields within the inner model domain during the 72 h period when the maximum 72 h basin average precipitation occurs over the arw for each temperature rise case for the a9701a storm event precipitation gradually increases over almost all the inner model domain with air temperature rise since the atmospheric river in the a9701a storm event was huge the ata method amplifies the water vapor flux over a wide area as shown in fig 8 this amplification of water vapor flux causes heavier precipitation over a wide area meanwhile precipitation is amplified especially over the arw by the ata method this concentrated amplification of precipitation over the arw is probably because the path of the atmospheric river was already optimized by the abcs method fig 9 shows the hourly basin average precipitation and its 72 h moving summation over the arw for the a9501 storm event by the ata method in addition to the abcs rhm method hourly basin average precipitation increases mainly during the two original largest peaks from 0 00h on january 9 1995 to 12 00h on january 10 1995 over the arw especially the first peak at 10 00h on january 9 1995 is significantly amplified by the ata method the increase in the two peaks of hourly basin average precipitation in turn increases the maximum 72 h basin average precipitation over the arw for the a9501 storm event fig 10 shows the precipitation fields within the inner model domain and the time averaged wind fields at the 500hpa pressure level during the 72 h period during which the maximum 72 h basin average precipitation occurs over the arw for each of the temperature rise cases for the a9501 storm event unlike the a9701a storm event precipitation is amplified only around the arw by the additional ata method as illustrated in fig 11 the additional ata method intensifies only the high moisture atmospheric flow toward the arw meanwhile the precipitation fields slightly but gradually shift toward southeast as air temperature increases on the boundaries of the model domain this shift in the precipitation field is caused by a small change in the wind direction with air temperature rise although this small change in the wind direction is difficult to detect in fig 10 in addition to the narrowness of the high moisture atmospheric flow this shift in the direction of the precipitation fields causes the changes in the maximum 72 h basin average precipitation for the a9501 storm event shown in fig 5 while all the peaks of hourly basin average precipitation for the a9701a storm event are amplified by the additional ata method fig 6 some small peaks for the a9501 storm event are not influenced by the additional ata method fig 9 for example the peak of the hourly precipitation depth on january 7 1995 is originally similar to the peak on january 14 1995 during the a9501 storm event however the peak on january 14 1995 is not amplified by the additional ata method while the peak on january 7 1995 is amplified fig 12 shows water vapor flux fields before the peak on january 7 1995 the water vapor flux of the high moisture atmospheric flow is amplified by the additional ata method and the flow is directed toward the arw meanwhile water vapor flux fields before the first peak on january 14 1995 are shown in fig 13 although the water vapor flux of the high moisture atmospheric flow before the first peak on january 14 1995 is also amplified by the additional ata method the high moisture atmospheric flow is not directed toward the arw but further north consequently the additional ata method magnifies the peak of the basin average precipitation on january 7 1995 but not the peaks on january 14 1995 these results indicate that wind direction of the storm system is an important factor in the amplification of the basin average precipitation by the additional ata method air temperature rise on the boundaries of the outer model domain almost monotonously increases the basin average precipitation over the arw as in fig 5 although the magnitude of increase in the basin average precipitation by the additional ata method may depend on the width of the atmospheric river s during a severe storm event this monotonous increase in the basin average precipitation with air temperature rise may imply the absence of an upper bound with respect to air temperature rise however 8 0 c in air temperature rise may already be too large to occur realistically although the numerical experiments in this section provide some insight into the relationship between severe precipitation and air temperature rise it will be unrealistic to raise the air temperature without considering its magnitude it would be more realistic to consider a specific magnitude in air temperature rise from a source such as a future climate change assessment study as investigated in the next section 5 2 mp estimation under changing climate the maximum 72 h basin average precipitation over the arw for the cases of ata0 0 abcs rhm ata1 36 and ata3 16 for the 61 selected storm events is shown in fig 14 the maximum 72 h basin average precipitation gradually increases for most of the storm events with the air temperature rise on the boundaries of the outer domain on average ata1 36 and ata3 16 in addition to the abcs rhm increase the maximum 72 h basin average precipitation by 9 0 and by 20 3 respectively the largest rates of increase by ata1 36 and ata 3 16 are 16 2 for the a7803 storm event and 40 9 for the a7311 storm event respectively for relatively small storm events the basin average precipitation is hardly amplified by the additional ata method although the maximum 72 h basin average precipitation has decreased by ata1 36 and ata3 16 only for the a6801 storm event on the other hand no clear correlation was found in the maximum 72 h basin average precipitation over the arw between ata0 0 abcs rhm and ata1 36 or ata3 16 additional temperature rises over abcs rhm while a monotonous increase with air temperature rise was found in the basin average precipitation for each storm event similar to the a9501 and the a9701a storm events the magnitude of increase in the basin average precipitation by the additional ata method is different among different storm events these results imply the complexity of atmospheric processes that cause precipitation over a targeted watershed consequently from the addition of ata to abcs rhm methods the a9501 storm event was found to be the storm event with the largest basin average precipitation depth for both of the cases ata1 36 and ata3 16 the mp estimates for this storm for the 72 h basin average precipitation over the arw by ata1 36 and ata3 16 are 846mm and 940mm respectively the historical largest value for the 72 h basin average precipitation and the mp estimate by the abcs rhm method ata0 0 were 423mm and 738mm respectively over the arw ishida et al 2015a 2015b the mp estimates by ata1 36 and ata3 16 are respectively 100 0 and 122 2 larger than the historical largest value and then respectively 14 6 and 27 3 larger than the mp estimate by the abcs rhm method ata0 0 the results of mp estimation by ata1 36 and ata3 16 are assumed to be the mp estimates for water years 2055 and 2099 respectively under changing climate in other words the results by ata1 36 and ata3 16 indicate that the mp estimate will increase respectively by 14 6 and 27 3 in the middle and at the end of the 21st century compared to the estimate under the historical climate conditions u s army corps of engineers 2005 provides a precipitation frequency curve for the 72 h basin average precipitation over the arw whereas the mp estimate under the historical conditions corresponds to precipitation with approximately 35 000 year return period the mp estimate for the end of the 21st century corresponds to precipitation with much more than 100 000years of return period although the magnitudes of air temperature rise taken in this study for the future conditions may be arguable it is highly likely that the ongoing global change in the climate may amplify the mp estimate over the arw in the future 6 summary and conclusions the air temperature adjustment ata method as an additional procedure to atmospheric boundary condition shifting abcs and relative humidity maximization rhm procedures was developed in this study for maximizing the basin average precipitation for a specified duration within this framework the impact of air temperature on the mp estimate through change in moisture holding capacity of air was investigated over the arw in northern california the united states as the target watershed for this investigation two types of numerical experiments were conducted by the ata method first the air temperature on the entire lateral boundaries of the outer model domain was gradually increased from 0 0 c to 8 0 c by 0 5 c increments for the a9701a and the a9501 storm events by the ata method in addition to the abcs rhm method in order to investigate the sensitivity of the maximum 72 h basin average precipitation over the arw to air temperature rise uniformly at the entire model lateral boundaries in this investigation a monotonous increase was found in the maximum 72 h basin average precipitation over the arw with air temperature rise uniformly at the model boundaries for both of the storm events secondly specific magnitudes of air temperature rise that represent future climate conditions during the 21st century were obtained from a climate change assessment study the air temperature was increased uniformly by these specific magnitudes on the model boundaries by the ata method in addition to the abcs rhm method to investigate the impact of air temperature on the mp estimate over the arw under changing climate the results in this second investigation indicate that future climate conditions may amplify the mp estimates that are based on historical conditions the mp estimate may increase over the arw by 14 6 in water year 2055 and by 27 3 in water year 2099 compared to the historical mp estimate the two types of numerical experiments that were performed in this study on the impact of air temperature on the mp estimate demonstrate the complexity of atmospheric systems that cause precipitation over a targeted watershed the increase in the magnitude of the basin average precipitation with air temperature rise uniformly on the model boundaries varies among hourly precipitation peaks within a storm event depending on the direction of high moisture atmospheric flow the magnitude of increase in the basin average precipitation also depends on each storm event although each storm event shows a monotonous increase in the basin average precipitation with air temperature rise air temperature is an important factor in the formation of severe precipitation the results in this study show a high sensitivity of the mp estimate to air temperature rise meanwhile the numerical simulation results of this study imply that the air temperature rise under saturated air moisture conditions may be able to increase precipitation with no upper bound as such the magnitude of air temperature rise would be a key issue for the mp estimation especially under future climate change conditions although in this study the magnitude of air temperature rise under future climate change conditions was obtained from a climate change assessment study the magnitude of temperature rise should be estimated based on careful investigations and discussions in order to keep the mp estimate realistic on the other hand besides the air temperature other atmospheric variables may also affect the precipitation depth although this study focused on the impact of air temperature in addition to abcs and rhm approaches on the mp estimation through change in moisture holding capacity of air physical mechanisms to cause severe precipitation are very complicated therefore it may be prudent to conduct the mp estimations within the framework of downscaled global circulation model future climate projections especially in order to account for the impacts of air temperature sea surface temperature and other variables on the initiation and evolution of high moisture atmospheric flows

corresponding author graphical abstract impact of air temperature on the maximum precipitation mp estimation through change in moisture holding capacity of air was investigated a series of previous studies have estimated the mp of 72 h basin average precipitation over the american river watershed arw in northern california by means of the maximum precipitation mp estimation approach which utilizes a physically based regional atmospheric model for the mp estimation they have selected 61 severe storm events for the arw and have maximized them by means of the atmospheric boundary condition shifting abcs and relative humidity maximization rhm methods this study conducted two types of numerical experiments in addition to the mp estimation by the previous studies first the air temperature on the entire lateral boundaries of the outer model domain was increased uniformly by 0 0 8 0 c with 0 5 c increments for the two severest maximized historical storm events in addition to application of the abcs rhm method to investigate the sensitivity of the basin average precipitation over the arw to air temperature rise in this investigation a monotonous increase was found in the maximum 72 h basin average precipitation over the arw with air temperature rise for both of the storm events the second numerical experiment used specific amounts of air temperature rise that is assumed to happen under future climate change conditions air temperature was increased by those specified amounts uniformly on the entire lateral boundaries in addition to application of the abcs rhm method to investigate the impact of air temperature on the mp estimate over the arw under changing climate the results in the second numerical experiment show that temperature increases in the future climate may amplify the mp estimate over the arw the mp estimate may increase by 14 6 in the middle of the 21st century and by 27 3 in the end of the 21st century compared to the historical period keywords probable maximum precipitation pmp regional atmospheric model dynamical downscaling climate change hydraulic structure design atmospheric river 1 introduction estimates of the extreme flood discharges are required to design large hydraulic structures such as dams and flood protection structures in hydraulic structure design the extreme flood discharge is supposed to be the physical upper bound of flow discharge at the drainage area of the targeted hydraulic structure namely at the targeted watershed however it is not simple to obtain the physical upper bound of flow discharge due to the non linearity and complexity of its physical mechanisms streamflow is a component of hydrological processes but it is also influenced by atmospheric phenomena especially precipitation is a major input of water from atmospheric processes to hydrological processes and frequently dominates the amount of flow discharge at a watershed therefore understanding of physical mechanisms of the extreme precipitation is necessary to estimate the extreme flood discharge at a targeted watershed in other words estimating the physical upper bound of precipitation over a targeted watershed with consideration of its physical mechanisms will be the first step for the extreme flood estimation the probable maximum precipitation pmp approach has been widely used to estimate the extreme precipitation e g casas et al 2011 corrigan et al 1999 fernando and wickramasuriya 2011 kulkarni et al 2010 u s weather bureau 1961 1966 zhan and zhou 1984 which was achieved by collaborative efforts among hydrologists and meteorologists since the middle of 1930s stallings et al 1986 according to world meteorological organization wmo 1986 pmp is defined as the meteorologically possible upper bound of precipitation over a targeted size of storm area at a particular location at a certain time of the year without long term climatic trend the pmp approach basically utilizes observed precipitation and maximizes precipitation based on the observed values by means of simple physical relationships between precipitation and other observable variables such as dew point temperature and wind speed despite many applications however there are some fundamental issues on the pmp approach pmp estimates are excessively sensitive to availability of the observation data papalexiou and koutsoyiannis 2006 a simple physical relationship between precipitation and other variables may be unable to describe complicated precipitation mechanisms abbs 1999 although the traditional pmp approach has been very useful as a tool for hydraulic structure design it was originally developed many decades ago when computational resources were considerably limited the dynamical downscaling technique with a physically based atmospheric model is nowadays a useful tool not only in atmospheric science but also in hydrological engineering although the dynamical downscaling technique requires large computational resources recent development in the information technology has enabled the dynamical downscaling technique to be applied to various hydrological problems e g kavvas et al 2013 kay et al 2006 kure et al 2013 markus et al 2011 trinh et al 2016 yoshitani et al 2009 for the estimation of maximum precipitation over a watershed an approach has recently been developed based on the dynamical downscaling technique to estimate the physical upper bound of precipitation over the targeted watershed by means of a physically based regional atmospheric model ishida et al 2015a 2015b ohara et al 2011 this approach first investigates storm systems that caused severe precipitation over the targeted watershed after selecting a sufficient number of severe storm events through the investigation of the historical storm systems this approach maximizes precipitation over the targeted watershed for each of the selected storm events with respect to their physical mechanisms by means of a regional atmospheric model then the largest value of precipitation among the maximized results for all the storm events is considered as the upper bound of precipitation over the targeted watershed the physical upper bound of precipitation estimated by this approach is referred to as maximum precipitation mp to differentiate it from the aforementioned traditional pmp accordingly this fully physically based approach is called the mp estimation approach or the physically based pmp physpmp approach as an alternative to the widely known traditional pmp approach due to the use of a regional atmospheric model the mp estimation approach requires no observations except for those limited observations that are necessary for the calibration and validation of the regional atmospheric model like the traditional pmp approach the mp estimation approach also requires methods to maximize precipitation over a targeted watershed after the preliminary study of ohara et al 2011 ishida et al 2015a 2015b developed two methods with a regional atmospheric model to maximize the contribution of storm systems to precipitation over a targeted watershed first the path of a storm system during a selected storm event is optimized by shifting the atmospheric boundary conditions of the regional atmospheric model over the target watershed in space with respect to latitude and longitude in order to maximize the contribution of the storm system to precipitation over the target watershed after the optimization of the path of the storm system the moisture of the storm system is maximized by setting relative humidity on the boundaries of the regional atmospheric model at 100 in order to maximize the potential of the storm system with respect to moisture the former method is called the atmospheric boundary condition shifting abcs method and the latter is the relative humidity maximization rhm method when the rhm method is applied together with the abcs method the combined method is referred to as the abcs rhm method in this paper the abcs method and the rhm method may be essential for the mp estimation approach because the path and moisture of a storm system have significant effects on the precipitation depth over the targeted watershed meanwhile other atmospheric variables may also influence precipitation depth especially air temperature may be of great interest because global warming is a major aspect of climate change according to an analysis on future climate projection data by kunkel et al 2013 the magnitudes of the maximum precipitable water will increase with air temperature rise magnifying the extreme precipitation in the future in this context this study focuses on air temperature among various atmospheric variables and investigates its impact on the mp estimation through change in moisture holding capacity of air as the target watershed the american river watershed arw in northern california is selected it is one of the three target watersheds in the previous mp estimation studies by ishida et al 2015a 2015b two types of numerical experiments will be conducted to investigate the impact of air temperature on the mp estimate of 72 h basin average precipitation over the arw that was obtained by the abcs rhm method in the previous studies ishida et al 2015a 2015b first the air temperature on the entire lateral boundaries of the domains of a regional atmospheric model will be gradually increased uniformly along the lateral boundaries in addition to the application of the abcs rhm method in order to investigate the influence of air temperature on the mp estimate through increase in the moisture holding capacity of air over the arw secondly the air temperature will be raised to some specific values that are assumed to represent future conditions under changing climate since air temperature is a major indicator of climate change the second numerical experiment is assumed to result in the mp estimate over the arw under future climate change conditions 2 methodology this study investigates the impact of air temperature on the mp estimate through change in the moisture holding capacity of air by several numerical experiments for the numerical experiments air temperature is raised uniformly at the entire lateral boundaries of the outer model domain of a regional atmospheric model to increase the moisture holding capacity of a storm system that brings moisture from the outside of the outer model domain to the targeted watershed this method is referred to as the air temperature adjustment ata method it is noted that all the methods for the mp estimation should be applied only to the boundaries of the outer model domain except at the initial state in order to conserve mass momentum and energy within the model domains during the simulation in this study numerical experiments with the ata method were conducted in addition to the mp estimation by the abcs rhm method of the previous studies ishida et al 2015a 2015b since air temperature rise expands the capacity of moisture in the air air temperature is an important factor that influences precipitation depth if the air contains more moisture a storm system may be able to produce heavier precipitation however air temperature rise alone does not increase the amount of moisture in the air and may reduce relative humidity less relative humidity may cause less precipitation to magnify precipitation depth by the ata method therefore relative humidity has to be taken into account as such it is recommended that the ata method is utilized together with the rhm method for the mp estimation this combined use of the ata method and the rhm method raises air temperature while keeping relative humidity at 100 on the entire model lateral boundaries which results in increase in the air moisture on the model boundaries consequently this combined use increases the moisture of atmospheric flows at synoptic scale that come from the outside into the outer model regional scale domain during the model simulation as explained in ishida et al 2015b in detail the rhm method is run together with the abcs method in mp estimation so that the impact of the rhm method can be concentrated on enhancing the contribution of a specific storm system to precipitation over a targeted watershed in the same manner the ata method with the rhm method is also applied together with the abcs method to increase the moisture of a specific storm system that historically caused severe precipitation over the target watershed 3 targeted watershed and model configuration the arw is located over the west slope of sierra nevada mountain range in northern california in the united states fig 1 there is a large reservoir at the outlet of the arw which is called folsom lake folsom lake is formed by folsom dam folsom dam plays an important role in flood protection because it is located at just upstream of sacramento the capital city of california this study utilizes the same regional atmospheric model the same configuration of the regional atmospheric model and the same global atmospheric data for its original initial and boundary conditions in the previous mp estimation studies of ishida et al 2015a 2015b which were calibrated and validated in ohara et al 2011 and ishida et al 2015a by comparing the model simulations under various configurations with the corresponding observation data the selected regional atmospheric model is the fifth generation penn state national center for atmospheric research ncar mesoscale model mm5 grell et al 1994 fig 2 shows the four nested domains for the mm5 the four nested domains consist of 24 22 horizontal grid points at 81km resolution 37 31 horizontal grid points at 27km resolution 73 49 horizontal grid points at 9km resolution and 175 109 horizontal grid points at 3km resolution respectively with 24 vertical levels the mm5 was configured with the following model options kain fritsch 2 scheme kain and fritsch 1993 for the cumulus parameterization reisner graupel scheme reisner et al 1998 for the microphysics processes medium range forecast scheme hong and pan 1996 for the planetary boundary layer processes the cloud radiation scheme ncar 2005 for a radiation processes and five layer soil model dudhia 1996 for the land surface processes the mp estimation approach with a regional atmospheric model requires global atmospheric data for the model s initial and boundary conditions which are to be adjusted by the aforementioned methods as the global atmospheric data ncar national centers for environmental prediction ncep reanalysis i dataset kalnay et al 1996 was employed 4 application the mp estimation approach requires severe storm events over a targeted watershed to maximize precipitation over the watershed ishida et al 2015a selected 61 severe storm events for the arw from 61 water years from october 1 1950 through september 30 2011 based on the simulation of precipitation fields over arw during this historical period the selected storm events are shown in table 1 the name of the storm events consists of the letter a of the arw two digits of the year and two digits of the months of the storm events when there are more than two storm events in the same month of the same year the storm event names are differentiated by a suffix these 61 selected severe storm events for the arw in the previous studies were also used in this study severe precipitation is mostly caused by a high moisture synoptic scale atmospheric flow the so called atmospheric river ar in northern california where the arw is located ishida et al 2015a focused on 72 h basin average precipitation because 72 h precipitation or 72 h flood discharge is generally used for hydraulic structure design in california then they shifted the atmospheric river to the optimal path to maximize the 72 h basin average precipitation over the arw for each of the 61 selected storm events by the abcs atmospheric boundary condition shifting method after the application of the abcs method ishida et al 2015b utilized the rhm relative humidity maximization method to maximize the moisture of the atmospheric river in addition to the abcs rhm method this study applies the ata atmospheric temperature adjustment method to the selected storm events for the arw by means of the mm5 with the aforementioned configuration in order to investigate the impact of air temperature on the mp estimate over the arw the ata method together with the rhm method will provide more moisture than by the rhm method alone for the atmospheric rivers that strike the arw by the abcs method the ata method in addition to the abcs rhm method is first applied to two of the 61 selected severe storm events the a9701a and the a9501 storm events air temperature on the boundaries is increased uniformly by 0 0 c to 8 0 c with 0 5 c intervals by the ata method in addition to the abcs rhm method in order to investigate the sensitivity of basin average precipitation over the arw to air temperature rise for simplification each case of the numerical experiments is referred to as ata with a specific increase in air temperature for example ata2 5 means that air temperature on the entire lateral boundaries is increased by 2 5 c uniformly by the ata method in addition to the abcs rhm method while ata0 0 means a case that uses only the abcs rhm method the a9701a storm event is one of the most severe historical storm events and the second largest storm event by the abcs rhm method ishida et al 2015b the period of the a9701a storm event is from december 26 1996 through january 6 1997 fig 3 shows the precipitable water over the pacific ocean at 6 00h on january 1 1997 a large atmospheric river that was originally a remnant of a tropical cyclone came from the west sector of the pacific ocean another large atmospheric river came from the middle sector of the tropical zone of the pacific ocean those two large atmospheric rivers merged together over the pacific ocean and became a single huge atmospheric river before it hit the west coast of the united states the a9501 storm event produced the largest storm event with respect to basin average precipitation after application of the abcs rhm method ishida et al 2015b the a9501 storm event started on january 4 1995 and ended on january 18 1995 the atmospheric river of the a9501 storm event was narrow compared to that of the a9701a storm event as illustrated in fig 4 although the atmospheric river of the a9501 storm event historically caused intense precipitation over some parts of northern california secondly the ata method in addition to the abcs rhm method is applied to all the 61 selected storm events to investigate the impact of air temperature on the mp estimate over the arw under changing climate jang et al 2012 assessed future climate change effects on air temperature in northern california based on future climate projections that climate change assessment study states that air temperature will increase by 1 36 c by water year 2055 and by 3 16 c by water year 2099 over the arw compared to water year 2010 the amount of air temperature rise that was estimated in that climate change assessment study is for the inner model domain and not on the boundaries of the outer model domain and is not based on the air temperature during each storm event however the magnitude of air temperature rise over the arw in that future climate change study may be informative for the investigation of the impact of air temperature rise on the mp estimate under changing climate therefore in this study the air temperature is increased uniformly by 1 36 c and 3 16 c on the entire lateral boundaries of the outer domain for the 61 selected severe storm events by the ata method in addition to the abcs rhm method during numerical experiments for the estimation of the maximum 72 h basin average precipitation over arw 5 results and discussion 5 1 sensitivity of mp estimate to air temperature fig 5 shows the amplified maximum 72 h basin average precipitation over the arw during the a9701a and the a9501 storm events by increasing the air temperature uniformly on the entire boundaries of the outer domain with the ata method in addition to the abcs rhm method the peak of the 72 h basin average precipitation increases over the arw for both of the storm events by the rise in air temperature the mp estimate of the 72 h basin average precipitation over the arw by the abcs rhm method ata0 0 was 686mm for the a9701a storm event ishida et al 2015b the mp estimate by the original absc rhm approach increases to 798mm by the additional ata2 0 935mm by the additional ata4 0 1056mm by the additional ata6 0 and 1199mm by the additional ata8 0 the percentage increases in the mp estimate are 16 5 36 5 54 1 and 74 9 respectively compared to the result by ata0 0 the mp estimate by the abcs rhm method ata0 0 was 738mm for the a9501 storm event ishida et al 2015b the mp estimate by the original absc rhm approach increases to 878mm by the additional ata2 0 929mm by the additional ata4 0 1055mm by the additional ata6 0 and 1330mm by the additional ata8 0 the percentage increases from the results of ata0 0 are 18 9 25 9 42 9 and 80 2 respectively the 72 h basin average precipitation increases almost linearly for the a9701a storm event by the additional ata method whereas there are some perturbations on the results for the a9501 storm event fig 6 shows the hourly basin average precipitation and its 72 h moving summation for the amplified results over the arw for the a9701a storm event by the ata method in addition to the abcs rhm method hourly basin average precipitation increases monotonously during each peak over the arw as air temperature rises on the entire lateral boundaries uniformly as a consequence of the increase of the hourly basin average precipitation during each peak the 72 h moving summation in basin average precipitation is also amplified fig 7 shows the precipitation fields within the inner model domain during the 72 h period when the maximum 72 h basin average precipitation occurs over the arw for each temperature rise case for the a9701a storm event precipitation gradually increases over almost all the inner model domain with air temperature rise since the atmospheric river in the a9701a storm event was huge the ata method amplifies the water vapor flux over a wide area as shown in fig 8 this amplification of water vapor flux causes heavier precipitation over a wide area meanwhile precipitation is amplified especially over the arw by the ata method this concentrated amplification of precipitation over the arw is probably because the path of the atmospheric river was already optimized by the abcs method fig 9 shows the hourly basin average precipitation and its 72 h moving summation over the arw for the a9501 storm event by the ata method in addition to the abcs rhm method hourly basin average precipitation increases mainly during the two original largest peaks from 0 00h on january 9 1995 to 12 00h on january 10 1995 over the arw especially the first peak at 10 00h on january 9 1995 is significantly amplified by the ata method the increase in the two peaks of hourly basin average precipitation in turn increases the maximum 72 h basin average precipitation over the arw for the a9501 storm event fig 10 shows the precipitation fields within the inner model domain and the time averaged wind fields at the 500hpa pressure level during the 72 h period during which the maximum 72 h basin average precipitation occurs over the arw for each of the temperature rise cases for the a9501 storm event unlike the a9701a storm event precipitation is amplified only around the arw by the additional ata method as illustrated in fig 11 the additional ata method intensifies only the high moisture atmospheric flow toward the arw meanwhile the precipitation fields slightly but gradually shift toward southeast as air temperature increases on the boundaries of the model domain this shift in the precipitation field is caused by a small change in the wind direction with air temperature rise although this small change in the wind direction is difficult to detect in fig 10 in addition to the narrowness of the high moisture atmospheric flow this shift in the direction of the precipitation fields causes the changes in the maximum 72 h basin average precipitation for the a9501 storm event shown in fig 5 while all the peaks of hourly basin average precipitation for the a9701a storm event are amplified by the additional ata method fig 6 some small peaks for the a9501 storm event are not influenced by the additional ata method fig 9 for example the peak of the hourly precipitation depth on january 7 1995 is originally similar to the peak on january 14 1995 during the a9501 storm event however the peak on january 14 1995 is not amplified by the additional ata method while the peak on january 7 1995 is amplified fig 12 shows water vapor flux fields before the peak on january 7 1995 the water vapor flux of the high moisture atmospheric flow is amplified by the additional ata method and the flow is directed toward the arw meanwhile water vapor flux fields before the first peak on january 14 1995 are shown in fig 13 although the water vapor flux of the high moisture atmospheric flow before the first peak on january 14 1995 is also amplified by the additional ata method the high moisture atmospheric flow is not directed toward the arw but further north consequently the additional ata method magnifies the peak of the basin average precipitation on january 7 1995 but not the peaks on january 14 1995 these results indicate that wind direction of the storm system is an important factor in the amplification of the basin average precipitation by the additional ata method air temperature rise on the boundaries of the outer model domain almost monotonously increases the basin average precipitation over the arw as in fig 5 although the magnitude of increase in the basin average precipitation by the additional ata method may depend on the width of the atmospheric river s during a severe storm event this monotonous increase in the basin average precipitation with air temperature rise may imply the absence of an upper bound with respect to air temperature rise however 8 0 c in air temperature rise may already be too large to occur realistically although the numerical experiments in this section provide some insight into the relationship between severe precipitation and air temperature rise it will be unrealistic to raise the air temperature without considering its magnitude it would be more realistic to consider a specific magnitude in air temperature rise from a source such as a future climate change assessment study as investigated in the next section 5 2 mp estimation under changing climate the maximum 72 h basin average precipitation over the arw for the cases of ata0 0 abcs rhm ata1 36 and ata3 16 for the 61 selected storm events is shown in fig 14 the maximum 72 h basin average precipitation gradually increases for most of the storm events with the air temperature rise on the boundaries of the outer domain on average ata1 36 and ata3 16 in addition to the abcs rhm increase the maximum 72 h basin average precipitation by 9 0 and by 20 3 respectively the largest rates of increase by ata1 36 and ata 3 16 are 16 2 for the a7803 storm event and 40 9 for the a7311 storm event respectively for relatively small storm events the basin average precipitation is hardly amplified by the additional ata method although the maximum 72 h basin average precipitation has decreased by ata1 36 and ata3 16 only for the a6801 storm event on the other hand no clear correlation was found in the maximum 72 h basin average precipitation over the arw between ata0 0 abcs rhm and ata1 36 or ata3 16 additional temperature rises over abcs rhm while a monotonous increase with air temperature rise was found in the basin average precipitation for each storm event similar to the a9501 and the a9701a storm events the magnitude of increase in the basin average precipitation by the additional ata method is different among different storm events these results imply the complexity of atmospheric processes that cause precipitation over a targeted watershed consequently from the addition of ata to abcs rhm methods the a9501 storm event was found to be the storm event with the largest basin average precipitation depth for both of the cases ata1 36 and ata3 16 the mp estimates for this storm for the 72 h basin average precipitation over the arw by ata1 36 and ata3 16 are 846mm and 940mm respectively the historical largest value for the 72 h basin average precipitation and the mp estimate by the abcs rhm method ata0 0 were 423mm and 738mm respectively over the arw ishida et al 2015a 2015b the mp estimates by ata1 36 and ata3 16 are respectively 100 0 and 122 2 larger than the historical largest value and then respectively 14 6 and 27 3 larger than the mp estimate by the abcs rhm method ata0 0 the results of mp estimation by ata1 36 and ata3 16 are assumed to be the mp estimates for water years 2055 and 2099 respectively under changing climate in other words the results by ata1 36 and ata3 16 indicate that the mp estimate will increase respectively by 14 6 and 27 3 in the middle and at the end of the 21st century compared to the estimate under the historical climate conditions u s army corps of engineers 2005 provides a precipitation frequency curve for the 72 h basin average precipitation over the arw whereas the mp estimate under the historical conditions corresponds to precipitation with approximately 35 000 year return period the mp estimate for the end of the 21st century corresponds to precipitation with much more than 100 000years of return period although the magnitudes of air temperature rise taken in this study for the future conditions may be arguable it is highly likely that the ongoing global change in the climate may amplify the mp estimate over the arw in the future 6 summary and conclusions the air temperature adjustment ata method as an additional procedure to atmospheric boundary condition shifting abcs and relative humidity maximization rhm procedures was developed in this study for maximizing the basin average precipitation for a specified duration within this framework the impact of air temperature on the mp estimate through change in moisture holding capacity of air was investigated over the arw in northern california the united states as the target watershed for this investigation two types of numerical experiments were conducted by the ata method first the air temperature on the entire lateral boundaries of the outer model domain was gradually increased from 0 0 c to 8 0 c by 0 5 c increments for the a9701a and the a9501 storm events by the ata method in addition to the abcs rhm method in order to investigate the sensitivity of the maximum 72 h basin average precipitation over the arw to air temperature rise uniformly at the entire model lateral boundaries in this investigation a monotonous increase was found in the maximum 72 h basin average precipitation over the arw with air temperature rise uniformly at the model boundaries for both of the storm events secondly specific magnitudes of air temperature rise that represent future climate conditions during the 21st century were obtained from a climate change assessment study the air temperature was increased uniformly by these specific magnitudes on the model boundaries by the ata method in addition to the abcs rhm method to investigate the impact of air temperature on the mp estimate over the arw under changing climate the results in this second investigation indicate that future climate conditions may amplify the mp estimates that are based on historical conditions the mp estimate may increase over the arw by 14 6 in water year 2055 and by 27 3 in water year 2099 compared to the historical mp estimate the two types of numerical experiments that were performed in this study on the impact of air temperature on the mp estimate demonstrate the complexity of atmospheric systems that cause precipitation over a targeted watershed the increase in the magnitude of the basin average precipitation with air temperature rise uniformly on the model boundaries varies among hourly precipitation peaks within a storm event depending on the direction of high moisture atmospheric flow the magnitude of increase in the basin average precipitation also depends on each storm event although each storm event shows a monotonous increase in the basin average precipitation with air temperature rise air temperature is an important factor in the formation of severe precipitation the results in this study show a high sensitivity of the mp estimate to air temperature rise meanwhile the numerical simulation results of this study imply that the air temperature rise under saturated air moisture conditions may be able to increase precipitation with no upper bound as such the magnitude of air temperature rise would be a key issue for the mp estimation especially under future climate change conditions although in this study the magnitude of air temperature rise under future climate change conditions was obtained from a climate change assessment study the magnitude of temperature rise should be estimated based on careful investigations and discussions in order to keep the mp estimate realistic on the other hand besides the air temperature other atmospheric variables may also affect the precipitation depth although this study focused on the impact of air temperature in addition to abcs and rhm approaches on the mp estimation through change in moisture holding capacity of air physical mechanisms to cause severe precipitation are very complicated therefore it may be prudent to conduct the mp estimations within the framework of downscaled global circulation model future climate projections especially in order to account for the impacts of air temperature sea surface temperature and other variables on the initiation and evolution of high moisture atmospheric flows

of precipitation events during the non monsoon periods whereas the models with clustering without mwe over estimate the rainfall during the dry season keywords statistical downscaling wavelet analysis principal component analysis wavelet entropy precipitation krishna basin 1 introduction general circulation models gcm are mathematical models in the form of a set of linear and non linear partial differential equations for hydro climatic variables developed by considering the underlying physics involved in the land ocean and atmospheric processes gcms are regarded as the most reliable tools for simulation of global climate hundreds of years into the future considering various plausible scenarios of concentrations of atmospheric greenhouse gasses anandhi et al 2009 however gcm s do not incorporate sub grid features such as topography land surface process land use pattern and cloud physics hence do not represent the true picture of the regional climatic conditions carter et al 1994 wigley et al 1990 gcms might capture the large scale circulation patterns and the smoothly varying fields such as surface pressure but accurate reproduction of non smooth fields such as precipitation is unlikely ghosh and mujumdar 2006 hence several downscaling techniques have been developed addressing the mismatch between the coarse scale climate presented in gcm outputs and the catchment scale climate chen et al 2010 sachindra et al 2016 downscaling techniques can be broadly classified into two classes statistical and dynamic while dynamic downscaling is often criticized for being computationally expensive salvi and ghosh 2013 statistical downscaling is generally computationally less intensive and an ensemble of high resolution climate scenarios can be produced relatively easily statistical downscaling is a data driven approach where an empirical relationship between the coarse scale predictors from regional climate models gcms and the local climate aberrations is established using some form of regression with different choices of mathematical transfer function predictor variables or statistical fitting procedure owing to the low computational cost and easy application several machine learning approaches are popular in the field of climatic downscaling several machine learning and statistical approaches are popular in climatic downscaling literature like support vector machines svm anandhi et al 2008 2009 devak et al 2015 xu 2010 relevance vector machines rvm ghosh and mujumdar 2008 regression based statistical downscaling model sdsm etemadi et al 2014 samadi et al 2013 artificial neural networks ann chadwick et al 2011 fistikoglu and okkan 2010 kernel regression kannan and ghosh 2013 etc langousis and kaleris 2014 demonstrated the application of a stochastic downscaling approach to simulate rainfall occurrence and amount by conditioning on selected atmospheric predictors recently sachindra et al 2016 evaluated gene expression programming gep technique for downscaling gcm outputs to monthly average minimum temperature at melbourne australia a review of several popular approaches in climatic downscaling can be found in fowler et al 2007 despite their popularity some of the machine learning approaches like ann svm are criticized for their black box nature where the relationship between predictor and predictand and the underlying process remains generally unknown traditional ann models have a possibility of getting trapped in local minima svm have the drawback of a rapid increase of basis functions with the size of training data set and absence of probabilistic interpretation govindaraju 2005 trends and seasonal variations in the data can significantly affect modeling of climate variables and hence may causes poor predictability in practical applications wavelet transforms by analyzing the time series data in both time and frequency domains give considerable information about the physical structure of the data which is useful to analyze time series that contain power at many different frequencies daubechies 1990 with the capability to enable multi scale resolution and frequency localization in time wavelets offer the advantage of facilitating a decomposition of the given climatic variables into its various but scale specific dynamic components as surrogates of the corresponding physical processes at those scales rathinasamy and khosa 2012 extensive literature is available on wavelet based models for a diverse set of problems in hydrological modeling like monsoonal flood forecasting sehgal et al 2014b drought forecasting deo et al 2016 streamflow analysis adamowski 2008 coulibaly and burn 2004 kucuk and ağirali super 2006 rathinasamy and khosa 2012 flood forecasting nanda et al 2016 hydrologic regionalization agarwal et al 2016a b precipitation analysis kim 2004 lu 2002 partal and kişi 2007 etc recently wavelets have found application in climatic downscaling as well ebtehaj et al 2013 developed a wavelet based downscaling framework using the sparse nature of precipitation fields cai et al 2009 applied wavelets as a denoising tool in climatic downscaling from gcm rashid et al 2015 used wavelet coherence to identify predictor variables for hydro climatic variables and proposed a generalized additive model in location scale and shape gamlss for downscaling rainfall previously perica and foufoula georgiou 1996 used the concept of self similarity in rainfall for spatial downscaling variable selection and input preparation is an important step which precedes the model development and is crucial for an efficient downscaling model general approach for input selection is based on the correlation analysis devak and dhanya 2014 salvi and ghosh 2013 and apply principal component analysis pca to extract the important principal components pcs for model development however pca and related techniques assume that the input variables are drawn from a similar underlying distribution mcwilliams and montana 2012 whereas in many applications particularly dealing with atmospheric variables in which the underlying population is suspected to be highly heterogeneous each variable may have a different distribution and a single low dimensional representation of the data would not be sufficient in this paper a wavelet based multi resolution approach is proposed for downscaling precipitation from cancm4 gcm based climate variables with second order volterra sov framework this study contributes to the available literature on climatic downscaling by proposing a novel method for input preparation based on cluster wise pca or sub space pca applied to clusters having similar multi scale entropy signature we propose volterra models chou 2007 diskin and boneh 1973 müftüoğlu 1991 as an alternative to popular machine learning approaches for modeling climatic inputs volterra models provide a generic representation of the non linear natural systems addressing the issue of non linear behavior of the geo physical state variables and eliminating the subjectivity in the choice of model architecture in case of other machine learning approaches discrete wavelet transform dwt is employed to obtain the wavelet sub time series for the selected input variables which are modeled using the second order volterra sov model at each decomposition level this study discusses the common challenge related to the application of wavelet based multi resolution approach like selection of suitable wavelet for input decomposition and choice of level of decomposition using dwt especially when the input variables originate from different processes phase or geographic locations the proposed models are applied to five locations in krishna basin india downscaled precipitation is obtained for all five locations in future mode till december 2035 trend and uncertainty analysis has been carried out on the maximum and mean precipitation for monsoon months i e may june for 30years jan 2006 to dec 2035 considering the importance of monsoon on the hydrological cycle of the study region 2 case study and data set 2 1 description of river basin the proposed methodology is applied to krishna river basin of the indian peninsula the catchment spreads between 73 17 to 81 9 east longitudes and 13 10 to 19 22 north latitudes the krishna basin covers a total area of 2 58 948km2 the major portion 75 of the basin is agricultural land and 4 of the basin is covered by water bodies the climate of the drainage basin is dominated by the southwest monsoon which sets in the middle of june and withdraws by the middle of october is the major source of precipitation for the whole region during this period the basin receives about 80 of its total annual rainfall india wris 2015 the map of krishna basin is shown in fig 1 2 2 data description five locations are chosen in the basin for application of the downscaling methodology named station a station b station c station d and station e for convenience as shown in fig 1 and fig 2 a precipitation data provided by the india meteorological data imd for these stations is used for training and validating the downscaling models at a finer resolution the imd data is available at a spatial resolution of 0 25 0 25 and temporal resolution of one day table 1 provides the statistical properties for imd precipitation data for the training and validation periods for all five stations reanalysis data of the mean monthly atmospheric variables prepared jointly by national centre for environmental prediction and national centre for atmospheric research ncep ncar extracted for the period from january 1969 to december 1994 is used for training the models the spatial resolution of ncep data is 2 5 2 5 several gcm s are available through the fifth assessment report ar5 of intergovernmental panel on climate change ipcc cai et al 2009 provides an assessment of the performance of seventeen gcms regarding their simulation of temperature and precipitation based on hindcasts for the periods of 1961 1990 and 1931 1960 and provides the skill scores based on the rmse of the model simulation relative to the observation of temperature and precipitation respectively for each of the 17 gcms in this study cancm4 grid size 2 8 2 8 gcm model developed by canadian centre for climate modelling and analysis is chosen based on the skill score as described by cai et al 2009 also since the objective of this paper is to introduce and test the proposed downscaling framework for the study basin and not a comparative analysis of the skill of various gcms in providing precipitation simulations the study restricts it s the use of gcms to cancm4 models due to the discrepancy in the grid size of the gcm and ncep models the predictors of gcm are interpolated to the scale of the ncep data the new location of the gcm along with their location indices is shown in fig 2 b 11years of historic monthly gcm data from january 1995 to december 2005 is used for validating the models and 30years of gcm data from january 1996 to december 2034 is used for downscaling in the forecast mode downscaling models are developed for each station considering the four ncep interpolated gcm points encompassing the respective downscaling point therefore the total number of variables available for each downscaling point is 280 70 4 it is to be noted that since the imd precipitation data is available at the daily scale which is aggregated to monthly mean values to conform to the temporal resolution of ncep and gcm data out of various atmospheric land oceanic and ice variables available in the gcm atmospheric variables provided by the cancm4 models at 22 pressure levels are considered in this study a total of 70 variables at each grid point are considered in this study which are common to both cancm4 and ncep predictors at 17 different pressure levels 1000 925 850 700 600 500 400 300 250 200 150 100 70 50 30 20 10 in mb are considered which includes air temperature ta eastward wind ua northward wind va and geo potential height zg and others at surface levels include surface temperature ts sea level pressure psl the selection of these predictors is consistent with several other studies previously carried out for the indian sub continent anandhi et al 2008 devak and dhanya 2014 3 tools and techniques several mathematical tools and techniques like wavelet transform entropy k means clustering principal component analysis pca and second order volterra sov are employed in this study to develop the proposed downscaling models this section provides a brief introduction of these techniques 3 1 continuous wavelet transform and multi scale wavelet entropy mwe a wavelet transform involves convolving the signal time series against particular instances of a wavelet at various time scales and positions the wavelet function has zero mean and is localized in both time and frequency space continuous wavelet transform cwt is implemented to perform these convolutions at every position and scale mathematically cwt of a time series f t with respect to a mother wavelet φ t is defined as the sum over all time of the signal multiplied by the scaled and shifted version of the mother wavelet φ t 1 w a b 1 a f t φ t b a dt where wa b is cwt coefficient for scale a and location b of the function φ t the conjugate wavelet basis functions φ t b a dt are derived from a common mother wavelet function φ a b t by scaling or dilating it by a and translating it by b the squared wavelet coefficients are plotted for each scale to facilitate more comprehensive analysis of the data the plot of the amplitude squared spectrum w b a 2 is called wavelet power spectrum in this paper matlab toolbox developed by grinsted et al 2004 is used to obtain the wavelet power spectrum of the input variables this study uses the concept of multi scale wavelet entropy mwe proposed by agarwal et al 2016a b as a substitute to wavelet power spectrum to represent multiscale variations in a time series the complexity uncertainty of a given process at different time frequency scales is calculated using shannon entropy measure shannon 1948 which is defined as 2 s wt x i 1 n x i ln p x i where p x i is the probability density function pdf used to describe the behavior of variable x of length n the multiscale entropy at a given scale a can be mathematically defined as 3 s a x i 1 n p d a i ln p d a i where sa represents the entropy of the given process at the time scale a da represents the detail coefficients of the given process at scale a obtained using the wavelet transform the multi scale entropy s a x represents the distribution of the certainty of a given process at different scales higher values indicate more uncertainty and lower values indicate low level of uncertainty and high information content therefore high value of entropy represents high unpredictability and hence highly complicated and disordered system for detailed information and illustrations on the application of wavelet entropy readers are referred to agarwal et al 2015 3 2 discrete wavelet transform determining wavelet coefficients of a time series at every possible scale is a redundant task normally dwt uses dyadic scheme of wavelet decomposition where alternate scale and position is adopted for calculating transform coefficients thereby reducing the computation burden discrete wavelet transform dwt enables to achieve the time frequency localization and multi scale resolution of a signal by suitably focusing and zooming around the neighborhood of one s choice mallat 1999 the process consists of a number of successive filtering steps in which the time series is decomposed into approximation a and detail sub time series or wavelet components d1 d2 d3 etc approximation component represents the slowly changing coarse features of a time series and are obtained by correlating stretched version low frequency and high scale of a wavelet with the original time series while detail components signify rapidly changing features of the time series and are obtained by correlating compressed wavelet high frequency and low scale with the original time series sehgal et al 2014a a detailed mathematical expression for the filtering scheme can be found in nourani et al 2009 3 3 k means clustering k means is one of the most popular clustering algorithms in literature the variables are classified into k clusters each of which is represented by its centroid which is the mean weighted or otherwise of feature vectors within the cluster if n k represent the number of feature vector in cluster k x is the set of data points and c k is the mean of cluster k then centroid of each cluster is defined as 4 c k 1 n k p 1 n k x p the algorithm starts with predefined initial number of cluster k chosen according to user defined criteria or heuristic procedure the process follows an iterative scheme to assign the data point to its nearest cluster centre according to euclidian distance measure between the two and then cluster centre is re calculated maimon and rokach 2005 convergence of algorithm occurs as per defined criteria or when partitioning is reduced to the maximum extent or on re allocating cluster centroid indicating that solution is locally optimal more detailed information about k means clustering can be obtained from ball and hall 1967 kanungo et al 2002 macqueen 1967 3 4 second order volterra sov model sov models are a class of non linear regression models the input variables are non linearity regressed with the output variables to estimate the regression coefficients if y t denotes the output predictand time series u 1 u 2 u 3 ul denote the l input n is the length of the time series m denotes the memory of each input variable up to which there is a significant lag relationship with the input time series and ξ t represents the model noise including modeling errors and the unobservable disturbances the 2nd order miso volterra model maheswaran and khosa 2012c is given by eq 5 5 y t n 1 l τ 1 m h 1 n τ u n t τ n 1 l τ 1 1

the nth input un and y the second order self kernels h 2 s n describe the 2nd order non linear relation between the nth input un and y respectively and the second order cross kernels h 2 x n 1 n 2 describe the 2nd order non linear interactions between each unique pair of inputs un 1 and un 2 as they affect y eq 5 can be simplified by combining the last two terms to yield eq 6 and it now remains to estimate kernels h 1 and h 2 6 y t n 1 l τ 1 m h 1 n τ u n t τ n 1 1 l n 2 1 l τ 1 1 m τ 2 1 m h 2 n 1 n 2 τ 1 τ 2 u n 1 t τ 1 u n 2 t τ 2 ξ t the representation of eq 6 can be further simplified by considering each of the lagged variables u 1 t 1 u 1 t τ u 2 t 1 u 2 t τ as separate variables d 1 t d 2 t d 3 t dnl t then eq 6 can be written as 7 y t l 1 n l h 1 l d l t l 1 1 n l l 2 1 n l h 2

miso volterra and mathematical derivation of the wavelet volterra coupled model the readers are referred to maheswaran and khosa 2012b 2012c 4 model development fig 3 shows the schematic for the proposed modeling methodology separate models are developed for each downscaling location assuming that the processes at each station are independent of any influence of the other this section provides a detailed description of each step in the model development step 1 standardization selected predictors from the ncep and gcm models are standardized to zero mean and unit standard deviation prior to statistical downscaling to reduce any systematic biases in the mean and variances of gcm and ncep ncar data relative to the observations wilby et al 1998 2004 standardization reduces the possibility of model instability owning to different order of magnitudes of the predictor variables scales down the predictor data to a single uniform scale and removes the units of the variables sachindra et al 2013 standardized data is obtained by first subtracting the mean and then dividing by standard deviation of the predictor variable for a predefined baseline period for both ncep ncar and gcm output step 2 variable averaging it is observed that for a given time the values of each ncep and interpolated gcm variable at all 4 vertices of an ncep grid enclosing the downscaling point are numerically similar to each other hence the values of each climatic variable across the vertices of the ncep grid are averaged out to obtain a single value across the grid at each pressure level fig 4 provides values of ta at 10mb pressure level ta10 at the vertices of the ncep grid surrounding point a it can be observed from fig 4 that the values and the variations in ta10 at ncep vertices numbered 1 ta10 1 2 ta10 2 5 ta10 5 6 ta10 6 are close to each other and the average of these variables ta10 a explains most of the variance in these variables refer to fig 2 b for locating these vertices on the basin hence justifying variable averaging for the purpose of variable reduction fig 5 provides schematic for the proposed variable averaging scheme step 3 input preparation using k means and pca a standard approach for input preparation for downscaling is to apply pca to the given set of candidate input variables and extract pcs which are orthogonal and preserve most of the variance originally present in the variables however applying such an operation for a large set of variables actually increases level of complexity slow to converge in this study we apply pca on the clusters of input variables which share similar behavior based on mwe this would actually help in preserving the information across different variables and also reduce the complexity in using pca for all the input variables at a time further it is possible to identify the significant variables influencing the predictand precipitation in this case as an initial step cwt is applied to each input variable obtained after step 1 and 2 using morlet wavelet to obtain wavelet coefficients at 7 time frequency dyadic scales covering information up to 128 months period these wavelet coefficients are then used to estimate mwe of the variable at each scale thus providing a distinct multi scale entropy signature for each input variable in the second step the estimated mwe of input variables is used as a signature to cluster ncep gcm variables into homogeneous groups using k means methodology selection of the optimum number of clusters is an important task while dealing with k means clustering two validity indices namely davies bouldin db index and dunn s index are used to identify the best number of clusters for the input data please refer to appendix a a b for more details on the db index and dunn s index selection of the number of clusters is carried out by segregating the data into 5 15 clusters and evaluating the corresponding clusters for a low db and high dunn s index value fig 6 provides the value of db and dunn s indices corresponding to each number of clusters 5 15 for all five stations based on this analysis 12 10 11 9 and 10 numbers of clusters are found to be suitable for stations a b c d and e respectively fig 7 provides a cluster wise classification of the available variables after step 1 and 2 for example it can be seen that for station a the entire set of 70 input variables are partitioned into 12 clusters each represented by a unique color it is to be noted that even though the overall pattern of clustering is similar for all five stations there are subtle differences in each other pertaining to the local geographical factors pca is then used on each cluster to obtain the pcs explaining 90 95 of the variance of the cluster for the training dataset we call this as cluster wise pca to differentiate it from the general connotation of pca of the input variable directly the coefficients of the pcs for training period saved as a static component of the modeling framework and are used to obtain pcs for validation and forecast period the above steps can be categorized as data preparatory steps these cluster wise principal components is taken as model inputs to ann and mlr models used for comparison purposes as these are very popular and it is shown in literature that these model generally outperform the sdsm based downscaling campozano et al 2016 liu et al 2008 these models can be denoted as p ann and p mlr models a detailed schematic describing data preparation for models is provided in fig 8 however using the coefficients from the training period to obtain pcs for the validation and forecast period may distort the pcs in validation by making them markedly correlated which violates the near zero correlation property of pcs theoretically the pcs should display zero or near zero correlation with each other sachindra et al 2013 2014 to validate the assumption of near zero correlation between the pcs of the training validation and gcm vectors for the future dataset the correlation matrix for the three dataset is evaluated for all five stations it is observed that pcs in general displayed a very low inter correlation for the dataset for the three time periods for all five stations although a few variables had a noticeable correlation with each other it does not alter the model performance due to the ols err architecture of the sov models in place fig 9 provides the correlation matrix for the input pcs for training validation and forecast period for station b step 4 multi resolution w p sov and w p mlr models the input variables obtained from step 1 3 above and the observed precipitation are transformed into respective wavelet sub time series for three dyadic resolution levels using dwt the wavelet sub time series obtained for each resolution level for the observed precipitation and the inputs from step 3 are modeled using sov and mlr to simulate downscaled precipitation at the corresponding scale the final downscaled value of precipitation is reconstructed from the outputs of these models by linear summation of each output sub time series fig 11 shows the non linear kernels for d2 component of the station b similarly kernels are estimated for all sub scale levels and for all five stations not shown here for brevity table 2 shows the number of significant ols err regressors present in the final model for different stations at three sub scale levels the number of significant regressors in the non linear domain signifies the level of non linearity in the underlying relationship between the predictand and predicator variables it can be observed that the relationship at level d1 2 months scale seems to be highly non linear compared to the relationship at the higher levels d2 d3 and a3 in case of the w p mlr model only a linear relationship is considered between the predictand and the predictor variables at different scales p ann and p mlr model pcs against observed data using ann mlr models are developed for the purpose of comparison which utilize the pcs from all clusters as the input to the models an important aspect of wavelet based models is the selection of level of decomposition and suitable mother wavelet in this study we have followed the guidelines given by maheswaran and khosa 2012a and sehgal et al 2014b however we also provide further insight for this study in the supplement material for this paper the models are developed and coded in the matlab r2014b in order to facilitate application of the proposed approach to diverse dataset by a wider audience a matlab toolkit based on the proposed approach is developed and is available through the website of the team https sites google com site climaticdownscalingtool home step 5 uncertainty assessment of the downscaling models major sources of uncertainty in a statistical downscaling exercise can be broadly classified into data and model uncertainty data uncertainty can be an artifact of the choice of the gcm chosen as an input for the downscaling model several studies have been conducted comparing the performance of one gcm over another model uncertainty can be attributed to insufficient training or sub optimal model structure etc estimating uncertainty in the downscaled precipitation for future is necessary considering numerous local factors which are not accommodated in the gcm outputs or can be captured accurately due to the limitations of the modeling methodology a bootstrap based resampling approach is used in this study khan et al 2006 samadi et al 2013 to account for the factor of uncertainty 200 resamples of the training data is obtained and 80 data from each resample is used to obtain the downscaling model parameters for each downscaling station for each resample of training input dataset a w p sov model is developed and trained using 80 of total resampled data each of which is applied to the validation and gcm dataset in the future a schematic of the bootstrap approach used in this study is shown in fig 10 more information about bootstrapping is included in appendix a 5 performance indices the model results are compared using some of the common performance indices such as normalized root mean square error nrmse coefficient of correlation cc willmott s index d willmott et al 2012 2015 and accuracy index nrmse is root mean square error rmse normalized to a scale 0 1 whereas nmae is mean absolute error mae normalized to a scale 0 1 the normalization of rmse and mae is done to facilitate easy comparison of model performances across stations and models rmse mae and cc are defined as follows 8 rmse 1 n i 1 n oi pi 2 9 mae 1 n i 1 n oi pi 10 cc i 0 n oi o pi p i 0 n oi o 2 i 0 n pi p 2 11 d i 0 n oi o pi p i 0 n oi o 2 i 0 n pi p 2 where oi and pi are the observed and estimated precipitation and n is the number of data points in the series accuracy index of the model is defined as percentage of estimated data points in the validation period falling within discrepancy ratio dr range of 1 1 where dr is defined as log of the fraction of estimated and observed precipitation 12 dr log pi oi it follows that dr 0 suggests exact matching between estimated and measured values otherwise there is either over estimation oi pi or under estimation oi pi in this study the estimation of monthly precipitation is deemed precise if the estimated value fall within 10 deviation from the observed value dr between 1 and 1 6 model results table 3 summarizes the performance of all the models based on selected performance indices as observed from table 3 w p sov and w p mlr models outperform p ann and p mlr models for all five stations for station a w p sov and w p mlr models provide cc of 0 723 and 0 716 nrmse of 0 177 and 0 178 nmae of 0 105 and 0 121 d of 0 669 and 0 543 and accuracy index of 76 52 and 68 94 respectively compared to cc of 0 682 and 0 672 nrmse of 0 182 and 0 188 nmae of 0 130 and 0 135 d of 0 595 and 0 525 and accuracy index of 65 91 and 63 64 using p ann and p mlr models respectively similar trend is observed for station b where w p sov models showed improvement over w p mlr p ann and p mlr models similarly improvement in nrmse nmae d and accuracy index w r t w p mlr p ann and p mlr is 2 1 12 8 and 12 8 4 1 24 5 25 3 6 2 14 5 and 17 4 and 8 3 9 6 and 9 6 respectively a similar behavior is observed for stations c and station e with w p sov and w p mlr performing considerably better than p ann and p mlr models for station d the performance of p ann models is observed to be close to that of w p mlr model both the models provide a cc of 0 715 and an accuracy index of 74 24 however in terms of nrmse and nmae statistics w p mlr provides a better downscaled estimate with nrmse of 0 154 and nmae of 0 234 compared to nrmse of 0 168 and nmae of 0 276 using p ann models fig 12 provides comparison of different models under study based on dr statistics the x axis of the plots provides the dr bracket and the y axis provides the percentage of total validation data points falling into the dr bracket the dotted vertical lines highlight the accuracy band and the total percentage of data points falling into the region demarcated by the dotted lines is termed as accuracy index of the model it is evident from the plots that w p sov models have an advantage over other models in general the multi resolution based models displayed less bias and improved overall accuracy for all five stations the hydrology of the basin is driven by the south west monsoon hence accurate estimation of the monsoonal precipitation is important for any downscaling approach in this region fig 13 shows the box plots for observed v s simulated precipitation for the monsoonal months may to october of the validation period it is observed that in general wavelet based models are able to capture the mean and extremes of the monsoonal precipitation better than p ann and p mlr models 6 1 downscaled precipitation for future having validated the performance of the proposed approach it is used for downscaling the future climatic estimates from the gcm the downscaled simulations till 2035 are obtained for all stations by applying the proposed w p sov models to the cancm4 gcm outputs estimates of the key statistical parameters for the downscaled precipitation datasets namely maximum annual mean annual skewness and 10th 25th 50th 75th 90th percentiles for three temporal lengths i e jan 2006 to dec 2015 jan 2016 to dec 2025 jan 2026 to dec 2035 are provided in table 4 since monsoon drives the hydrological cycle in the basin it is imperative to analyze trends of monsoonal rainfall for the future period maximum and mean precipitation for the monsoonal period may october for years 2006 2035 is provided in fig 14 bootstrap resampling approach previously explained is used to calculate the variance σ2 in estimating the descriptive statistics provided in table 4 and to generate the confidence interval ci at the 95 significance level for estimating the maximum and mean value of monsoonal precipitation as in fig 14 the mann kendall test is used to identify any monotonic upward or downward trend in the maximum and mean precipitation for the monsoonal period over time the mann kendall test is a non parametric statistical test with a null hypothesis of no monotonic trend the p value for the test at α 0 05 and the interpretation of the test for each station is provided in table 5 from fig 14 and table 5 it can be observed that the trend in maximum monsoonal precipitation for the year 2006 2035 doesn t follow a uniform pattern across stations station a shows a monotonically decreasing trend whereas station d shows an increasing trend no significant monotonic trend is observed for station b c and e mean monsoonal precipitation doesn t show statistically significant monotonic pattern for any station 7 discussion the results obtained from different models show that the wavelet based models have a clear advantage over the single scale models both wavelet based models w p sov and w p mlr outperform stand alone models like p ann and p mlr application of wavelet analysis facilitates a multi resolution modeling approach to model the input variables separate models are developed at each scale of the precipitation time series hence the models are sensitive to both long and transient trends in the input variables providing an edge over the stand alone models this is because the scale wise decomposition separates the features variability at different scales making it easier to capture the underlying relationship moreover the sov models have an advantage over mlr based models as it addresses to the non linearity in the process short and transient processes which are mostly accounted by the d1 component of a time series are difficult to model using linear models due to the inherent complexity of the process hence a non linear model captures variations in these components more accurately it is observed from table 2 that d1 component accounted for most number of non linear variables in the model across all stations a closer look at the results reveals that the performance of the downscaling models varies with the target location for station a and station b the performance of wavelet based models is significantly better compared to other models for station c d and e the increment in the performance of models using wavelet based approach is relatively small for station d the p ann model is comparable to that of w p mlr models it is to be noted that the performance of the downscaling models is significantly influenced by micro climatic local factors in this case study station b is located at the windward side of the western ghats and experience heavy rainfall in contrary to other stations which lie in arid semi arid regions of southern indian peninsula modeling rainfall pattern for arid and semi arid regions is comparatively difficult due to complex rainfall patterns in order to highlight the advantage of using a cluster wise pca over direct pca of all the variables separate models are run and the results are estimated for station b table 6 shows the results obtained from models with and without performing cluster wise pca from the analysis of the results it is noted that the cluster wise pca improves the results over simple pca method for input variable preparation intuitively the clustering of similar variables helps to reduce the dimensionality of the problem and thereby the principal components captured more variability in the inputs it can be seen that compared to pca ann no clustering and pca w sov no clustering the corresponding cluster wise pca based models perform better for example simple pca with ann model produced estimates that had a cc of 0 779 however the corresponding model with clustering gave results with a cc of 0 842 further fig 15 shows the plot of the results in terms of number of rainfall events captured by the model obtained from two w p sov models for station b which differ in the clustering methodology while one model employs mwe based k means another model uses stand alone k means for variable clustering prior to the application of pca no mwe it can be seen that the model with cluster wise pca on mwe based k means clusters is able to perform better in estimating the number of precipitation events during the non monsoon periods than the model with clustering without mwe which false alarms and hence over estimates the rainfall during the dry season these observations are in line with the findings of agarwal et al 2016a b which show that the multi scale wavelet entropy is capable of picking up the underlying variability in the signal at different scales and hence can used for effectively clustering process having similar patterns comparing the results of other clustering methods other than k means and other basis other than wavelet entropy for clustering is beyond the scope of the present work 7 1 advantages and limitations of the proposed approach the wavelet based approach provides a better understanding of the underlying processes at several time frequency resolutions thus providing improved estimates of the downscaled precipitation the proposed methodology can be conveniently applied to a wider grid wise downscaling and applied to a wider geographical region sov based models enable a deterministic parameter estimation the proposed w p sov approach provides a better estimation of the observed precipitation compared to w p mlr p ann and p mlr for all five stations thus establishing the robustness of the approach it is to be noted that direct identification of the key drivers of the underlying process cannot be carried out using this approach as the models are built on the dwcs of the principal components of each cluster of ncep gcm variables rather than the individual variables themselves the exclusivity of individual ncep gcm variables is lost in the attempt to reduce model complexity using variable reduction technique however a sensitivity analysis can be carried out by omitting including each cluster and evaluating the performance of the model after omitting including the cluster this exercise will be helpful in identifying the clusters for which the models are most least sensitive the proposed models use only one wavelet function for a given station which is selected based on the comparative performance evaluation with models using different wavelet functions for dwt on a large scale analysis involving a multitude of downscaling locations a more general approach may be better suited where any prior information of the suitability of a given wavelet function is not available the authors suggest an ensemble of models using a variety of wavelets in order to equip the models to capture the processes of a given location these models will be the focus of future research 8 conclusion this paper evaluates a wavelet based multi resolution modeling approach for downscaling gcm variables to mean monthly precipitation for krishna basin india the application of the proposed approach is demonstrated for five locations across the basin with significantly different climatology and rainfall patterns a cluster wise pca technique using mwe for preparation of the inputs is proposed for the downscaling models the performance of the proposed w p sov models is compared with those of ann mlr based models further to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed cluster wise pca based on mwe in capturing the variability in precipitation comparison is made with the models with stand alone pca no mwe based clustering prior to pca primary findings of this study are summarized below 1 wavelet based multi resolution models w p sov and w p mlr outperform p ann and p mlr models which use stand alone ann mlr for modeling the input dataset among w p sov and w p mlr the former provides better downscaling performance due to the ability of sov models to capture higher order and non linear dynamics of the system 2 cluster wise pca improves the results over simple pca method for input variable preparation by reducing the dimensionality of the input variables this enables the principal components to capture more variability in the inputs compared to the direct pca the models based on cluster wise pca approach perform better in terms of rmse and accuracy index 3 the downscaled mean monthly precipitation for the five locations with their descriptive statistics with an estimate of variance using a bootstrap approach is evaluated trend analysis on the downscaled precipitation reveals that while one station has statistically significant increasing trend eastern side of the basin another station has the opposite trend north west side basin in maximum monsoonal precipitation over the years 2004 2035 other stations do not show any significant increasing or decreasing trend none of the stations have a statistically significant trend in mean precipitation for monsoonal months for the period 2006 2035 4 overall it can be concluded that wavelet analysis can be used as a useful tool in climatic downscaling the study proposes a location specific performance evaluation of different wavelets in capturing the overall variability in the selected input variables and a wavelet spectrum based method in understanding the dominant periods in the dataset in order to assess the suitable level of decomposition for the input variables it is to be noted that while the application of the proposed methodology is demonstrated at a monthly time step the approach can be effectively used for dataset with a finer weekly daily or sub daily or a coarser annual temporal resolution with varying degree of accuracy certainly the application of the proposed methodology to case studies from different regions across the globe with different geographic climatic and hydrologic characteristics and dataset of various temporal resolutions would validate and strengthen the conclusions drawn in this paper acknowledgement this research is funded

7604,this study proposes a wavelet based multi resolution modeling approach for statistical downscaling of gcm variables to mean monthly precipitation for five locations at krishna basin india climatic dataset from ncep is used for training the proposed models jan 69 to dec 94 and are applied to corresponding cancm4 gcm variables to simulate precipitation for the validation jan 95 dec 05 and forecast jan 06 dec 35 periods the observed precipitation data is obtained from the india meteorological department imd gridded precipitation product at 0 25 degree spatial resolution this paper proposes a novel multi scale wavelet entropy mwe based approach for clustering climatic variables into suitable clusters using k means methodology principal component analysis pca is used to obtain the representative principal components pc explaining 90 95 variance for each cluster a multi resolution non linear approach combining discrete wavelet transform dwt and second order volterra sov is used to model the representative pcs to obtain the downscaled precipitation for each downscaling location w p sov model the results establish that wavelet based multi resolution sov models perform significantly better compared to the traditional multiple linear regression mlr and artificial neural networks ann based frameworks it is observed that the proposed mwe based clustering and subsequent pca helps reduce the dimensionality of the input climatic variables while capturing more variability compared to stand alone k means no mwe the proposed models perform better in estimating the number of precipitation events during the non monsoon periods whereas the models with clustering without mwe over estimate the rainfall during the dry season keywords statistical downscaling wavelet analysis principal component analysis wavelet entropy precipitation krishna basin 1 introduction general circulation models gcm are mathematical models in the form of a set of linear and non linear partial differential equations for hydro climatic variables developed by considering the underlying physics involved in the land ocean and atmospheric processes gcms are regarded as the most reliable tools for simulation of global climate hundreds of years into the future considering various plausible scenarios of concentrations of atmospheric greenhouse gasses anandhi et al 2009 however gcm s do not incorporate sub grid features such as topography land surface process land use pattern and cloud physics hence do not represent the true picture of the regional climatic conditions carter et al 1994 wigley et al 1990 gcms might capture the large scale circulation patterns and the smoothly varying fields such as surface pressure but accurate reproduction of non smooth fields such as precipitation is unlikely ghosh and mujumdar 2006 hence several downscaling techniques have been developed addressing the mismatch between the coarse scale climate presented in gcm outputs and the catchment scale climate chen et al 2010 sachindra et al 2016 downscaling techniques can be broadly classified into two classes statistical and dynamic while dynamic downscaling is often criticized for being computationally expensive salvi and ghosh 2013 statistical downscaling is generally computationally less intensive and an ensemble of high resolution climate scenarios can be produced relatively easily statistical downscaling is a data driven approach where an empirical relationship between the coarse scale predictors from regional climate models gcms and the local climate aberrations is established using some form of regression with different choices of mathematical transfer function predictor variables or statistical fitting procedure owing to the low computational cost and easy application several machine learning approaches are popular in the field of climatic downscaling several machine learning and statistical approaches are popular in climatic downscaling literature like support vector machines svm anandhi et al 2008 2009 devak et al 2015 xu 2010 relevance vector machines rvm ghosh and mujumdar 2008 regression based statistical downscaling model sdsm etemadi et al 2014 samadi et al 2013 artificial neural networks ann chadwick et al 2011 fistikoglu and okkan 2010 kernel regression kannan and ghosh 2013 etc langousis and kaleris 2014 demonstrated the application of a stochastic downscaling approach to simulate rainfall occurrence and amount by conditioning on selected atmospheric predictors recently sachindra et al 2016 evaluated gene expression programming gep technique for downscaling gcm outputs to monthly average minimum temperature at melbourne australia a review of several popular approaches in climatic downscaling can be found in fowler et al 2007 despite their popularity some of the machine learning approaches like ann svm are criticized for their black box nature where the relationship between predictor and predictand and the underlying process remains generally unknown traditional ann models have a possibility of getting trapped in local minima svm have the drawback of a rapid increase of basis functions with the size of training data set and absence of probabilistic interpretation govindaraju 2005 trends and seasonal variations in the data can significantly affect modeling of climate variables and hence may causes poor predictability in practical applications wavelet transforms by analyzing the time series data in both time and frequency domains give considerable information about the physical structure of the data which is useful to analyze time series that contain power at many different frequencies daubechies 1990 with the capability to enable multi scale resolution and frequency localization in time wavelets offer the advantage of facilitating a decomposition of the given climatic variables into its various but scale specific dynamic components as surrogates of the corresponding physical processes at those scales rathinasamy and khosa 2012 extensive literature is available on wavelet based models for a diverse set of problems in hydrological modeling like monsoonal flood forecasting sehgal et al

hydrologic regionalization agarwal et al 2016a b precipitation analysis kim 2004 lu 2002 partal and kişi 2007 etc recently wavelets have found application in climatic downscaling as well ebtehaj et al 2013 developed a wavelet based downscaling framework using the sparse nature of precipitation fields cai et al 2009 applied wavelets as a denoising tool in climatic downscaling from gcm rashid et al 2015 used wavelet coherence to identify predictor variables for hydro climatic variables and proposed a generalized additive model in location scale and shape gamlss for downscaling rainfall previously perica and foufoula georgiou 1996 used the concept of self similarity in rainfall for spatial downscaling variable selection and input preparation is an important step which precedes the model development and is crucial for an efficient downscaling model general approach for input selection is based on the correlation analysis devak and dhanya 2014 salvi and ghosh 2013 and apply principal component analysis pca to extract the important principal components pcs for model development however pca and related techniques assume that the input variables are drawn from a similar underlying distribution mcwilliams and montana 2012 whereas in many applications particularly dealing with atmospheric variables in which the underlying population is suspected to be highly heterogeneous each variable may have a different distribution and a single low dimensional representation of the data would not be sufficient in this paper a wavelet based multi resolution approach is proposed for downscaling precipitation from cancm4 gcm based climate variables with second order volterra sov framework this study contributes to the available literature on climatic downscaling by proposing a novel method for input preparation based on cluster wise pca or sub space pca applied to clusters having similar multi scale entropy signature we propose volterra models chou 2007 diskin and boneh 1973 müftüoğlu 1991 as an alternative to popular machine learning approaches for modeling climatic inputs volterra models provide a generic representation of the non linear natural systems addressing the issue of non linear behavior of the geo physical state variables and eliminating the subjectivity in the choice of model architecture in case of other machine learning approaches discrete wavelet transform dwt is employed to obtain the wavelet sub time series for the selected input variables which are modeled using the second order volterra sov model at each decomposition level this study discusses the common challenge related to the application of wavelet based multi resolution approach like selection of suitable wavelet for input decomposition and choice of level of decomposition using dwt especially when the input variables originate from different processes phase or geographic locations the proposed models are applied to five locations in krishna basin india downscaled precipitation is obtained for all five locations in future mode till december 2035 trend and uncertainty analysis has been carried out on the maximum and mean precipitation for monsoon months i e may june for 30years jan 2006 to dec 2035 considering the importance of monsoon on the hydrological cycle of the study region 2 case study and data set 2 1 description of river basin the proposed methodology is applied to krishna river basin of the indian peninsula the catchment spreads between 73 17 to 81 9 east longitudes and 13 10 to 19 22 north latitudes the krishna basin covers a total area of 2 58 948km2 the major portion 75 of the basin is agricultural land and 4 of the basin is covered by water bodies the climate of the drainage basin is dominated by the southwest monsoon which sets in the middle of june and withdraws by the middle of october is the major source of precipitation for the whole region during this period the basin receives about 80 of its total annual rainfall india wris 2015 the map of krishna basin is shown in fig 1 2 2 data description five locations are chosen in the basin for application of the downscaling methodology named station a station b station c station d and station e for convenience as shown in fig 1 and fig 2 a precipitation data provided by the india meteorological data imd for these stations is used for training and validating the downscaling models at a finer resolution the imd data is available at a spatial resolution of 0 25 0 25 and temporal resolution of one day table 1 provides the statistical properties for imd precipitation data for the training and validation periods for all five stations reanalysis data of the mean monthly atmospheric variables prepared jointly by national centre for environmental prediction and national centre for atmospheric research ncep ncar extracted for the period from january 1969 to december 1994 is used for training the models the spatial resolution of ncep data is 2 5 2 5 several gcm s are available through the fifth assessment report ar5 of intergovernmental panel on climate change ipcc cai et al 2009 provides an assessment of the performance of seventeen gcms regarding their simulation of temperature and precipitation based on hindcasts for the periods of 1961 1990 and 1931 1960 and provides the skill scores based on the rmse of the model simulation relative to the observation of temperature and precipitation respectively for each of the 17 gcms in this study cancm4 grid size 2 8 2 8 gcm model developed by canadian centre for climate modelling and analysis is chosen based on the skill score as described by cai et al 2009 also since the objective of this paper is to introduce and test the proposed downscaling framework for the study basin and not a comparative analysis of the skill of various gcms in providing precipitation simulations the study restricts it s the use of gcms to cancm4 models due to the discrepancy in the grid size of the gcm and ncep models the predictors of gcm are interpolated to the scale of the ncep data the new location of the gcm along with their location indices is shown in fig 2 b 11years of historic monthly gcm data from january 1995 to december 2005 is used for validating the models and 30years of gcm data from january 1996 to december 2034 is used for downscaling in the forecast mode downscaling models are developed for each station considering the four ncep interpolated gcm points encompassing the respective downscaling point therefore the total number of variables available for each downscaling point is 280 70 4 it is to be noted that since the imd precipitation data is available at the daily scale which is aggregated to monthly mean values to conform to the temporal resolution of ncep and gcm data out of various atmospheric land oceanic and ice variables available in the gcm atmospheric variables provided by the cancm4 models at 22 pressure levels are considered in this study a total of 70 variables at each grid point are considered in this study which are common to both cancm4 and ncep predictors at 17 different pressure levels 1000 925 850 700 600 500 400 300 250 200 150 100 70 50 30 20 10 in mb are considered which includes air temperature ta eastward wind ua northward wind va and geo potential height zg and others at surface levels include surface temperature ts sea level pressure psl the selection of these predictors is consistent with several other studies previously carried out for the indian sub continent anandhi et al 2008 devak and dhanya 2014 3 tools and techniques several mathematical tools and techniques like wavelet transform entropy k means clustering principal component analysis pca and second order volterra sov are employed in this study to develop the proposed downscaling models this section provides a brief introduction of these techniques 3 1 continuous wavelet transform and multi scale wavelet entropy mwe a wavelet transform involves convolving the signal time series against particular instances of a wavelet at various time scales and positions the wavelet function has zero mean and is localized in both time and frequency space continuous wavelet transform cwt is implemented to perform these convolutions at every position and scale mathematically cwt of a time series f t with respect to a mother wavelet φ t is defined as the sum over all time of the signal multiplied by the scaled and shifted version of the mother wavelet φ t 1 w a b 1 a f t φ t b a dt where wa b is cwt coefficient for scale a and location b of the function φ t the conjugate wavelet basis functions φ t b a dt are derived from a common mother wavelet function φ a b t by scaling or dilating it by a and translating it by b the squared wavelet coefficients are plotted for each scale to facilitate more comprehensive analysis of the data the plot of the amplitude squared spectrum w b a 2 is called wavelet power spectrum in this paper matlab toolbox developed by grinsted et al 2004 is used to obtain the wavelet power spectrum of the input variables this study uses the concept of multi scale wavelet entropy mwe proposed by agarwal et al 2016a b as a substitute to wavelet power spectrum to represent multiscale variations in a time series the complexity uncertainty of a given process at different time frequency scales is calculated using shannon entropy measure shannon 1948 which is defined as 2 s wt x i 1 n x i ln p x i where p x i is the probability density function pdf used to describe the behavior of variable x of length n the multiscale entropy at a given scale a can be mathematically defined as 3 s a x i 1 n p d a i ln p d a i where sa represents the entropy of the given process at the time scale a da represents the detail coefficients of the given process at scale a obtained using the wavelet transform the multi scale entropy s a x represents the distribution of the certainty of a given process at different scales higher values indicate more uncertainty and lower values indicate low level of uncertainty and high information content therefore high value of entropy represents high unpredictability and hence highly complicated and disordered system for detailed information and illustrations on the application of wavelet entropy readers are referred to agarwal et al 2015 3 2 discrete wavelet transform determining wavelet coefficients of a time series at every possible scale is a redundant task normally dwt uses dyadic scheme of wavelet decomposition where alternate scale and position is adopted for calculating transform coefficients thereby reducing the computation burden discrete wavelet transform dwt enables to achieve the time frequency localization and multi scale resolution of a signal by suitably focusing and zooming around the neighborhood of one s choice mallat 1999 the process consists of a number of successive filtering steps in which the time series is decomposed into approximation a and detail sub time series or wavelet components d1 d2 d3 etc approximation component represents the slowly changing coarse features of a time series and are obtained by correlating stretched version low frequency and high scale of a wavelet with the original time series while detail components signify rapidly changing features of the time series and are obtained by correlating compressed wavelet high frequency and low scale with the original time series sehgal et al 2014a a detailed mathematical expression for the filtering scheme can be found in nourani et al 2009 3 3 k means clustering k means is one of the most popular clustering algorithms in literature the variables are classified into k clusters each of which is represented by its centroid which is the mean weighted or otherwise of feature vectors within the cluster if n k represent the number of feature vector in cluster k x is the set of data points and c k is the mean of cluster k then centroid of each cluster is defined as 4 c k 1 n k p 1 n k x p the algorithm starts with predefined initial number of cluster k chosen according to user defined criteria or heuristic procedure the process follows an iterative scheme to assign the data point to its nearest cluster centre according to euclidian distance measure between the two and then cluster centre is re calculated maimon and rokach 2005 convergence of algorithm occurs as per defined criteria or when partitioning is reduced to the maximum extent or on re allocating cluster centroid indicating that solution is locally optimal more detailed information about k means clustering can be obtained from ball and hall 1967 kanungo et al 2002 macqueen 1967 3 4 second order volterra sov model sov models are a class of non linear regression models the input variables are non linearity regressed with the output variables to estimate the regression coefficients if y t denotes the output predictand time series u 1 u 2 u 3 ul denote the l input n is the length of the time series m denotes the memory of each input variable up to which there is a significant lag relationship with the input time series and ξ t represents the model noise including modeling errors and the unobservable disturbances the 2nd order miso volterra model maheswaran and khosa 2012c is given by eq 5 5 y t n 1 l τ 1 m h 1 n τ u n t τ n 1 l τ 1 1

the nth input un and y the second order self kernels h 2 s n describe the 2nd order non linear relation between the nth input un and y respectively and the second order cross kernels h 2 x n 1 n 2 describe the 2nd order non linear interactions between each unique pair of inputs un 1 and un 2 as they affect y eq 5 can be simplified by combining the last two terms to yield eq 6 and it now remains to estimate kernels h 1 and h 2 6 y t n 1 l τ 1 m h 1 n τ u n t τ n 1 1 l n 2 1 l τ 1 1 m τ 2 1 m h 2 n 1 n 2 τ 1 τ 2 u n 1 t τ 1 u n 2 t τ 2 ξ t the representation of eq 6 can be further simplified by considering each of the lagged variables u 1 t 1 u 1 t τ u 2 t 1 u 2 t τ as separate variables d 1 t d 2 t d 3 t dnl t then eq 6 can be written as 7 y t l 1 n l h 1 l d l t l 1 1 n l l 2 1 n l h 2

miso volterra and mathematical derivation of the wavelet volterra coupled model the readers are referred to maheswaran and khosa 2012b 2012c 4 model development fig 3 shows the schematic for the proposed modeling methodology separate models are developed for each downscaling location assuming that the processes at each station are independent of any influence of the other this section provides a detailed description of each step in the model development step 1 standardization selected predictors from the ncep and gcm models are standardized to zero mean and unit standard deviation prior to statistical downscaling to reduce any systematic biases in the mean and variances of gcm and ncep ncar data relative to the observations wilby et al 1998 2004 standardization reduces the possibility of model instability owning to different order of magnitudes of the predictor variables scales down the predictor data to a single uniform scale and removes the units of the variables sachindra et al 2013 standardized data is obtained by first subtracting the mean and then dividing by standard deviation of the predictor variable for a predefined baseline period for both ncep ncar and gcm output step 2 variable averaging it is observed that for a given time the values of each ncep and interpolated gcm variable at all 4 vertices of an ncep grid enclosing the downscaling point are numerically similar to each other hence the values of each climatic variable across the vertices of the ncep grid are averaged out to obtain a single value across the grid at each pressure level fig 4 provides values of ta at 10mb pressure level ta10 at the vertices of the ncep grid surrounding point a it can be observed from fig 4 that the values and the variations in ta10 at ncep vertices numbered 1 ta10 1 2 ta10 2 5 ta10 5 6 ta10 6 are close to each other and the average of these variables ta10 a explains most of the variance in these variables refer to fig 2 b for locating these vertices on the basin hence justifying variable averaging for the purpose of variable reduction fig 5 provides schematic for the proposed variable averaging scheme step 3 input preparation using k means and pca a standard approach for input preparation for downscaling is to apply pca to the given set of candidate input variables and extract pcs which are orthogonal and preserve most of the variance originally present in the variables however applying such an operation for a large set of variables actually increases level of complexity slow to converge in this study we apply pca on the clusters of input variables which share similar behavior based on mwe this would actually help in preserving the information across different variables and also reduce the complexity in using pca for all the input variables at a time further it is possible to identify the significant variables influencing the predictand precipitation in this case as an initial step cwt is applied to each input variable obtained after step 1 and 2 using morlet wavelet to obtain wavelet coefficients at 7 time frequency dyadic scales covering information up to 128 months period these wavelet coefficients are then used to estimate mwe of the variable at each scale thus providing a distinct multi scale entropy signature for each input variable in the second step the estimated mwe of input variables is used as a signature to cluster ncep gcm variables into homogeneous groups using k means methodology selection of the optimum number of clusters is an important task while dealing with k means clustering two validity indices namely davies bouldin db index and dunn s index are used to identify the best number of clusters for the input data please refer to appendix a a b for more details on the db index and dunn s index selection of the number of clusters is carried out by segregating the data into 5 15 clusters and evaluating the corresponding clusters for a low db and high dunn s index value fig 6 provides the value of db and dunn s indices corresponding to each number of clusters 5 15 for all five stations based on this analysis 12 10 11 9 and 10 numbers of clusters are found to be suitable for stations a b c d and e respectively fig 7 provides a cluster wise classification of the available variables after step 1 and 2 for example it can be seen that for station a the entire set of 70 input variables are partitioned into 12 clusters each represented by a unique color it is to be noted that even though the overall pattern of clustering is similar for all five stations there are subtle differences in each other pertaining to the local geographical factors pca is then used on each cluster to obtain the pcs explaining 90 95 of the variance of the cluster for the training dataset we call this as cluster wise pca to differentiate it from the general connotation of pca of the input variable directly the coefficients of the pcs for training period saved as a static component of the modeling framework and are used to obtain pcs for validation and forecast period the above steps can be categorized as data preparatory steps these cluster wise principal components is taken as model inputs to ann and mlr models used for comparison purposes as these are very popular and it is shown in literature that these model generally outperform the sdsm based downscaling campozano et al 2016 liu et al 2008 these models can be denoted as p ann and p mlr models a detailed schematic describing data preparation for models is provided in fig 8 however using the coefficients from the training period to obtain pcs for the validation and forecast period may distort the pcs in validation by making them markedly correlated which violates the near zero correlation property of pcs theoretically the pcs should display zero or near zero correlation with each other sachindra et al 2013 2014 to validate the assumption of near zero correlation between the pcs of the training validation and gcm vectors for the future dataset the correlation matrix for the three dataset is evaluated for all five stations it is observed that pcs in general displayed a very low inter correlation for the dataset for the three time periods for all five stations although a few variables had a noticeable correlation with each other it does not alter the model performance due to the ols err architecture of the sov models in place fig 9 provides the correlation matrix for the input pcs for training validation and forecast period for station b step 4 multi resolution w p sov and w p mlr models the input variables obtained from step 1 3 above and the observed precipitation are transformed into respective wavelet sub time series for three dyadic resolution levels using dwt the wavelet sub time series obtained for each resolution level for the observed precipitation and the inputs from step 3 are modeled using sov and mlr to simulate downscaled precipitation at the corresponding scale the final downscaled value of precipitation is reconstructed from the outputs of these models by linear summation of each output sub time series fig 11 shows the non linear kernels for d2 component of the station b similarly kernels are estimated for all sub scale levels and for all five stations not shown here for brevity table 2 shows the number of significant ols err regressors present in the final model for different stations at three sub scale levels the number of significant regressors in the non linear domain signifies the level of non linearity in the underlying relationship between the predictand and predicator variables it can be observed that the relationship at level d1 2 months scale seems to be highly non linear compared to the relationship at the higher levels d2 d3 and a3 in case of the w p mlr model only a linear relationship is considered between the predictand and the predictor variables at different scales p ann and p mlr model pcs against observed data using ann mlr models are developed for the purpose of comparison which utilize the pcs from all clusters as the input to the models an important aspect of wavelet based models is the selection of level of decomposition and suitable mother wavelet in this study we have followed the guidelines given by maheswaran and khosa 2012a and sehgal et al 2014b however we also provide further insight for this study in the supplement material for this paper the models are developed and coded in the matlab r2014b in order to facilitate application of the proposed approach to diverse dataset by a wider audience a matlab toolkit based on the proposed approach is developed and is available through the website of the team https sites google com site climaticdownscalingtool home step 5 uncertainty assessment of the downscaling models major sources of uncertainty in a statistical downscaling exercise can be broadly classified into data and model uncertainty data uncertainty can be an artifact of the choice of the gcm chosen as an input for the downscaling model several studies have been conducted comparing the performance of one gcm over another model uncertainty can be attributed to insufficient training or sub optimal model structure etc estimating uncertainty in the downscaled precipitation for future is necessary considering numerous local factors which are not accommodated in the gcm outputs or can be captured accurately due to the limitations of the modeling methodology a bootstrap based resampling approach is used in this study khan et al 2006 samadi et al 2013 to account for the factor of uncertainty 200 resamples of the training data is obtained and 80 data from each resample is used to obtain the downscaling model parameters for each downscaling station for each resample of training input dataset a w p sov model is developed and trained using 80 of total resampled data each of which is applied to the validation and gcm dataset in the future a schematic of the bootstrap approach used in this study is shown in fig 10 more information about bootstrapping is included in appendix a 5 performance indices the model results are compared using some of the common performance indices such as normalized root mean square error nrmse coefficient of correlation cc willmott s index d willmott et al 2012 2015 and accuracy index nrmse is root mean square error rmse normalized to a scale 0 1 whereas nmae is mean absolute error mae normalized to a scale 0 1 the normalization of rmse and mae is done to facilitate easy comparison of model performances across stations and models rmse mae and cc are defined as follows 8 rmse 1 n i 1 n oi pi 2 9 mae 1 n i 1 n oi pi 10 cc i 0 n oi o pi p i 0 n oi o 2 i 0 n pi p 2 11 d i 0 n oi o pi p i 0 n oi o 2 i 0 n pi p 2 where oi and pi are the observed and estimated precipitation and n is the number of data points in the series accuracy index of the model is defined as percentage of estimated data points in the validation period falling within discrepancy ratio dr range of 1 1 where dr is defined as log of the fraction of estimated and observed precipitation 12 dr log pi oi it follows that dr 0 suggests exact matching between estimated and measured values otherwise there is either over estimation oi pi or under estimation oi pi in this study the estimation of monthly precipitation is deemed precise if the estimated value fall within 10 deviation from the observed value dr between 1 and 1 6 model results table 3 summarizes the performance of all the models based on selected performance indices as observed from table 3 w p sov and w p mlr models outperform p ann and p mlr models for all five stations for station a w p sov and w p mlr models provide cc of 0 723 and 0 716 nrmse of 0 177 and 0 178 nmae of 0 105 and 0 121 d of 0 669 and 0 543 and accuracy index of 76 52 and 68 94 respectively compared to cc of 0 682 and 0 672 nrmse of 0 182 and 0 188 nmae of 0 130 and 0 135 d of 0 595 and 0 525 and accuracy index of 65 91 and 63 64 using p ann and p mlr models respectively similar trend is observed for station b where w p sov models showed improvement over w p mlr p ann and p mlr models similarly improvement in nrmse nmae d and accuracy index w r t w p mlr p ann and p mlr is 2 1 12 8 and 12 8 4 1 24 5 25 3 6 2 14 5 and 17 4 and 8 3 9 6 and 9 6 respectively a similar behavior is observed for stations c and station e with w p sov and w p mlr performing considerably better than p ann and p mlr models for station d the performance of p ann models is observed to be close to that of w p mlr model both the models provide a cc of 0 715 and an accuracy index of 74 24 however in terms of nrmse and nmae statistics w p mlr provides a better downscaled estimate with nrmse of 0 154 and nmae of 0 234 compared to nrmse of 0 168 and nmae of 0 276 using p ann models fig 12 provides comparison of different models under study based on dr statistics the x axis of the plots provides the dr bracket and the y axis provides the percentage of total validation data points falling into the dr bracket the dotted vertical lines highlight the accuracy band and the total percentage of data points falling into the region demarcated by the dotted lines is termed as accuracy index of the model it is evident from the plots that w p sov models have an advantage over other models in general the multi resolution based models displayed less bias and improved overall accuracy for all five stations the hydrology of the basin is driven by the south west monsoon hence accurate estimation of the monsoonal precipitation is important for any downscaling approach in this region fig 13 shows the box plots for observed v s simulated precipitation for the monsoonal months may to october of the validation period it is observed that in general wavelet based models are able to capture the mean and extremes of the monsoonal precipitation better than p ann and p mlr models 6 1 downscaled precipitation for future having validated the performance of the proposed approach it is used for downscaling the future climatic estimates from the gcm the downscaled simulations till 2035 are obtained for all stations by applying the proposed w p sov models to the cancm4 gcm outputs estimates of the key statistical parameters for the downscaled precipitation datasets namely maximum annual mean annual skewness and 10th 25th 50th 75th 90th percentiles for three temporal lengths i e jan 2006 to dec 2015 jan 2016 to dec 2025 jan 2026 to dec 2035 are provided in table 4 since monsoon drives the hydrological cycle in the basin it is imperative to analyze trends of monsoonal rainfall for the future period maximum and mean precipitation for the monsoonal period may october for years 2006 2035 is provided in fig 14 bootstrap resampling approach previously explained is used to calculate the variance σ2 in estimating the descriptive statistics provided in table 4 and to generate the confidence interval ci at the 95 significance level for estimating the maximum and mean value of monsoonal precipitation as in fig 14 the mann kendall test is used to identify any monotonic upward or downward trend in the maximum and mean precipitation for the monsoonal period over time the mann kendall test is a non parametric statistical test with a null hypothesis of no monotonic trend the p value for the test at α 0 05 and the interpretation of the test for each station is provided in table 5 from fig 14 and table 5 it can be observed that the trend in maximum monsoonal precipitation for the year 2006 2035 doesn t follow a uniform pattern across stations station a shows a monotonically decreasing trend whereas station d shows an increasing trend no significant monotonic trend is observed for station b c and e mean monsoonal precipitation doesn t show statistically significant monotonic pattern for any station 7 discussion the results obtained from different models show that the wavelet based models have a clear advantage over the single scale models both wavelet based models w p sov and w p mlr outperform stand alone models like p ann and p mlr application of wavelet analysis facilitates a multi resolution modeling approach to model the input variables separate models are developed at each scale of the precipitation time series hence the models are sensitive to both long and transient trends in the input variables providing an edge over the stand alone models this is because the scale wise decomposition separates the features variability at different scales making it easier to capture the underlying relationship moreover the sov models have an advantage over mlr based models as it addresses to the non linearity in the process short and transient processes which are mostly accounted by the d1 component of a time series are difficult to model using linear models due to the inherent complexity of the process hence a non linear model captures variations in these components more accurately it is observed from table 2 that d1 component accounted for most number of non linear variables in the model across all stations a closer look at the results reveals that the performance of the downscaling models varies with the target location for station a and station b the performance of wavelet based models is significantly better compared to other models for station c d and e the increment in the performance of models using wavelet based approach is relatively small for station d the p ann model is comparable to that of w p mlr models it is to be noted that the performance of the downscaling models is significantly influenced by micro climatic local factors in this case study station b is located at the windward side of the western ghats and experience heavy rainfall in contrary to other stations which lie in arid semi arid regions of southern indian peninsula modeling rainfall pattern for arid and semi arid regions is comparatively difficult due to complex rainfall patterns in order to highlight the advantage of using a cluster wise pca over direct pca of all the variables separate models are run and the results are estimated for station b table 6 shows the results obtained from models with and without performing cluster wise pca from the analysis of the results it is noted that the cluster wise pca improves the results over simple pca method for input variable preparation intuitively the clustering of similar variables helps to reduce the dimensionality of the problem and thereby the principal components captured more variability in the inputs it can be seen that compared to pca ann no clustering and pca w sov no clustering the corresponding cluster wise pca based models perform better for example simple pca with ann model produced estimates that had a cc of 0 779 however the corresponding model with clustering gave results with a cc of 0 842 further fig 15 shows the plot of the results in terms of number of rainfall events captured by the model obtained from two w p sov models for station b which differ in the clustering methodology while one model employs mwe based k means another model uses stand alone k means for variable clustering prior to the application of pca no mwe it can be seen that the model with cluster wise pca on mwe based k means clusters is able to perform better in estimating the number of precipitation events during the non monsoon periods than the model with clustering without mwe which false alarms and hence over estimates the rainfall during the dry season these observations are in line with the findings of agarwal et al 2016a b which show that the multi scale wavelet entropy is capable of picking up the underlying variability in the signal at different scales and hence can used for effectively clustering process having similar patterns comparing the results of other clustering methods other than k means and other basis other than wavelet entropy for clustering is beyond the scope of the present work 7 1 advantages and limitations of the proposed approach the wavelet based approach provides a better understanding of the underlying processes at several time frequency resolutions thus providing improved estimates of the downscaled precipitation the proposed methodology can be conveniently applied to a wider grid wise downscaling and applied to a wider geographical region sov based models enable a deterministic parameter estimation the proposed w p sov approach provides a better estimation of the observed precipitation compared to w p mlr p ann and p mlr for all five stations thus establishing the robustness of the approach it is to be noted that direct identification of the key drivers of the underlying process cannot be carried out using this approach as the models are built on the dwcs of the principal components of each cluster of ncep gcm variables rather than the individual variables themselves the exclusivity of individual ncep gcm variables is lost in the attempt to reduce model complexity using variable reduction technique however a sensitivity analysis can be carried out by omitting including each cluster and evaluating the performance of the model after omitting including the cluster this exercise will be helpful in identifying the clusters for which the models are most least sensitive the proposed models use only one wavelet function for a given station which is selected based on the comparative performance evaluation with models using different wavelet functions for dwt on a large scale analysis involving a multitude of downscaling locations a more general approach may be better suited where any prior information of the suitability of a given wavelet function is not available the authors suggest an ensemble of models using a variety of wavelets in order to equip the models to capture the processes of a given location these models will be the focus of future research 8 conclusion this paper evaluates a wavelet based multi resolution modeling approach for downscaling gcm variables to mean monthly precipitation for krishna basin india the application of the proposed approach is demonstrated for five locations across the basin with significantly different climatology and rainfall patterns a cluster wise pca technique using mwe for preparation of the inputs is proposed for the downscaling models the performance of the proposed w p sov models is compared with those of ann mlr based models further to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed cluster wise pca based on mwe in capturing the variability in precipitation comparison is made with the models with stand alone pca no mwe based clustering prior to pca primary findings of this study are summarized below 1 wavelet based multi resolution models w p sov and w p mlr outperform p ann and p mlr models which use stand alone ann mlr for modeling the input dataset among w p sov and w p mlr the former provides better downscaling performance due to the ability of sov models to capture higher order and non linear dynamics of the system 2 cluster wise pca improves the results over simple pca method for input variable preparation by reducing the dimensionality of the input variables this enables the principal components to capture more variability in the inputs compared to the direct pca the models based on cluster wise pca approach perform better in terms of rmse and accuracy index 3 the downscaled mean monthly precipitation for the five locations with their descriptive statistics with an estimate of variance using a bootstrap approach is evaluated trend analysis on the downscaled precipitation reveals that while one station has statistically significant increasing trend eastern side of the basin another station has the opposite trend north west side basin in maximum monsoonal precipitation over the years 2004 2035 other stations do not show any significant increasing or decreasing trend none of the stations have a statistically significant trend in mean precipitation for monsoonal months for the period 2006 2035 4 overall it can be concluded that wavelet analysis can be used as a useful tool in climatic downscaling the study proposes a location specific performance evaluation of different wavelets in capturing the overall variability in the selected input variables and a wavelet spectrum based method in understanding the dominant periods in the dataset in order to assess the suitable level of decomposition for the input variables it is to be noted that while the application of the proposed methodology is demonstrated at a monthly time step the approach can be effectively used for dataset with a finer weekly daily or sub daily or a coarser annual temporal resolution with varying degree of accuracy certainly the application of the proposed methodology to case studies from different regions across the globe with different geographic climatic and hydrologic characteristics and dataset of various temporal resolutions would validate and strengthen the conclusions drawn in this paper acknowledgement this research is funded
