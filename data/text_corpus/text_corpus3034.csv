15170,cement mortar lining cml is commonly used for iron pipe internal corrosion inhibition in drinking water distribution system dwds however the corrosion of cml itself is still a problem particularly under soft water conditions in this study both long term experimental study and theoretical studies were conducted to evaluate the effects of graphene oxide go and three dimensional reduced graphene oxide 3d rgo as additives on the stability of cml and the corresponding water quality results showed that during a 182 day leaching experiment the 3d rgo modified cement had a higher ability to inhibit the cement constituent leaching than go modified and original cements structural characterization indicated that the addition of 3d rgo could slightly promote the degree of calcium hydroxide crystallization in cml molecular dynamics simulation demonstrated that the 3d rgo nanosheets strengthened the tensile strain of the cement and restricted the movement of calcium ions by forming strong bonds with the calcium silicate hydrate gel network in addition compared with go modified cement and original cement the 3d rgo modified cement could somewhat reduce the disinfection by products formation and the microbial richness in drinking water thus the reinforcement of cement by 3d rgo could enhance the safety and durability of cml iron pipes in dwds graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords drinking water distribution system cement mortar lining three dimensional graphene water quality data availability no data was used for the research described in the article 1 introduction ductile iron pipe is one of the mainstream water supply pipes at present but the metal inner wall is susceptible to corrosion tang et al 2017 wąsowski et al 2019 due to the low price advantage and relatively good anti corrosion effect cement mortar lining cml is the most preferred lining type for ductile iron pipes parks et al 2012 however during use the cement mortar could dissolve after contact with water particularly under soft water conditions the dissolution of calcium hydroxide ch and decalcification of calcium silicate hydrate c s h gel may increase ph and total dissolved solids tds of the water douglas et al 1996b zielina et al 2015 in addition aluminum and heavy metals may also leach into water during the process berend and trouwborst 1999 guo et al 1998 wąsowski et al 2019 zielina et al 2014 in addition to water quality problems caused by cml constituent leaching pipe materials can directly affect the biofilm community structure of the pipe wall and the colonization of opportunistic pathogens which in turn affects the durability of the pipe and the safety of the water supply ren et al 2015 tang et al 2021b for application in drinking water distribution system dwds the effect of cement on water quality is significant for water safety leaching is one of the most significant factors affecting the durability of cement pastes moreover when used as cml in dwds corrosion induced leaching behavior would deteriorate water quality douglas et al 1996a the c s h gel network is one of the main hydration products of cement based materials and the dissolution effect dissolves the ch and decalcifies the c s h in the cml which may reduce its stability and service life graphene oxide go is a two dimensional carbon material with excellent properties tang et al 2021a zhang et al 2020 the surface of its lamellar layer contains hydroxyl epoxide carboxyl and carbonyl functional groups and the edges of which are rich in carbonyl and carboxyl groups mohammed et al 2015 previous research found that due to the special properties of go it could have high reactivity with cement and it can be easily dispersed in cement media shamsaei et al 2018 making it attractive for cement modification studies have shown that only a very small amount addition can greatly improve the mechanical properties and the resistance of cement to salt ion corrosion gong et al 2015 mohammed et al 2015 pan et al 2015 xu et al 2019 moreover the addition of go can reduce the water absorption of the cement and when go cement used as a pipe lining its low water absorption may lead to greater resistance to leaching thereby increasing the life of the lining mohammed et al 2015 compared to functionalized cnts for cement reinforcement go showed to have better reinforcing performance with more uniform dispersion and higher interfacial adhesion lu and zhong 2022 however the effect of graphene based materials on cement for application in drinking water area has not been focused yet using simple hydrothermal treatments the 2d go powders could be turned into three dimensional reduced go 3d rgo hydrogels through the self assembly of go sheets which restrains the agglomeration of the graphene sheets chen et al 2012 nardecchia et al 2013 without the agglomeration problem 3d rgo has larger specific surface area than 2d graphene bano et al 2020 a synergistic effect of 3d graphene and silica fume was found on the properties of hardened cement paste ying et al 2022 however prior research has mostly concentrated on using graphene based materials to improve the cement s mechanical and durability features shamsaei et al 2018 no research has been carried on using graphene based cements to transport drinking water therefore it is of great importance to investigate the safety and durability of cement modified by 3d rgo due to the large scale application of cml based drinking water pipes in this study both long term experimental study and theoretical study were used to evaluate the performance of cement modified by 3d rgo under the drinking water conditions long term 182 d leaching experiments were conducted to observe the leaching behaviors of cement constituents crystalline structure and pore distribution of modified cements were characterized by various instrumental methods and theoretical simulation based on molecular dynamics was used to explore the interaction between the 3d rgo and the cement constituents the effects of cement modification on disinfection by products dbps formation and microorganism composition in water influenced by the modified cement were also investigated 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials the go powder was purchased from xfnano china type 52 5 ordinary portland cement was obtained

were obtained from sinopharm chemical reagent company shanghai china methyl tert butyl ether mtbe was purchased from j k china 2 2 experimental design go and 3d rgo preparation go was prepared using natural graphite powder by a modified hummers method first 1 5 g go was dispersed in 300 ml deionized water and under an ultrasonic crushing for 30 min then it was put in an ultrasonic bath for another 12 h to form a uniform go solution fig s1 another identical go solution with the same disperse procedure was added in a teflon lined stainless steel autoclave then heated in an electric oven at 120 c for 12 h to synthesize 3d rgo hydrogel through hydrothermal reaction zhuang et al 2016 zhuang et al 2015 then the 3d rgo hydrogel was stirred into pieces followed by the same steps as for go solution preparation to form a uniform 3d rgo solution fig s2 the concentrations of go and 3d rgo hydrogel solution were 5 mg ml and 50 ml of both solutions were freeze dried for subsequent characterization cement paste preparation three kinds of cement samples were prepared pure cement pc paste was prepared by mixing 2700 g cement and 810 ml water go cement goc paste and 3d rgo cement 3d goc paste were prepared by mixing 2700 g cement 648 ml water 162 ml go solution and 162 ml 3d rgo hydrogel solution respectively the ratio of go and 3d rgo hydrogel was both 0 03 by weight of cement gong et al 2015 lv et al 2013 mohammed et al 2015 all the pastes were stirred for 10 min at first then each paste was cast into a 40 30 16 mm mold the molds were removed after 24 h and the specimens were immersed in saturated limewater at 20 c for 1 month murugan et al 2016 after one month of curing each kind of cement specimens were taken out 5 pieces for each and dried in an oven at 60 c for 2 d and the thoroughly dried samples were used for characterization reactor establishment and operation as shown in fig s3 the reactor was made of plexiglass each reactor contained 16 specimens all the specimens were coated with epoxy resin on 5 surfaces except the surface pointing to the center of the reactor the cement specimens were immersed in the reactor and the upper motor drove the stirring paddle to rotate test water used for cement constituent leaching was deionized water during a 24 hour operation the motor ran for 16 h providing a flow rate about 0 7 m s in the rest of the 8 h the reactor was under stagnation condition to simulate the actual dwds condition the experiment lasted for 182 days water samples were collected daily during the first 30 days and every two days during day 31 to day 90 then every four days until the end of the experiment water was discharged completely from the reactor after the sample was collected and fresh deionized water was fed into the reactor meanwhile each water sample was divided into two parts one part was analyzed immediately after taken from reactor for ph and tds effect of modified cements on dbps immersion

text s2 2 4 molecular dynamics md simulation the atomic model of c s h gel was generated based on the 11 å tobermorite crystalline structure merlino et al 1999 the c s h sample of md simulations was created via 8 3 7 replications of the single cell of 11 å tobermorite crystal the final c s h sample showed dimensions of around 51 73 22 32 81 86 å that is large enough for md tension study for the case of c s h graphene composites two types of md composite samples were generated based on the experimental study one type of md composite model was generated by graphene nanosheets that were individually inserted into the space gaps between silicon chains of bulk c s h named as c s h ug composite model the other type of md composite model was obtained by an aggregation of graphene nanosheets that was inserted into the bulk c s h named as c s h rg composite model periodic boundary conditions pbcs were imposed along the three x y and z directions to mimic infinite large systems allowing to eliminate the edge effects 3 results and discussion 3 1 characterization of go and 3d rgo the zeta potentials of go and 3d rgo were 29 5 mv and 8 75 mv respectively and the average particle sizes were 1782 nm and 4379 nm respectively table s2 the lower zeta potential of go was due to the presence of negatively charged oh and cooh groups whereas the zeta potential of 3d rgo increased due to a decrease in oxygen functional groups during self assemble in hydrothermal treatment mindivan 2016 the particle size distribution showed that both go and 3d rgo were uniformly dispersed in water and 3d rgo had a larger particle size due to the cross linking of go nanosheets from the xps spectrum of go in the c1s region three peaks at 284 8 286 8 and 288 1 ev were noticed which could be attributed to sp2 hybridized carbon c c epoxy hydroxyl carbon c o and carboxyl c o respectively fig s4 a cai et al 2015 wang et al 2016b compared with go the intensity of c o in 3d rgo decreased dramatically which indicated that go had been successfully reduced fig s4 b the ftir spectrum of go and 3d rgo are shown in fig s5 the absorption peaks of go were observed at 3412 cm 1 oh 1715 cm 1 c o 1620 cm 1 sp2 hybridized carbon of go 1396 cm 1 c oh 1058 cm 1 c o vibrations of alkoxy groups 835 cm 1 c h 3d rgo had only three adsorption peaks which were at 1739 cm 1 c o 1564 cm 1 graphitic carbon and 1194 cm 1 c o c the reduction of oxygen containing functional groups confirmed the reduction of go to rgo nundy et al 2021 surekha et al 2020 as shown by the afm images fig s6 the lateral dimensional sizes of both go and 3d rgo nanosheets were small which might be caused by ultrasonic fragmentation during the dispersion process zhang et al 2009 the average thickness of go was 0 69 nm and that of 3d rgo was 0 65 nm which was due to the reduction reaction that reduced the number of oxygen containing functional groups of 3d rgo matsumoto et al 2010 3 2 long term leaching behavior of cement modified by 3d rgo the calcium tds aluminum silicon and ph values in the reactor effluent for the three different cements are shown in fig 1 and fig s7 the values of all parameters gradually decreased over time and none of them reached a steady state at the end of the experiment this was due to the fact that the deionized water used for soaking was highly aggressive to the cement causing continuous leaching of the components from the cement in the first 60 days the effluent calcium content was pc goc 3d goc and after 80 days it was obviously goc pc 3d goc the effluent aluminum and silicon concentrations followed a similar pattern in the first 80 d and goc being much higher than pc and 3d goc after 80 d while pc and 3d goc were almost identical during the entire experiment 3d goc had the lowest effluent tds and ph among the three cements indicating that this cement released not only the least total substances but also the least alkaline chemicals the smaller the total amount of alkaline chemicals is released from the cement the longer the alkaline ph of the cement pore fluid can be maintained and the better the protection of the pipe wall the effluent tds values of pc and goc were close in the first 80 d with goc being slightly higher than pc at day 82 184 and the effluent ph values of pc and goc being close in the first 100 d with goc being slightly higher than pc after that among the three cements the effluent calcium concentration tds value and ph value of 3d goc were always the lowest while the effluent aluminum concentration and silicon concentration were basically the same as those of pc indicating that 3d goc possessed the best anti leaching properties and had the least influence on water quality fig 2 depicts the cumulative concentrations of effluent calcium aluminum and silicon throughout the experimental period compared with pc the cumulative effluent calcium concentration of goc increased by 3 2 and that of 3d goc reduced by 15 7 further demonstrating the excellent leaching resistance of 3d goc the cumulative effluent concentrations of aluminum and silicon of goc is slightly higher than those of the other two cements pc and 3d goc for the cumulative tds values of the whole experiment pc goc and 3d goc were 10 538 10 814 and 8542 mg l respectively with a minor rise of 2 6 for goc compared to pc and a drop of 18 9 for 3d goc compared to pc the cumulative ph values of the entire experiment were 520 25 522 06 and 516 43 for the three cements described above although the total values did not differ much the differences were still noticeable due to the small ph fluctuation range with goc having the highest total alkaline release and 3d goc having the lowest total alkaline release therefore the addition of 3d rgo could significantly reduce the release of calcium and alkaline substances thereby mitigating the impact of cement leaching on water quality while potentially extending the service life of the cml pipes 3 3 structural changes of cement modified by 3d rgo the graphene incorporation in cement could affect the cement hydration reactions fig s8 shows the dtg and tga patterns of the original and modified cement samples the dehydration of c s h and ettringite produced the peak near 100 c adamopoulou et al 2011 de weerdt et al 2019 the dehydration of ch produced the peak near 430 c hidalgo et al 2007 and the broad peak near 700 c was due to the decomposition of calcium carbonate to lose carbon dioxide ou et al 2010 based on the tga curves it could be obtained that the weight losses due to ch dehydration were 8 38 8 44 and 10 03 for the pc goc and 3d goc respectively which indicated that 3d rgo significantly increased the ch crystal content the crystal changes induced by the addition of go and 3d rgo were further analyzed by xrd fig s9 and the relative contents of different crystals in each sample were also calculated fig s10 the major crystals in all three cements are ch tricalcium silicate c3s and dicalcium silicate c2s which indicates the addition of go and 3d rgo did not lead to the formation of new crystal matters in the cements as for the diffraction peak intensity ch in the cement with the addition of 3d rgo had slightly enhanced diffraction peaks at 2θ 18 1 corresponding to 001 crystal plane and 2θ 34 1 corresponding to 101 crystal plane when compared to the pc the possible explanation is that the presence of oxygen functional groups on the surface of 3d rgo could serve as nucleation sites for ch resulting in faster crystal growth in the direction of the 001 and 101 crystal planes jing et al 2020 in addition 3d rgo reduced the content of c3s in cement indicating that 3d rgo promoted cement hydration to some extent kang et al 2019 the differential pore size distribution and pore volume distribution for the three cements are shown in fig 3 the most probable pore sizes of pc goc and 3d goc are 36 4 32 0 and 34 2 nm respectively which are within the range of capillary pores compared to pc the addition of 3d rgo did not significantly influence the gel pore volume but slightly reduced the capillary pore and macropore volumes however the addition of go increased the volume of gel pores 10 nm and decreased the volume of capillary holes 10 1000 nm compared to pc which is similar to the results found by murugan et al murugan et al 2016 in addition compared with pc and 3d goc the volume of macropores 1000 nm of goc increased by 25 83 and 40 18 respectively this may be related to the size distribution of go nanosheets after dispersion in water which is usually between a few hundred nanometers and several micrometers and their irregular shape might lead to an increased volume of large pores in the goc mohammed et al 2015 therefore the highest constituent release of goc might be attributed to its special pore size distribution 3 4 theoretical analysis on interaction between 3d rgo and cement the significant impact of reinforced concrete by graphene had been found in a previous study dimov et al 2018 the stress strain relation can distinguish the different mechanical properties of the pc goc and 3d goc fig 4 shows the simulated interaction zone of pc goc and 3d goc under tensile strain the stress of all the samples increased with the tensile strain increasing to 0 08 m m and subsequently reduced slowly in the post failure regime when tensile strain continued to increase fig 5 a 3d goc showed the highest stress 4 6 gpa in three samples which indicated 3d rgo could enhance the mechanical property of the cml calcium is one of the most important ions in c s h which is interspersed between the long chains of silica oxygen tetrahedra in the form of cao the dynamic properties of ca atoms in the samples were quantitatively evaluated by mean square displacement msd as shown in fig 5b msd parameter depicts the freedom of movement within a certain matrix which can be translated as a sign of cohesion between the said materials and the hosting matrix the msd of ca2 showed that the 3d rgo had obviously higher inhibition for the ca2 movement which was in accordance with the lowest ion leaching behavior of 3d goc within 182 d during the hydrothermal process for 3d rgo preparation the go dispersions are cross linked with each other through partial π π stacking and then self assemble to form porous 3d rgo xu et al 2015 during this process 3d rgo will generate more defects fang et al 2017 while the carboxyl groups hydroxyl groups or other groups readily occur on these defects thereby increasing local activity liu et al 2015 after being blended into cement the carboxyl groups in 3d rgo can combine with calcium ions in c s h to form ca hcoo 2 wang et al 2016a zhao et al 2018 which acts as a bridge to connect different 3d rgo fragments thereby making c s h gel and 3d rgo interpenetrate each other to form a double network structure at the same time the pore channels of the 3d rgo are gradually filled in as the cement hydration products grow along the pore wall in this process 3d rgo acting as a skeleton limits the unrestrained expansion of cement hydration products while also influencing their distribution ying et al 2022 through the above processes the addition of 3d rgo not only increased the strength of 3d goc but also made calcium ions more firmly fixed in the system improving the anti leaching resistance 3 5 effects of cement reinforcement by 3d rgo on drinking water quality effect of cement modification on representative dbps including thms haas and hans in drinking water were measured under different chlorine dosages as shown in fig s11 it can be found that under the same cl2 concentration the production of the three dbps did not differ greatly the total dbps generation amount increased with the cl2 concentration increment and the amount corresponding to 3d goc was slightly lower than those corresponding to pc and goc on the interface of graphene containing materials with metal o c linkage oh was found to be generated using o2 as electron donor zhuang et al 2019 moreover due to the confinement effect associated with the 3d graphene assembly the barrier of 3d rgo 1 10 ev was much smaller than that of the 2d graphene state 1 60 ev resulting in an increase of in the c o bond length and in the activity of the c atom to promote oh generation zhuang et al 2020 thus in the graphene c s h composite the ca o c linkage facilitated by the 3d rgo might generate more oh which could degrade the pre formed dbps on the interface of 3d goc the effects of dbps on human health should be evaluated not only by their concentration but also by their toxicity because the toxicity of different dbps varies greatly and some dbps are capable of producing high toxicity even at very low concentrations two commonly used indicators for assessing dbps toxicity are cytotoxicity and genotoxicity dbps cytotoxicity is defined as the product of unit cytotoxicity and dbps concentration in the sample and dbps genotoxicity is defined as the product of unit genotoxicity and dbps concentration in the sample ding et al 2013 yu et al 2021 fig s12 depicts the cytotoxicity and genotoxicity of immersion water of different cement samples after 24 h of immersion at various cl2 concentrations the generation of total dbps in each sample increased as the concentration of cl2 dosed increased resulting in an increase in cytotoxicity and genotoxicity at the same time furthermore it could be found that the cytotoxicity and genotoxicity corresponding to 3d goc are somewhat lower than those corresponding to the other two cement samples in addition to measuring dbps production after immersion of different cement samples three dimensional excitation emission matrix 3d eem fluorescence measurements were performed on the water after immersion fig s13 to characterize the type and concentration of dom chen et al 2003 left in the water after the chlorination reaction fig s14 with increasing cl2 concentration the amount of dom remaining as dbps precursors in the post reaction water reduced which corresponded to an increase in dbps production the relatively higher remaining dom concentrations in the post reaction water verified that 3d rgo modified cement could inhibit the formation of dbps and accordingly reduced the cytotoxicity and genotoxicity risks posed by dbps to consumers to further evaluate the effect of 3d rgo reinforced cement on drinking water safety the bacterial communities in waters corresponding to different cement samples were analyzed on genus level and those with a relative abundance of less than 1 of bacteria were classified as others fig s15 throughout all four samples nevskia was the most abundant the species composition of the four samples was represented by venn diagrams at the genus level fig s16 with 60 genera present in all four samples 62 endemic genera in sample blank 76 endemic genera in sample pc 22 endemic genera in sample goc and 14 endemic genera in sample 3d goc in terms of species richness sample pc had 227 genera and sample blank had 217 genera however samples goc and 3d goc had 145 and 121 genera respectively demonstrating that cement after goc and 3d goc modification could inhibit the growth of certain bacteria the alpha diversity analysis was carried out for four samples and the sobs index was calculated under phylum and genus levels fig s17 the indexes at both levels were pc blank goc 3d goc further proved that pure cement might promote microbial richness however goc and 3d goc could reduce microbial richness to a certain extent which might be helpful for reducing microbial risks graphene can perform antimicrobial activities through physical action both go and 3d rgo have lamellar structures with sharp edges which would pierce through the microbial cell membrane and causing intracellular substances to flow out eventually leading to cell death another mechanism of graphene antimicrobial activity is reactive oxygen species mediated oxidative stress zou et al 2016 in addition as discussed previously graphene modified cements may generate oh that disrupt cellular function and cause microbial death moreover the msd of ca2 showed that the 3d rgo had obviously higher inhibition for the ca2 movement which could reduce the release of calcium ions from cement into the water when calcium ions release into water they may become part of particles or deposits which are beneficial to the growth of microorganisms in dwds liu et al 2013 ma et al 2019 therefore the reduction of calcium release resulted from 3d rgo enforcement could also contribute to the reduction of microorganism risk in the dwds experiments on the effects of different kinds of cement samples on dbps production and on microbial communities were conducted for only one week and the graphene exposed on the cement surface could have an effect in direct contact with water when the delivered water is non aggressive or slightly aggressive a calcium carbonate precipitation layer will gradually form on the cement surface thus blocking the contact of graphene with water liu et al 2022 as an advanced material graphene oxide may have some biological toxicity a study has found that the safe critical concentration was 10 μg ml pang et al 2017 we can do the following calculation using small diameter pipe as an example to understand the possible concentration of graphene in water the inner diameter of dn100 cml pipe is about 90 mm the thickness of cml is about 6 mm the density of cml is about 2 3 g cm3 then there is 6 4 l of water and 1325 g of cml in each meter of cml pipe when the amount of graphene oxide added is 0 03 of the mass fraction of cement then there is 0 4 g of graphene oxide in one meter of cml pipe the service life of cml is generally up to several decades miller 1965 here assuming a lining failure time of 30 years the thickness reduction due to corrosion is 0 55 μm of cml per 24 h which contains 0 37 μg of graphene oxide and the concentration of graphene in water after leaching into water is 0 0058 μg ml which is extremely lower than the aforementioned 10 μg ml for pipes with larger diameter the graphene concentration could be even lower on the other hand the 3d rgo modified cml will have higher resistance to corrosion as shown in this study thus the leaching of graphene into water would be much less possible in addition to the biological toxicity the impact of graphene modified cml on global warming and energy consumption is of concern compared to conventional cml and life cycle assessment lca is an effective way to clarify these impacts for cement and graphene a cradle to gate evaluation approach is commonly employed arvidsson et al 2014 chen et al 2010 in cement production the global warming potential gwp is 0 8 kg co2 equivalent kg cement and the primary energy demand ped is 3 99 mj kg cement li et al 2015 long et al 2018 in graphene production under commercial scale the gwp is 0 46 kg co2 equivalent kg graphene and the ped is 1879 mj kg graphene cossutta et al 2017 pizza et al 2014 in this study the addition of graphene was 0 03 of the mass fraction of cement as a result the gwp and ped of graphene cement are 101 7 and 114 of those of pure cement respectively the addition of 0 01 go by weight of cement can increase the 28 d compressive strength of cement composites by about 20 30 lu and zhong 2022 which means that the amount of cement can be reduced while achieving the same strength assuming a 20 reduction in cement the reduction in gwp and ped is also sufficient to cover the increase caused by the addition of graphene 4 conclusions cement samples modified by go and 3d rgo were prepared and characterized in terms of gel network formation crystal composition and pore distribution long term 182 d dynamic immersion experiments in deionized water were conducted to observe the release behaviors of cement constituents during the long term leaching 3d rgo modified cement significantly reduced the calcium release whereas go modification significantly increased cement constituents release the characterization results showed that the addition of 3d rgo increased the ch crystallinity of the cement without significantly changing the pore structure whereas the addition of go significantly decreased the gel pore volume and increased the macropore and micropore volumes in the cement according to the md simulation the 3d rgo nanosheets increased the tensile strain of the cement and restricted the movement of calcium ions by building strong bonds with the c s h network in addition the 3d rgo modified cement could reduce the amount of dbps in drinking water and decrease the microbial diversity to some extent compared to pc and goc and the toxicity of leached graphene to human could be ignored in terms of environmental impact the reduction in cement usage due to graphene s enhancement of cement properties can offset the gwp and ped produced during graphene production therefore 3d rgo could effectively prevent ions leaching from cement to extend the service life of the cml iron pipes without creating greater environmental loads and is conducive to improve the drinking water safety in dwds declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they

15170,cement mortar lining cml is commonly used for iron pipe internal corrosion inhibition in drinking water distribution system dwds however the corrosion of cml itself is still a problem particularly under soft water conditions in this study both long term experimental study and theoretical studies were conducted to evaluate the effects of graphene oxide go and three dimensional reduced graphene oxide 3d rgo as additives on the stability of cml and the corresponding water quality results showed that during a 182 day leaching experiment the 3d rgo modified cement had a higher ability to inhibit the cement constituent leaching than go modified and original cements structural characterization indicated that the addition of 3d rgo could slightly promote the degree of calcium hydroxide crystallization in cml molecular dynamics simulation demonstrated that the 3d rgo nanosheets strengthened the tensile strain of the cement and restricted the movement of calcium ions by forming strong bonds with the calcium silicate hydrate gel network in addition compared with go modified cement and original cement the 3d rgo modified cement could somewhat reduce the disinfection by products formation and the microbial richness in drinking water thus the reinforcement of cement by 3d rgo could enhance the safety and durability of cml iron pipes in dwds graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords drinking water distribution system cement mortar lining three dimensional graphene water quality data availability no data was used for the research described in the article 1 introduction ductile iron pipe is one of the mainstream water supply pipes at present but the metal inner wall is susceptible to corrosion tang et al 2017 wąsowski et al 2019 due to the low price advantage and relatively good anti corrosion effect cement mortar lining cml is the most preferred lining type for ductile iron pipes parks et al 2012 however during use the cement mortar could dissolve after contact with water particularly under soft water conditions the dissolution of calcium hydroxide ch and decalcification of calcium silicate hydrate c s h gel may increase ph and total dissolved solids tds of the water douglas et al 1996b zielina et al 2015 in addition aluminum and heavy metals may also leach into water during the process berend and trouwborst 1999 guo et al 1998 wąsowski et al 2019 zielina et al 2014 in addition to water quality problems caused by cml constituent leaching pipe materials can directly affect the biofilm community structure of the pipe wall and the colonization of opportunistic pathogens which in turn affects the durability of the pipe and the safety of the water supply ren et al 2015 tang et al 2021b for application in drinking water distribution system dwds the effect of cement on water quality is significant for water safety leaching is one of the most significant factors affecting the durability of cement pastes moreover when used as cml in dwds corrosion induced leaching behavior would deteriorate water quality douglas et al 1996a the c s h gel network is one of the main hydration products of cement based materials and the dissolution effect dissolves the ch and decalcifies the c s h in the cml which may reduce its stability and service life graphene oxide go is a two dimensional carbon material with excellent properties tang et al 2021a zhang et al 2020 the surface of its lamellar layer contains hydroxyl epoxide carboxyl and carbonyl functional groups and the edges of which are rich in carbonyl and carboxyl groups mohammed et al 2015 previous research found that due to the special properties of go it could have high reactivity with cement and it can be easily dispersed in cement media shamsaei et al 2018 making it attractive for cement modification studies have shown that only a very small amount addition can greatly improve the mechanical properties and the resistance of cement to salt ion corrosion gong et al 2015 mohammed et al 2015 pan et al 2015 xu et al 2019 moreover the addition of go can reduce the water absorption of the cement and when go cement used as a pipe lining its low water absorption may lead to greater resistance to leaching thereby increasing the life of the lining mohammed et al 2015 compared to functionalized cnts for cement reinforcement go showed to have better reinforcing performance with more uniform dispersion and higher interfacial adhesion lu and zhong 2022 however the effect of graphene based materials on cement for application in drinking water area has not been focused yet using simple hydrothermal treatments the 2d go powders could be turned into three dimensional reduced go 3d rgo hydrogels through the self assembly of go sheets which restrains the agglomeration of the graphene sheets chen et al 2012 nardecchia et al 2013 without the agglomeration problem 3d rgo has larger specific surface area than 2d graphene bano et al 2020 a synergistic effect of 3d graphene and silica fume was found on the properties of hardened cement paste ying et al 2022 however prior research has mostly concentrated on using graphene based materials to improve the cement s mechanical and durability features shamsaei et al 2018 no research has been carried on using graphene based cements to transport drinking water therefore it is of great importance to investigate the safety and durability of cement modified by 3d rgo due to the large scale application of cml based drinking water pipes in this study both long term experimental study and theoretical study were used to evaluate the performance of cement modified by 3d rgo under the drinking water conditions long term 182 d leaching experiments were conducted to observe the leaching behaviors of cement constituents crystalline structure and pore distribution of modified cements were characterized by various instrumental methods and theoretical simulation based on molecular dynamics was used to explore the interaction between the 3d rgo and the cement constituents the effects of cement modification on disinfection by products dbps formation and microorganism composition in water influenced by the modified cement were also investigated 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials the go powder was purchased from xfnano china type 52 5 ordinary portland cement was obtained

were obtained from sinopharm chemical reagent company shanghai china methyl tert butyl ether mtbe was purchased from j k china 2 2 experimental design go and 3d rgo preparation go was prepared using natural graphite powder by a modified hummers method first 1 5 g go was dispersed in 300 ml deionized water and under an ultrasonic crushing for 30 min then it was put in an ultrasonic bath for another 12 h to form a uniform go solution fig s1 another identical go solution with the same disperse procedure was added in a teflon lined stainless steel autoclave then heated in an electric oven at 120 c for 12 h to synthesize 3d rgo hydrogel through hydrothermal reaction zhuang et al 2016 zhuang et al 2015 then the 3d rgo hydrogel was stirred into pieces followed by the same steps as for go solution preparation to form a uniform 3d rgo solution fig s2 the concentrations of go and 3d rgo hydrogel solution were 5 mg ml and 50 ml of both solutions were freeze dried for subsequent characterization cement paste preparation three kinds of cement samples were prepared pure cement pc paste was prepared by mixing 2700 g cement and 810 ml water go cement goc paste and 3d rgo cement 3d goc paste were prepared by mixing 2700 g cement 648 ml water 162 ml go solution and 162 ml 3d rgo hydrogel solution respectively the ratio of go and 3d rgo hydrogel was both 0 03 by weight of cement gong et al 2015 lv et al 2013 mohammed et al 2015 all the pastes were stirred for 10 min at first then each paste was cast into a 40 30 16 mm mold the molds were removed after 24 h and the specimens were immersed in saturated limewater at 20 c for 1 month murugan et al 2016 after one month of curing each kind of cement specimens were taken out 5 pieces for each and dried in an oven at 60 c for 2 d and the thoroughly dried samples were used for characterization reactor establishment and operation as shown in fig s3 the reactor was made of plexiglass each reactor contained 16 specimens all the specimens were coated with epoxy resin on 5 surfaces except the surface pointing to the center of the reactor the cement specimens were immersed in the reactor and the upper motor drove the stirring paddle to rotate test water used for cement constituent leaching was deionized water during a 24 hour operation the motor ran for 16 h providing a flow rate about 0 7 m s in the rest of the 8 h the reactor was under stagnation condition to simulate the actual dwds condition the experiment lasted for 182 days water samples were collected daily during the first 30 days and every two days during day 31 to day 90 then every four days until the end of the experiment water was discharged completely from the reactor after the sample was collected and fresh deionized water was fed into the reactor meanwhile each water sample was divided into two parts one part was analyzed immediately after taken from reactor for ph and tds effect of modified cements on dbps immersion

text s2 2 4 molecular dynamics md simulation the atomic model of c s h gel was generated based on the 11 å tobermorite crystalline structure merlino et al 1999 the c s h sample of md simulations was created via 8 3 7 replications of the single cell of 11 å tobermorite crystal the final c s h sample showed dimensions of around 51 73 22 32 81 86 å that is large enough for md tension study for the case of c s h graphene composites two types of md composite samples were generated based on the experimental study one type of md composite model was generated by graphene nanosheets that were individually inserted into the space gaps between silicon chains of bulk c s h named as c s h ug composite model the other type of md composite model was obtained by an aggregation of graphene nanosheets that was inserted into the bulk c s h named as c s h rg composite model periodic boundary conditions pbcs were imposed along the three x y and z directions to mimic infinite large systems allowing to eliminate the edge effects 3 results and discussion 3 1 characterization of go and 3d rgo the zeta potentials of go and 3d rgo were 29 5 mv and 8 75 mv respectively and the average particle sizes were 1782 nm and 4379 nm respectively table s2 the lower zeta potential of go was due to the presence of negatively charged oh and cooh groups whereas the zeta potential of 3d rgo increased due to a decrease in oxygen functional groups during self assemble in hydrothermal treatment mindivan 2016 the particle size distribution showed that both go and 3d rgo were uniformly dispersed in water and 3d rgo had a larger particle size due to the cross linking of go nanosheets from the xps spectrum of go in the c1s region three peaks at 284 8 286 8 and 288 1 ev were noticed which could be attributed to sp2 hybridized carbon c c epoxy hydroxyl carbon c o and carboxyl c o respectively fig s4 a cai et al 2015 wang et al 2016b compared with go the intensity of c o in 3d rgo decreased dramatically which indicated that go had been successfully reduced fig s4 b the ftir spectrum of go and 3d rgo are shown in fig s5 the absorption peaks of go were observed at 3412 cm 1 oh 1715 cm 1 c o 1620 cm 1 sp2 hybridized carbon of go 1396 cm 1 c oh 1058 cm 1 c o vibrations of alkoxy groups 835 cm 1 c h 3d rgo had only three adsorption peaks which were at 1739 cm 1 c o 1564 cm 1 graphitic carbon and 1194 cm 1 c o c the reduction of oxygen containing functional groups confirmed the reduction of go to rgo nundy et al 2021 surekha et al 2020 as shown by the afm images fig s6 the lateral dimensional sizes of both go and 3d rgo nanosheets were small which might be caused by ultrasonic fragmentation during the dispersion process zhang et al 2009 the average thickness of go was 0 69 nm and that of 3d rgo was 0 65 nm which was due to the reduction reaction that reduced the number of oxygen containing functional groups of 3d rgo matsumoto et al 2010 3 2 long term leaching behavior of cement modified by 3d rgo the calcium tds aluminum silicon and ph values in the reactor effluent for the three different cements are shown in fig 1 and fig s7 the values of all parameters gradually decreased over time and none of them reached a steady state at the end of the experiment this was due to the fact that the deionized water used for soaking was highly aggressive to the cement causing continuous leaching of the components from the cement in the first 60 days the effluent calcium content was pc goc 3d goc and after 80 days it was obviously goc pc 3d goc the effluent aluminum and silicon concentrations followed a similar pattern in the first 80 d and goc being much higher than pc and 3d goc after 80 d while pc and 3d goc were almost identical during the entire experiment 3d goc had the lowest effluent tds and ph among the three cements indicating that this cement released not only the least total substances but also the least alkaline chemicals the smaller the total amount of alkaline chemicals is released from the cement the longer the alkaline ph of the cement pore fluid can be maintained and the better the protection of the pipe wall the effluent tds values of pc and goc were close in the first 80 d with goc being slightly higher than pc at day 82 184 and the effluent ph values of pc and goc being close in the first 100 d with goc being slightly higher than pc after that among the three cements the effluent calcium concentration tds value and ph value of 3d goc were always the lowest while the effluent aluminum concentration and silicon concentration were basically the same as those of pc indicating that 3d goc possessed the best anti leaching properties and had the least influence on water quality fig 2 depicts the cumulative concentrations of effluent calcium aluminum and silicon throughout the experimental period compared with pc the cumulative effluent calcium concentration of goc increased by 3 2 and that of 3d goc reduced by 15 7 further demonstrating the excellent leaching resistance of 3d goc the cumulative effluent concentrations of aluminum and silicon of goc is slightly higher than those of the other two cements pc and 3d goc for the cumulative tds values of the whole experiment pc goc and 3d goc were 10 538 10 814 and 8542 mg l respectively with a minor rise of 2 6 for goc compared to pc and a drop of 18 9 for 3d goc compared to pc the cumulative ph values of the entire experiment were 520 25 522 06 and 516 43 for the three cements described above although the total values did not differ much the differences were still noticeable due to the small ph fluctuation range with goc having the highest total alkaline release and 3d goc having the lowest total alkaline release therefore the addition of 3d rgo could significantly reduce the release of calcium and alkaline substances thereby mitigating the impact of cement leaching on water quality while potentially extending the service life of the cml pipes 3 3 structural changes of cement modified by 3d rgo the graphene incorporation in cement could affect the cement hydration reactions fig s8 shows the dtg and tga patterns of the original and modified cement samples the dehydration of c s h and ettringite produced the peak near 100 c adamopoulou et al 2011 de weerdt et al 2019 the dehydration of ch produced the peak near 430 c hidalgo et al 2007 and the broad peak near 700 c was due to the decomposition of calcium carbonate to lose carbon dioxide ou et al 2010 based on the tga curves it could be obtained that the weight losses due to ch dehydration were 8 38 8 44 and 10 03 for the pc goc and 3d goc respectively which indicated that 3d rgo significantly increased the ch crystal content the crystal changes induced by the addition of go and 3d rgo were further analyzed by xrd fig s9 and the relative contents of different crystals in each sample were also calculated fig s10 the major crystals in all three cements are ch tricalcium silicate c3s and dicalcium silicate c2s which indicates the addition of go and 3d rgo did not lead to the formation of new crystal matters in the cements as for the diffraction peak intensity ch in the cement with the addition of 3d rgo had slightly enhanced diffraction peaks at 2θ 18 1 corresponding to 001 crystal plane and 2θ 34 1 corresponding to 101 crystal plane when compared to the pc the possible explanation is that the presence of oxygen functional groups on the surface of 3d rgo could serve as nucleation sites for ch resulting in faster crystal growth in the direction of the 001 and 101 crystal planes jing et al 2020 in addition 3d rgo reduced the content of c3s in cement indicating that 3d rgo promoted cement hydration to some extent kang et al 2019 the differential pore size distribution and pore volume distribution for the three cements are shown in fig 3 the most probable pore sizes of pc goc and 3d goc are 36 4 32 0 and 34 2 nm respectively which are within the range of capillary pores compared to pc the addition of 3d rgo did not significantly influence the gel pore volume but slightly reduced the capillary pore and macropore volumes however the addition of go increased the volume of gel pores 10 nm and decreased the volume of capillary holes 10 1000 nm compared to pc which is similar to the results found by murugan et al murugan et al 2016 in addition compared with pc and 3d goc the volume of macropores 1000 nm of goc increased by 25 83 and 40 18 respectively this may be related to the size distribution of go nanosheets after dispersion in water which is usually between a few hundred nanometers and several micrometers and their irregular shape might lead to an increased volume of large pores in the goc mohammed et al 2015 therefore the highest constituent release of goc might be attributed to its special pore size distribution 3 4 theoretical analysis on interaction between 3d rgo and cement the significant impact of reinforced concrete by graphene had been found in a previous study dimov et al 2018 the stress strain relation can distinguish the different mechanical properties of the pc goc and 3d goc fig 4 shows the simulated interaction zone of pc goc and 3d goc under tensile strain the stress of all the samples increased with the tensile strain increasing to 0 08 m m and subsequently reduced slowly in the post failure regime when tensile strain continued to increase fig 5 a 3d goc showed the highest stress 4 6 gpa in three samples which indicated 3d rgo could enhance the mechanical property of the cml calcium is one of the most important ions in c s h which is interspersed between the long chains of silica oxygen tetrahedra in the form of cao the dynamic properties of ca atoms in the samples were quantitatively evaluated by mean square displacement msd as shown in fig 5b msd parameter depicts the freedom of movement within a certain matrix which can be translated as a sign of cohesion between the said materials and the hosting matrix the msd of ca2 showed that the 3d rgo had obviously higher inhibition for the ca2 movement which was in accordance with the lowest ion leaching behavior of 3d goc within 182 d during the hydrothermal process for 3d rgo preparation the go dispersions are cross linked with each other through partial π π stacking and then self assemble to form porous 3d rgo xu et al 2015 during this process 3d rgo will generate more defects fang et al 2017 while the carboxyl groups hydroxyl groups or other groups readily occur on these defects thereby increasing local activity liu et al 2015 after being blended into cement the carboxyl groups in 3d rgo can combine with calcium ions in c s h to form ca hcoo 2 wang et al 2016a zhao et al 2018 which acts as a bridge to connect different 3d rgo fragments thereby making c s h gel and 3d rgo interpenetrate each other to form a double network structure at the same time the pore channels of the 3d rgo are gradually filled in as the cement hydration products grow along the pore wall in this process 3d rgo acting as a skeleton limits the unrestrained expansion of cement hydration products while also influencing their distribution ying et al 2022 through the above processes the addition of 3d rgo not only increased the strength of 3d goc but also made calcium ions more firmly fixed in the system improving the anti leaching resistance 3 5 effects of cement reinforcement by 3d rgo on drinking water quality effect of cement modification on representative dbps including thms haas and hans in drinking water were measured under different chlorine dosages as shown in fig s11 it can be found that under the same cl2 concentration the production of the three dbps did not differ greatly the total dbps generation amount increased with the cl2 concentration increment and the amount corresponding to 3d goc was slightly lower than those corresponding to pc and goc on the interface of graphene containing materials with metal o c linkage oh was found to be generated using o2 as electron donor zhuang et al 2019 moreover due to the confinement effect associated with the 3d graphene assembly the barrier of 3d rgo 1 10 ev was much smaller than that of the 2d graphene state 1 60 ev resulting in an increase of in the c o bond length and in the activity of the c atom to promote oh generation zhuang et al 2020 thus in the graphene c s h composite the ca o c linkage facilitated by the 3d rgo might generate more oh which could degrade the pre formed dbps on the interface of 3d goc the effects of dbps on human health should be evaluated not only by their concentration but also by their toxicity because the toxicity of different dbps varies greatly and some dbps are capable of producing high toxicity even at very low concentrations two commonly used indicators for assessing dbps toxicity are cytotoxicity and genotoxicity dbps cytotoxicity is defined as the product of unit cytotoxicity and dbps concentration in the sample and dbps genotoxicity is defined as the product of unit genotoxicity and dbps concentration in the sample ding et al 2013 yu et al 2021 fig s12 depicts the cytotoxicity and genotoxicity of immersion water of different cement samples after 24 h of immersion at various cl2 concentrations the generation of total dbps in each sample increased as the concentration of cl2 dosed increased resulting in an increase in cytotoxicity and genotoxicity at the same time furthermore it could be found that the cytotoxicity and genotoxicity corresponding to 3d goc are somewhat lower than those corresponding to the other two cement samples in addition to measuring dbps production after immersion of different cement samples three dimensional excitation emission matrix 3d eem fluorescence measurements were performed on the water after immersion fig s13 to characterize the type and concentration of dom chen et al 2003 left in the water after the chlorination reaction fig s14 with increasing cl2 concentration the amount of dom remaining as dbps precursors in the post reaction water reduced which corresponded to an increase in dbps production the relatively higher remaining dom concentrations in the post reaction water verified that 3d rgo modified cement could inhibit the formation of dbps and accordingly reduced the cytotoxicity and genotoxicity risks posed by dbps to consumers to further evaluate the effect of 3d rgo reinforced cement on drinking water safety the bacterial communities in waters corresponding to different cement samples were analyzed on genus level and those with a relative abundance of less than 1 of bacteria were classified as others fig s15 throughout all four samples nevskia was the most abundant the species composition of the four samples was represented by venn diagrams at the genus level fig s16 with 60 genera present in all four samples 62 endemic genera in sample blank 76 endemic genera in sample pc 22 endemic genera in sample goc and 14 endemic genera in sample 3d goc in terms of species richness sample pc had 227 genera and sample blank had 217 genera however samples goc and 3d goc had 145 and 121 genera respectively demonstrating that cement after goc and 3d goc modification could inhibit the growth of certain bacteria the alpha diversity analysis was carried out for four samples and the sobs index was calculated under phylum and genus levels fig s17 the indexes at both levels were pc blank goc 3d goc further proved that pure cement might promote microbial richness however goc and 3d goc could reduce microbial richness to a certain extent which might be helpful for reducing microbial risks graphene can perform antimicrobial activities through physical action both go and 3d rgo have lamellar structures with sharp edges which would pierce through the microbial cell membrane and causing intracellular substances to flow out eventually leading to cell death another mechanism of graphene antimicrobial activity is reactive oxygen species mediated oxidative stress zou et al 2016 in addition as discussed previously graphene modified cements may generate oh that disrupt cellular function and cause microbial death moreover the msd of ca2 showed that the 3d rgo had obviously higher inhibition for the ca2 movement which could reduce the release of calcium ions from cement into the water when calcium ions release into water they may become part of particles or deposits which are beneficial to the growth of microorganisms in dwds liu et al 2013 ma et al 2019 therefore the reduction of calcium release resulted from 3d rgo enforcement could also contribute to the reduction of microorganism risk in the dwds experiments on the effects of different kinds of cement samples on dbps production and on microbial communities were conducted for only one week and the graphene exposed on the cement surface could have an effect in direct contact with water when the delivered water is non aggressive or slightly aggressive a calcium carbonate precipitation layer will gradually form on the cement surface thus blocking the contact of graphene with water liu et al 2022 as an advanced material graphene oxide may have some biological toxicity a study has found that the safe critical concentration was 10 μg ml pang et al 2017 we can do the following calculation using small diameter pipe as an example to understand the possible concentration of graphene in water the inner diameter of dn100 cml pipe is about 90 mm the thickness of cml is about 6 mm the density of cml is about 2 3 g cm3 then there is 6 4 l of water and 1325 g of cml in each meter of cml pipe when the amount of graphene oxide added is 0 03 of the mass fraction of cement then there is 0 4 g of graphene oxide in one meter of cml pipe the service life of cml is generally up to several decades miller 1965 here assuming a lining failure time of 30 years the thickness reduction due to corrosion is 0 55 μm of cml per 24 h which contains 0 37 μg of graphene oxide and the concentration of graphene in water after leaching into water is 0 0058 μg ml which is extremely lower than the aforementioned 10 μg ml for pipes with larger diameter the graphene concentration could be even lower on the other hand the 3d rgo modified cml will have higher resistance to corrosion as shown in this study thus the leaching of graphene into water would be much less possible in addition to the biological toxicity the impact of graphene modified cml on global warming and energy consumption is of concern compared to conventional cml and life cycle assessment lca is an effective way to clarify these impacts for cement and graphene a cradle to gate evaluation approach is commonly employed arvidsson et al 2014 chen et al 2010 in cement production the global warming potential gwp is 0 8 kg co2 equivalent kg cement and the primary energy demand ped is 3 99 mj kg cement li et al 2015 long et al 2018 in graphene production under commercial scale the gwp is 0 46 kg co2 equivalent kg graphene and the ped is 1879 mj kg graphene cossutta et al 2017 pizza et al 2014 in this study the addition of graphene was 0 03 of the mass fraction of cement as a result the gwp and ped of graphene cement are 101 7 and 114 of those of pure cement respectively the addition of 0 01 go by weight of cement can increase the 28 d compressive strength of cement composites by about 20 30 lu and zhong 2022 which means that the amount of cement can be reduced while achieving the same strength assuming a 20 reduction in cement the reduction in gwp and ped is also sufficient to cover the increase caused by the addition of graphene 4 conclusions cement samples modified by go and 3d rgo were prepared and characterized in terms of gel network formation crystal composition and pore distribution long term 182 d dynamic immersion experiments in deionized water were conducted to observe the release behaviors of cement constituents during the long term leaching 3d rgo modified cement significantly reduced the calcium release whereas go modification significantly increased cement constituents release the characterization results showed that the addition of 3d rgo increased the ch crystallinity of the cement without significantly changing the pore structure whereas the addition of go significantly decreased the gel pore volume and increased the macropore and micropore volumes in the cement according to the md simulation the 3d rgo nanosheets increased the tensile strain of the cement and restricted the movement of calcium ions by building strong bonds with the c s h network in addition the 3d rgo modified cement could reduce the amount of dbps in drinking water and decrease the microbial diversity to some extent compared to pc and goc and the toxicity of leached graphene to human could be ignored in terms of environmental impact the reduction in cement usage due to

al 2020 but it is unclear whether or not the best gi solution obtained under a synthetic rainfall event will be similarly effective under long term continuous rainfall the objective of this paper is to expand the application of the simulation optimization approach to a large city scale urban drainage system utilizing high performance parallel computing and to evaluate the performance of optimal gi solutions obtained with design storms under a long term continuous scenario ostrich swmm a simulation optimization gi planning tool developed at the university at buffalo macro et al 2019 was used to find the optimal siting of rainwater harvesting cisterns for reducing cso volumes in the city of buffalo new york usa the hydrological model of buffalo has more than 6000 areal subcatchments of which 897 subcatchments can accommodate at least one cistern i e 897 decision variables in the optimization problem a one month historic rainfall data and various design storm scenarios with 2 10 50 and 100 year return periods and 2 6 12 and 24 h rainfall durations were chosen as forcing functions for the underlying simulation optimization models optimal solutions obtained with the design storm scenarios were compared with those obtained with the continuous rainfall scenario 2 methodology swmm was used for the rainfall runoff simulation process and pipe network hydraulics rossman 2010 and multi objective optimization was performed using the ostrich swmm macro et al 2019 the numbers and locations of cisterns to be installed in the 897 subcatchments were the decision variables and the two objectives were to minimize implementation cost and cso volumes details of the optimization problem are provided in the following sections 2 1 study area and urban hydrological model the city of buffalo has a combined sewer system that includes 1 271 km of sewer lines the swmm model for the city of buffalo was developed by arcadis on behalf of the buffalo sewer authority arcadis 2018 and includes 9 201 conduits 8 839 junctions 4 217 storages 8 pumps and 53 cso outfalls fig 1 the surface hydrology was delineated by 59 725 function based subcatchments distributed over 6 764 spatially distinct geographic areas using the modeling at the source technique ghodsi et al 2021 dynamic wave routing was used to track runoff and external inflows through the buffalo drainage system and the green ampt method was utilized for modeling infiltration the model was calibrated using data from multiple flow meters for the period between september 2016 and june 2017 arcadis 2018 2 1 1 targeted subcatchments and gi commercial buildings were found to be one of the main sources of runoff production during a typical year in buffalo ghodsi et al 2021 consequently this study focused on cso mitigation by reducing runoff from commercial rooftops using a single type of commonly available cistern 5 000 gallons with a height of 2 6 m an area of 7 3 m2 a drain coefficient of 50 8 mm h 2 inches h and a drain delay of 12 h abi aad et al 2010 a threshold of 2 000 m2 for targeting cistern placement was selected because a distributional analysis indicated that 2 000 m2 is representative of a typical large commercial rooftop in the city of buffalo out of 3 214 commercial rooftop subcatchments in the buffalo swmm model 897 are larger than 2 000 m2 thus were selected as target locations for cistern implementation rooftop subcatchments with an area greater than 2 000 m2 were assumed to represent multiple buildings a subcatchment with 10 000 m2 was assumed to consist of 5 separate buildings the optimization was configured to allow each building to have at most 1 cistern a 10 000 m2 subcatchment would be allowed to have at most 5 cisterns placed at that location 2 1 2 design storm and continuous scenarios buffalo rainfall intensity duration frequency idf curves were obtained from degaetano and castellano 2015 and used to develop two sets of design storm scenarios using the chicago method keifer and chu 1957 the first set of scenarios used a fixed 2 year return period and various storm durations 2 h 6 h 12 h and 24 h while the second set of scenarios used a fixed storm duration of 6 h and various return periods 2 year 10 year 50 year and 100 year the two sets of scenarios yielded a total of 7 design storm scenarios designated as s1 through s7 fig 2 in order to evaluate whether or not the choice of design storms or continuous rainfall would significantly impact the optimal locations of cisterns july 1993 was selected as a typical continuous rainfall scenario designated as scenario s8 illustrated in fig 3 15 min time interval rainfall data were obtained from the buffalo niagara international airport weather station network id ghcnd usw00014733 the year 1993 has been recognized by regulators as representative of typical rainfall patterns in the city of buffalo malcolm pirnie arcadis and buffalo sewer authority 2014 total precipitation of 78 mm in july 1993 is close to the average monthly precipitation of 86 mm in buffalo from 1941 to 2019 u s climate data 2018 this month also contains both small and large rainfall events including the largest event in 1993 with the maximal rainfall intensity of 19 3 mm h on july 27th fig 3 2 2 multi objective optimization formulation the swmm model was used in conjunction with a multi objective optimization algorithm to find the most cost effective siting of cisterns for reducing cso volumes multi objective optimization seeks to enumerate an optimal set of tradeoffs i e the pareto front between multiple competing objectives f x f1 x f2 x fn x where f represents a vector of n competing objectives f1 f2 fn fn represents the n th competing objective e g gi implementation cost or total predicted cso volume and x x1 x2 xn symbolize the decision variables e g design features like the number of cisterns at a given location the budget constrained nature of typical gi planning suggests multi objective optimization can be an attractive technique for assessing tradeoffs between gi installation costs and corresponding reductions in cso volume 2 2 1 objective functions and decision variables the optimization goal of this research was to find non dominated solutions nds for the two objectives of minimizing cistern installation costs and total cso volume the decision variables were the number of cisterns for each of the targeted commercial rooftop subcatchments the two objective functions are given in eqs 1 and 2 with constraints given in eq 3 1 m i n i m i z e f 1 c s o v o l u m e i 1 i n w i v c s o i 2 m i n i m i z e f 2 c o s t u n i t c o s t x 1 x m n c x 3 s u b j e c t t o 0 n c x u p p e r b o u n d x where x x 1 x m uppe rboun d x are a x 2000 m 2 where v c s o i represents the cso volume at the ith outfall n is the number of outfalls in the watershed n 53 in this study and w i is a coefficient that denotes the relative importance of the ith outfall these coefficients can be specified according to the importance priorities of different outfalls w i was set as 1 for all outfalls meaning all outfalls were treated with equal importance unit cost 2 750 was the economic cost of each cistern the decision variables n c x represent the number of cisterns in the xth targeted subcatchment and m 897 was the total number of targeted subcatchments the lower bound of n c x was set to zero and the upper bound the maximum number of cisterns for each subcatchment was calculated based on the area of the xth subcatchment divided by 2 000 m2 in total the maximum number of cisterns that can be applied to all subcatchments is 2 347 with a maximum cost of 6 5 million dollars 2 2 2 optimization algorithm the ndss for eqs 1 3 were enumerated using a parallelized version of the pareto archived dynamically dimensioned search algorithm parapadds parapadds utilizes distributed computing resources to accelerate the pareto archiving process employed by padds in which a conventional dynamically dimensioned search dds neighborhood search strategy is combined with an archiving step that catalogs any nds discovered during the search asadzadeh and tolson 2009 parapadds was configured using the perturbation parameter of 0 2 tolson and shoemaker 2007 and computational budget of 8 000 evaluations of the swmm model the estimated hyper volume contribution method was used as the selection metric for scoring nds asadzadeh and tolson 2009 the search was seeded with a set of candidate solutions that were randomly generated assuming a uniform distribution between the minimum and maximum values of each decision variable 400 and 200 processors were used during the multi objective search for continuous and design storm scenarios respectively since the design storm scenarios were not as computationally expensive as the continuous rainfall scenario 3 results and discussion numerical experiments with continuous and design storm scenarios s1 s8 were performed to address the cistern placement simulation optimization problem the numerical experiments produced a set of the pareto fronts representing tradeoffs between cistern installation cost and cso volume under different rainfall scenarios 3 1 pareto fronts each design storm scenario s1 s7 required a wall clock time of about 19 h to evaluate 8 000 candidate solutions using 200 processors while the equivalent serial i e single processor wall time was estimated as 5 months the one month continuous rainfall scenario s8 was the most computationally expensive numerical experiment the wall clock time was reduced from an estimated 33 months if running on a single processor to 60 h by utilizing 400 processors the pareto fronts for the design storm scenario optimization experiments are summarized in fig 4 table 1 compares two edge case solutions for each rainfall scenario a minimum cso volume solution vmin in which all possible 2 347 cisterns are installed and an original or no cost solution v0 in which no cisterns are installed with respect to the selected edge case solutions the relative cistern efficiency i e percent reduction in cso volume ranged from 8 for scenario s7 with 107 mm rainfall to 18 for scenario s1 with 31 mm of rainfall furthermore rainfall scenarios with a 2 year return period s1 s4 yielded an increasing trend of predicted cso volumes as rainfall duration increased although the absolute cistern performance mirrored this increasing trend see table 1 the relative performance reduction exhibited a decreasing trend see fig 4 and also the last column of table 1 examination of rainfall events with the same duration 6 h but various return periods s2 s5 s6 and s7 highlights a similar trend larger return periods are associated with reduced relative cistern efficiency the relative cistern performance degrades during storm events with a longer duration and larger return period since the impacts of cisterns reach the maximum once they are filled for extreme rainfall events like the design storms the relative cistern efficiency is a function of cistern storage volume relative to total rainfall volume 3 2 dominated and non dominated solutions all solutions enumerated by parapadds for the continuous rainfall scenario s8 are shown in fig 5 categorized into two groups dominated solution ds and non dominated solution nds for an nds neither of the objective functions can be improved without degrading the other objective function the pareto front contained 128 ndss that represented the best tradeoffs between cso volumes f1 in eq 1 and cost f2 in eq 2 based on the decision maker s preference or budget constraint any nds along the pareto front can be considered an optimal solution the cso volume associated with the tradeoff curve ranges from 0 86 to 1 03 million cubic meters mm3 corresponding to the installation of 2 374 and 0 cisterns respectively the installation of cisterns can reduce up to 0 17 mm3 cso volumes a 17 relative reduction and an average reduction of 72 m3 per cistern although all ndss are considered equivalent in multi objective optimization problems a distance based method can be a useful way to identify one specific solution on the tradeoff curve a selected solution for illustrating the performance of one of the optimal solutions this method aims at minimizing a function of the distance of ndss from the desired solution the desired solution target value can be defined as a set of goals the desired solution of this research was set as the minimum values of each objective function therefore the selected solution in fig 5 that balances cost and volume reduction was chosen based on the minimum normalized distances of the tradeoff curve from the desired solution f 1 m i n f 2 m i n this selected solution installed 884 cisterns to reduce total cso volume by 8 2 0 08 mm3 reduction at a cost of 2 4 million each cistern in the selected solution reduced cso volume by an average of 96 m3 by choosing a random placement of cisterns from dss managers might spend the same amount of money 2 4 million but reduce only 0 05 mm3 cso 0 034 mm3 less than the optimized selected solution on the other hand managers might spend 3 4 million 1 million more than the selected solution to reach the same cso volume reduction 0 08 mm3 reduction this highlights the significance of using optimization methods instead of scenario based approaches it should be mentioned that there may be worse solutions that were not included in the dss produced by the parapadds algorithm in that case there can be larger differences in cost and cso volume reduction between the ndss and other placement plans the hydrologic performance of cisterns is illustrated in fig 6 which shows the hydrographs of one cso outfall for the selected solution and the solutions with 0 and 2 347 cisterns the minimum and maximum scenarios respectively the hydrograph time series corresponds to july 7th 1993 from 15 30 to 24 00 which experienced 10 9 mm of rainfall in 2 h without cisterns the hydrologic model predicted 4 250 m3 of cso volume at the considered outfall the selected and maximum cistern solutions would reduce the cso volume to 3 145 m3 or 1 230 m3 respectively the peak flow was also predicted to decrease from 0 14 mm3 day million cubic meters per day for the no cistern scenario to 0 102 and 0 047 mm3 day for the selected and maximum cistern solutions respectively relative to the no cistern solution the selected solution reduced the predicted peak flow by 28 and delays the predicted time to peak flow by 15 min fig 7 shows the spatial distribution of cisterns from the 128 ndss for all 897 subcatchments under the scenario s8 the color indicates the median number of subcatchment cisterns divided by the maximum allowable number while the circle size indicates the size of the subcatchment one interpretation of this figure is that dark blue subcatchments would be promising locations for cisterns while light blue subcatchments would be less effective at cso volume reduction small size circles 4 000 m2 can accommodate only 1 or 2 cisterns so the normalized median metric may not be informative fig 8 illustrates the statistical distribution of cistern quantities from all nds for the 5 largest subcatchments in the largest subcatchment 1 in fig 7 up to 48 cisterns could be installed and yet among the nds the median number of cisterns installed at this location was 2 this suggests that subcatchment 1 despite its size is not a location that is ideal for installing cisterns to mitigate csos with respect to cistern placement results suggest that subcatchment 2 is also not in a location that can effectively leverage its larger area conversely the more consistent widths associated with the violin plots widths of a violin plot represent frequencies for subcatchments 3 5 suggest that these subcatchments are located at more favorable locations as shown in fig 7 subcatchments 1 and 2 are very close to outfalls while subcatchments 3 4 and 5 are located farther away from the outfalls results suggested that the distance between subcatchments and the cso outfall within the cso watershed could be an important metric for prioritizing cistern placement but more research is needed 3 3 robustness of optimal solutions from design storm scenarios numerical experiments were performed to assess the robustness of the ndss obtained from the design storm scenarios to verify whether or not the ndss from the synthetic storm scenarios s1 s7 would still be effective under the continuous rainfall scenario s8 in total 658 ndss obtained from each synthetic storm scenario were evaluated in the continuous rainfall scenario s8 these additional simulations were arranged into seven groupings r1 through r7 where r1 corresponds to the use of nds associated with scenario s1 but run using continuous rainfall data and so on results are provided in fig 9 a r1 r4 and fig 9b r5 r7 along with a solid line representing the ndss of the continuous rainfall scenario s8 in particular the r1 r7 solutions that are located within the middle region of the tradeoff curve are a significant distance from the pareto front this suggests that stakeholders who prefer a middle budget tradeoff between cost and cso reduction for the july scenario should be careful with relying on solutions derived from the synthetic storm scenarios conversely the r1 r7 solutions that are located toward the extremes of the tradeoff curve low and high budgets appear to be much closer to the pareto front since the necessity to optimize at the extremes is minimal in the middle region there are more possible solutions and more variation is expected so the selection of design rainfall scenario is more important in the middle region 4 conclusion with the capability of utilizing high performance parallel computing ostrich swmm was successfully applied for optimizing the siting of cisterns in a large city scale urban drainage system under design storms and a one month continuous scenario by evaluating the performance of the optimal gi solutions obtained with design storms under a one month continuous scenario results indicated that optimal gi plans derived from design storm scenarios as is the most usual in previous research may not perform very well under continuous rainfall scenarios differences were found to be particularly significant in the middle region of the trade off curve where there are more possible solutions and more variation is expected also the differences were random among design storms no specific design storm duration or return period was found to be the closest to the on month continuous scenario this study suggested that rainfall scenarios should be carefully considered when performing simulation based optimization for gi planning the one month continuous scenario might not represent a longer rainfall time series such as one year rainfall more research is needed to understand differences and patterns as the duration of continuous rainfall increases although this work considered only one type of gi cisterns and two objectives economic cost and cso volume reduction ostrich swmm can be configured to consider multiple gi features and more objectives such as improved air and water quality reduction of heat islands increased urban biodiversity and other ecosystem services future work can also focus on developing strategies for prioritizing subcatchments as targets for cistern installation such prioritization is expected to further improve the performance of multi objective optimization when applied to a complex combined sewer system containing an interconnected network of thousands of subcatchments conduits and storage components

inches h and a drain delay of 12 h abi aad et al 2010 a threshold of 2 000 m2 for targeting cistern placement was selected because a distributional analysis indicated that 2 000 m2 is representative of a typical large commercial rooftop in the city of buffalo out of 3 214 commercial rooftop subcatchments in the buffalo swmm model 897 are larger than 2 000 m2 thus were selected as target locations for cistern implementation rooftop subcatchments with an area greater than 2 000 m2 were assumed to represent multiple buildings a subcatchment with 10 000 m2 was assumed to consist of 5 separate buildings the optimization was configured to allow each building to have at most 1 cistern a 10 000 m2 subcatchment would be allowed to have at most 5 cisterns placed at that location 2 1 2 design storm and continuous scenarios buffalo rainfall intensity duration frequency idf curves were obtained from degaetano and castellano 2015 and used to develop two sets of design storm scenarios using the chicago method keifer and chu 1957 the first set of scenarios used a fixed 2 year return period and various storm durations 2 h 6 h 12 h and 24 h while the second set of scenarios used a fixed storm duration of 6 h and various return periods 2 year 10 year 50 year and 100 year the two sets of scenarios yielded a total of 7 design storm scenarios designated as s1 through s7 fig 2 in order to evaluate whether or not the choice of design storms or continuous rainfall would significantly impact the optimal locations of cisterns july 1993 was selected as a typical continuous rainfall scenario designated as scenario s8 illustrated in fig 3 15 min time interval rainfall data were obtained from the buffalo niagara international airport weather station network id ghcnd usw00014733 the year 1993 has been recognized by regulators as representative of typical rainfall patterns in the city of buffalo malcolm pirnie arcadis and buffalo sewer authority 2014 total precipitation of 78 mm in july 1993 is close to the average monthly precipitation of 86 mm in buffalo from 1941 to 2019 u s climate data 2018 this month also contains both small and large rainfall events including the largest event in 1993 with the maximal rainfall intensity of 19 3 mm h on july 27th fig 3 2 2 multi objective optimization formulation the swmm model was used in conjunction with a multi objective optimization algorithm to find the most cost effective siting of cisterns for reducing cso volumes multi objective optimization seeks to enumerate an optimal set of tradeoffs i e the pareto front between multiple competing objectives f x f1 x f2 x fn x where f represents a vector of n competing objectives f1 f2 fn fn represents the n th competing objective e g gi implementation cost or total predicted cso volume and x x1 x2 xn symbolize the decision variables e g design features like the number of cisterns at a given location the budget constrained nature of typical gi planning suggests multi objective optimization can be an attractive technique for assessing tradeoffs between gi installation costs and corresponding reductions in cso volume 2 2 1 objective functions and decision variables the optimization goal of this research was to find non dominated solutions nds for the two objectives of minimizing cistern installation costs and total cso volume the decision variables were the number of cisterns for each of the targeted commercial rooftop subcatchments the two objective functions are given in eqs 1 and 2 with constraints given in eq 3 1 m i n i m i z e f 1 c s o v o l u m e i 1 i n w i v c s o i 2 m i n i m i z e f 2 c o s t u n i t c o s t x 1 x m n c x 3 s u b j e c t t o 0 n c x u p p e r b o u n d x where x x 1 x m uppe rboun d x are a x 2000 m 2 where v c s o i represents the cso volume at the ith outfall n is the number of outfalls in the watershed n 53 in this study and w i is a coefficient that denotes the relative importance of the ith outfall these coefficients can be specified according to the importance priorities of different outfalls w i was set as 1 for all outfalls meaning all outfalls were treated with equal importance unit cost 2 750 was the economic cost of each cistern the decision variables n c x represent the number of cisterns in the xth targeted subcatchment and m 897 was the total number of targeted subcatchments the lower bound of n c x was set to zero and the upper bound the maximum number of cisterns for each subcatchment was calculated based on the area of the xth subcatchment divided by 2 000 m2 in total the maximum number of cisterns that can be applied to all subcatchments is 2 347 with a maximum cost of 6 5 million dollars 2 2 2 optimization algorithm the ndss for eqs 1 3 were enumerated using a parallelized version of the pareto archived dynamically dimensioned search algorithm parapadds parapadds utilizes distributed computing resources to accelerate the pareto archiving process employed by padds in which a conventional dynamically dimensioned search dds neighborhood search strategy is combined with an archiving step that catalogs any nds discovered during the search asadzadeh and tolson 2009 parapadds was configured using the perturbation parameter of 0 2 tolson and shoemaker 2007 and computational budget of 8 000 evaluations of the swmm model the estimated hyper volume contribution method was used as the selection metric for scoring nds asadzadeh and tolson 2009 the search was seeded with a set of candidate solutions that were randomly generated assuming a uniform distribution between the minimum and maximum values of each decision variable 400 and 200 processors were used during the multi objective search for continuous and design storm scenarios respectively since the design storm scenarios were not as computationally expensive as the continuous rainfall scenario 3 results and discussion numerical experiments with continuous and design storm scenarios s1 s8 were performed to address the cistern placement simulation optimization problem the numerical experiments produced a set of the pareto fronts representing tradeoffs between cistern installation cost and cso volume under different rainfall scenarios 3 1 pareto fronts each design storm scenario s1 s7 required a wall clock time of about 19 h to evaluate 8 000 candidate solutions using 200 processors while the equivalent serial i e single processor wall time was estimated as 5 months the one month continuous rainfall scenario s8 was the most computationally expensive numerical experiment the wall clock time was reduced from an estimated 33 months if running on a single processor to 60 h by utilizing 400 processors the pareto fronts for the design storm scenario optimization experiments are summarized in fig 4 table 1 compares two edge case solutions for each rainfall scenario a minimum cso volume solution vmin in which all possible 2 347 cisterns are installed and an original or no cost solution v0 in which no cisterns are installed with respect to the selected edge case solutions the relative cistern efficiency i e percent reduction in cso volume ranged from 8 for scenario s7 with 107 mm rainfall to 18 for scenario s1 with 31 mm of rainfall furthermore rainfall scenarios with a 2 year return period s1 s4 yielded an increasing trend of predicted cso volumes as rainfall duration increased although the absolute cistern performance mirrored this increasing trend see table 1 the relative performance reduction exhibited a decreasing trend see fig 4 and also the last column of table 1 examination of rainfall events with the same duration 6 h but various return periods s2 s5 s6 and s7 highlights a similar trend larger return periods are associated with reduced relative cistern efficiency the relative cistern performance degrades during storm events with a longer duration and larger return period since the impacts of cisterns reach the maximum once they are filled for extreme rainfall events like the design storms the relative cistern efficiency is a function of cistern storage volume relative to total rainfall volume 3 2 dominated and non dominated solutions all solutions enumerated by parapadds for the continuous rainfall scenario s8 are shown in fig 5 categorized into two groups dominated solution ds and non dominated solution nds for an nds neither of the objective functions can be improved without degrading the other objective function the pareto front contained 128 ndss that represented the best tradeoffs between cso volumes f1 in eq 1 and cost f2 in eq 2 based on the decision maker s preference or budget constraint any nds along the pareto front can be considered an optimal solution the cso volume associated with the tradeoff curve ranges from 0 86 to 1 03 million cubic meters mm3 corresponding to the installation of 2 374 and 0 cisterns respectively the installation of cisterns can reduce up to 0 17 mm3 cso volumes a 17 relative reduction and an average reduction of 72 m3 per cistern although all ndss are considered equivalent in multi objective optimization problems a distance based method can be a useful way to identify one specific solution on the tradeoff curve a selected solution for illustrating the performance of one of the optimal solutions this method aims at minimizing a function of the distance of ndss from the desired solution the desired solution target value can be defined as a set of goals the desired solution of this research was set as the minimum values of each objective function therefore the selected solution in fig 5 that balances cost and volume reduction was chosen based on the minimum normalized distances of the tradeoff curve from the desired solution f 1 m i n f 2 m i n this selected solution installed 884 cisterns to reduce total cso volume by 8 2 0 08 mm3 reduction at a cost of 2 4 million each cistern in the selected solution reduced cso volume by an average of 96 m3 by choosing a random placement of cisterns from dss managers might spend the same amount of money 2 4 million but reduce only 0 05 mm3 cso 0 034 mm3 less than the optimized selected solution on the other hand managers might spend 3 4 million 1 million more than the selected solution to reach the same cso volume reduction 0 08 mm3 reduction this highlights the significance of using optimization methods instead of scenario based approaches it should be mentioned that there may be worse solutions that were not included in the dss produced by the parapadds algorithm in that case there can be larger differences in cost and cso volume reduction between the ndss and other placement plans the hydrologic performance of cisterns is illustrated in fig 6 which shows the hydrographs of one cso outfall for the selected solution and the solutions with 0 and 2 347 cisterns the minimum and maximum scenarios respectively the hydrograph time series corresponds to july 7th 1993 from 15 30 to 24 00 which experienced 10 9 mm of rainfall in 2 h without cisterns the hydrologic model predicted 4 250 m3 of cso volume at the considered outfall the selected and maximum cistern solutions would reduce the cso volume to 3 145 m3 or 1 230 m3 respectively the peak flow was also predicted to decrease from 0 14 mm3 day million cubic meters per day for the no cistern scenario to 0 102 and 0 047 mm3 day for the selected and maximum cistern solutions respectively relative to the no cistern solution the selected solution reduced the predicted peak flow by 28 and delays the predicted time to peak flow by 15 min fig 7 shows the spatial distribution of cisterns from the 128 ndss for all 897 subcatchments under the scenario s8 the color indicates the median number of subcatchment cisterns divided by the maximum allowable number while the circle size indicates the size of the subcatchment one interpretation of this figure is that dark blue subcatchments would be promising locations for cisterns while light blue subcatchments would be less effective at cso volume reduction small size circles 4 000 m2 can accommodate only 1 or 2 cisterns so the normalized median metric may not be informative fig 8 illustrates the statistical distribution of cistern quantities from all nds for the 5 largest subcatchments in the largest subcatchment 1 in fig 7 up to 48 cisterns could be installed and yet among the nds the median number of cisterns installed at this location was 2 this suggests that subcatchment 1 despite its size is not a location that is ideal for installing cisterns to mitigate csos with respect to cistern placement results suggest that subcatchment 2 is also not in a location that can effectively leverage its larger area conversely the more consistent widths associated with the violin plots widths of a violin plot represent frequencies for subcatchments 3 5 suggest that these subcatchments are located at more favorable locations as shown in fig 7 subcatchments 1 and 2 are very close to outfalls while subcatchments 3 4 and 5 are located farther away from the outfalls results suggested that the distance between subcatchments and the cso outfall within the cso watershed could be an important metric for prioritizing cistern placement but more research is needed 3 3 robustness of optimal solutions from design storm scenarios numerical experiments were performed to assess the robustness of the ndss obtained from the design storm scenarios to verify whether or not the ndss from the synthetic storm scenarios s1 s7 would still be effective under the continuous rainfall scenario s8 in total 658 ndss obtained from each synthetic storm scenario were evaluated in the continuous rainfall scenario s8 these additional simulations were arranged into seven groupings r1 through r7 where r1 corresponds to the use of nds associated with scenario s1 but run using continuous rainfall data and so on results are provided in fig 9 a r1 r4 and fig 9b r5 r7 along with a solid line representing the ndss of the continuous rainfall scenario s8 in particular the r1 r7 solutions that are located within the middle region of the tradeoff curve are a significant distance from the pareto front this suggests that stakeholders who prefer a middle budget tradeoff between cost and cso reduction for the july scenario should be careful with relying on solutions derived from the synthetic storm scenarios conversely the r1 r7 solutions that are located toward the extremes of the tradeoff curve low and high budgets appear to be much closer to the pareto front since the necessity to optimize at the extremes is minimal in the middle region there are more possible solutions and more variation is expected so the selection of design rainfall scenario is more important in the middle region 4 conclusion with the capability of utilizing high performance parallel computing ostrich swmm was successfully applied for optimizing the siting of cisterns in a large city scale urban drainage system under design storms and a one month continuous scenario by evaluating the performance of the optimal gi solutions obtained with design storms under a one month continuous scenario results indicated that optimal gi plans derived from design storm scenarios as is the most usual in previous research may not perform very well under continuous rainfall scenarios differences were found to be particularly significant in the middle region of the trade off curve where there are more possible solutions and more variation is expected also the differences were random among design storms no specific design storm duration or return period was found to be the closest to the on month continuous scenario this study suggested that rainfall scenarios should be carefully considered when performing simulation based optimization for gi planning the one month continuous scenario might not represent a longer rainfall time series such as one year rainfall more research is needed to understand differences and patterns as the duration of continuous rainfall increases although this work considered only one type of gi cisterns and two objectives economic cost and cso volume reduction ostrich swmm can be configured to consider multiple gi features and more objectives such as improved air and water quality reduction of heat islands increased urban biodiversity and other ecosystem services future work can also focus on developing strategies for prioritizing subcatchments as targets for cistern installation such prioritization is expected to further improve the performance of multi objective optimization when applied to a complex combined sewer system containing an interconnected network of thousands of subcatchments conduits and storage components

15172,mine waste mw in historical mercury hg mining areas continuously emits hg into local environment including aquatic ecosystems tracing hg migration process from mw and determining its relative contribution to hg pollution is critical for understanding the environmental impact of mw remediation in this study we combined data of hg concentration speciation and isotope to address this issue in the wanshan hg mining area in southwest china we found that rainfall can elevate hg concentrations in river water and control the partitioning and transport of hg in karst fissure zones through changing the hydrological conditions a consistently large offset of δ202hg 1 24 was observed between dissolved hg dhg and particulate hg phg in surface water during the low flow period lfp which may have been related to the relatively stable hydrologic conditions and unique geological background karst fissure zones of the karst region kr results from the ternary hg isotopic mixing model showed that despite an order of magnitude reduction in hg concentration and flux in river water after remediation the remediated mw is still a significant source of hg pollution to local aquatic ecosystems accounting for 49 3 11 9 and 37 8 11 8 of river dhg in high flow period hfp and lfp respectively this study provides new insights into hg migration and transportation in aquatic ecosystem and pollution source apportionment in hg polluted area which can be used for making polices for future remediation actions graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords mercury mine waste remediation rainfall mercury isotope karst area data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction mercury hg is a toxic pollutant and is listed as a priority pollutant by many international agencies jiang et al 2006 kwon et al 2020 mining activities such as gold and hg mining have increased the hg concentration by three fold in surface water compared to pre anthropogenic condition amos et al 2013 lamborg et al 2014 streets et al 2011 the wanshan hg mine wmm which is known as the capital of hg is located in a karst region kr in southwest china although hg mining activities were banned in 2001 long term mining activities have caused severe hg pollution in local ecosystems feng et al 2008 horvat et al 2003 li et al 2008 qiu et al 2013 kim et al 2016 xia et al 2020 mine waste mw is the product of high temperature ore roasting and it contains large amounts of secondary soluble hg the total mercury thg and methylmercury mehg levels in the surface water flowing through the mw were significantly elevated compared to that of the background area zhang et al 2010a 2010b in addition the kr of southwest china is one of the largest karst geomorphologic distributing areas in the world huang et al 2008 kr showed high hg background and unique aquifers plays a unique role in the global hg biogeochemical cycle xia et al 2022 erosion is a major factor in watersheds with significant mw storage during rainfall runoff events especially stormwater this process can lead to serious hg emission and diffusion increasing the environmental risks to local aquatic ecosystems guedron et al 2011 rose et al 2012 zheng et al 2016 in the kr large inter annual variations and differences between pre and after rainfall events in hg emissions have created a regime of hydrologic extremities however the role of rainfall in the release of hg from mw and subsequent transfer to aquatic systems remains unclear the action plan for soil pollution prevention and control was implemented in china in 2016 typical restoration measures such as capping with sand or clay were implemented in this area and these methods were considered as economical and effective remediation approaches to control pollution in aquatic ecosystems however sand and clay have a relatively weak affinity for hg and cannot prevent hg migration through the cap via the pore water pathway eckley et al 2020 furthermore enhanced flux of hg to surface water has been demonstrated by mesocosm experiments because of the low organic carbon content of sand caps curtis et al 2019 evaluating the effects of restoration treatments requires quantification of hg emission flux to downstream water bodies which is a challenging but crucial for projecting future changes at hg contaminated sites because of the difficulties in determining the water flow through mw traditional methods cannot be used to calculate hg emission flux from mw based on surface water hg concentration stable hg isotopes are represented by a three dimensional system that may not be affected by uncertain factors such as the hg concentration and stream discharge the unique hg isotopic composition of various reservoirs in hg mining areas could be used to effectively tracing the migration pathways and sources of hg in fluvial systems blum et al 2014 delphine et al 2009 yin et al 2010a because of extremely low concentration of hg in surface water hg in water must be extracted and pre concentrated for hg isotopic analysis mass dependent fractionation mdf occurs in almost all environmental processes such as adsorption and desorption jiskra et al 2012 diffusion koster van groos et al 2014 evaporation zheng et al 2019 microbial methylation and demethylation janssen et al 2016 kritee et al 2009 and hg uptake by plants yin et al 2013a yuan et al 2019 mass independent fractionation mif is caused by the magnetic isotope effect and nuclear volume effect bergquist and blum 2007 estrade et al 2009 and mie in photochemical reactions are the main reasons for global mif biswas et al 2008 buchachenko 2001 carignan et al 2009 chen et al 2012 sonke 2011 sun et al 2014 zheng et al 2007 to utilize hg isotopes as a tracer for hg cycling and pollution sources the fractionation factors for important biogeochemical processes must be determined smith et al 2015 prior studies have demonstrated that mdf may occur during transformation of cinnabar to by products due to the roasting process because calcines 0 08 0 20 were enriched by 0 8 in δ202hg values compared to the unroasted hg ores 0 74 0 11 in the wmm yin et al 2013b delphine et al 2009 found that the hg isotopic composition of cinnabar was similar to that of the river sediment and presumed that the sediments throughout the watershed of the isonzo river to the gulf of trieste were seriously impacted by hg export from the idrija hg mine previous studies mainly focused on smelter affected sediments or agricultural regains feng et al 2010 lepak et al 2020 song et al 2021 washburn et al 2017 and identified hg pollution sources however the migration process and transport mechanism of hg from pollution sources to fluvial systems remain to be unclear the objectives of this study were to 1 assess the hg flux from remediated mws and evaluate the remediation effect 2 clarify the role of rainfall in hg release from the mw and 3 quantify the contribution of hg emission from the mw using the hg stable isotope approach findings from this study are expected to reveal the role of the mws in the regional hg cycle and provide scientific basis and data support for the formulation of remediation policies for hg contaminated solid waste 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the wanshan hg mine is located in wanshan county of guizhou province within the karst landscape of the yunnan guizhou plateau fig 1 a and b the study area has a sub tropical climate with humid condition and an annual precipitation of 1110 1410 mm in this study a typical remediated mw pile named meizixi mzx was chosen because it is located in a typical karst area and its headwaters were stacked with remediation mw fig 1c it is situated upstream of and connects to several small and shallow streams with numerous downstream tributaries its aquifers are characterized with high spatial heterogeneity and complex subterranean conduit networks 2 2 sample collection to effectively evaluate the contributions of hg emission from mw to mzx we focused on the upstream source of this river and a reach of it within a 2 km radius water samples were collected from the river near mw pile natural springs and precipitation during normal flow periods nfps october 2020 low flow periods lfps december 2020 and high flow periods hfp july 2021 in the hfp surface water samples were collected at the same point before and after the rainfall event before sampling three ultrapure water samples were prepared in the laboratory as field blanks within a vertical mw profile a thin steel rod was driven horizontally into the profile to avoid obstacles and provide a clear pilot channel for a 10 cm porous polymer tube eijkelkamp agrisearch equipment netherlands the solution was left for two weeks to equilibrate with the soil and 10 ml of pore water was extracted using a vacuum tube moreno jimenez et al 2011 all water samples were collected in duplicate unfiltered river water samples were collected for thg and total methylmercury tmehg analyses the surface water samples were filtered in situ using a 0 45 μm polyvinylidene fluoride filter millipore for dissolved hg dhg and dissolved methyl hg dmehg analyses the water samples were stored in 200 ml borosilicate bottles which were decontaminated using acidic solution followed by rinsing with deionized water and incineration for 1 5 h in a muffle furnace at 480 c after filtration the water samples were acidified with ultra pure hydrochloric acid sealed packaged in double layer bags returned to the laboratory and stored in a refrigerator at 4 c at each sampling site 1 l of water was collected and filtered using a teflon filter membrane to determine the total suspended solids tss the tss value was used to calculate the distribution coefficients log kd using the dhg concentration of the filtered surface water and suspended material following the method described by james et al 1998 the water flow q was measured by cup type current meter ls45a the basic physical and chemical parameters of the surface water were measured in situ during the sampling process water temperature wt ph electrical conductivity ec 25 c and dissolved oxygen do were measured using a portable ponsel odeon meter which was calibrated prior to deployment using ph 4 7 and 10 ec 1412 μs cm and do 0 and 100 standards the measurement accuracies of the device for the ph wt do and ec were 0 01 0 01 c 1 and 0 01 μs cm respectively 2 3 sample preparation for hg isotope analysis filtered surface water and suspended particle samples for hg isotope analysis were collected during lfp and hfp to ensure the minimum hg concentration required for the hg isotope analysis each filtered surface water sample was pre enriched based on the method established by li et al 2019 approximately 2 5 l water samples were used to determine the hg isotopes the samples were acidified successively using 0 5 v v ultrapure hydrochloric acid in the field and then transported back to the laboratory for cold storage before enrichment a 0 5 brcl solution was added for oxidation for at least 48 h the oxidized water samples were transferred to a bubble bottle a small amount of nh2oh hcl solution was added to remove excess brcl then a 0 5 sncl2 solution was added to reduce hg2 to hg0 which was purged with 2 5 l min of zero hg gas for 1 h and the evaporated hg was pre concentrated into a chlorinated activated carbon tube the hg captured by chlorinated activated carbon was removed by the pyrolysis device and absorbed into 5 ml of 40 anti aqua regia v v hno3 hcl 2 1 the solutions were stored in a refrigerator at 4 c away from light before hg isotope analysis li et al 2019 for phg a high temperature purified teflon membrane was used to filter an appropriate amount of water 2 5 l and the filter membranes were freeze dried and digested at high temperature using a tubular muffle furnace to extract hg into a 5 ml of a 40 anti aqua regia absorption liquid fu et al 2013 2 4 hg concentration and hg isotope analysis the operationally defined fractions of thg phg and dhg in the surface water samples were determined using a dual stage au amalgamation method and cold vapor atomic fluorescence spectrophotometer cvafs dhg and thg were determined following brcl oxidation for 24 h and then reduced to hg0 using acidic sncl2 phg was obtained by subtracting dhg from thg the tmehg and dmehg concentrations were determined by distillation ethylation gc separation and cvafs guo et al 2008 jiang et al 2004 the isotopic composition of hg was analyzed using mc icpms nu instruments uk the measurement procedures were described in detail by yin et al 2010b thallium internal corrections external standards and sample bracketing method were used to obtain precise and accurate measurements an internal tl standard nist 997 was introduced to correct instrumental mass bias strict sample standard bracketing with a solution of nist 3133 that was matched in terms of the concentration and solution matrix was used for mass bias correction mdf was expressed in delta notation δ relative to nist 3133 and it was calculated using eq 1 1 δ x x x h g s a m p l e x x x 198 h g s a m p l e x x x 198 h g n i s t 3133 1 1000 where xxx represents 199 200 201 202 or 204 mif is reported as the deviation from the

random number generation was performed in rstudio windows and then the monte carlo simulation method n 10 000 was used to estimate the relative contributions of the three end members the uncertainties in the triple mixing model were also estimated using the monte carlo simulation approach 2 5 quality control the quality assurance and quality control of the hg analysis were assessed using blanks blind duplicates and matrix spikes the recoveries for the matrix spikes averaged at 101 4 for thg and 81 16 for mehg the relative standard deviation was 8 for the hg concentration analysis the recovery rates of the enrichment test of the water samples ranged from 95 to 110 the results of the um almadén standard solution δ202hg 0 59 0 06 δ199hg 0 03 0 04 δ201hg 0 01 0 05 2σ n 8 and gss 4

data were analyzed using spss 26 0 and origin 2018 software the characteristics of thg and other hg forms in the water samples were reported as the mean standard deviation sd and examined using descriptive statistics a nonparametric test was used to compare the differences between different data groups correlation and difference tests were considered to be statistically significant at p 0 05 3 results and discussion 3 1 temporal variation of water hg and hg emission flux thg and dhg concentrations during the hfp 32 6 16 3 ng l and 23 6 12 2 ng l respectively were significantly higher than those during the lfp 14 8 9 8 ng l and 7 4 4 1 ng l respectively p 0 05 whereas phg concentrations were not significantly different between these two periods 9 0 6 4 versus 7 8 8 8 ng l p 0 05 fig s1 and table s1 the concentrations of tmehg in hfp were slightly higher than those in the other two periods anova p 0 05 the average tmehg concentrations are given in the section s2 both water discharge and hydrodynamic conditions governed hg concentration in the hfp stronger hydrodynamic conditions higher flows and enhanced erosion led to hg transport from the mw into the river resulting in significantly higher thg and dhg concentrations compared with the case of lfp meanwhile a significant dilution effect on phg was observed during the hfp in contrast relatively weak hydrodynamic conditions might have resulted in the deposition of phg at the riverbed rainfall has a combined effect of erosion and leaching on the mw thus leading to hg dissolution in mw and then releasing into rivers gray et al 2003 kim et al 2000 the solidified mw pile is more stable and leaching effect is dominated compared with erosion so dhg was the dominant form compared with phg however no significant seasonal differences in phg were observed the highest thg dhg and phg concentrations were observed near the mw pile during the hfp indicating that mw is an important source of hg to downstream regions due to erosion and leaching during rainfall note that mw pile at mzx was sprayed with a passivator and covered with soil in 2013 and then vegetation was planted above the pile besides the surrounding river channel was also dredged to evaluate the effectiveness of these restoration actions we compared our data collected in 2020 2021 with those reported before 2013 qiu et al 2005 zhang et al 2010a 2010b only data from sampling locations close to the mw pile within 1 5 km were selected for accurate comparison fig 2 because the historical flow of this stretch of the river could not be determined the arithmetic averages of hg concentration were used for comparison most dhg and phg concentrations observed in the present study were lower than level ⅰ of the national standard for surface water 50 ng l except at some points near mw during hfp thg and dhg concentrations during nfp 20 7 14 8 ng l and 7 25 4 30 ng l respectively and thg and phg concentrations during hfp were significantly lower in 2020 than 2002 p 0 05 overall decreasing trends from 2008 to 2020 were observed in the different forms of hg thg dhg and phg despite of insignificant differences between the two years fig 2 the maximum thg concentration 69 ng l near the mw observed in this study was reduced by an order of magnitude compared to that observed at the mzx river in 2011 316 ng l dai 2011 the average water flows of the mzx river at the mw cross section were 0 119 m3 s 0 075 m3 s and 0 187 m3 s and the corresponding hg fluxes were 32 9 23 6 g y 5 7 3 5 g y and 47 4 23 8 g y during the nfp lfp and hfp respectively the calculation methods are shown in section s1 1 therefore the thg emission flux from the mzx pile to the river was estimated be 109 7 50 9 g y compared with the hg flux calculated by dai 2011 for this section of the river 1480 g y the hg flux in this study also decreased by an order of magnitude the above results illustrate the significant effect of the remediation arrangement however thg concentration in this study was still slightly higher than the background surface water values indicating mw piles being still a major source of hg pollution in local aquatic ecosystems in hg mining areas yan et al 2019 mw contains large amounts of secondary compounds of hg produced under high temperature conditions which are released continuously to the surrounding environment by rainfall leaching runoff and volatilization therefore the proportional contribution of hg emission from mw to surface water needs to be further elucidated particularly in relation to erosion and leaching induced by rainfall 3 2 effects of rainfall the mzx river is mainly fed by spring water and rainfall to further clarify the impact of rainfall on surface water hg concentrations we collected data of a rainfall event in the hfp the velocity of water flow at the cross section of mw pile increased significantly from 0 08 m3 s to 0 19 m3 s pre and after the rainfall event in addition the thg dhg and phg concentrations in the surface water increased by 15 2 19 5 ng l 11 4 13 5 ng l and 3 7 10 0 ng l respectively due to the initial erosion effect fig 3 the much higher increment in dhg than phg concentration is consistent with their variation trends in the surface water between the hfp and lfp fig s1 the ph and conductivity in surface water should respond rapidly to a rainfall event therefore these parameters were used below as indicators to explore the influence of rainfall on hg concentrations in surface water the average ph and conductivity in the rainwater were 6 8 0 3 and 33 9 19 9 μs cm respectively and those in the surface water were 8 5 0 1 and 287 8 24 2 μs cm respectively before the rainfall and 7 9 0 1 and 359 8 5 6 μs cm after the rainfall event fig s2a and s2b at the kr rainfall dilution and water rock gas interactions are the two main controlling factors on the hydrochemical indices of surface water the lower ph and conductivity in rainwater than surface water and the significantly increased conductivity in the surface water after the rainfall event indicated that the direct contribution of rainfall to surface water conductivity was small however it is very likely that rainfall indirectly affected surface water through increasing the erosion and leaching of hg from the surrounding mws which led to increases in water conductivity as previously reported by liu et al 2007 more discussions on this mechanism are presented below 3 3 hg isotopes in dhg and phg in the lfp the δ202hg values of dhg and phg in surface water near the mw pile averaged at 0 56 0 13 and 0 61 0 33 respectively fig 4 and table s2 compared with those of the mw 0 09 0 23 the δ202hg values of phg in surface water were more positive fig 5 because lighter hg can be more easily dissolved from mw a consistent offset of δ202hg values 1 24 0 22 was observed between dhg and phg regardless of whether flow through the mw pile occurred or not and this value was statistically significant p 0 01 n 9 washburn et al 2017 also found similar results in the south river 0 28 which is a gravel bed river located in a valley in the usa however the offset of δ202hg was far less than that of our study in addition the south river aquatic ecosystems are dominated by phg which has low solubility and is relatively unreactive leading a slight variation in its isotopic composition schudel et al 2018 smith et al 2015 found enrichments of light hg isotopes in the precipitated β hgs relative to the dissolved hg in the laboratory with acid condition ph 2 3 and the offset of δ202hg was 0 63 while the dissolution process in our study caused positive offset in weak alkaline conditions ph 8 2 0 3 the dhg concentrations from the source of mzx to the mw pile averaged at 8 4 7 6 ng l and 23 6 12 2 ng l while those of the phg concentrations averaged at 3 0 4 5 ng l and 9 0 6 4 ng l during the lfp and hfp respectively the proportion of dhg to thg was relatively high during the lfp and hfp with averages of 88 9 and 73 4 respectively however washburn et al 2017 indicated that the average proportion of dhg to thg was 23 9 in the hyporheic zones of the channel margins of the south river to eliminate interference during the sampling process and more effectively describe the partitioning of dhg and phg in fluvial systems the distribution coefficient kd was adopted in this study based on the method of james et al 1998 see the method details in section s1 2 the log kd values arithmetically averaged at 5 0 0 8 and 5 8 0 5 in the lfp and hfp respectively these values were much lower than those observed at the south river 6 0 6 5 indicating a greater predominance of dhg in our study the dhg in this study is functionally defined as hg that passed through a 0 45 μm filter and it may be related to colloidal dissolved organic matter dom which contains a variety of ligands with affinities for hg when hg enters the water column due to erosion and leaching a portion of hg is quickly adsorbed by sulfhydryl groups with high affinity that are present in dom wiederhold et al 2010 when the adsorption reaches saturation larger suspended particles with weak affinity to hg will also adsorb a part of hg hesterberg et al 2001 hintelmann and harris 2004 skyllberg et al 2006 multiple studies have shown that the binding effect of hg to dom low hg dom ratio is controlled by a small fraction of dom molecules that contain a reactive thiol functional group under natural conditions haitzer et al 2002 in addition hg isotope fractionation in the hgs system was likely dominated by ligand exchange in solution from hg o to hg s coordination smith et al 2015 and thiol bound hg was enriched in light hg isotopes by 0 53 and 0 62 δ202hg relative to hgcl2 and hg oh 2 respectively wiederhold et al 2010 the mechanism in the hyporheic zone is complicated and requires further investigation we speculate that the different geological backgrounds and types of hg contaminated sites are also responsible for the large differences in the offsets the strata of the south river area are dominated by sandstone jaillard et al 1999 while that in the present study have a unique karst geological background moreover the capacity to store and transmit water in kr varies widely owing to the complex structure and degree of karstification because of the extensive network of interconnected joints fractures and dissolution cavities the water column of the kr was characterized by high ph and low turbidity the south river was polluted by a chemical plant used to recover elemental hg from sludge however our study was conducted at a hg mining area in a low temperature metallogenic zone thus the hg species and isotopic compositions varied significantly between the two studies compared to the δ202hg values of phg in the south river 0 68 the apparently positive δ202hg values found in the present study 0 61 0 33 are also responsible for the large offset of δ202hg between phg and dhg moreover the δ202hg values of the pore water in the channel margin hyporheic zone δ202hg 0 52 0 44 were significantly higher than those of the surface waters δ202hg 0 89 0 20 washburn et al 2018 furthermore the resuspension of sediments from the river bed into the water column may reduce the overall hg isotopic fractionation in the south river however in the present study remediation was carried out in the river channel and the riverbed was filled with gravel without sediment the δ202hg values of dhg and phg averaged at 1 26 0 41 and 0 53 0 69 respectively during the hfp compared with the case during the lfp the δ202hg values during the hfp were generally negative and varied greatly and a relatively stable offset was not observed this conclusion is consistent with that for the south river mentioned above likely due to the influence of hydrologic conditions on water hg partitioning and hg isotope fractionation washburn et al 2018 after a certain period of time adsorption dissolution equilibrium is attained because of the weaker hydrodynamic condition in the lfp the hg isotopic values of the mw were located between phg and dhg indicating sufficient water rock dissolution and limited exogenous input however the hydrologic conditions in the hyporheic zone changed significantly because of the plentiful rainfall in the hfp especially in the kr thus the isotopic compositions of phg in wtm were close to those of the mw fig 5 the δ199hg values of dhg and phg were close to 0 regardless of the hydrological seasonality section s3 and all surface water samples showed a δ199hg δ201hg ratio of 1 in both lfp fig s3 and hfp fig s4 3 4 source identification by hg isotopes in the surface water near the mw dhg was the predominant form thus we used δ199hg and δ202hg to quantify the relative contribution of hg pollution from mw op and bw to the surface water hg eqs 6 8 here upstream surface water with a low hg concentration that did not flow through the mw is defined as the bw thg concentrations were significantly elevated when water flowed through the mw and then gradually decreased downstream which is similar to the findings of previous studies dai et al 2013 qiu et al 2009 zhang et al 2010a the hg isotopic values of pore water of mw mpw are mixtures of mw and op and only a slightly negative offset was observed between mpw and mw which may be caused by op based on this hypothesis mw was directly regarded as an end member to eliminate the influence of other sources only sampling points near the mw and before passing through the farmland were considered in this study because of the short distance between sampling sites within 1 km we assumed that it is only a rapid mixing process when different end members enter the receiving water and significant mdf and mif will not occur during this rapid mixing process the average thg concentrations in bw op and wtm were 12 2 ng l 201 ng l and 15 5 ng l respectively during lfp and were 6 8 ng l 327 8 ng l and 69 0 ng l during hfp summer time note that the average thg concentration in the mpw was 181 ng l section s4 the thg concentrations were negatively correlated with the δ199hg values fig 6 higher thg concentrations were observed in wtm and the δ199hg values were close to the mpw and op signals fig 6 in addition the differences in the δ202hg values between the three sources were significant p 0 05 thus allowing for the development of a constrained hg isotopic mixing model with good confidence in this study we used the δ202hg and δ199hg values for source tracing and their relationship is presented in fig 5 the data points were interpreted as the result of triple mixing of the three end members bw was characterized by a slightly positive δ199hg and negative δ202hg and op was characterized by a negative δ199hg based on the δ199hg δ202hg mixing model the direct contribution of op to dhg was relatively small at 13 2 9 28 and 15 8 10 6 in the hfp and lfp respectively we found that the contribution of op to dhg in surface water was mainly associated with the erosion and leaching of mw and bedrock as mentioned in section 3 2 although rainfall amounts varied greatly between the hfp and lfp the contributions of op to dhg in wtm were similar between these two periods in the hg mining area atmospheric hg from the local sources enters the water column through wet deposition because phg is the main hg form in op the isotopic values of phg in op were very close to those in wtm during the hfp fig s5a but were different from those in wtm during the lfp fig s5b indicating that rainfall mainly contributed to phg in the surface water section s4 the contributions of mw f mw to dhg in wtm were 49 3 11 9 and 37 8 11 8 and those of bw were 37 5 6 48 and 46 4 7 15 in the hfp and lfp respectively thus mw is still a major source of dhg in the mining affected surface water rainfall is abundant in the hfp and the erosion and leaching effects are significant therefore contributions of rainfall to surface water hg were significant in the hfp despite of low discharge of rainwater flowing through mw in the lfp the contribution of mw to surface water hg could still reach 37 8 owing to the relatively high hg concentrations in the flow the contributions of bw to surface water hg were comparable to those of mw mainly due to the two contrasting factors i e relatively high discharge and relatively low hg concentration as the main hg form in surface water dhg is characterized by a strong migration ability which may pose great environmental risks to downstream aquatic ecosystems in this study we firstly combined the δ199hg and δ202hg signals to quantify the rainfall induced dhg pollution from mw to surface water and highlighted the need for further integrated monitoring of the source and quantity of dhg downstream 4 conclusions and implications this study found significantly higher surface water hg concentrations during hfp than lfp and very different surface water hg concentrations between the periods pre and after rainfall events these results suggest that erosion and leaching of mw and bedrock into the water column may be the main factors underlying the above phenomena it is also found that rainfall induced variability in hydrologic conditions in karst fissure pipes may affect the hg isotopic partitioning between dhg and phg in surface waters during the lfp sufficient dissolution equilibrium may have occurred because of the stable hydrologic conditions therefore a consistent offset of δ202hg 1 24 was observed between dhg and phg in addition this offset was much higher than that reported in previous studies which was likely due to the unique geological background of the kr with high ph low turbidity and relatively low dom overall the precipitation and dissolution processes may lead to the consistent fractionation between dhg and phg hydrodynamic conditions alter the degree of water rock interaction and thus determine the degree of fractionation the temporal variations of hg concentration and mixing model results indicated that remediation work can reduce the hg concentration and flux from mw to surface water however the remediated mw pile remains a source of hg for the local aquatic environment the consistent offset of δ202hg between phg and dhg in surface water provides a fundamental framework for understanding of hg isotope fractionation during mineral dissolution in natural water it indicates that hg isotopes are a powerful indicator of hg migration and transportation in aquatic ecosystem and pollution source apportionment in hg polluted areas results from the present study provide an important scientific basis for developing economical and practical remediation policies for hg containing

15172,mine waste mw in historical mercury hg mining areas continuously emits hg into local environment including aquatic ecosystems tracing hg migration process from mw and determining its relative contribution to hg pollution is critical for understanding the environmental impact of mw remediation in this study we combined data of hg concentration speciation and isotope to address this issue in the wanshan hg mining area in southwest china we found that rainfall can elevate hg concentrations in river water and control the partitioning and transport of hg in karst fissure zones through changing the hydrological conditions a consistently large offset of δ202hg 1 24 was observed between dissolved hg dhg and particulate hg phg in surface water during the low flow period lfp which may have been related to the relatively stable hydrologic conditions and unique geological background karst fissure zones of the karst region kr results from the ternary hg isotopic mixing model showed that despite an order of magnitude reduction in hg concentration and flux in river water after remediation the remediated mw is still a significant source of hg pollution to local aquatic ecosystems accounting for 49 3 11 9 and 37 8 11 8 of river dhg in high flow period hfp and lfp respectively this study provides new insights into hg migration and transportation in aquatic ecosystem and pollution source apportionment in hg polluted area which can be used for making polices for future remediation actions graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords mercury mine waste remediation rainfall mercury isotope karst area data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction mercury hg is a toxic pollutant and is listed as a priority pollutant by many international agencies jiang et al 2006 kwon et al 2020 mining activities such as gold and hg mining have increased the hg concentration by three fold in surface water compared to pre anthropogenic condition amos et al 2013 lamborg et al 2014 streets et al 2011 the wanshan hg mine wmm which is known as the capital of hg is located in a karst region kr in southwest china although hg mining activities were banned in 2001 long term mining activities have caused severe hg pollution in local ecosystems feng et al 2008 horvat et al 2003 li et al 2008 qiu et al 2013 kim et al 2016 xia et al 2020 mine waste mw is the product of high temperature ore roasting and it contains large amounts of secondary soluble hg the total mercury thg and methylmercury mehg levels in the surface water flowing through the mw were significantly elevated compared to that of the background area zhang et al 2010a 2010b in addition the kr of southwest china is one of the largest karst geomorphologic distributing areas in the world huang et al 2008 kr showed high hg background and unique aquifers plays a unique role in the global hg biogeochemical cycle xia et al 2022 erosion is a major factor in watersheds with significant mw storage during rainfall runoff events especially stormwater this process can lead to serious hg emission and diffusion increasing the environmental risks to local aquatic ecosystems guedron et al 2011 rose et al 2012 zheng et al 2016 in the kr large inter annual variations and differences between pre and after rainfall events in hg emissions have created a regime of hydrologic extremities however the role of rainfall in the release of hg from mw and subsequent transfer to aquatic systems remains unclear the action plan for soil pollution prevention and control was implemented in china in 2016 typical restoration measures such as capping with sand or clay were implemented in this area and these methods were considered as economical and effective remediation approaches to control pollution in aquatic ecosystems however sand and clay have a relatively weak affinity for hg and cannot prevent hg migration through the cap via the pore water pathway eckley et al 2020 furthermore enhanced flux of hg to surface water has been demonstrated by mesocosm experiments because of the low organic carbon content of sand caps curtis et al 2019 evaluating the effects of restoration treatments requires quantification of hg emission flux to downstream water bodies which is a challenging but crucial for projecting future changes at hg contaminated sites because of the difficulties in determining the water flow through mw traditional methods cannot be used to calculate hg emission flux from mw based on surface water hg concentration stable hg isotopes are represented by a three dimensional system that may not be affected by uncertain factors such as the hg concentration and stream discharge the unique hg isotopic composition of various reservoirs in hg mining areas could be used to effectively tracing the migration pathways and sources of hg in fluvial systems blum et al 2014 delphine et al 2009 yin et al 2010a because of extremely low concentration of hg in surface water hg in water must be extracted and pre concentrated for hg isotopic analysis mass dependent fractionation mdf occurs in almost all environmental processes such as adsorption and desorption jiskra et al 2012 diffusion koster van groos et al 2014 evaporation zheng et al 2019 microbial methylation and demethylation janssen et al 2016 kritee et al 2009 and hg uptake by plants yin et al 2013a yuan et al 2019 mass independent fractionation mif is caused by the magnetic isotope effect and nuclear volume effect bergquist and blum 2007 estrade et al

hg isotopes as a tracer for hg cycling and pollution sources the fractionation factors for important biogeochemical processes must be determined smith et al 2015 prior studies have demonstrated that mdf may occur during transformation of cinnabar to by products due to the roasting process because calcines 0 08 0 20 were enriched by 0 8 in δ202hg values compared to the unroasted hg ores 0 74 0 11 in the wmm yin et al 2013b delphine et al 2009 found that the hg isotopic composition of cinnabar was similar to that of the river sediment and presumed that the sediments throughout the watershed of the isonzo river to the gulf of trieste were seriously impacted by hg export from the idrija hg mine previous studies mainly focused on smelter affected sediments or agricultural regains feng et al 2010 lepak et al 2020 song et al 2021 washburn et al 2017 and identified hg pollution sources however the migration process and transport mechanism of hg from pollution sources to fluvial systems remain to be unclear the objectives of this study were to 1 assess the hg flux from remediated mws and evaluate the remediation effect 2 clarify the role of rainfall in hg release from the mw and 3 quantify the contribution of hg emission from the mw using the hg stable isotope approach findings from this study are expected to reveal the role of the mws in the regional hg cycle and provide scientific basis and data support for the formulation of remediation policies for hg contaminated solid waste 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the wanshan hg mine is located in wanshan county of guizhou province within the karst landscape of the yunnan guizhou plateau fig 1 a and b the study area has a sub tropical climate with humid condition and an annual precipitation of 1110 1410 mm in this study a typical remediated mw pile named meizixi mzx was chosen because it is located in a typical karst area and its headwaters were stacked with remediation mw fig 1c it is situated upstream of and connects to several small and shallow streams with numerous downstream tributaries its aquifers are characterized with high spatial heterogeneity and complex subterranean conduit networks 2 2 sample collection to effectively evaluate the contributions of hg emission from mw to mzx we focused on the upstream source of this river and a reach of it within a 2 km radius water samples were collected from the river near mw pile natural springs and precipitation during normal flow periods nfps october 2020 low flow periods lfps december 2020 and high flow periods hfp july 2021 in the hfp surface water samples were collected at the same point before and after the rainfall event before sampling three ultrapure water samples were prepared in the laboratory as field blanks within a vertical mw profile a thin steel rod was driven horizontally into the profile to avoid obstacles and provide a clear pilot channel for a 10 cm porous polymer tube eijkelkamp agrisearch equipment netherlands the solution was left for two weeks to equilibrate with the soil and 10 ml of pore water was extracted using a vacuum tube moreno jimenez et al 2011 all water samples were collected in duplicate unfiltered river water samples were collected for thg and total methylmercury tmehg analyses the surface water samples were filtered in situ using a 0 45 μm polyvinylidene fluoride filter millipore for dissolved hg dhg and dissolved methyl hg dmehg analyses the water samples were stored in 200 ml borosilicate bottles which were decontaminated using acidic solution followed by rinsing with deionized water and incineration for 1 5 h in a muffle furnace at 480 c after filtration the water samples were acidified with ultra pure hydrochloric acid sealed packaged in double layer bags returned to the laboratory and stored in a refrigerator at 4 c at each sampling site 1 l of water was collected and filtered using a teflon filter membrane to determine the total suspended solids tss the tss value was used to calculate the distribution coefficients log kd using the dhg concentration of the filtered surface water and suspended material following the method described by james et al 1998 the water flow q was measured by cup type current meter ls45a the basic physical and chemical parameters of the surface water were measured in situ during the sampling process water temperature wt ph electrical conductivity ec 25 c and dissolved oxygen do were measured using a portable ponsel odeon meter which was calibrated prior to deployment using ph 4 7 and 10 ec 1412 μs cm and do 0 and 100 standards the measurement accuracies of the device for the ph wt do and ec were 0 01 0 01 c 1 and 0 01 μs cm respectively 2 3 sample preparation for hg isotope analysis filtered surface water and suspended particle samples for hg isotope analysis were collected during lfp and hfp to ensure the minimum hg concentration required for the hg isotope analysis each filtered surface water sample was pre enriched based on the method established by li et al 2019 approximately 2 5 l water samples were used to determine the hg isotopes the samples were acidified successively using 0 5 v v ultrapure hydrochloric acid in the field and then transported back to the laboratory for cold storage before enrichment a 0 5 brcl solution was added for oxidation for at least 48 h the oxidized water samples were transferred to a bubble bottle a small amount of nh2oh hcl solution was added to remove excess brcl then a 0 5 sncl2 solution was added to reduce hg2 to hg0 which was purged with 2 5 l min of zero hg gas for 1 h and the evaporated hg was pre concentrated into a chlorinated activated carbon tube the hg captured by chlorinated activated carbon was removed by the pyrolysis device and absorbed into 5 ml of 40 anti aqua regia v v hno3 hcl 2 1 the solutions were stored in a refrigerator at 4 c away from light before hg isotope analysis li et al 2019 for phg a high temperature purified teflon membrane was used to filter an appropriate amount of water 2 5 l and the filter membranes were freeze dried and digested at high temperature using a tubular muffle furnace to extract hg into a 5 ml of a 40 anti aqua regia absorption liquid fu et al 2013 2 4 hg concentration and hg isotope analysis the operationally defined fractions of thg phg and dhg in the surface water samples were determined using a dual stage au amalgamation method and cold vapor atomic fluorescence spectrophotometer cvafs dhg and thg were determined following brcl oxidation for 24 h and then reduced to hg0 using acidic sncl2 phg was obtained by subtracting dhg from thg the tmehg and dmehg concentrations were determined by distillation ethylation gc separation and cvafs guo et al 2008 jiang et al 2004 the isotopic composition of hg was analyzed using mc icpms nu instruments uk the measurement procedures were described in detail by yin et al 2010b thallium internal corrections external standards and sample bracketing method were used to obtain precise and accurate measurements an internal tl standard nist 997 was introduced to correct instrumental mass bias strict sample standard bracketing with a

random number generation was performed in rstudio windows and then the monte carlo simulation method n 10 000 was used to estimate the relative contributions of the three end members the uncertainties in the triple mixing model were also estimated using the monte carlo simulation approach 2 5 quality control the quality assurance and quality control of the hg analysis were assessed using blanks blind duplicates and matrix spikes the recoveries for the matrix spikes averaged at 101 4 for thg and 81 16 for mehg the relative standard deviation was 8 for the hg concentration analysis the

data were analyzed using spss 26 0 and origin 2018 software the characteristics of thg and other hg forms in the water samples were reported as the mean standard deviation sd and examined using descriptive statistics a nonparametric test was used to compare the differences between different data groups correlation and difference tests were considered to be statistically significant at p 0 05 3 results and discussion 3 1 temporal variation of water hg and hg emission flux thg and dhg concentrations during the hfp 32 6 16 3 ng l and 23 6 12 2 ng l respectively were significantly higher than those during the lfp 14 8 9 8 ng l and 7 4 4 1 ng l respectively p 0 05 whereas phg concentrations were not significantly different between these two periods 9 0 6 4 versus 7 8 8 8 ng l p 0 05 fig s1 and table s1 the concentrations of tmehg in hfp were slightly higher than those in the other two periods anova p 0 05 the average tmehg concentrations are given in the section s2 both water discharge and hydrodynamic conditions governed hg concentration in the hfp stronger hydrodynamic conditions higher flows and enhanced erosion led to hg transport from the mw into the river resulting in significantly higher thg and dhg concentrations compared with the case of lfp meanwhile a significant dilution effect on phg was observed during the hfp in contrast relatively weak hydrodynamic conditions might have resulted in the deposition of phg at the riverbed rainfall has a combined effect of erosion and leaching on the mw thus leading to hg dissolution in mw and then releasing into rivers gray et al 2003 kim et al 2000 the solidified mw pile is more stable and leaching effect is dominated compared with erosion so dhg was the dominant form compared with phg however no significant seasonal differences in phg were observed the highest thg dhg and phg concentrations were observed near the mw pile during the hfp indicating that mw is an important source of hg to downstream regions due to erosion and leaching during rainfall note that mw pile at mzx was sprayed with a passivator and covered with soil in 2013 and then vegetation was planted above the pile besides the surrounding river channel was also dredged to evaluate the effectiveness of these restoration actions we compared our data collected in 2020 2021 with those reported before 2013 qiu et al 2005 zhang et al 2010a 2010b only data from sampling locations close to the mw pile within 1 5 km were selected for accurate comparison fig 2 because the historical flow of this stretch of the river could not be determined the arithmetic averages of hg concentration were used for comparison most dhg and phg concentrations observed in the present study were lower than level ⅰ of the national standard for surface water 50 ng l except at some points near mw during hfp thg and dhg concentrations during nfp 20 7 14 8 ng l and 7 25 4 30 ng l respectively and thg and phg concentrations during hfp were significantly lower in 2020 than 2002 p 0 05 overall decreasing trends from 2008 to 2020 were observed in the different forms of hg thg dhg and phg despite of insignificant differences between the two years fig 2 the maximum thg concentration 69 ng l near the mw observed in this study was reduced by an order of magnitude compared to that observed at the mzx river in 2011 316 ng l dai 2011 the average water flows of the mzx river at the mw cross section were 0 119 m3 s 0 075 m3 s and 0 187 m3 s and the corresponding hg fluxes were 32 9 23 6 g y 5 7 3 5 g y and 47 4 23 8 g y during the nfp lfp and hfp respectively the calculation methods are shown in section s1 1 therefore the thg emission flux from the mzx pile to the river was estimated be 109 7 50 9 g y compared with the hg flux calculated by dai 2011 for this section of the river 1480 g y the hg flux in this study also decreased by an order of magnitude the above results illustrate the significant effect of the remediation arrangement however thg concentration in this study was still slightly higher than the background surface water values indicating mw piles being still a major source of hg pollution in local aquatic ecosystems in hg mining areas yan et al 2019 mw contains large amounts of secondary compounds of hg produced under high temperature conditions which are released continuously to the surrounding environment by rainfall leaching runoff and volatilization therefore the proportional contribution of hg emission from mw to surface water needs to be further elucidated particularly in relation to erosion and leaching induced by rainfall 3 2 effects of rainfall the mzx river is mainly fed by spring water and rainfall to further clarify the impact of rainfall on surface water hg concentrations we collected data of a rainfall event in the hfp the velocity of water flow at the cross section of mw pile increased significantly from 0 08 m3 s to 0 19 m3 s pre and after the rainfall event in addition the thg dhg and phg concentrations in the surface water increased by 15 2 19 5 ng l 11 4 13 5 ng l and 3 7 10 0 ng l respectively due to the initial erosion effect fig 3 the much higher increment in dhg than phg concentration is consistent with their variation trends in the surface water between the hfp and lfp fig s1 the ph and conductivity in surface water should respond rapidly to a rainfall event therefore these parameters were used below as indicators to explore the influence of rainfall on hg concentrations in surface water the average ph and conductivity in the rainwater were 6 8 0 3 and 33 9 19 9 μs cm respectively and those in the surface water were 8 5 0 1 and 287 8 24 2 μs cm respectively before the rainfall and 7 9 0 1 and 359 8 5 6 μs cm after the rainfall event fig s2a and s2b at the kr rainfall dilution and water rock gas interactions are the two main controlling factors on the hydrochemical indices of surface water the lower ph and conductivity in rainwater than surface water and the significantly increased conductivity in the surface water after the rainfall event indicated that the direct contribution of rainfall to surface water conductivity was small however it is very likely that rainfall indirectly affected surface water through increasing the erosion and leaching of hg from the surrounding mws which led to increases in water conductivity as previously reported by liu et al 2007 more discussions on this mechanism are presented below 3 3 hg isotopes in dhg and phg in the lfp the δ202hg values of dhg and phg in surface water near the mw pile averaged at 0 56 0 13 and 0 61 0 33 respectively fig 4 and table s2 compared with those of the mw 0 09 0 23 the δ202hg values of phg in surface water were more positive fig 5 because lighter hg can be more easily dissolved from mw a consistent offset of δ202hg values 1 24 0 22 was observed between dhg and phg regardless of whether flow through the mw pile occurred or not and this value was statistically significant p 0 01 n 9 washburn et al 2017 also found similar results in the south river 0 28 which is a gravel bed river located in a valley in the usa however the offset of δ202hg was far less than that of our study in addition the south river aquatic ecosystems are dominated by phg which has low solubility and is relatively unreactive leading a slight variation in its isotopic composition schudel et al 2018 smith et al 2015 found enrichments of light hg isotopes in the precipitated β hgs relative to the dissolved hg in the laboratory with acid condition ph 2 3 and the offset of δ202hg was 0 63 while the dissolution process in our study caused positive offset in weak alkaline conditions ph 8 2 0 3 the dhg concentrations from the source of mzx to the mw pile averaged at 8 4 7 6 ng l and 23 6 12 2 ng l while those of the phg concentrations averaged at 3 0 4 5 ng l and 9 0 6 4 ng l during the lfp and hfp respectively the proportion of dhg to thg was relatively high during the lfp and hfp with averages of 88 9 and 73 4 respectively however washburn et al 2017 indicated that the average proportion of dhg to thg was 23 9 in the hyporheic zones of the channel margins of the south river to eliminate interference during the sampling process and more effectively describe the partitioning of dhg and phg in fluvial systems the distribution coefficient kd was adopted in this study based on the method of james et al 1998 see the method details in section s1 2 the log kd values arithmetically averaged at 5 0 0 8 and 5 8 0 5 in the lfp and hfp respectively these values were much lower than those observed at the south river 6 0 6 5 indicating a greater predominance of dhg in our study the dhg in this study is functionally defined as hg that passed through a 0 45 μm filter and it may be related to colloidal dissolved organic matter dom which contains a variety of ligands with affinities for hg when hg enters the water column due to erosion and leaching a portion of hg is quickly adsorbed by sulfhydryl groups with high affinity that are present in dom wiederhold et al 2010 when the adsorption reaches saturation larger suspended particles with weak affinity to hg will also adsorb a part of hg hesterberg et al 2001 hintelmann and harris 2004 skyllberg et al 2006 multiple studies have shown that the binding effect of hg to dom low hg dom ratio is controlled by a small fraction of dom molecules that contain a reactive thiol functional group under natural conditions haitzer et al 2002 in addition hg isotope fractionation in the hgs system was likely dominated by ligand exchange in solution from hg o to hg s coordination smith et al 2015 and thiol bound hg was enriched in light hg isotopes by 0 53 and 0 62 δ202hg relative to hgcl2 and hg oh 2 respectively wiederhold et al 2010 the mechanism in the hyporheic zone is complicated and requires further investigation we speculate that the different geological backgrounds and types of hg contaminated sites are also responsible for the large differences in the offsets the strata of the south river area are dominated by sandstone jaillard et al 1999 while that in the present study have a unique karst geological background moreover the capacity to store and transmit water in kr varies widely owing to the complex structure and degree of karstification because of the extensive network of interconnected joints fractures and dissolution cavities the water column of the kr was characterized by high ph and low turbidity the south river was polluted by a chemical plant used to recover elemental hg from sludge however our study was conducted at a hg mining area in a low temperature metallogenic zone thus the hg species and isotopic compositions varied significantly between the two studies compared to the δ202hg values of phg in the south river 0 68 the apparently positive δ202hg values found in the present study 0 61 0 33 are also responsible for the large offset of δ202hg between phg and dhg moreover the δ202hg values of the pore water in the channel margin hyporheic zone δ202hg 0 52 0 44 were significantly higher than those of the surface waters δ202hg 0 89 0 20 washburn et al 2018 furthermore the resuspension of sediments from the river bed into the water column may reduce the overall hg isotopic fractionation in the south river however in the present study remediation was carried out in the river channel and the riverbed was filled with gravel without sediment the δ202hg values of dhg and phg averaged at 1 26 0 41 and 0 53 0 69 respectively during the hfp compared with the case during the lfp the δ202hg values during the hfp were generally negative and varied greatly and a relatively stable offset was not observed this conclusion is consistent with that for the south river mentioned above likely due to the influence of hydrologic conditions on water hg partitioning and hg isotope fractionation washburn et al 2018 after a certain period of time adsorption dissolution equilibrium is attained because of the weaker hydrodynamic condition in the lfp the hg isotopic values of the mw were located between phg and dhg indicating sufficient water rock dissolution and limited exogenous input however the hydrologic conditions in the hyporheic zone changed significantly because of the plentiful rainfall in the hfp especially in the kr thus the isotopic compositions of phg in wtm were close to those of the mw fig 5 the δ199hg values of dhg and phg were close to 0 regardless of the hydrological seasonality section s3 and all surface water samples showed a δ199hg δ201hg ratio of 1 in both lfp fig s3 and hfp fig s4 3 4 source identification by hg isotopes in the surface water near the mw dhg was the predominant form thus we used δ199hg and δ202hg to quantify the relative contribution of hg pollution from mw op and bw to the surface water hg eqs 6 8 here upstream surface water with a low hg concentration that did not flow through the mw is defined as the bw thg concentrations were significantly elevated when water flowed through the mw and then gradually decreased downstream which is similar to the findings of previous studies dai et al 2013 qiu et al 2009 zhang et al 2010a the hg isotopic values of pore water of mw mpw are mixtures of mw and op and only a slightly negative offset was observed between mpw and mw which may be caused by op based on this hypothesis mw was directly regarded as an end member to eliminate the influence of other sources only sampling points near the mw and before passing through the farmland were considered in this study because of the short distance between sampling sites within 1 km we assumed that it is only a rapid mixing process when different end members enter the receiving water and significant mdf and mif will not occur during this rapid mixing process the average thg concentrations in bw op and wtm were 12 2 ng l 201 ng l and 15 5 ng l respectively during lfp and were 6 8 ng l 327 8 ng l and 69 0 ng l during hfp summer time note that the average thg concentration in the mpw was 181 ng l section s4 the thg concentrations were negatively correlated with the δ199hg values fig 6 higher thg concentrations were observed in wtm and the δ199hg values were close to the mpw and op signals fig 6 in addition the differences in the δ202hg values between the three sources were significant p 0 05 thus allowing for the development of a constrained hg isotopic mixing model with good confidence in this study we used the δ202hg and δ199hg values for source tracing and their relationship is presented in fig 5 the data points were interpreted as the result of triple mixing of the three end members bw was characterized by a slightly positive δ199hg and negative δ202hg and op was characterized by a negative δ199hg based on the δ199hg δ202hg mixing model the direct contribution of op to dhg was relatively small at 13 2 9 28 and 15 8 10 6 in the hfp and lfp respectively we found that the contribution of op to dhg in surface water was mainly associated with the erosion and leaching of mw and bedrock as mentioned in section 3 2 although rainfall amounts varied greatly between the hfp and lfp the contributions of op to dhg in wtm were similar between these two periods in the hg mining area atmospheric hg from the local sources enters the water column through wet deposition because phg is the main hg form in op the isotopic values of phg in op were very close to those in wtm during the hfp fig s5a but were different from those in wtm during the lfp fig s5b indicating that rainfall mainly contributed to phg in the surface water section s4 the contributions of mw f mw to dhg in wtm were 49 3 11 9 and 37 8 11 8 and those of bw were 37 5 6 48 and 46 4 7 15 in the hfp and lfp respectively thus mw is still a major source of dhg in the mining affected surface water rainfall is abundant in the hfp and the erosion and leaching effects are significant therefore contributions of rainfall to surface water hg were significant in the hfp despite of low discharge of rainwater flowing through mw in the lfp the contribution of mw to surface water hg could still reach 37 8 owing to the relatively high hg concentrations in the flow the contributions of bw to surface water hg were comparable to those of mw mainly due to the two contrasting factors i e relatively high discharge and relatively low hg concentration as the main hg form in surface water dhg is characterized by a strong migration ability which may pose great environmental risks to downstream aquatic ecosystems in this study we firstly combined the δ199hg and δ202hg signals to quantify the rainfall induced dhg pollution from mw to surface water and highlighted the need for further integrated monitoring of the source and quantity of dhg downstream 4 conclusions and implications this study found significantly higher surface water hg concentrations during hfp than lfp and very different surface water hg concentrations between the periods pre and after rainfall events these results suggest that erosion and leaching of mw and bedrock into the water column may be the main factors underlying the above phenomena it is also found that rainfall induced variability in hydrologic conditions in karst fissure pipes may affect the hg isotopic partitioning between dhg and phg in surface waters during the lfp sufficient dissolution equilibrium may have occurred because of the stable hydrologic conditions therefore a consistent offset of δ202hg 1 24 was observed between dhg and phg in addition this offset was much higher than that reported in previous studies which was likely due to the unique geological background of the kr with high ph low turbidity and relatively low dom overall the precipitation and dissolution processes may lead to the consistent fractionation between dhg and phg hydrodynamic conditions alter the degree of water rock interaction and thus determine the degree of fractionation the temporal variations of hg concentration and mixing model results indicated that remediation work can reduce the hg concentration and flux from mw to surface water however the remediated mw pile remains a source of hg for the local aquatic environment the consistent offset of δ202hg between phg and dhg in surface water provides a fundamental framework for understanding of hg isotope fractionation during mineral dissolution in natural water it indicates that hg isotopes are a powerful indicator of hg migration and transportation in aquatic ecosystem and pollution source apportionment in hg polluted areas results from the present study provide an important scientific basis for developing economical and practical remediation policies for hg containing

15173,the accidental spill of hazardous and noxious substances hnss in the ocean has serious environmental and human health consequences assessing the ecotoxicity of seawater exposed to various hns is challenging due to the constant development of new hns or mixtures and assessment methods are also limited microalgae viability tests are often used among the various biological indicators for ecotoxicity testing as they are the primary producers in aquatic ecosystems however since the conventional cell growth rate test measures cell viability over three to four days using manual inspection under a conventional optical microscope it is labor and time intensive and prone to subjective errors in this study we propose a rapid and automated method to evaluate seawater ecotoxicity by quantification of the morphological changes of microalgae exposed to more than 30 hnss this method was further validated using conventional growth rate test results dunaliella tertiolecta a microalgae species without rigid cell walls was selected as the test organism its morphological changes in response to hns exposure were measured at the single cell level using a custom developed device that uses lens free shadow imaging technology the ecotoxicity evaluation induced by the morphological change could be available in as little as 5 min using the proposed method and device and it could be effective for 20 hnss out of 30 hnss tested moreover the test results of six selected hnss with high marine transport volume and toxicity revealed that the sensitivity of the proposed method extends to half the maximum effective concentration ec50 and even to the lowest observed effective concentration loec furthermore the average correlation index between the growth inhibition test three to four days and the proposed morphology changes test 5 min for the six selected hnss was 0 84 indicating great promise in the field of various point of care water quality monitoring thus the proposed equipment and technology may provide a viable alternative to traditional on site toxicity testing and the potential of rapid morphological analysis may replace traditional growth inhibition testing graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords hns bioassay lens free shadow imaging technology shadow parameters morphological change seawater ecotoxicity assessment data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction hazardous and noxious substances hnss are defined as any substance other than oil that if introduced into the marine environment is likely to create hazards to human health harm living resources and marine life damage amenities or interfere with other legitimate uses of the sea protocol 2000 with the development of industry and technology in recent years the use of hns has steadily increased and the majority of them are transported by sea cunha et al 2016 harold et al 2014 a significant increase in overseas transportation of hnss has led to a significant increase in spill accidents chen et al 2019 thus the increase in hns accidents has had a greater impact on the marine environment and human health cunha et al 2017 rocha et al 2016 however not only is it challenging to quantify the impact of hns in a short time but it also requires collecting a large amount of data furthermore most ecotoxicity results are based on experiments with freshwater organisms mamaca et al 2005 neuparth et al 2011 these ecotoxicity data should be interpreted with caution because freshwater organisms are less sensitive to chemicals than marine organisms spurgeon et al 2020 furthermore rapid and accurate assessment of water toxicity is critical for water safety however studying the toxicity of all chemicals in water is impossible because new chemicals with unknown ecotoxicity are introduced every year and their mixtures can have complex toxicity effects european commission and directorate general for health and consumers 2013 de almeida et al 2017 dévier et al 2011 a bioassay test for ecotoxicity is one of the most effective methods for determining the risk of toxicity bioassays involve direct toxicity assessments of samples brought into the laboratory and tested for toxicity in vivo using live cell populations of microorganisms as test organisms e g microalgae zooplankton fish crustaceans and luminescent bacteria delorenzo and fulton 2012 lapeña et al 2021 müller et al 2019 rozman and kalčíková 2021 tang et al 2022 viegas 2021 among the organisms used in bioassays microalgae are the primary producers of marine ecosystems and the basis of all food chains they account for more than half of the global net primary biomass production field et al 1998 microalgae are mainly used in toxicity tests due to their high sensitivity reproducibility and direct observation of toxic symptoms at the cellular level eom et al 2021 ramadass et al 2017 tato and beiras 2019 the growth inhibition test is a conventional microalgae toxicity study that examines the effects of a chemical on microalgae growth the microalgae are exposed to the test substance in batch cultures typically for 72 h and cell viability is measured every 24 h guideline 2001 however measuring the tiny microalgae with a microscope is difficult and time consuming and an accurate estimate of their growth rate is possible only after several generations of cells have divided therefore several studies have been conducted recently to monitor various biological changes such as photosynthetic activity and microalgal mobility using optical electrical and chemical methods to address this issue han et al 2019 ramadass et al 2017 seo et al 2015 zheng et al 2018 dunaliella tertiolecta d tertiolecta is a unicellular biflagellate green alga with a cell size of 10 12 μm that is used as a test species for ecotoxicity assessment because of its high sensitivity to the effects of various pollutants such as metals solvents pesticides and petrochemicals qian et al 2015 d tertiolecta lacks a rigid cell wall and changes shape from ellipsoid to an inflated or deflated form indicating the transition from a living to a dead state they have been reported to undergo morphological changes due to stress and toxicity baird and delorenzo 2010 chen et al 2017 pretti et al 2014 although these morphological changes can be used for toxicity evaluation it is difficult to separate the cells and observe their shape for example an optical microscope makes it easy to distinguish between living and dead cells however at low magnification 100 it is difficult to detect minute morphological changes as the boundaries become blurred furthermore due to the limited field of view fov of a microscope hundreds of microalgae cannot be analyzed simultaneously therefore using a microscope to assess toxicity based on morphological changes is challenging and other efficient measurement methods are needed the lens free shadow imaging technique lsit can assess the properties of a cell by analyzing its distinct shadow patterns mudanyali et al 2009 roy et al 2016b 2017 seo et al 2022 the lsit does not require expensive optical lenses and equipment for focusing a light emitting diode led and a complementary metal oxide semiconductor cmos image sensor can be used to collect the intrinsic fingerprint shadow patterns of cells lsit system can be built compactly because there is no lens and single cells can be measured quickly with a large fov previously we have demonstrated the possibility of assessing toxicity by measuring acute toxicity in hundreds of microalgae based on morphological changes seo et al 2020 we detected live d tertiolecta cells with the use of shadow parameters and was able to distinguish between elliptical spherical and swollen cells therefore in this study two shadow parameters circular cell ratio and healthy cell ratio were developed to classify the morphological changes of d tertiolecta exposed to hns enabling rapid ecotoxicity testing and on site monitoring a bioassay based on changes in cell morphological ratio was developed by evaluating the sensitivity of cell growth rate and ratio of morphological change to toxicity the morphological response and sensitivity test was conducted with 30 hns and the results of the 72 h growth inhibition test were compared with the growth rate and morphological changes of the same sample consequently a relationship was established between the toxicity of hns and two biological changes cell growth rate and the ratio of morphological changes in d tertiolecta this relationship enables on site monitoring of hns toxicity using cellytics in addition results of this bioassay using morphological changes were validated by comparison with algal growth rate this analysis technique may serve as an effective tool for on site toxicity assessment 2 material and methods 2 1 test organism microalgae from two suppliers were used for the experiment with 30 hns and the growth inhibition test the

incubated at 20 21 c under continuous illumination at 6180 7020 lx for three to four days the microalgae used for the experiments were taken from precultures in the exponential growth phase 2 2 measuring device and analysis parameters lsit involves the formation of diffraction patterns when light from a point source passes through an aperture on a ccd or cmos sensor isikman et al 2009 ozcan and demirci 2008 when light is diffracted as it passes through the aperture it forms a series of light and dark bands known as diffraction patterns the diffraction pattern is determined by the size and shape of the aperture as well as the wavelength of the light in the case of a circular aperture the diffraction pattern consists of a central bright region called the airy disk surrounded by a series of concentric rings of varying intensity the intensity of the light in the diffraction pattern follows a characteristic pattern known as the airy function which decreases exponentially from the center of the airy disk to the edges in lsit the diffraction pattern is used to capture the image of an object roy et al 2016a when the object is placed in front of the aperture the diffraction pattern is modulated by the shadow of the object creating a unique pattern that can be used to reconstruct the image of the object greenbaum et al 2012 roy et al 2016b seo et al 2017 this enables high resolution imaging of small objects even at short distances without the use of a lens the physical and optical properties of an object such as its size shape and refractive index determine the characteristics of a diffraction pattern formed when the sample plane is illuminated with coherent light boominathan et al 2022 kim et al 2012 an optical microscope ckx31sf olympus japan and a custom developed device cellytics were used to measure the morphological changes of d tertiolecta cellytics fig 1 a enables automated counting and morphological analysis based on lsit which consists of a 470

shadow parameters fig 1d cellytics had a fov of 23 52 mm2 and simultaneously measured cells at concentrations of up to 106 cells ml the morphological changes in d tertiolecta were compared with the same cells under the optical microscope fig 2 a a morphological difference was observed in the shadow pattern of d tertiolecta that was altered by toxicity shadow parameters were constructed to distinguish the morphological difference between the two cell states live and dead the central maximum value cmv the central value of the diffraction pattern was used as a criterion for distinguishing between live and dead cells a second shadow parameter the standard deviation of maxima to minima distance smd distinguished cell morphological changes due to toxicity the parameter smd corresponds to the brightness difference between the second and third concentric circles and is expressed as the standard deviation of the values of 24 zones at 15 intervals for the shadow parameter maxima to minima

was approximately 8 10 104 cells ml cells were distributed in aliquots of 100 ml in 250 ml erlenmeyer flasks the experiments were performed in triplicate and the treated groups were exposed to the half maximal effective concentration ec50 of hns after 5 min of reaction time the morphology of cells from the control and exposed groups was compared by measuring cmv and smd the hnss were selected

ammonia displayed physical behavior in the dissolved state and were diluted with filtered seawater at six different concentrations including controls a range finding test was performed to confirm the range of effective concentrations for d tertiolecta when there is no information regarding the effects of hns or when the concentrations are insufficient in a 72 h growth inhibition test d tertiolecta

logarithmic increase in the change in cr in each control and exposed group flask conversely cells that were not affected by toxicity were referred to as healthy cells and counted as the number of cells greater than the α value the percentage of healthy cells estimated using shadow parameters was termed the healthy ratio the specific growth rate gr was calculated using eq 2 after taking 1 ml of the test solution every 24 h and counting the cell density directly under the optical microscope the average growth rate for a specific period was calculated as the logarithmic increase in the cell density of each flask in the control and exposed groups according to the following equation 2 μ i j ln x j ln x i t j t i d a y 1 where µ i j is the average specific growth rate from time i to time j t i and t j are the times for the start and end of the period respectively x i and x j are the cell densities at time i and j respectively 2 5 2 statistical analyses one way analysis of variance anova was used to evaluate whether there was a significant difference in growth and morphological changes between the control and exposed groups prior to using anova the data were examined for normality shapiro wilk test and homogeneity of variance bartlett test and the no observed effect concentration noec and lowest observed effect concentration loec were calculated using the dunnett multiple comparison procedure the ec50 was calculated using a point estimation method and the results were statistically analyzed using toxcalc 5 0 tidepool scientific software ca usa and spss statistics version 26 0 0 ibm corp armonk ny usa 3 results and discussion 3 1 1 the morphological changes of d tertiolecta d tertiolecta undergoes gradual morphological changes under stressful or toxic conditions typically they have an elliptical shape but when exposed to toxins they transform into a circular shape moreover as the environment deteriorates the cell wall eventually disintegrates leading to death pretti et al 2014 the optical microscope and shadow images of d tertiolecta exposed to acetone are shown in fig 2a each diffraction pattern was quantified using the shadow parameters to differentiate between live elliptical cyst swollen and dead deflated cells fig 2b under nontoxic conditions the mean cmv and smd values of approximately 500 live cells were 146 17 and 9 35 respectively upon exposure to 37 5 mg l acetone the cells transformed into cyst cells with cmv and smd values of 148 13 and 6 45 respectively cmv showed minimal variation whereas smd was significantly reduced by approximately one third however when exposed to 75 mg l acetone the cells died and their cmv and smd values changed to 170 64 and 5 99 respectively when dead cells were compared with live cyst cells the smd value did not change significantly but there was a remarkable increase in the cmv value for dead cells finally each shadow parameter was statistically analyzed by a t test between two independent samples using spss statistics version 26 0 0 ibm corp fig 2c shows box and whisker plots for the cmv and smd the cmv distribution was clear and distinct in both live healthy and cystic and dead cells in contrast the smd distribution revealed a significant difference p 0 001 allowing the cells to be differentiated based on the shadow parameters 3 1 2 morphological changes in d tertiolecta exposed to ec50 of hnss we compared the cr of the control group with that of the exposed group to determine the extent of morphological changes induced by exposure to hnss previously we showed that the cumulative graph up to smd 6 reflects the effect of microalgae exposure on hns seo et al 2020 hence for optimal comparison the cr for measuring the transition from elliptical to circular shape due to exposure to ec50 was calculated using eq 1 based on the smd value of 6 α fig 3 shows the change in the cr values for thirty of the hnss twenty of the 30 substances showed statistically significant differences in cr values between the control and exposed cells p 0 01 the cr values of nineteen of these twenty substances i e acetone chloroform potassium hydroxide solution methacrylic acid ethyl alcohol methyl alcohol toluene phenol aniline acetic acid glycerin hydrochloric acid acetic anhydride tetrahydrofuran benzene ethylenediamine ethyl acrylate butyl alcohol and tert butanol increased compared to the control and these cr values differed by an average of 2 19 fold cells exposed to methacrylic acid showed the most significant morphological changes with a cr value that increased by more than fourfold from 17 54 to 80 01 the cr value of cells exposed to trichloroethylene decreased by approximately 50 from 24 64 to 13 40 thus due to toxicity the cells change shape usually spherical but sometimes taking on an elongated form furthermore 10 out of 30 chemicals showed similar changes in cr values between the control and exposed groups within the standard deviation because no data for d tertiolecta were found for the ec50 tested it is safe to assume that the tested ec50 has no effect on d tertiolecta however two thirds of the hns assessed induced a morphological change in cells exposed to hns within 5 min suggesting that morphological changes can be used to assess toxicity 3 2 comparison of growth rate and morphological change in section 3 1 2 we showed that morphological changes could be used to measure hns toxicity therefore we examined the results of a bioassay that measured morphology and population growth in the same sample using a 72 h growth inhibition test to determine the efficacy of assessing toxicity in the field based on morphological changes and the relationship between population growth and morphology 3 2 1 growth inhibition test for the d tertiolecta the d tertiolecta population was measured by an expert under a microscope to verify the growth rate in the 72 h growth inhibition test eq 2 was used to convert the measured number of cells into the specific growth rate fig 4 a shows the specific growth rate of d tertiolecta exposed to six different hnss using statistical approaches we determined the ec50 loec and noec which are indicators for assessing the risk of hns the ec50 loec and noec values of six different hnss derived from the growth rate study are given in table 1 of these six substances d tertiolecta was most sensitive to ammonia and least sensitive to methyl alcohol 3 2 2 measurement and analysis of morphology changes in the d tertiolecta cells exposed to six hnss the morphology changes of d tertiolecta in the 72 h growth inhibition test were assessed by non experts using cellytics at 5 min 3 h and 6 h the optimal analysis for each experiment may vary significantly due the sensitivity of the morphology to the environment the conditions of the experiment and the initial state of cells therefore in this experiment the smd threshold was set to a value between six and nine and examined the variation of the cr values as a function of hns concentration in the samples exposed for 5 min fig 4b ⅰ shows the variation of cr as a function of methyl alcohol concentration regardless of the smd threshold the cr exhibited a linear response since a similar linear cr response as a function of concentration was observed for the other five hns ethyl alcohol acetone sulfuric acid dilute phosphoric acid and ammonia only methyl alcohol is discussed in more detail in the text fig s2 the detailed results for the remaining hns can be found in the supplementary information figs s2 s4 based on the cr values it was possible to differentiate toxicity according to concentration regardless of the criterion used however in this experiment we chose smd 7 to detect the morphological changes of the cells optimally for smd 7 the slope of the plot of cr values against concentration was large 10 pp and the coefficient of determination r 2 between the hns concentration and the cr values was 0 9 furthermore we also examined morphological changes at three different time intervals and different concentrations of hnss fig 4b ⅱ shows the percent difference between the cr of the control and different concentrations of methyl alcohol after 5 min 3 h and 6 h of reaction time the percentage change was generally greater after 3 h and 6 h than after 5 min this could be because a longer reaction time may result in a greater number of reacting cells however since the reaction rate of each substance is different there was no correlation between the change in percentage points as a function of hns concentration or time between the different substances fig s3 the loec is the lowest measured concentration of a substance with a statistically significant effect on a test organism during a given exposure period organization for economic co operation and development 2006 after exposure to loec levels of methyl alcohol 20 000 mg ml for 5 min 3 h and 6 h the percentage point pp in cr values of cells was 13 77 1 15 22 35 2 40 and 20 06 3 63 respectively similarly when cells were exposed to all chemicals at loec levels for 3 h and 6 h cells showed a difference of more than 10 pp in cr values indicating that morphological changes are more sensitive than population growth table 2 finally we analyzed cells unaffected by toxicity to determine the relationship between growth rate and morphological change ratio since healthy cells actively proliferate one would anticipate that they would divide freely in the absence of toxicity thus a higher number of healthy cells leads to an increase in cell division and a larger population fig 4b iii shows the proportion of cells unaffected by toxicity healthy ratio as a function of methyl alcohol concentration and exposure time the healthy ratio represents a change in the ratio between healthy cells and the control group a linear decrease in healthy ratios was observed after 5 min 3 h and 6 h exposure to hns with r 2 values of 0 95 0 77 and 0 95 respectively these results showed that even at loec values of hns the cr values and healthy ratio were significantly altered in the exposed cells moreover a linear relationship between the healthy ratio and hns concentration makes this metric suitable for studying growth rates based on morphological changes 3 2 3 comparison of growth rate and morphological change ratio using the loec values obtained we compared the sensitivity of the two biological changes growth rate and morphological change ratio the loec of 6 hns evaluated by morphological changes showed different values at exposure times of 5 min 3 h and 6 h the loec values of ethyl alcohol methyl alcohol acetone sulfuric acid phosphoric acid and ammonia were determined to be 8333 3750 and 7083 mg l 16 250 5937 and 5937 mg l 2500 1250 and 3125 mg l 112 53 and 10 mg l 218 135 and 177 mg l and 100 62 5 and 6 25 mg l after 5 min 3 h and 6 h respectively a comparison of loec data derived from growth rate and morphological ratio changes is shown in fig 5 after 6 h of exposure morphological change results were more sensitive to all chemicals than growth rate results with lower loec values except for sulfuric acid and ammonia the morphological ratio yielded lower loec values than the growth rate after 5 min for all other chemicals after 5 min sulfuric acid and ammonia had higher loec values as determined by the morphological ratio however after 6 h the loec value determined by the morphological ratio decreased and became lower than the growth rate as a result after 6 h the morphological ratio for all chemicals was more sensitive than the growth rate the morphological change result is less sensitive at 5 min than at other intervals but the loec values of the morphological change ratio and growth rate are the most similar morphological changes after 5 min appear to have the strongest correlation with the effect of a change in cell growth rate 3 3 relationship between growth rate and morphological changes cells undergo morphological changes before dying from toxicity therefore toxicity related morphological changes are expected to be related to the growth rate we compared the morphological changes of d tertiolecta with its growth rate fig 6 depicts a comparison of the growth rate and morphological changes healthy ratio for six hns the growth rate was determined from the 72 h growth inhibition test and morphological changes were used to calculate the healthy ratio the healthy ratio decreases with increasing toxic concentrations after 5 min 3 h and 6 h exposure fig s4 the healthy ratio of the 5 min exposure period had the strongest correlation with growth compared to the other exposure intervals consequently the relationship between the growth rate and the healthy ratio after 5 min of exposure was studied with increasing hns concentration both growth rate and healthy ratio decreased furthermore with the exception of acetone the growth rate and healthy ratio were closely related and showed similar trends the correlation coefficients for ethyl alcohol methyl alcohol acetone sulfuric acid phosphoric acid and ammonia were 0 85 0 82 0 57 0 95 0 95 and 0 87 respectively and the average correlation coefficient was 0 84 acetone has a low correlation coefficient of 0 57 which may be due to the fact that toxicity may have a faster and more sensitive effect on morphological changes than on the growth rate of d tertiolecta consequently morphological analysis could be a suitable substitute for the growth inhibition test in determining field toxicity in the field 4 conclusions in summary we used shadow imaging technology to characterize the morphological changes of d tertiolecta exposed to hns the feasibility of field analysis was established by examining the sensitivity of cell growth rate and the ratio of the morphological change to toxicity we developed a toxicity bioassay based on the changes in the morphological ratio circular cell ratio and healthy cell ratio this bioassay efficiently assesses cell morphology using a portable custom device cellytics based on lens free shadow imaging d tertiolecta was classified into live healthy and cystic and dead cells using the shadow parameter cmv and into healthy and cystic cells using the shadow parameter smd with 95 confidence this bioassay technology has shown that 20 out of 30 hnss can be tested for toxicity in less than 5 min using the morphological ratio circular ratio at ec50 however for accurate validation the experimentally determined ec50 should be considered in addition morphological changes were found to be more sensitive than growth with the noec of the circular ratio yielding a lower concentration at 5 min 3 h and 6 h for four five and six hns respectively than the noec of the growth ratio at 72 h furthermore the correlation coefficient between the morphology ratio healthy ratio after 5 min and the growth rate averaged 0 84 demonstrating the relationship between toxicity induced growth and morphological changes thus the proposed equipment and technology may provide an effective alternative to traditional on site toxicity testing and the prospect of faster morphological analysis may replace traditional growth inhibition testing in addition this technology has the potential to be used in a variety of fields including but not limited to medicine biosensing and the environment to monitor and assess cellular changes credit authorship contribution statement sanghoon shin investigation experimentation

15173,the accidental spill of hazardous and noxious substances hnss in the ocean has serious environmental and human health consequences assessing the ecotoxicity of seawater exposed to various hns is challenging due to the constant development of new hns or mixtures and assessment methods are also limited microalgae viability tests are often used among the various biological indicators for ecotoxicity testing as they are the primary producers in aquatic ecosystems however since the conventional cell growth rate test measures cell viability over three to four days using manual inspection under a conventional optical microscope it is labor and time intensive and prone to subjective errors in this study we propose a rapid and automated method to evaluate seawater ecotoxicity by quantification of the morphological changes of microalgae exposed to more than 30 hnss this method was further validated using conventional growth rate test results dunaliella tertiolecta a microalgae species without rigid cell walls was selected as the test organism its morphological changes in response to hns exposure were measured at the single cell level using a custom developed device that uses lens free shadow imaging technology the ecotoxicity evaluation induced by the morphological change could be available in as little as 5 min using the proposed method and device and it could be effective for 20 hnss out of 30 hnss tested moreover the test results of six selected hnss with high marine transport volume and toxicity revealed that the sensitivity of the proposed method extends to half the maximum effective concentration ec50 and even to the lowest observed effective concentration loec furthermore the average correlation index between the growth inhibition test three to four days and the proposed morphology changes test 5 min for the six selected hnss was 0 84 indicating great promise in the field of various point of care water quality monitoring thus the proposed equipment and technology may provide a viable alternative to traditional on site toxicity testing and the potential of rapid morphological analysis may replace traditional growth inhibition testing graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords hns bioassay lens free shadow imaging technology shadow parameters morphological change seawater ecotoxicity assessment data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction hazardous and noxious substances hnss are defined as any substance other than oil that if introduced into the marine environment is likely to create hazards to human health harm living resources and marine life damage amenities or interfere with other legitimate uses of the sea protocol 2000 with the development of industry and technology in recent years the use of hns has steadily increased and the majority of them are transported by sea cunha et al 2016 harold et al 2014 a significant increase in overseas transportation of hnss has led to a significant increase in spill accidents chen et al 2019 thus the increase in hns accidents has had a greater impact on the marine environment and human health cunha et al 2017 rocha et al 2016 however not only is it challenging to quantify the impact of hns in a short time but it also requires collecting a large amount of data furthermore most ecotoxicity results are based on experiments with freshwater organisms mamaca et al 2005 neuparth et al 2011 these ecotoxicity data should be interpreted with caution because freshwater organisms are less sensitive to chemicals than marine organisms spurgeon et al 2020 furthermore rapid and accurate assessment of water toxicity is critical for water safety however studying the toxicity of all chemicals in water is impossible because new chemicals with unknown ecotoxicity are introduced every year and their mixtures can have complex toxicity effects european commission and directorate general for health and consumers 2013 de almeida et al 2017 dévier et al 2011 a bioassay test for ecotoxicity is one of the most effective methods for determining the risk of toxicity bioassays involve direct toxicity assessments of samples brought into the laboratory and tested for toxicity in vivo using live cell populations of microorganisms as test organisms e g microalgae zooplankton fish crustaceans and luminescent bacteria delorenzo and fulton 2012 lapeña et al 2021 müller et al 2019 rozman and kalčíková 2021 tang et al 2022 viegas 2021 among the organisms used in bioassays microalgae are the primary producers of marine ecosystems and the basis of all food chains they account for more than half of the global net primary biomass production field et al 1998 microalgae are mainly used in toxicity tests due to their high sensitivity reproducibility and direct observation of toxic symptoms at the cellular level eom et al 2021 ramadass et al 2017 tato and beiras 2019 the growth inhibition test is a conventional microalgae toxicity study that examines the effects of a chemical on microalgae growth the microalgae are exposed to the test substance in batch cultures typically for 72 h and cell viability is measured every 24 h guideline 2001 however measuring the tiny microalgae with a microscope is difficult and time consuming and an accurate estimate of their growth rate is possible only after several generations of cells have divided therefore several studies have been conducted recently to monitor various biological changes such as photosynthetic activity and microalgal mobility using optical electrical and chemical methods to address this issue han et al 2019 ramadass et al 2017 seo et al 2015 zheng et al 2018 dunaliella tertiolecta d tertiolecta is a unicellular biflagellate green alga with a cell size of 10 12 μm that is used as a test species for ecotoxicity assessment because of its high sensitivity to the effects of various pollutants such as metals solvents pesticides and petrochemicals qian et al 2015 d tertiolecta lacks a rigid cell wall and changes shape from ellipsoid to an inflated or deflated form indicating the transition from a living to a dead state they have been reported to undergo morphological changes due to stress and toxicity baird and delorenzo 2010 chen et al 2017 pretti et al 2014 although these morphological changes can be used for toxicity evaluation it is difficult to separate the cells and observe their shape for example an optical microscope makes it easy to distinguish between living and dead cells however at low magnification 100 it is difficult to detect minute morphological changes as the boundaries become blurred furthermore due to the limited field of view fov of a microscope hundreds of microalgae cannot be analyzed simultaneously therefore using a microscope to assess toxicity based on morphological changes is challenging and other efficient measurement methods are needed the lens free shadow imaging technique lsit can assess the properties of a cell by analyzing its distinct shadow patterns mudanyali et al 2009 roy et al 2016b 2017 seo et al 2022 the lsit does not require expensive optical lenses and equipment for focusing a light emitting diode led and a complementary metal oxide semiconductor cmos image sensor can be used to collect the intrinsic fingerprint shadow patterns of cells lsit system can be built compactly because there is no lens and single cells can be measured quickly with a large fov previously we have demonstrated the possibility of assessing toxicity by measuring acute toxicity in hundreds of microalgae based on morphological changes seo et al 2020 we detected live d tertiolecta cells with the use of shadow parameters and was able to distinguish between elliptical spherical and swollen cells therefore in this study two shadow parameters circular cell ratio and healthy cell ratio were developed to classify the morphological changes of d tertiolecta exposed to hns enabling rapid ecotoxicity testing and on site monitoring a bioassay based on changes in cell morphological ratio was developed by evaluating the sensitivity of cell growth rate and ratio of morphological change to toxicity the morphological response and sensitivity test was conducted with 30 hns and the results of the 72 h growth inhibition test were compared with the growth rate and morphological changes of the same sample consequently a relationship was established between the toxicity of hns and two biological changes cell growth rate and the ratio of morphological changes in d tertiolecta this relationship enables on site monitoring of hns toxicity using cellytics in addition results of this bioassay using morphological changes were validated by comparison with algal growth rate this analysis technique may serve as an effective tool for on site toxicity assessment 2 material and methods 2 1 test organism microalgae from two suppliers were used for the experiment with 30 hns and the growth inhibition test the marine green microalga d tertiolecta used for the experiment with thirty hns was obtained from nlp co ltd busan korea d tertiolecta were grown for one year in a shaking incubator vs 8480sf l vision scientific co ltd daejeon korea the culture temperature was maintained at 20 21 c under a fluorescent light illumination of 6500 7250 lx prior to the experiment the seawater was filtered through a 0 45 µm pore size membrane filter cat no 7184 004 whatman maidstone uk d tertiolecta ccap 19 5 used in the growth inhibition test for comparison and verification of growth and morphology was obtained from the culture collection of algae and protozoa ccap scotland uk d tertiolecta were cultured for at least two weeks in a constant temperature room 20 c 2 c and test microalgae precultures were incubated at 20 21 c under continuous illumination at 6180 7020 lx for three to four days the microalgae used for the experiments were taken from precultures in the exponential growth phase 2 2 measuring device and analysis parameters lsit involves the formation of diffraction patterns when light from a point source passes through an aperture on a ccd or cmos sensor isikman et al 2009 ozcan and demirci 2008 when light is diffracted as it passes through the aperture it forms a series of light and dark bands known as diffraction patterns the diffraction pattern is determined by the size and shape of the aperture as well as the wavelength of the light in the case of a circular aperture the diffraction pattern consists of a central bright region called the airy disk surrounded by a series of concentric rings of varying intensity the intensity of the light in the diffraction pattern follows a characteristic pattern known as the airy function which decreases exponentially from the center of the airy disk to the edges in lsit the diffraction pattern is used to capture the image of an object roy et al 2016a when the object is placed in front of the aperture the diffraction pattern is modulated by the shadow of the object creating a unique pattern that can be used to reconstruct the image of the object greenbaum et al 2012 roy et al 2016b seo et al 2017 this enables high resolution imaging of small objects even at short distances without the use of a lens the physical and optical properties of an object such as its size shape and refractive index determine the characteristics of a diffraction pattern formed when the sample plane is illuminated with coherent light boominathan et al 2022 kim et al 2012 an optical microscope ckx31sf olympus japan and a custom developed device cellytics were used to measure the morphological changes of d tertiolecta cellytics fig 1 a enables automated counting and morphological analysis based on lsit which consists of a 470

f light from led is converted to semi coherent light by the pinhole mounted in front of led and a diffraction pattern shadow image is produced by cells placed in a specially designed disposable cell chip fig 1e chamber height 100 μm volume 10 μl mounted 0 1 mm below the cmos image sensor the device dimensions were 100 120 80 mm3 weighing 550 g cellytics was connected to a laptop via a usb c connector and captured shadow images of individual microalgae within 1 s using specially developed cellytics software the captured images were analyzed in 5 s using number concentration size and shadow parameters fig 1d cellytics had a fov of 23 52 mm2 and simultaneously measured cells at concentrations of up to 106 cells ml the morphological changes in d tertiolecta were compared with the same cells under the optical microscope fig 2 a a morphological difference was observed in the shadow pattern of d tertiolecta that was altered by toxicity shadow parameters were constructed to distinguish the morphological difference between the two cell states live and dead the central maximum value cmv the central value of the diffraction pattern was used as a criterion for distinguishing between live and dead cells a second shadow parameter the standard deviation of maxima to minima distance smd distinguished cell morphological changes due to toxicity the parameter smd corresponds to the brightness difference between the second and third concentric circles and is expressed as the standard deviation of the values of 24 zones at 15 intervals for the shadow parameter maxima to minima distance mmd fig 1g 2 3 materials and methods for testing 2 3 1 morphological changes at ec50 of hns as observed under the microscope the initial cell density in the control and treated exposed groups was approximately 8 10 104 cells ml cells were distributed in aliquots of 100 ml in 250 ml erlenmeyer flasks the experiments were performed in triplicate and the treated groups were exposed to the half maximal effective concentration ec50 of hns after 5 min of reaction time the morphology of cells from the control and exposed groups was compared by measuring cmv and smd the hnss were selected from compounds used extensively in maritime transport in korean ports ulsan gwangyang and daesan the ec50 used in this study were selected from the ec50 results of the us environmental protection agency epa which provides toxicity information through a knowledge base called ecotox ecotox n d as reference concentrations the following ec50 values were determined for 30 hnss purchased from sigma

morphological changes the hnss selected for this study met the following criteria i they are responsible for more than one million tons of cargo each year in korea ii they have been involved in at least two accidents and iii they are among the top 20 chemicals on the international maritime organization imo list six hnss ethyl alcohol methyl alcohol acetone sulfuric acid phosphoric acid and ammonia displayed physical behavior in the dissolved state and were diluted with filtered seawater at six different concentrations including controls a range finding test was performed to confirm the range of effective concentrations for d tertiolecta when there is no information regarding the effects of hns or when the concentrations are insufficient in a 72 h growth inhibition test d tertiolecta growth and morphology were measured using cells extracted from the same sample all conditions were in accordance with astm e1218 04 guidelines astm 1993 in addition the experiments were repeated two to four times per hns to ensure accuracy and repeatability the initial cell density of each interval was dispensed in 100 ml aliquots 5 6 104 cells ml in the 250 ml erlenmeyer flasks a conventional optical microscope was used to measure the growth rate every 24 h 0 h 24 h 48 h and 72 h and cellytics examined the morphological change of cells 5 min 3 h and 6 h after hns exposure lugol solution sigma aldrich was used to stain d tertiolecta detailed experimental conditions are provided in fig s1 supplementary information 2 5 analysis process 2 5 1 toxicity analysis of the growth rate and the morphological changes in the cells the circular ratio cr value was used to compare the change in cells affected by toxicity the circular ratio was calculated from 1 ml of the test solution exposed to toxicity for a specific time and the smd of the cells was measured using cellytics the cr was calculated at a specific smd value s m d α and is given by 1 c i r c u l a r r a t i o c r α s m d α m n where α is a comparison criterion n is the total number of cells measured and m is the number of cells smaller than the criterion value α the comparison of abnormal cells was calculated as the logarithmic increase in the change in cr in each control and exposed group flask conversely cells that were not affected by toxicity were referred to as healthy cells and counted as the number of cells greater than the α value the percentage of healthy cells estimated using shadow parameters was termed the healthy ratio the specific growth rate gr was calculated using eq 2 after taking 1 ml of the test solution every 24 h and counting the cell density directly under the optical microscope the average growth rate for a specific period was calculated as the logarithmic increase in the cell density of each flask in the control and exposed groups according to the following equation 2 μ i j ln x j ln x i t j t i d a y 1 where µ i j is the average specific growth rate from time i to time j t i and t j are the times for the start and end of the period respectively x i and x j are the cell densities at time i and j respectively 2 5 2 statistical analyses one way analysis of variance anova was used to evaluate whether there was a significant difference in growth and morphological changes between the control and exposed groups prior to using anova the data were examined for normality shapiro wilk test and homogeneity of variance bartlett test and the no observed effect concentration noec and lowest observed effect concentration loec were calculated using the dunnett multiple comparison procedure the ec50 was calculated using a point estimation method and the results were statistically analyzed using toxcalc 5 0 tidepool scientific software ca usa and spss statistics

conditions typically they have an elliptical shape but when exposed to toxins they transform into a circular shape moreover as the environment deteriorates the cell wall eventually disintegrates leading to death pretti et al 2014 the optical microscope and shadow images of d tertiolecta exposed to acetone are shown in fig 2a each diffraction pattern was quantified using the shadow parameters to differentiate between live elliptical cyst swollen and dead deflated cells fig 2b under nontoxic conditions the mean cmv and smd values of approximately 500 live cells were 146 17 and 9 35 respectively upon exposure to 37 5 mg l acetone the cells transformed into cyst cells with cmv and smd values of 148 13 and 6 45 respectively cmv showed minimal variation whereas smd was significantly reduced by approximately one third however when exposed to 75 mg l acetone the cells died and their cmv and smd values changed to 170 64 and 5 99 respectively when dead cells were compared with live cyst cells the smd value did not change significantly but there was a remarkable increase in the cmv value for dead cells finally each shadow parameter was statistically analyzed by a t test between two independent samples using spss statistics version 26 0 0 ibm corp fig 2c shows box and whisker plots for the cmv and smd the cmv distribution was clear and distinct in both live healthy and cystic and dead cells in contrast the smd distribution revealed a significant difference p 0 001 allowing the cells to be differentiated based on the shadow parameters 3 1 2 morphological changes in d tertiolecta exposed to ec50 of hnss we compared the cr of the control group with that of the exposed group to determine the extent of morphological changes induced by exposure to hnss previously we showed that the cumulative graph up to smd 6 reflects the effect of microalgae exposure on hns seo et al 2020 hence for optimal comparison the cr for measuring the transition from elliptical to circular shape due to exposure to ec50 was calculated using eq 1 based on the smd value of 6 α fig 3 shows the change in the cr values for thirty of the hnss twenty of the 30 substances showed statistically significant differences in cr values between the control and exposed cells p 0 01 the cr values of nineteen of these twenty substances i e acetone chloroform potassium hydroxide solution methacrylic acid ethyl alcohol methyl alcohol toluene phenol aniline acetic acid glycerin hydrochloric acid acetic anhydride tetrahydrofuran benzene ethylenediamine ethyl acrylate butyl alcohol and tert butanol increased compared to the control and these cr values differed by an average of 2 19 fold cells exposed to methacrylic acid showed the most significant morphological changes with a cr value that increased by more than fourfold from 17 54 to 80 01 the cr value of cells exposed to trichloroethylene decreased by approximately 50 from 24 64 to 13 40 thus due to toxicity the cells change shape usually spherical but sometimes taking on an elongated form furthermore 10 out of 30 chemicals showed similar changes in cr values between the control and exposed groups within the standard deviation because no data for d tertiolecta were found for the ec50 tested it is safe to assume that the tested ec50 has no effect on d tertiolecta however two thirds of the hns assessed induced a morphological change in cells exposed to hns within 5 min suggesting that morphological changes can be used to assess toxicity 3 2 comparison of growth rate and morphological change in section 3 1 2 we showed that morphological changes could be used to measure hns toxicity therefore we examined the results of a bioassay that measured morphology and population growth in the same sample using a 72 h growth inhibition test to determine the efficacy of assessing toxicity in the field based on morphological changes and the relationship between population growth and morphology 3 2 1 growth inhibition test for the d tertiolecta the d tertiolecta population was measured by an expert under a microscope to verify the growth rate in the 72 h growth inhibition test eq 2 was used to convert the measured number of cells into the specific growth rate fig 4 a shows the specific growth rate of d tertiolecta exposed to six different hnss using statistical approaches we determined the ec50 loec and noec which are indicators for assessing the risk of hns the ec50 loec and noec values of six different hnss derived from the growth rate study are given in table 1 of these six substances d tertiolecta was most sensitive to ammonia and least sensitive to methyl alcohol 3 2 2 measurement and analysis of morphology changes in the d tertiolecta cells exposed to six hnss the morphology changes of d tertiolecta in the 72 h growth inhibition test were assessed by non experts using cellytics at 5 min 3 h and 6 h the optimal analysis for each experiment may vary significantly due the sensitivity of the morphology to the environment the conditions of the experiment and the initial state of cells therefore in this experiment the smd threshold was set to a value between six and nine and examined the variation of the cr values as a function of hns concentration in the samples exposed for 5 min fig 4b ⅰ shows the variation of cr as a function of methyl alcohol concentration regardless of the smd threshold the cr exhibited a linear response since a similar linear cr response as a function of concentration was observed for the other five hns ethyl alcohol acetone sulfuric acid dilute phosphoric acid and ammonia only methyl alcohol is discussed in more detail in the text fig s2 the detailed results for the remaining hns can be found in the supplementary information figs s2 s4 based on the cr values it was possible to differentiate toxicity according to concentration regardless of the criterion used however in this experiment we chose smd 7 to detect the morphological changes of the cells optimally for smd 7 the slope of the plot of cr values against concentration was large 10 pp and the coefficient of determination r 2 between the hns concentration and the cr values was 0 9 furthermore we also examined morphological changes at three different time intervals and different concentrations of hnss fig 4b ⅱ shows the percent difference between the cr of the control and different concentrations of methyl alcohol after 5 min 3 h and 6 h of reaction time the percentage change was generally greater after 3 h and 6 h than after 5 min this could be because a longer reaction time may result in a greater number of reacting cells however since the reaction rate of each substance is different there was no correlation between the change in percentage points as a function of hns concentration or time between the different substances fig s3 the loec is the lowest measured concentration of a substance with a statistically significant effect on a test organism during a given exposure period organization for economic co operation and development 2006 after exposure to loec levels of methyl alcohol 20 000 mg ml for 5 min 3 h and 6 h the percentage point pp in cr values of cells was 13 77 1 15 22 35 2 40 and 20 06 3 63 respectively similarly when cells were exposed to all chemicals at loec levels for 3 h and 6 h cells showed a difference of more than 10 pp in cr values indicating that morphological changes are more sensitive than population growth table 2 finally we analyzed cells unaffected by toxicity to determine the relationship between growth rate and morphological change ratio since healthy cells actively proliferate one would anticipate that they would divide freely in the absence of toxicity thus a higher number of healthy cells leads to an increase in cell division and a larger population fig 4b iii shows the proportion of cells unaffected by toxicity healthy ratio as a function of methyl alcohol concentration and exposure time the healthy ratio represents a change in the ratio between healthy cells and the control group a linear decrease in healthy ratios was observed after 5 min 3 h and 6 h exposure to hns with r 2 values of 0 95 0 77 and 0 95 respectively these results showed that even at loec values of hns the cr values and healthy ratio were significantly altered in the exposed cells moreover a linear relationship between the healthy ratio and hns concentration makes this metric suitable for studying growth rates based on morphological changes 3 2 3 comparison of growth rate and morphological change ratio using the loec values obtained we compared the sensitivity of the two biological changes growth rate and morphological change ratio the loec of 6 hns evaluated by morphological changes showed different values at exposure times of 5 min 3 h and 6 h the loec values of ethyl alcohol methyl alcohol acetone sulfuric acid phosphoric acid and ammonia were determined to be 8333 3750 and 7083 mg l 16 250 5937 and 5937 mg l 2500 1250 and 3125 mg l 112 53 and 10 mg l 218 135 and 177 mg l and 100 62 5 and 6 25 mg l after 5 min 3 h and 6 h respectively a comparison of loec data derived from growth rate and morphological ratio changes is shown in fig 5 after 6 h of exposure morphological change results were more sensitive to all chemicals than growth rate results with lower loec values except for sulfuric acid and ammonia the morphological ratio yielded lower loec values than the growth rate after 5 min for all other chemicals after 5 min sulfuric acid and ammonia had higher loec values as determined by the morphological ratio however after 6 h the loec value determined by the morphological ratio decreased and became lower than the growth rate as a result after 6 h the morphological ratio for all chemicals was more sensitive than the growth rate the morphological change result is less sensitive at 5 min than at other intervals but the loec values of the morphological change ratio and growth rate are the most similar morphological changes after 5 min appear to have the strongest correlation with the effect of a change in cell growth rate 3 3 relationship between growth rate and morphological changes cells undergo morphological changes before dying from toxicity therefore toxicity related morphological changes are expected to be related to the growth rate we compared the morphological changes of d tertiolecta with its growth rate fig 6 depicts a comparison of the growth rate and morphological changes healthy ratio for six hns the growth rate was determined from the 72 h growth inhibition test and morphological changes were used to calculate the healthy ratio the healthy ratio decreases with increasing toxic concentrations after 5 min 3 h and 6 h exposure fig s4 the healthy ratio of the 5 min exposure period had the strongest correlation with growth compared to the other exposure intervals consequently the relationship between the growth rate and the healthy ratio after 5 min of exposure was studied with increasing hns concentration both growth rate and healthy ratio decreased furthermore with the exception of acetone the growth rate and healthy ratio were closely related and showed similar trends the correlation coefficients for ethyl alcohol methyl alcohol acetone sulfuric acid phosphoric acid and ammonia were 0 85 0 82 0 57 0 95 0 95 and 0 87 respectively and the average correlation coefficient was 0 84 acetone has a low correlation coefficient of 0 57 which may be due to the fact that toxicity may have a faster and more sensitive effect on morphological changes than on the growth rate of d tertiolecta consequently morphological analysis could be a suitable substitute for the growth inhibition test in determining field toxicity in the field 4 conclusions in summary we used shadow imaging technology to characterize the morphological changes of d tertiolecta exposed to hns the feasibility of field analysis was established by examining the sensitivity of cell growth rate and the ratio of the morphological change to toxicity we developed a toxicity bioassay based on the changes in the morphological ratio circular cell ratio and healthy cell ratio this bioassay efficiently assesses cell morphology using a portable custom device cellytics based on lens free shadow imaging d tertiolecta was classified into live healthy and cystic and dead cells using the shadow parameter cmv and into healthy and cystic cells using the shadow parameter smd with 95 confidence this bioassay technology has shown that 20 out of 30 hnss can be tested for toxicity in less than 5 min using the morphological ratio circular ratio at ec50 however for accurate validation the experimentally determined ec50 should be considered in addition morphological changes were found to be more sensitive than growth with the noec of the circular ratio yielding a lower concentration at 5 min 3 h and 6 h for four five and six hns respectively than the noec of the growth ratio at 72 h furthermore the correlation coefficient between the morphology ratio healthy ratio after 5 min and the growth rate averaged 0 84 demonstrating the relationship between toxicity induced growth and morphological changes thus the proposed equipment and technology may provide an effective alternative to traditional on site toxicity testing and the prospect of faster morphological analysis may replace traditional growth inhibition testing in addition this technology has the potential to be used in a variety of fields including but not limited to medicine biosensing and the environment to monitor and assess cellular changes credit authorship contribution statement sanghoon shin investigation experimentation

nox reduction in the anoxic stage li et al 2022a rubio rincon et al 2017 compared with conventional denitrification driven by exogenous organics ed can adequately utilize the organics in raw wastewater without the additional addition of organics li et al 2022b moreover with the addition of organics denitrification with high sludge yield leads to shorter solids residence time srt jenni et al 2014 while ed with a low carbon utilization rate favors the combination with autotrophic nitrogen removal due to the lower sludge yield van aalst van leeuwen et al 1997 paos and gaos are common endogenous heterotrophic bacteria in wwtps with ed capacity mcilroy et al 2014 oehmen et al 2007 as paos utilized more carbon sources for phosphorus metabolism their ed stability is susceptible to environmental factors carbon phosphorus ratio poly p levels and srt acevedo et al 2017 oehmen et al 2007 welles et al 2016 in contrast gao driven ed is considered to have more efficient carbon sources utilization and stable nitrogen removal dan et al 2021 ji et al 2020 given that both groups are favored to alternate anaerobic carbon rich aerobic carbon poor processes paos generally accompany gaos in municipal wastewater treatment mcilroy et al 2014 petriglieri et al 2021 besides the distinct endogenous carbon sources utilization pathways the uptake of organics by both groups in the anaerobic stage is competitive zekker et al 2021a poly p as the energy source used by paos to take up organics provides energy at a far higher rate than that obtained by gaos through glycolysis 1 0 mol atp mol poly p 0 5 mol atp mol gly smolders et al 1994 van groenestijn et al 1987 zeng et al 2003 therefore it is commonly observed that paos take up organics preferentially alongside the rapid release of phosphorus acevedo et al 2017 dan et al 2021 to increase the organics obtained by gaos and enhance ed considerable efforts have been made such as the setup of a pre anaerobic stage the extension of the anaerobic period organics addition and slow feeding ding et al 2022 kolakovic et al 2021 li et al 2022a miao et al 2018 for municipal wastewater with limited organics these measures were ineffective due to the unavoidable competition from paos poly p is the core energy source for the uptake of organics by paos a dramatic decrease in acetate uptake has been observed at low poly p levels acevedo et al 2017 acevedo et al 2012 because of this decreasing the poly p level is expected to optimize organics allocation between paos and gaos improving the ability of gaos to drive ed the mechanism for enhancing gao based ed to promote synergistic nitrogen removal with anammox in the treatment of real municipal wastewater however is not clear in the integrated pna sequencing batch reactor pna sbr employed in this study the level of poly p was decreased by the intermittent approximately 70 days introduction of high organics reject water to optimize carbon sources allocation between paos and gaos to reveal the enhanced mechanism of endogenous denitrification and its impacts on nitrogen removal the allocation and conversion of exogenous and endogenous carbon sources were evaluated along with variations in nitrogen removal performance during long term operation additionally short term experiments and community phylogenies were analyzed to further understand the nitrogen removal mechanisms of synergistic ed and anammox to the best of our knowledge previous studies have not provided a clear understanding of enhanced ed in combination with anammox for treating real municipal wastewater with intermittent poly p limitation understanding the mechanisms of nitrogen removal during enhanced ed as well as the hybridization of processes carried out by endogenous heterotrophic bacteria with anaob could broaden knowledge of anammox systems and facilitate the application of anammox based nitrogen removal technologies in mainstream wastewater treatment 2 materials and methods 2 1 reactor operation the activated sludge was inoculated from a lab scale pna sbr with nre and nitrite accumulation ratios of approximately 80 and 50 respectively wang et al 2023 the feed wastewater was collected from the septic tank in the faculty dormitory area beijing china table 1 the sbr was operated for 190 days with a working volume of 10 l maintained at 22 0 1 0 c

aerobic period and srt sun et al 2021 both parameters were extended to 3 5 h and 30 days respectively in phase ii days 41 90 fig s1 for optimizing organics allocation between paos and gaos reject water containing a substantial amount of volatile short chain fatty acids was introduced on days 97 and 167 of phase iii days 91 190 to promote phosphorus release and exclusion decreasing the poly p

stirred anaerobically for 3 0 h as the pha synthesis reached maximum levels phosphorus release reached 80 0 mg l fig s2a b following sedimentation the phosphorus rich supernatant was excluded followed by aeration and anoxic stirring to complete the metabolic cycle of paos and gaos fig s2a the poly p vss decreased from 0 0281 to 0 0078 mg p mg vss fig s2c 2 3 short term experiments to determine nitrogen removal pathways in the anoxic stage from days 121 to 161 short term experiments were conducted to determine the correlation of nitrogen removal between ed and anammox in the anoxic stage on day 121 the activated sludge inoculated in the parent reactor was incubated in a 2l sbr the influent used was the same municipal wastewater used in the parent reactor the process operated in the same mode as the parent reactor in phase iii anaerobic stirring 2 0 h aeration 2 0 h anoxic stirring 6 0 h the dissolved oxygen do was decreased to 1 0 1 5 mg l to control residual ammonium so that the nitrite produced was not sufficient for anammox to occur the daily variation of nitrogen removal performance and pathways of typical cycles were detected and analyzed 2 4 chemical analysis the

alignment and phylogenetic analysis using blast and mega version 11 0 li et al 2019 3 results and discussion 3 1 energy substance conversion by endogenous heterotrophic bacteria during the experiment the majority of organics 80 in the raw wastewater were stored as endogenous carbon sources by endogenous heterotrophic bacteria paos and gaos fig 1 a in phase i in the anaerobic stage 81 3 8 6 of the organics were stored of which 64 8 10 6 were consumed by pam while 31 6 7 6 were consumed by gam fig 1b eqs s1 4 as the aerobic period and srt increased in phase ii the nitrate produced by nitrification was not completely removed by endogenous denitrification ed and the remaining nitrate was reduced by denitrifiers utilizing exogenous organics in the anaerobic stage here the organics stored as endogenous carbon sources decreased to 68 4 7 1 with the exclusion of phosphorus rich supernatant in phase iii poly p the primary energy source for organics uptake by paos decreased from 0 0281 to 0 0078 mg p mg vss fig 1c and organics stored through gam increased to 57 7 8 1 exceeding those stored by pam the total organics stored as endogenous carbon sources in the anaerobic stage increased to 82 6 12 6 in contrast to poly p vss in phase iii both pha and gly increased from 1 3 0 1 and 12 6 0 3 mmol c l to 2 2 0 1 and 19 9 0 4 mmol c l respectively fig 1d as gly served as the primary energy source driving ed in the anoxic stage the proportion of phv in the pha increased from 9 8 1 9 to 37 6 3 3 this could be due to more energy production using gly during this phase and thus more reduced equivalents nadh produced through glycolysis were available for phb and phv synthesis welles et al 2016 the stoichiometric parameters showed that gly pha increased from 0 75 0 13 and 0 86 0 15 mmol c mmol c to 1 33 0 18 and 1 45 0 24 mmol c mmol c in the anaerobic and aerobic stages respectively while p pha decreased from 0 97 0 14 and 1 15 0 16 mmol p mmol c to 0 27 0 09 and 0 29 0 07 mmol p mmol c respectively this corresponded with the trends seen for gly cod and p cod in the anaerobic stage table 2 and was consistent with trends in parameters seen for gam dominated systems in previous studies acevedo et al 2017 acevedo et al 2012 welles et al 2016 the abundance of genes pfk pyk zwf fbp involved in glycolysis and gluconeogenesis increased in phase iii fig s3 together these results show that optimization of carbon allocation between paos and gaos through the exclusion of phosphorus rich supernatant could strengthen gam this might enhance gao driven endogenous denitrification dan et al 2021 vocks et al 2005 3 2 nitrogen removal characteristics 3 2 1 variations in long term nitrogen removal performance after inoculation days 1 to 10 nre was maintained at approximately 80 with large amounts of nitrate present in the effluent 11 5 2 1 mg l fig 2 a b ammonium oxidation and nitrogen removal were poor in phase i due to the short srt and aerobic period that were necessary for the enrichment of endogenous heterotrophic bacteria figs 2a and s4a with restored nitrification performance in phase ii prolonged srt and aerobic period sun et al 2021 nitrogen removal in the anoxic stage increased to 19 3 3 8 mg l 64 2 13 4 and nre increased to 92 6 figs 2a c and s4b despite this 5 6 2 0 mg l of no3 n remained in the effluent that was not removed by ed or combined anammox fig 2b this suggested that with limited carbon cod n 2 8 0 2 the organics needed further allocation optimization to enhance nitrate removal by ed with the exclusion of the phosphorus rich supernatant and more organics allocated to gam as described above fig 1 the nitrogen removal in the anoxic stage increased to 26 4 2 5 mg l 70 6 4 2 and nitrogen removal by ed increased from 3 2 0 8 mg l during inoculation to 15 2 2 2 mg l 39 4 5 0 fig 2c d and eqs s6 9 the no3 n in the effluent was rapidly reduced to 0 7 0 6 mg l in phase iii and the nre was increased to 97 5 2 2 the effluent in this phase contained 0 5 0 3 mg l of nh4 n and 0 4 0 4 mg l of no2 n figs 2a b s4c and s5 moreover nitrogen removal rates significantly increased from 46 6 3 7 in the initial inoculation period to 79 4 4 3 mg n g vss d eqs s10 13 consequently the ed capacity was significantly enhanced following the exclusion of the phosphorus rich supernatant interestingly during this phase the nitrogen removal by anammox remained constant at 11 3 1 9 mg l 31 2 4 3 fig 2d despite the inadequate supply of nitrite and the enhanced ed fig 2b miao et al 2018 this was likely due to the collaboration between anammox and ed in maintaining stable anammox performance 3 2 2 nitrogen removal characteristics in short term experiments short term experiments were conducted to clarify the correlation between ed and anammox reducing electron acceptors in the anoxic stage when do was decreased to 1 0 1 5 mg l the remaining nh4 n increased to 10 0 15 0 mg l and the no2 n and no3 n produced were 8 0 10 0 and 10 0 15 0 mg l respectively ammonium was completely removed despite the insufficient nitrite supply in the anoxic stage fig s6a b following the complete depletion of nitrite in the typical cycle nitrate served as an electron acceptor for ammonium oxidation through anammox fig 3 b with no2 nh4 of 0 91 0 11 well below the theoretical value of 1 32 du et al 2020 endogenous partial denitrification epd provided an additional 4 2 1 6 mg l of nitrite to anammox fig 3a these results were consistent with the results of in situ tests where extra ammonium was added to the parent reactor at the end of the aerobic stage fig s7 taken together the results show that ed did not compete with anammox for nitrite instead providing nitrite to anammox through nitrate reduction and maintaining stable anammox performance 3 3 variations in nitrogen removal capacity and associated functional bacteria and genes the nitrogen removal rate was evaluated periodically alongside the absolute abundance of functional genes and microorganisms in phase i short srt the absolute abundance of genes from aob amoa nob nitrobacter and nitrospira and anaob decreased to 1 0 0 2 104 3 2 0 4 105 and 9 8 0 3 105 copies ng dna respectively fig 4 c as expected with prolonged srt and aerobic period in phase ii the absolute abundance of these organisms then increased to 3 9 0 4 106 1 2 0 2 106 and 4 9 0 2 106 copies ng dna respectively these results matched trends in ammonium oxidation nitrate production and anammox nitrogen removal rates fig 4a endogenous heterotrophic bacteria were also significantly enriched in this phase with the absolute abundance of gaos and paos increasing to 1 7 0 5 107 and 6 8 0 3 106 copies ng dna respectively in phase iii when phosphorus rich supernatant was excluded the absolute abundance of gaos increased to 2 9 0 2 107 copies ng dna much higher than that of paos 1 6 0 5 107 copies ng dna this was accompanied by an increase in ed rate from 0 2 to 1 4 mg n g vss h fig 4a c and eqs s10 13 the absolute abundance of nob decreased to 5 7 0 6 105 copies ng dna accompanied by a decrease in nitrate production rate this was likely due to competition for do with the enriched endogenous heterotrophic bacteria li et al 2017 wang et al 2016 the anaob was not affected by the prevalence of endogenous heterotrophic bacteria the absolute abundance of anaob and related functional genes hzsb hdh increased to 8 3 0 2 106 and 6 4 0 5 106 copies ng dna respectively fig 4b and the anammox nitrogen removal rate of remained constant at approximately 1 0 mg n g vss h notably the absolute abundance of the genes encoding nitrate reductase napa narg increased to 5 6 0 4 107 copies ng dna nearly twice as high as genes encoding nitrite reductase nirs nirk 3 0 0 2 107 copies ng dna accordingly the nitrate reduction rate could have been much higher than nitrite reduction during this period alleviating the competition between ed and anammox for nitrite and contributing to closing the nitrate loop lawson et al 2017 orschler et al 2021 3 4 succession of microbial community structure extracted dna samples from each phase were analyzed using 16s rrna gene amplicon sequencing at the phylum level proteobacteria were dominant with relative abundance consistently increasing from 31 5 inoculation period to 45 1 phase iii fig 5 a gammaproteobacteria were dominant out of the only two different classes detected alphaproteobacteria and gammaproteobacteria with their relative abundance increasing from 25 8 to 39 9 at the genus level the functional genera varied in accordance with the qpcr results fig 5b following the exclusion of phosphorus rich supernatants the relative abundance of nitrospira and ca ntrotoga nob decreased from 1 0 to 0 6 while nitrosomonas aob and ca brocadia anaob remained steady at 0 4 and 0 3 respectively the relative abundance of ca competibacter gao a gammaproteobacteria increased significantly from 3 4 to 5 7 and became dominant far exceeding the abundance of ca accumulibacter pao 3 5 interestingly even though ca competibacter maintained a high relative abundance 3 9 after inoculation the ed capacity was still poor until improving dramatically in phase ⅲ fig 2 to further clarify this variation in ed capacity which was driven by gaos the phylogeny of ca competibacter was analyzed at the otu level twenty three otus belong to ca competibacter was distributed among more than eight identified subgroups gb fig 5c among these gb3 was dominant though its relative abundance decreased dramatically from 47 2 to 36 1 previous studies have shown that gb3 is not capable of reducing nox n kim et al 2011 kong et al 2002 this may account for the poor ed performance when there was a high abundance of ca competibacter at inoculation the abundance of gb1 gb4 and gb5 known to perform ed mcilroy et al 2014 increased significantly from 27 3 inoculation period to 41 8 phase ⅲ specifically gb1 which contains the complete set of genes encoding denitrification no3 n n2 increased from 18 2 to 20 7 kong et al 2006 mcilroy et al 2014 while gb4 and gb5 containing only genes encoding nitrate reduction no3 n no2 n kim et al 2011 kong et al 2006 wang et al 2021a increased significantly from 9 1 to 21 1 taken together these results indicated the potential for ed driven by ca competibacter gao was significantly enhanced after optimizing carbon allocation and establishment of nitrate cycling with anammox 3 5 implications with unstable partial nitrification pna generally suffers from excessive nitrate production in wwtps du et al 2020 ji et al 2020 wang et al 2022 limited organics in raw wastewater are oxidized to carbon dioxide during nitrification requiring additional organic material such as acetate to be added to reduce the excess nitrate through denitrification du et al 2022 li et al 2020 in the absence of nitrite and with nob competition the retention of anaob is challenging even with biofilm or granulation li et al 2017 wang et al 2021b this study demonstrated that gaos could efficiently utilize the limited organics found in municipal wastewater cod n 2 8 0 1 in combination with anaob to enhance nitrogen removal 97 5 2 2 this was done by optimizing the allocation of organics between paos and gaos more organics were employed by gaos to drive ed for nitrification and anammox generated nitrate reduction and the gao subgroups gb4 gb5 of ca competibacter gao provided the substrate for anaob by reducing nitrate to nitrite because of this the stability of partial nitrification and the ratio of nitrite to ammonium no2 nh4 were no longer strict requirements for stable anammox fux et al 2002 li et al 2020 mccarty 2018 the growth of nob with a low affinity for oxygen was inhibited due to the competition for do from the prevalent endogenous heterotrophic bacteria wang et al 2016 wu et al 2017 which likely led to the decrease in nob abundance and the increase in nitrite accumulation in phase iii figs 2b and 4c the nitrogen lost in the aerobic stage increased to 9 1 2 4 mg l fig 2c indicating the enhancement of anammox or simultaneous nitrification anammox and denitrification singh et al 2022 together these conditions were conducive to anaob retention in real municipal wastewater and allowed for synergistic nitrogen removal by the synergistic processes in anaob endogenous heterotrophic bacteria system megatons of phosphorus are lost in wwtps each year guo and li 2020 tian et al 2017 with the continuous replenishment of poly p by paos fig 1c the intermittent exclusion of phosphorus rich supernatant which was done for approximately 70 days here could effectively recover phosphorus from municipal wastewater through chemical precipitation guo and li 2020 it is noteworthy that the enrichment of ca accumulibacter clade ii when phosphorus rich supernatant was eliminated allowed for a continuous increase in the abundance of ca accumulibacter pao figs 5b and s11 this might be because this clade switched between poly p and gly hydrolysis for energy when different poly p levels were present acevedo et al 2017 welles et al 2016 overall the survival of this clade could facilitate sustainable phosphorus recovery in wastewater treatment it should be noted however that the phosphorus removal performance of ca accumulibacter clade ii was unstable due to the alternation between saturation and depletion of poly p fig s10 different subclades of ca accumulibacter clade ii exhibits distinct phosphorus removal abilities kolakovic et al 2021 and therefore improved phosphorus removal performance should be further investigated the technology of reusing reject water as organic matter for nitrogen removal in wwtps is increasingly utilized jenni et al 2014 liu et al 2017 the use of phosphorus rich supernatant exclusion by using reject water also promotes energy self sufficiency in wwtps furthermore nitrate is generally a product of nitrification which as demonstrated in this work could induce the proliferation of subgroups of ca competibacter that reduces nitrate fig 5c it is worth noting that optimizing the carbon allocation between paos and gaos directly in the full scale mainstream nitrogen removal process could pose a shock to the system since the effects of the introduction of reject water on the community were not established fully even if the introduction of organics was intermittent wang et al 2020 inducing the release of poly p from activated sludge in the side stream and therefore improving the ability of endogenous heterotrophic bacteria and anaob to remove nitrogen might further the flexible application of pna 4 conclusion this study demonstrated the optimization of the allocation of organics between paos and gaos by excluding phosphorus rich supernatant facilitating nitrogen removal from municipal wastewater through a synergistic process involving endogenous heterotrophic bacteria and anaob the specific conclusions were as follows with the decrease of poly p level gam used more organics than pam in the anaerobic stage predominating the endogenous metabolism glycogen was the primary driving energy source for ed in the anoxic stage the abundance of ca competibacter gao increased from 3 4 to 5 7 following the exclusion of the phosphorus rich supernatant contributing to a significant enhancement in the ed capacity and resulting in a rapid decrease of effluent nitrate to 0 7 0 6 mg l when nitrite was insufficient the proliferation of the subgroups of ca competibacter that reduces nitrate to nitrite exclusively supplemented anammox with substrate produced epd this guaranteed that the anaob population and performance would remain stable

important goals in wastewater treatment plant wwtp construction and renovation compared to traditional nitrification denitrification nitrogen removal processes partial nitrification combined with anammox pna removes ammonium and nitrite simultaneously producing 11 2 nitrate du et al 2020 fux et al 2002 as a completely autotrophic nitrogen removal technology pna requires no organics and less aeration energy while generating lower sludge yields this process has been attempted extensively for mainstream nitrogen removal agrawal et al 2018 li et al 2022a zekker et al 2021b to reduce unstable partial nitrification and anammox generated nitrate in the effluent denitrification endogenous denitrification ed is used ji et al 2020 singh et al 2022 ed is characterized by its ability to store exogenous organics as slowly degrading endogenous carbon sources polyhydroxyalkanoates pha and glycogen gly in the anaerobic stage decreasing their oxidation to co2 during nitrification and driving nox reduction in the anoxic stage li et al 2022a rubio rincon et al 2017 compared with conventional denitrification driven by exogenous organics ed can adequately utilize the organics in raw wastewater without the additional addition of organics li et al 2022b moreover with the addition of organics denitrification with high sludge yield leads to shorter solids residence time srt jenni et al 2014 while ed with a low carbon utilization rate favors the combination with autotrophic nitrogen removal due to the lower sludge yield van aalst van leeuwen et al 1997 paos and gaos are common endogenous heterotrophic bacteria in wwtps with ed capacity mcilroy et al 2014 oehmen et al 2007 as paos utilized more carbon sources for phosphorus metabolism their ed stability is susceptible to environmental factors carbon phosphorus ratio poly p levels and srt acevedo et al 2017 oehmen et al 2007 welles et al 2016 in contrast gao driven ed is considered to have more efficient carbon sources utilization and stable nitrogen removal dan et al 2021 ji et al 2020 given that both groups are favored to alternate anaerobic carbon rich aerobic carbon poor processes paos generally accompany gaos in municipal wastewater treatment mcilroy et al 2014 petriglieri et al 2021 besides the distinct endogenous carbon sources utilization pathways the uptake of organics by both groups in the anaerobic stage is competitive zekker et al 2021a poly p as the energy source used by paos to take up organics provides energy at a far higher rate than that obtained by gaos through glycolysis 1 0 mol atp mol poly p 0 5 mol atp mol gly smolders et al 1994 van groenestijn et al 1987 zeng et al 2003 therefore it is commonly observed that paos take up organics preferentially alongside the rapid release of phosphorus acevedo et al 2017 dan et al 2021 to increase the organics obtained by gaos and enhance ed considerable efforts have been made such as the setup of a pre anaerobic stage the extension of the anaerobic period organics addition and slow feeding ding et al 2022 kolakovic et al 2021 li et al 2022a miao et al 2018 for municipal wastewater with limited organics these measures were ineffective due to the unavoidable competition from paos poly p is the core energy source for the uptake of organics by paos a dramatic decrease in acetate uptake has been observed at low poly p levels acevedo et al 2017 acevedo et al 2012 because of this decreasing the poly p level is expected to optimize organics allocation between paos and gaos improving the ability of gaos to drive ed the mechanism for enhancing gao based ed to promote synergistic nitrogen removal with anammox in the treatment of real municipal wastewater however is not clear in the integrated pna sequencing batch reactor pna sbr employed in this study the level of poly p was decreased by the intermittent approximately 70 days introduction of high organics reject water to optimize carbon sources allocation between paos and gaos to reveal the enhanced mechanism of endogenous denitrification and its impacts on nitrogen removal the allocation and conversion of exogenous and endogenous carbon sources were evaluated along with variations in nitrogen removal performance during long term operation additionally short term experiments and community phylogenies were analyzed to further understand the nitrogen removal mechanisms of synergistic ed and anammox to the best of our knowledge previous studies have not provided a clear understanding of enhanced ed in combination with anammox for treating real municipal wastewater with intermittent poly p limitation understanding the mechanisms of nitrogen removal during enhanced ed as well as the hybridization of processes carried out by endogenous heterotrophic bacteria with anaob could broaden knowledge of anammox systems and facilitate the application of anammox based nitrogen removal technologies in mainstream wastewater treatment 2 materials and methods 2 1 reactor operation the activated sludge was inoculated from a lab scale pna sbr with nre and nitrite accumulation ratios of approximately 80 and 50 respectively wang et al 2023 the feed wastewater was collected from the septic tank in the faculty dormitory area beijing china table 1 the sbr was operated for 190 days with a working volume of 10 l maintained at 22 0 1 0 c with a heating rod the process was run in two 12 hour cycles per day consisting of six stages anaerobic stirring 2 0 h with 10 min feeding aeration 1 5 3 5 h anoxic stirring 4 0 6 0 h settling 10 0

were tested under alternating anaerobic aerobic anoxic conditions to enrich endogenous heterotrophic bacteria paos and gaos oehmen et al 2007 to restore the nitrification capacity inhibited at a short aerobic period and srt sun et al 2021 both parameters were extended to 3 5 h and 30 days respectively in phase ii days 41 90 fig s1 for optimizing organics allocation between paos and gaos reject water containing a substantial amount of volatile short chain fatty acids was introduced on days 97 and 167 of phase iii days 91 190 to promote phosphorus release and exclusion decreasing the poly p level table s1 during the phosphorus release and exclusion municipal wastewater was blended with the reject water at a ratio of 9 0 1 0 chemical oxygen demand cod of approximately 600 0 mg l and stirred anaerobically for 3 0 h as the pha synthesis reached maximum levels phosphorus release reached 80 0 mg l fig s2a b following sedimentation the phosphorus rich supernatant was excluded followed by aeration and anoxic stirring to complete the metabolic cycle of paos and gaos fig s2a the poly p vss decreased from 0 0281 to 0 0078 mg p mg vss fig s2c 2 3 short term experiments to determine nitrogen removal pathways in the anoxic stage from days 121 to 161 short term experiments were conducted to determine the correlation of nitrogen removal between ed and anammox in the anoxic stage on day 121 the activated sludge inoculated in the parent reactor was incubated in a 2l sbr the influent used was the same municipal wastewater used in the parent reactor the process operated in the same mode as the parent reactor in phase iii anaerobic stirring 2 0 h aeration 2 0 h anoxic stirring 6 0 h the dissolved oxygen do was decreased to 1 0 1 5 mg l to control residual ammonium so that the nitrite produced was not sufficient for anammox to occur the daily variation of nitrogen removal performance and pathways of typical cycles were detected and analyzed 2 4 chemical analysis the concentrations of nh4 n no2 n no3 n po4 3 p cod mlss and mlvss in samples taken daily were determined according to previous studies du et al 2020 li et al 2022a activated sludge was collected periodically to analyze the cyclical variations of endogenous carbon sources the lyophilized sludge was pyrolyzed with trichloromethane at 105 c for 20 0 h and pha both poly βhydroxybutyrate phb and poly β hydroxyvalerate phv were measured using gas chromatography 7890a agilent technologies inc usa kolakovic et al 2021 corresponding sludge samples were pyrolyzed with 0 6 m l hydrochloric acids at

alignment and phylogenetic analysis using blast and mega version 11 0 li et al 2019 3 results and discussion 3 1 energy substance conversion by endogenous heterotrophic bacteria during the experiment the majority of organics 80 in the raw wastewater were stored as endogenous carbon sources by endogenous heterotrophic bacteria paos and gaos fig 1 a in phase i in the anaerobic stage 81 3 8 6 of the organics were stored of which 64 8 10 6 were consumed by pam while 31 6 7 6 were consumed by gam fig 1b eqs s1 4 as the aerobic period and srt increased in phase ii the nitrate produced by nitrification was not completely removed by endogenous denitrification ed and the remaining nitrate was reduced by denitrifiers utilizing exogenous organics in the anaerobic stage here the organics stored as endogenous carbon sources decreased to 68 4 7 1 with the exclusion of phosphorus rich supernatant in phase iii poly p the primary energy source for organics uptake by paos decreased from 0 0281 to 0 0078 mg p mg vss fig 1c and organics stored through gam increased to 57 7 8 1 exceeding those stored by pam the total organics stored as endogenous carbon sources in the anaerobic stage increased to 82 6 12 6 in contrast to poly p vss in phase iii both pha and gly increased from 1 3 0 1 and 12 6 0 3 mmol c l to 2 2 0 1 and 19 9 0 4 mmol c l respectively fig 1d as gly served as the primary energy source driving ed in the anoxic stage the proportion of phv in the pha increased from 9 8 1 9 to 37 6 3 3 this could be due to more energy production using gly during this phase and thus more reduced equivalents nadh produced through glycolysis were available for phb and phv synthesis welles et al 2016 the stoichiometric parameters showed that gly pha increased from 0 75 0 13 and 0 86 0 15 mmol c mmol c to 1 33 0 18 and 1 45 0 24 mmol c mmol c in the anaerobic and aerobic stages respectively while p pha decreased from 0 97 0 14 and 1 15 0 16 mmol p mmol c to 0 27 0 09 and 0 29 0 07 mmol p mmol c respectively this corresponded with the trends seen for gly cod and p cod in the anaerobic stage table 2 and was consistent with trends in parameters seen for gam dominated systems in previous studies acevedo et al 2017 acevedo et al 2012 welles et al 2016 the abundance of genes pfk pyk zwf fbp involved in glycolysis and gluconeogenesis increased in phase iii fig s3 together these results show that optimization of carbon allocation between paos and gaos through the exclusion of phosphorus rich supernatant could strengthen gam this might enhance gao driven endogenous denitrification dan et al 2021 vocks et al 2005 3 2 nitrogen removal characteristics 3 2 1 variations in long term nitrogen removal performance after inoculation days 1 to 10 nre was maintained at approximately 80 with large amounts of nitrate present in the effluent 11 5 2 1 mg l fig 2 a b ammonium oxidation and nitrogen removal were poor in phase i due to the short srt and aerobic period that were necessary for the enrichment of endogenous heterotrophic bacteria figs 2a and s4a with restored nitrification performance in phase ii prolonged srt and aerobic period sun et al 2021 nitrogen removal in the anoxic stage increased to 19 3 3 8 mg l 64 2 13 4 and nre increased to 92 6 figs 2a c and s4b despite this 5 6 2 0 mg l of no3 n remained in the effluent that was not removed by ed or combined anammox fig 2b this suggested that with limited carbon cod n 2 8 0 2 the organics needed further allocation optimization to enhance nitrate removal by ed with the exclusion of the phosphorus rich supernatant and more organics allocated to gam as described above fig 1 the nitrogen removal in the anoxic stage increased to 26 4 2 5 mg l 70 6 4 2 and nitrogen removal by ed increased from 3 2 0 8 mg l during inoculation to 15 2 2 2 mg l 39 4 5 0 fig 2c d and eqs s6 9 the no3 n in the effluent was rapidly reduced to 0 7 0 6 mg l in phase iii and the nre was increased to 97 5 2 2 the effluent in this phase contained 0 5 0 3 mg l of nh4 n and 0 4 0 4 mg l of no2 n figs 2a b s4c and s5 moreover nitrogen removal rates significantly increased from 46 6 3 7 in the initial inoculation period to 79 4 4 3 mg n g vss d eqs s10 13 consequently the ed capacity was significantly enhanced following the exclusion of the phosphorus rich supernatant interestingly during this phase the nitrogen removal by anammox remained constant at 11 3 1 9 mg l 31 2 4 3 fig 2d despite the inadequate supply of nitrite and the enhanced ed fig 2b miao et al 2018 this was likely due to the collaboration between anammox and ed in maintaining stable anammox performance 3 2 2 nitrogen removal characteristics in short term experiments short term experiments were conducted to clarify the correlation between ed and anammox reducing electron acceptors in the anoxic stage when do was decreased to 1 0 1 5 mg l the remaining nh4 n increased to 10 0 15 0 mg l and the no2 n and no3 n produced were 8 0 10 0 and 10 0 15 0 mg l respectively ammonium was completely removed despite the insufficient nitrite supply in the anoxic stage fig s6a b following the complete depletion of nitrite in the typical cycle nitrate served as an electron acceptor for ammonium oxidation through anammox fig 3 b with no2 nh4 of 0 91 0 11 well below the theoretical value of 1 32 du et al 2020 endogenous partial denitrification epd provided an additional 4 2 1 6 mg l of nitrite to anammox fig 3a these results were consistent with the results of in situ tests where extra ammonium was added to the parent reactor at the end of the aerobic stage fig s7 taken together the results show that ed did not compete with anammox for nitrite instead providing nitrite to anammox through nitrate reduction and maintaining stable anammox performance 3 3 variations in nitrogen removal capacity and associated functional bacteria and genes the nitrogen removal rate was evaluated periodically alongside the absolute abundance of functional genes and microorganisms in phase i short srt the absolute abundance of genes from aob amoa nob nitrobacter and nitrospira and anaob decreased to 1 0 0 2 104 3 2 0 4 105 and 9 8 0 3 105 copies ng dna respectively fig 4 c as expected with prolonged srt and aerobic period in phase ii the absolute abundance of these organisms then increased to 3 9 0 4 106 1 2 0 2 106 and 4 9 0 2 106 copies ng dna respectively these results matched trends in ammonium oxidation nitrate production and anammox nitrogen removal rates fig 4a endogenous heterotrophic bacteria were also significantly enriched in this phase with the absolute abundance of gaos and paos increasing to 1 7 0 5 107 and 6 8 0 3 106 copies ng dna respectively in phase iii when phosphorus rich supernatant was excluded the absolute abundance of gaos increased to 2 9 0 2 107 copies ng dna much higher than that of paos 1 6 0 5 107 copies ng dna this was accompanied by an increase in ed rate from 0 2 to 1 4 mg n g vss h fig 4a c and eqs s10 13 the absolute abundance of nob decreased to 5 7 0 6 105 copies ng dna accompanied by a decrease in nitrate production rate this was likely due to competition for do with the enriched endogenous heterotrophic bacteria li et al 2017 wang et al 2016 the anaob was not affected by the prevalence of endogenous heterotrophic bacteria the absolute abundance of anaob and related functional genes hzsb hdh increased to 8 3 0 2 106 and 6 4 0 5 106 copies ng dna respectively fig 4b and the anammox nitrogen removal rate of remained constant at approximately 1 0 mg n g vss h notably the absolute abundance of the genes encoding nitrate reductase napa narg increased to 5 6 0 4 107 copies ng dna nearly twice as high as genes encoding nitrite reductase nirs nirk 3 0 0 2 107 copies ng dna accordingly the nitrate reduction rate could have been much higher than nitrite reduction during this period alleviating the competition between ed and anammox for nitrite and contributing to closing the nitrate loop lawson et al 2017 orschler et al 2021 3 4 succession of microbial community structure extracted dna samples from each phase were analyzed using 16s rrna gene amplicon sequencing at the phylum level proteobacteria were dominant with relative abundance consistently increasing from 31 5 inoculation period to 45 1 phase iii fig 5 a gammaproteobacteria were dominant out of the only two different classes detected alphaproteobacteria and gammaproteobacteria with their relative abundance increasing from 25 8 to 39 9 at the genus level the functional genera varied in accordance with the qpcr results fig 5b following the exclusion of phosphorus rich supernatants the relative abundance of nitrospira and ca ntrotoga nob decreased from 1 0 to 0 6 while nitrosomonas aob and ca brocadia anaob remained steady at 0 4 and 0 3 respectively the relative abundance of ca competibacter gao a gammaproteobacteria increased significantly from 3 4 to 5 7 and became dominant far exceeding the abundance of ca accumulibacter pao 3 5 interestingly even though ca competibacter maintained a high relative abundance 3 9 after inoculation the ed capacity was still poor until improving dramatically in phase ⅲ fig 2 to further clarify this variation in ed capacity which was driven by gaos the phylogeny of ca competibacter was analyzed at the otu level twenty three otus belong to ca competibacter was distributed among more than eight identified subgroups gb fig 5c among these gb3 was dominant though its relative abundance decreased dramatically from 47 2 to 36 1 previous studies have shown that gb3 is not capable of reducing nox n kim et al 2011 kong et al 2002 this may account for the poor ed performance when there was a high abundance of ca competibacter at inoculation the abundance of gb1 gb4 and gb5 known to perform ed mcilroy et al 2014 increased significantly from 27 3 inoculation period to 41 8 phase ⅲ specifically gb1 which contains the complete set of genes encoding denitrification no3 n n2 increased from 18 2 to 20 7 kong et al 2006 mcilroy et al 2014 while gb4 and gb5 containing only genes encoding nitrate reduction no3 n no2 n kim et al 2011 kong et al 2006 wang et al 2021a increased significantly from 9 1 to 21 1 taken together these results indicated the potential for ed driven by ca competibacter gao was significantly enhanced after optimizing carbon allocation and establishment of nitrate cycling with anammox 3 5 implications with unstable partial nitrification pna generally suffers from excessive nitrate production in wwtps du et al 2020 ji et al 2020 wang et al 2022 limited organics in raw wastewater are oxidized to carbon dioxide during nitrification requiring additional organic material such as acetate to be added to reduce the excess nitrate through denitrification du et al 2022 li et al 2020 in the absence of nitrite and with nob competition the retention of anaob is challenging even with biofilm or granulation li et al 2017 wang et al 2021b this study demonstrated that gaos could efficiently utilize the limited organics found in municipal wastewater cod n 2 8 0 1 in combination with anaob to enhance nitrogen removal 97 5 2 2 this was done by optimizing the allocation of organics between paos and gaos more organics were employed by gaos to drive ed for nitrification and anammox generated nitrate reduction and the gao subgroups gb4 gb5 of ca competibacter gao provided the substrate for anaob by reducing nitrate to nitrite because of this the stability of partial nitrification and the ratio of nitrite to ammonium no2 nh4 were no longer strict requirements for stable anammox fux et al 2002 li et al 2020 mccarty 2018 the growth of nob with a low affinity for oxygen was inhibited due to the competition for do from the prevalent endogenous heterotrophic bacteria wang et al 2016 wu et al 2017 which likely led to the decrease in nob abundance and the increase in nitrite accumulation in phase iii figs 2b and 4c the nitrogen lost in the aerobic stage increased to 9 1 2 4 mg l fig 2c indicating the enhancement of anammox or simultaneous nitrification anammox and denitrification singh et al 2022 together these conditions were conducive to anaob retention in real municipal wastewater and allowed for synergistic nitrogen removal by the synergistic processes in anaob endogenous heterotrophic bacteria system megatons of phosphorus are lost in wwtps each year guo and li 2020 tian et al 2017 with the continuous replenishment of poly p by paos fig 1c the intermittent exclusion of phosphorus rich supernatant which was done for approximately 70 days here could effectively recover phosphorus from municipal wastewater through chemical precipitation guo and li 2020 it is noteworthy that the enrichment of ca accumulibacter clade ii when phosphorus rich supernatant was eliminated allowed for a continuous increase in the abundance of ca accumulibacter pao figs 5b and s11 this might be because this clade switched between poly p and gly hydrolysis for energy when different poly p levels were present acevedo et al 2017 welles et al 2016 overall the survival of this clade could facilitate sustainable phosphorus recovery in wastewater treatment it should be noted however that the phosphorus removal performance of ca accumulibacter clade ii was unstable due to the alternation between saturation and depletion of poly p fig s10 different subclades of ca accumulibacter clade ii exhibits distinct phosphorus removal abilities kolakovic et al 2021 and therefore improved phosphorus removal performance should be further investigated the technology of reusing reject water as organic matter for nitrogen removal in wwtps is increasingly utilized jenni et al 2014 liu et al 2017 the use of phosphorus rich supernatant exclusion by using reject water also promotes energy self sufficiency in wwtps furthermore nitrate is generally a product of nitrification which as demonstrated in this work could induce the proliferation of subgroups of ca competibacter that reduces nitrate fig 5c it is worth noting that optimizing the carbon allocation between paos and gaos directly in the full scale mainstream nitrogen removal process could pose a shock to the system since the effects of the introduction of reject water on the community were not established fully even if the introduction of organics was intermittent wang et al 2020 inducing the release of poly p from activated sludge in the side stream and therefore improving the ability of endogenous heterotrophic bacteria and anaob to remove nitrogen might further the flexible application of pna 4 conclusion this study demonstrated the optimization of the allocation of organics between paos and gaos by excluding phosphorus rich supernatant facilitating nitrogen removal from municipal wastewater through a synergistic process involving endogenous heterotrophic bacteria and anaob the specific conclusions were as follows with the decrease of poly p level gam used more organics than pam in the anaerobic stage predominating the endogenous metabolism glycogen was the primary driving energy source for ed in the anoxic stage the abundance of ca competibacter gao increased from 3 4 to 5 7 following the exclusion of the phosphorus rich supernatant contributing to a significant enhancement in the ed capacity and resulting in a rapid decrease of effluent nitrate to 0 7 0 6 mg l when nitrite was insufficient the proliferation of the subgroups of ca competibacter that reduces nitrate to nitrite exclusively supplemented anammox with substrate produced epd this guaranteed that the anaob population and performance would remain stable overall the combination of enhanced ed and stable anammox achieved 97 5 2 2 of nitrogen removal efficiency during the treatment of municipal wastewater declaration of competing interest the authors
