9700,providing a suitable water environment and nitrogen n supply are essential for improving the crop productivity especially in rain fed areas affected by drought and nutrient deficiencies the ridge furrow mulching system rfms is an efficient planting pattern in the rain fed area of the loess plateau in china changing the ridge furrow ratio in rfms often modifies the hydrothermal environments few previous studies have investigated the combined effect of changing the ridge furrow ratio and n application rate thus we conducted a field experiment from 2020 to 2021 in the loess plateau region of china with two planting patterns flat planting without film mulching and rfms with three ridge furrow ratios of 40 70 cm 55 55 cm and 70 40 cm and three nitrogen application rates n1 180 kg ha 1 n2 240 kg ha 1 and n3 300 kg ha 1 we analyzed the effects of different n application rates and planting patterns on the soil hydrothermal environment growth and development grain yield and water use efficiency wue of spring maize the results showed that the soil hydrothermal environment improved as the ridge furrow ratio increased but increasing the n application rate risked aggravating the soil water consumption compared with fp the warming effect of rfpm accelerated senescence and shortened growth period 1 4 days of spring maize under n1 and the negative effect could be effectively alleviated with the increase of n application rate increasing the ridge furrow ratio and n application rate increased the photosynthetic capacity leaf area and accumulated dry matter compared with fp rf40 70 rf55 55 and rf70 40 significantly increased the grain yield by 12 96 20 28 and 28 98 and significantly increased wue by 16 01 22 35 and 31 83 respectively grain yield and wue also increased with the increase of n application rate regression analysis further showed that under rfms at 70 40 cm the highest spring maize grain yield and wue were achieved with n application rates of 274 14 kg ha 1 and 268 56 kg ha 1 respectively therefore we suggested that rfms at 70 40 cm and n application at 268 56 274 14 kg ha 1 are most suitable for rain fed spring maize production in the loess plateau region keywords ridge furrow ratio n application rate soil hydrothermal positive interactions grain yield 1 introduction rapid population growth has increased the pressure on global food production and the global food demand is expected to double by 2050 tilman et al 2011 rain fed agriculture is an important type of agricultural production worldwide and it plays a key role in providing food and livelihoods for the growing global population johan et al 2010 however limited and uneven precipitation is the only water source in rain fed agriculture thereby resulting in low and unstable crop productivity sei 2005 according to statistics the mean grain yield from rain fed crops is 1 5 t ha 1 which is much lower than that from irrigated crops with 3 1 t ha 1 rosegrant et al 2002 in addition severe food security problems may occur because effects on rain fed agriculture caused by the increasing pressure on water resources and uncertainties as a consequence of climate change ipcc 2014 many studies have consistently shown that enhancing the collection of precipitation and the water use efficiency wue are crucial for improving the productivity of rain fed crops li et al 2012 2014 the development of innovative in situ techniques for efficiently collecting and utilizing precipitation is important for improving the crop productivity in rain fed agricultural areas gan et al 2013 the ridge furrow mulching system rfms is now considered one of the most efficient in situ rainwater harvesting techniques after decades of development mo et al 2016 2018 this technique involves preparing alternating ridges and furrows in the field where the ridges are covered with plastic film to serve as catchment areas and the bare furrows receive rainwater as plant growing areas li et al 2016 rfms guides precipitation into the crop root zone via the modified micro topography and the film mulch also reduces the unproductive evaporation of soil water to ultimately improve the effectiveness of soil water utilization in addition the film mulch alleviates the restriction because low temperatures in the early stage of spring maize seed germination gan et al 2013 to ensure a higher emergence rate and accelerate the growth process bu et al 2013a previous studies have shown that compared with flat planting without film mulching fp rfms can enhance spring maize root and canopy growth by improving the soil hydrothermal environment to increase the accumulated dry matter grain yield and wue zhang et al 2019a 2019b based on the superiority of rfms it is widely used in agricultural production areas where moisture is limited such as east africa south korea north korea and northwest china gan et al 2013 gan et al 2013 changing the ratio of the ridge width relative to the furrow width in rfms will lead to water collection areas film covered areas and planting areas with different sizes thereby modifying the soil hydrothermal environment for crop growth in a previous meta analysis we found that the improvement effect of soil hydrothermal environment increased with the increase of ridge furrow ratio compared to fp zhang et al 2021a the responses of the crop grain yield and wue to different ridge furrow ratios will vary because differences in the hydrothermal micro environment duan et al 2021 zhao et al 2014 in particular luo et al 2021 found that the optimal ridge furrow ratio for rain fed wheat production in east africa were 1 and 1 5 20 cm 20 cm and 30 cm 20 cm which obtained the highest wheat productivity and precipitation use efficiency liu et al 2020 concluded that the best ridge furrow ratio for winter wheat growing in semi arid areas of the loess plateau region in china was 60 60 cm which obtained the highest accumulated dry matter crop yield net profit and hydrothermal utilization efficiency li et al 2019 found that the spring maize grain yield and wue increased as the ridge furrow ratio increased 40 70 cm 55 55 cm and 70 40 cm in addition to differences in the region which may lead to differences in the climate and the physical and chemical properties of soil and crop varieties in these previous studies differences in the nutrient supply especially nitrogen may have influenced the optimal ridge furrow ratio zhang et al 2021b the loess plateau is the main grain producing area in northern china and rain fed agriculture is conducted in more than 60 of the total cultivated area in this region wang et al 2015 spring maize is planted widely in this region xue et al 2008 and it accounts for more than 27 of the cultivated area liu et al 2010a the productivity of spring maize in this area is generally low and the limitation of water resources and the low n use efficiency caused by low water availability are the two key factors leading to this phenomenon li et al 2009 the n application rate in this area is usually much higher than the 97 141 kg n ha 1 required to achieve a maize grain yield of 4900 7800 kg ha 1 and it is even as high as 330 kg n ha 1 hou et al 2012 liu et al 2015 under limited soil water conditions excessive n inputs can reduce the n utilization efficiency as well as aggravating crop water stress by increasing evapotranspiration zhang et al 2021b thereby restricting root and canopy growth pandey et al 2000 to ultimately decrease the grain yield and wue some recent studies have shown that harnessing positive synergies between the soil water and nutrient supply can enhance crop productivity wang et al 2019 zhang et al 2021b i e promote fertilizer utilization with water and adjust water with fertilizer hong et al 2021 in particular increasing the availability of soil water as a medium promotes the flow of nutrients especially n and increases the nutrient availability for crops to ultimately increase the accumulated dry matter and grain yield di paolo and rinaldi 2008 an appropriate nutrient supply can promote the growth and activity of crop roots gao et al 2014 jia et al 2018 and increasing the space accessed for soil water absorption to alleviate the limitation caused by extreme drought on crop productivity therefore optimizing the soil water environment and n supply may enhance their positive interactions to improve spring maize growth the grain yield and wue under rain fed agriculture in the loess plateau region previous studies have investigated the effects of the ridge furrow ratio or n application rate on the productivity of rain fed spring maize in the loess plateau region li et al 2019 qiang et al 2019 however optimizing a single management strategy will have a limited positive effect on spring maize productivity few studies have investigated the combined effect of different ridge furrow ratios and n application rates on crop productivity according to the differences in soil water availability we hypothesized that optimizing the ridge furrow ratio and n application rate could improve the soil hydrothermal environment to promote the growth of rain fed spring maize and increase the grain yield and wue therefore the aims of the present study were 1 to investigate the effects of different ridge furrow ratios and n application rates on the temporal and spatial variations in the soil hydrothermal environment 2 to analyze the effects of different ridge furrow ratios and n application rates on growth the grain yield and wue in rain fed spring maize and 3 to determine the most suitable combination of the ridge furrow ratio and n application rate for rain fed spring maize production in the loess plateau region 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental site the field experiment was conducted during the spring maize growing seasons in 2020 2021 at changwu agro ecological experimental station in the loess plateau shaanxi province china 107 40 e 35 12 n the mean annual precipitation in the region is about 548 mm and more than half of the precipitation occurs from july to september under the influence of the continental monsoon climate the air temperature and precipitation during the experiment are shown in fig 1 the soil type in the area is typical calaric regosol fao 1988 in the 0 20 cm soil layer the organic carbon total nitrogen available nitrogen and available potassium contents and ph were 6 95 g kg 1 0 91 g kg 1 60 73 mg kg 1 103 70 mg kg 1 and 8 1 respectively 2 2 experimental design and field management two planting patterns and three n application rates were tested in the field experiment the two planting patterns were fp fig 2 a and rfms with three different ridge furrow ratios the three commonly used ridge furrow ratios in the local area were selected as described by li et al 2017 2019 comprising 40 70 cm rf40 70 55 55 cm rf55 55 and 70 40 cm rf70 40 fig 2 b d under rfms the height of the ridge was 15 cm and the plastic film covering had a thickness of 0 008 mm the three n application rates were 180 kg ha 1 240 kg ha 1 and 300 kg ha 1 as for the determination of n application rate we investigated the n application rate of spring maize in this area before the start of the experimental design and concluded that 300 kg ha 1 was the most common maximum n application rate of farmers in this area we set the n application rate of 240 kg ha 1 and 180 kg ha 1 in descending gradient of 60 kg ha 1 a two factor randomized block design was used in this experiment with a total of 12 treatments where each treatment was repeated three times to give a total of 36 plots and each had an area of 48 m2 length 8 m width 6 m a ridge with a height of 20 cm was built at the edge of each plot to prevent runoff between plots in both growing seasons each treatment was performed in the same plot the n fertilizer used in the experiment was urea pure n content 46 the application rate of phosphate fertilizer p2o5 in this study was 75 kg ha 1 according to local fertilization practices n and phosphate fertilizers were evenly spread over the soil before preparing the ridges and furrows then use a rotary cultivator to get it into the soil under rfms ridges and furrows are artificially formed and the plastic film was fixed in the soil at the junction of the ridge and furrow in order to prevent uneven precipitation accumulation in the furrow manually smooth the furrow on may 10 2020 and may 5 2021 spring maize seeds were spot seeded at the ridge and furrow junction with a manual seeder harvesting was conducted manually on october 5 2020 and september 29 2021 the planting density of spring maize xianyu 335 which is a commonly used variety in the local area was the same in all plots at 75 000 plant ha 1 irrigation was not applied during the two year experiment and manual weeding was conducted to avoid the adverse effects of chemical herbicides on spring maize growth after the harvest in 2020 the plastic film was kept in each plot to retain the soil moisture and collect precipitation during the fallow season the plastic film was removed and replaced with new plastic film before sowing in 2021 2 3 measurements and calculations 2 3 1 soil water and temperature in order to determine the spatiotemporal changes in the soil moisture contents during 2020 and 2021 three sampling points were randomly selected in each plot in the spring maize sowing six leaf v6 12 leaf v12 tasseling vt milk r3 and physiological maturity r6 stages and soil samples were collected from the 0 200 cm soil layer 20 cm per layer using threaded soil drills the soil water content was measured using the drying method and then averaged over the three sampling points the soil water storage sws mm in the 0 200 cam layer was calculated as follows zhang et al 2021 1 sws mm swc ρ b sd 10 where ρb g cm 3 is the soil bulk density in each soil layer and sd cm is the soil depth in 2020 and 2021 one day after sowing geothermal probes jiangsu jingchuang electric appliance co ltd china were buried at depths of 5 cm and 15 cm in the soil between two spring maize plants in the same row in each plot and the temperature was recorded every 1 h 2 3 2 maize phenology the growth of spring maize was monitored in each plot where the numbers of days when more than half of the plants in each plot reached the v6 v12 vt r3 and r6 stages were recorded by referring to the maize development stage system qin et al 2019 ritchie et al 1992 2 3 3 plant height leaf area index and accumulated dry matter in the v6 v12 vt r3 and r6 stages in the two growing seasons three maize plants with uniform growth were collected from each plot and their heights were measured according to the method described by mckee 1964 the fully expanded green leaf area m2 of each spring maize plant was calculated as follows 2 2 leaf area l w 0 75 where l and w are the maximum length and width of each leaf respectively the leaf area index was calculated as the ratio of the leaf area on each plant relative to the area occupied by a single plant 0 1334 m2 the plants were then collected and placed into envelopes before drying in an oven at 105 c for 0 5 h and then drying to constant weight at 80 c to determine the accumulated dry matter 2 3 4 photosynthetic properties from 9 00 a m to 11 00 a m on a sunny day in the vt stage three spring maize plants with uniform growth were selected in each plot and the net photosynthetic rate pn stomatal conductance gs and transpiration rate tr were measured for leaves in the ear position using a portable li 6400 instrument li cor inc lincoln ne usa 2 3 5 grain yield and yield components two rows of maize ears were collected from each plot at physiological maturity and the grain number diameter length and bare tip length were measured for all ears the grain yield was determined at a moisture content of 14 the harvest index was calculated as the ratio of the grain yield relative to the dry matter mass for the aboveground parts 2 3 6 wue during the spring maize growth period no water was provided except for precipitation so the evapotranspiration et was calculated as follows 3 3 et p sws where p mm is the precipitation in the growing season and δsws mm is the difference in sws in the 0 200 cm soil layer between harvesting and sowing the wue was calculated as follows 4 4 wue grain yield et 2 3 7 statistical analyses spss 18 0 software ibm inc armonk ny usa was used for data analyses the least significant difference test lsd was used to identify differences between means and a significant treatment effect at p 0 05 all images were drawn using graphpad prism 8 0 software 3 results 3 1 effects of planting pattern and n application rate on soil hydrothermal environment 3 1 1 soil water content the planting pattern and n application rate clearly affected the soil water contents fig 3 in both growing seasons all three ridge furrow ratios generally increased the soil water content in the 0 200 cm layer compared with fp regardless of the n application rate compared with fp rf40 70 rf55 55 and rf70 40 significantly increased the mean soil water contents by 3 37 5 18 and 7 58 p 0 05 two year mean respectively rfms was still effective at storing and retaining water during the fallow period and thus it significantly increased the soil water content in the 0 130 cm soil layer when sowing in 2021 p 0 05 fig 4 a and this effect increased as the ridge furrow ratio increased during the r6 stage in 2021 the differences in the soil water contents between treatments were not obvious fig 4 f due to continuous precipitation fig 1 in the two growing seasons the soil water content decreased as the n application rate increased fig 5 and the soil water contents of the different soil layers were affected differently by the n application rates in particular compared with n1 the shallow 0 40 cm soil water contents were 2 93 and 3 89 lower under n2 and n3 respectively whereas the soil water contents in the 40 100 cm layer were 1 32 and 1 92 lower and the soil water contents in the 100 200 cm layer were 1 15 and 0 72 lower therefore soil water content was the highest under the combination rf70 40 and n1 and the lowest under the combination fp and n3 3 1 2 soil temperature fig 6 shows the changes in the soil temperature at soil depths of 5 cm and 15 cm under different planting patterns there were no obvious differences in the soil temperatures under different n application rates so they are not shown in the figure compared with fp the three ridge furrow ratios significantly increased the soil temperature compared with fp the two year mean soil temperatures at 5 cm increased by 0 47 c 0 84 c and 1 19 c under rf40 70 rf55 55 and rf70 40 respectively and those at 15 cm increased by 0 42 c 0 60 c and 1 06 c respectively fig 6 it is obvious that the warming effect of three ridge furrow in 5 cm soil layer is greater than that in 15 cm soil layer clearly the effects of the different ridge furrow ratios on the soil temperature varied in the different growth stages compared with fp fig 6 in the sowing v6 stage compared with fp the mean soil temperatures at 5 cm increased by 1 17 c 2 10 c and 2 70 c under rf40 70 rf55 55 and rf70 40 respectively two year mean values and the same applies in the following and by 1 21 c 1 90 c and 2 50 c at 15 cm in the v6 vt stage the mean soil temperatures at 5 cm increased by 0 35 c 0 66 c and 1 19 c under rf40 70 rf55 55 and rf70 40 respectively and by 0 05 c 0 21 c and 0 60 c at 15 cm in the vt r6 stage the mean soil temperatures at 5 cm increased by 0 18 c 0 25 c and 0 34 c under rf40 70 rf55 55 and rf70 40 respectively and by 0 23 c 0 22 c and 0 05 c at 15 cm in general the warming effects of the three ridge furrow ratios gradually weakened throughout the growth process 3 2 effects of planting pattern and n application rate on spring maize physiological characteristics 3 2 1 spring maize phenology the n application rates and planting patterns clearly affected the phenology of spring maize fig 7 as the n application rate increased the growth period of spring maize was prolonged under different planting patterns under the three n application rates compared with fp the three ridge furrow ratios shortened the spring maize emergence time by 4 5 days under n1 compared with fp the three ridge furrow ratios all accelerated the spring maize growth process rf40 70 rf55 55 and rf70 40 advanced the maturity of spring maize by 1 day 2 5 days and 3 5 days two year means respectively mainly because the three ridge furrow ratios advanced the spring maize emergence time by 4 6 days compared with fp under n2 and n3 the three ridge furrow ratios shortened the time required for spring maize to reach the vt stage by 1 4 days but extended the time from the vt stage to r6 stage by 5 8 days thereby resulting in a longer spring maize growth period 1 4 days longer therefore reasonable ridge furrow ratio and n application rate combination can promote the emergence of spring maize and prolong the growth process of spring maize 3 2 2 photosynthetic characteristics the n application rates and planting patterns had significant effects on pn tr and gs fig 8 increasing the n application rate enhanced the photosynthetic characteristics in particular compared with n1 pn significantly increased by 6 36 and 9 02 under n2 and n3 respectively two year means and the same applies in the following fig 8a and b while tr significantly increased by 4 27 and 8 38 fig 8c and d and gs significantly increased by 8 30 and 10 96 p 0 05 fig 8e and f interestingly pn tr and gs did not respond significantly to the different n application rates under fp compared with fp pn significantly increased significantly by 7 13 14 69 and 24 51 under rf40 70 rf55 55 and rf70 40 respectively while tr significantly increased by 7 06 16 74 and 31 50 and gs significantly increased by 6 55 17 78 and 20 91 p 0 05 in general increasing the n application rate and the ridge furrow ratio can increase the photosynthetic capacity of spring maize 3 2 3 leaf area and accumulated dry matter figs 9 and 10 show the differences in the leaf area per plant and accumulated dry matter in two spring maize growing seasons the leaf area per plant increased initially and then decreased during the growth process and the accumulated dry matter exhibited logistic growth the effects of the n application rate and planting pattern on the leaf area and accumulated dry matter were consistent the leaf area per plant and accumulated dry matter increased as the n application rate increased and they both increased as the ridge furrow ratio increased compared with fp in particular when the maximum leaf area per plant was reached in the vt stage compared with n1 the leaf area per plant significantly increased by 5 66 and 9 45 under n2 and n3 respectively p 0 05 two year means and the same applies in the following in addition the leaf area per plant significantly increased by 10 66 21 35 and 32 32 under rf40 70 rf55 55 and rf70 40 respectively compared with fp compared with n1 the final accumulated dry matter per plant significantly increased by 6 69 and 9 94 under n2 and n3 respectively p 0 05 compared with fp the accumulated dry matter significantly increased by 15 02 27 79 and 40 00 under rf40 70 rf55 55 and rf70 40 respectively p 0 05 however there was no significant difference in the accumulated dry matter under rf70 40 with n2 and n3 3 3 effects of planting pattern and n application rate on grain yield and wue 3 3 1 ear characteristics grain yield and yield components the ear characteristics were significantly affected by the year n application rate and planting pattern table 1 the ear characteristics were better in 2020 than 2021 increasing the n application rate improved the ear characteristics but the ear characteristics kernels per row ear length ear diameter and length of bare tip generally did not differ significantly between n2 and n3 compared with fp the three ridge furrow ratios all improved the ear characteristics and the enhancements increased as the ridge furrow ratio increased the year n application rate and planting pattern had significant effects on the grain yield grain number per ear 100 grain weight and ear number per unit area table 2 the 100 grain weight and ear number per unit area were lower in 2020 than 2021 but the grain number per ear was greater in 2020 than in 2021 because the significantly higher spring maize grain yield the grain number per ear and ear number per unit area increased as the n application rate increased but the 100 grain weight decreased the grain yields under n1 n2 and n3 were 10 97 t ha 1 11 90 t ha 1 and 12 18 t ha 1 respectively compared with fp the three ridge furrow ratios significantly increased the grain yield because improvements in the yield components in particular rf40 70 rf55 55 and rf70 40 significantly increased the grain yields by 12 96 20 28 and 28 98 respectively p 0 05 in both years rf70 40 obtained the highest grain yield under n3 table s2 however the grain yield with rf70 40 did not differ significantly under n2 and n3 p 0 05 mainly because there were generally no significant differences in the ear characteristics and yield components tables s1 and s2 3 3 2 wue in both years the n application rate and planting pattern significantly affected the wue fig 11 compared with fp rfms significantly increased the wue and the effect increased as the ridge furrow ratio increased in particular compared with fp the wue significantly increased by 16 01 22 35 and 31 83 under rf40 70 rf55 55 and rf70 40 respectively p 0 05 increasing the n application rate increased the wue but there were no significant differences between n2 and n3 in some cases especially under rf70 40 4 discussion 4 1 effects of planting pattern and n application rate on soil hydrothermal environment the soil moisture content is considered one of the most critical factors for regulating plant growth and development silvente et al 2012 liao et al 2021 and small differences in soil moisture may also have large impacts on crop productivity liu et al 2010b especially under dryland conditions gan et al 2013 luo et al 2021 mo et al 2016 zhang et al 2019a 2019b and 2019c in the present study both ridge furrow ratio and n application rate had significant effects on soil water content but the increase of both had opposite effects on soil water content compared with fp the soil water content increased significantly under all three ridge furrow ratios and this positive effect increased as the ridge furrow ratio increased figs 3 and 4 which was consistent with the results of li et al 2017 the reason for this phenomenon may be that increasing the ridge furrow ratio enlarges the surface area for collecting precipitation and reduces the contact area between the soil and atmosphere thereby allowing more rainwater to be collected and reducing the non productive consumption of soil water in addition increasing the film coverage can enhance water infiltration zhang et al 2019a and thus a larger ridge furrow ratio is more advantageous in areas with low precipitation li et al 2019 mo et al 2013 li and gong 2002 different from the ridge furrow ratio the increase of n application rate reduced soil water content fig 5 previous studies indicated that this maybe related to the increase of n application rate promote crop dry matter accumulation and intensifies soil water consumption lian et al 2016 di paolo and rinaldi 2008 in other words increased n application rate may exacerbate drought stress in summary soil water content was the highest under the combination rf70 40 and n1 and the lowest under the combination fp and n3 in the loess plateau region drought is one of the most important causes of retarded emergence and weak seedlings in spring maize mo et al 2013 the results obtained in the present study indicate that maintaining the ridge and furrow configuration in the fallow season can enhance the storage and conservation of water especially in the 0 130 cm soil layer thereby facilitating the emergence of spring maize in the following year and maintaining an adequate water supply in the seedling stage we also found that compared with the soil water contents in the medium 40 100 cm and deep 100 200 cm soil layers the different n application rates had more obvious effects on the soil water content in the shallow soil 0 40 cm fig 5 which may be related to the fact that the increase of n application rate mainly promoted the root growth in 0 40 cm soil layer data not shown and 0 40 cm soil layer was the main water absorbing soil layer of spring maize zhang et al 2021c the soil temperature greatly affects plant growth and various physiological and biochemical reactions qin et al 2018 pramanik et al 2015 zhou et al 2012 gan et al 2013 showed that the soil temperature is more important for crop growth than the air temperature in the different spring maize growth stages increasing the soil temperature had opposite effects in the loess plateau region increasing the soil temperature in the early growth period alleviated the restriction on seed germination due to low temperatures thereby ensuring a higher emergence rate however increasing the soil temperature in the later growth period reduced the activity of the roots and accelerated root senescence bu et al 2013b li et al 1999 we found that the soil temperature was only affected by the different planting patterns and not by the n application rates compared with fp the warming effects of the three ridge furrow ratios were not continuous and uniform fig 6 in the early growth stage the spring maize canopy is not established and short wave solar radiation penetrates the film to increase the soil temperature whereas long wave ground radiation cannot penetrate the film liu et al 2020 therefore compared with fp the three ridge furrow ratios all significantly increased the soil temperature we found that the warming effect increased as the ridge furrow ratio increased fig 6 which is consistent with the results obtained by liu et al 2020 in the later growth stage it is difficult for solar short wave radiation to directly reach the ground to increase the soil temperature because the influence of the dense canopy in addition the three ridge furrows ratios all increased the soil water content compared with fp fig 3 and fig 4 it is difficult to increase the soil temperature because the higher specific heat capacity of water wang et al 2008 which leads to no significant differences in the soil temperature under the three ridge furrow ratios and fp and they were even slightly lower than that under fp thus the lack of warming effects under the three ridge furrow ratios could avoid negative impacts on spring maize in the later growth period 4 2 effects of planting pattern and n application rate on spring maize phenology and growth changes in the soil hydrothermal environment and nutrient supply will clearly affect the phenology and growth of plants wu et al 2021 increasing the temperature usually accelerates the growth of plants oteros et al 2015 xu et al 2019 previous studies have shown that rfms shortens the spring maize growth process bu et al 2013b qin et al 2018 where rfms may increase the soil temperature and reduce the activity of superoxide dismutase in the root system to accelerate the senescence of the root system we observed a similar phenomenon under n1 where the three ridge furrow ratios shortened the spring maize growth process by 1 4 days compared with fp fig 7 it is well known that increasing the n application rate can delay plant senescence wen et al 2020 a similar phenomenon was observed in this study fig 7 interestingly under the n2 and n3 application rates the growth process under the three ridge furrow ratios was higher than that under fp especially under rf55 55 and rf70 40 which indicated that the effect of increasing the n application rate on the growth process is more prominent under the three ridge furrow ratios fig 7 we speculated that this phenomenon may be related to the improvement of soil water content which is conducive to the effect of n fertilizer zhang et al 2020 it has been shown that when the grain filling duration is longer more dry matter is transferred from the vegetative organs to the reproductive organs which is more conducive to high yields zhang et al 2019c under drought stress plants tend to reduce water losses by closing the stomata and reducing expansion of the leaf area in order to survive adaptively mwale et al 2007b these plant responses reduce their photosynthetic capacity and the effective interception of solar radiation thereby limiting the accumulation of dry matter liu et al 2010a mwale et al 2007b in the present study under three n application rates compared with fp the three ridge furrow ratios increased the leaf area per plant by improving the soil hydrothermal environment and tr and pn increased because the enhancement of gs zhang et al 2019c these changes have to ultimately promoted the accumulation of dry matter where these effects increased as the ridge furrow ratio increased figs 8 9 and 10 n is an essential element for crop canopy expansion and the maintenance of efficient photosynthesis ali et al 2011 wen et al 2020 but the increased application of n under water stress conditions may damage the leaf structure and reduce photosynthesis xing et al 2021 which may explain why increasing the n application rate had no significant effects on the photosynthetic efficiency and leaf area under fp figs 8 and 9 however the three ridge furrow ratios increased the availability of n by improving the hydrothermal environment thereby leading to increases in the photosynthetic efficiency and leaf area as the n application rate increased the accumulated dry matter exhibited the same trend as the photosynthetic efficiency and leaf area fig 10 the highest accumulated dry matter was obtained under rf70 40 with all three n application rates but there was no significant difference between n2 and n3 this phenomenon may be explained by the limitation of rf70 40 in improving the soil hydrothermal environment leading to a threshold for the n application rate located between n2 and n3 as supported by regression analysis fig s1 4 3 effects of planting pattern and n application rate on spring maize grain yield and wue the core focus of our study is the combined effect of ridge furrow ratio and n application rate on spring maize productivity it is well known that water and n are the main factors affecting crop productivity especially in rain fed farming areas there is a strong interaction between soil water and n on crop productivity ma et al 2021 generally speaking the improvement of the water environment increases the flow of n which is more conducive to being captured by the plant roots in turn to the increase of n absorption will further promote the roots growth and increase the absorption of soil water the coupling effect of the two has a significant positive effect on crop productivity hammad et al 2011 singandhupe et al 2003 this study further proved this coupling effect that is the grain yield and wue of spring maize increased with the increase in the ridge furrow ratio and n application rate table 2 and fig 11 and the correlation analysis showed that this was related to the improvement of photosynthetic characteristics leaf area and dry matter accumulation table s3 at the same time these results also confirmed our hypothesis in general there are thresholds for both the water and n supplies and the crop productivity maybe adversely affected if either of these thresholds is exceeded zhang et al 2019d regression analysis results showed that compared with the other three planting patterns it is obvious that rf70 40 reduced the n input threshold fig s1 therefore we recommend combining rf70 40 with an n application rate of 268 56 274 14 kg ha 1 as a field management strategy for rain fed spring maize planting in the loess plateau region 4 4 implications of this study this study provided a theoretical basis for the optimization of rain fed spring maize management practices in the loess plateau at the same time it provided a reference for other regions in the world that face the same agricultural production environment as this region such as east africa south korea and north korea although the increase in ridge and furrow ratio may have the potential to achieve higher yield per plant the larger ridge and furrow ratio reduces the planting area for example pan et al 2019 found that sunflower has a greater growth advantage under a large ridge furrow ratio but this does not offset the reduction in yield caused by the reduction in planting area therefore the choice of ridge and furrow ratio should be established on the basis of not reducing the number of plants per unit area in addition the choice of field management practices largely depends on climatic conditions soil types farming methods etc the above factors should be considered comprehensively in the optimization of ridge furrow ratio and n application rate in other areas another point of concern is that although large ridge furrow ratio have a higher yield and wue it also increased the area covered by plastic mulch which leads to an increased risk of white pollution therefore future study need to focus on the development and application of alternative plastic film such as degradable film 5 conclusion in the rain fed area of the loess plateau we found that optimizing the ridge furrow ratio and n application rate could improve the hydrothermal environment of the spring maize rhizosphere to stimulate the growth of the canopy thereby increasing the grain yield and wue compared with fp rf70 40 had the most positive effect among the different ridge furrow ratios and it lowered the threshold n application rate we suggest that rf70 40 can be combined with n application at a rate of 268 56 274 14 kg ha 1 to optimize rain fed spring maize growing in the loess plateau region in this study we applied the n fertilizer management strategy used most commonly by local farmers where all of the n fertilizer was applied as a base which may limit the effectiveness of n fertilizer future research should focus on the effects of different n fertilizer application

9700,providing a suitable water environment and nitrogen n supply are essential for improving the crop productivity especially in rain fed areas affected by drought and nutrient deficiencies the ridge furrow mulching system rfms is an efficient planting pattern in the rain fed area of the loess plateau in china changing the ridge furrow ratio in rfms often modifies the hydrothermal environments few previous studies have investigated the combined effect of changing the ridge furrow ratio and n application rate thus we conducted a field experiment from 2020 to 2021 in the loess plateau region of china with two planting patterns flat planting without film mulching and rfms with three ridge furrow ratios of 40 70 cm 55 55 cm and 70 40 cm and three nitrogen application rates n1 180 kg ha 1 n2 240 kg ha 1 and n3 300 kg ha 1 we analyzed the effects of different n application rates and planting patterns on the soil hydrothermal environment growth and development grain yield and water use efficiency wue of spring maize the results showed that the soil hydrothermal environment improved as the ridge furrow ratio increased but increasing the n application rate risked aggravating the soil water consumption compared with fp the warming effect of rfpm accelerated senescence and shortened growth period 1 4 days of spring maize under n1 and the negative effect could be effectively alleviated with the increase of n application rate increasing the ridge furrow ratio and n application rate increased the photosynthetic capacity leaf area and accumulated dry matter compared with fp rf40 70 rf55 55 and rf70 40 significantly increased the grain yield by 12 96 20 28 and 28 98 and significantly increased wue by 16 01 22 35 and 31 83 respectively grain yield and wue also increased with the increase of n application rate regression analysis further showed that under rfms at 70 40 cm the highest spring maize grain yield and wue were achieved with n application rates of 274 14 kg ha 1 and 268 56 kg ha 1 respectively therefore we suggested that rfms at 70 40 cm and n application at 268 56 274 14 kg ha 1 are most suitable for rain fed spring maize production in the loess plateau region keywords ridge furrow ratio n application rate soil hydrothermal positive interactions grain yield 1 introduction rapid population growth has increased the pressure on global food production and the global food demand is expected to double by 2050 tilman et al 2011 rain fed agriculture is an important type of agricultural production worldwide and it plays a key role in providing food and livelihoods for the growing global population johan et al 2010 however limited and uneven precipitation is the only water source in rain fed agriculture thereby resulting in low and unstable crop productivity sei 2005 according to statistics the mean grain yield from rain fed crops is 1 5 t ha 1 which is much lower than that from irrigated crops with 3 1 t ha 1 rosegrant et al 2002 in addition severe food security problems may occur because effects on rain fed agriculture caused by the increasing pressure on water resources and uncertainties as a consequence of climate change ipcc 2014 many studies have consistently shown that enhancing the collection of precipitation and the water use efficiency wue are crucial for improving the productivity of rain fed crops li et al 2012 2014 the development of innovative in situ techniques for efficiently collecting and utilizing precipitation is important for improving the crop productivity in rain fed agricultural areas gan et al 2013 the ridge furrow mulching system rfms is now considered one of the most efficient in situ rainwater harvesting techniques after decades of development mo et al 2016 2018 this technique involves preparing alternating ridges and furrows in the field where the ridges are covered with plastic film to serve as catchment areas and the bare furrows receive rainwater as plant growing areas li et al 2016 rfms guides precipitation into the crop root zone via the modified micro topography and the film mulch also reduces the unproductive evaporation of soil water to ultimately improve the effectiveness of soil water utilization in addition the film mulch alleviates the restriction because low temperatures in the early stage of spring maize seed germination gan et al 2013 to ensure a higher emergence rate and accelerate the growth process bu et al 2013a previous studies have shown that compared with flat planting without film mulching fp rfms can enhance spring maize root and canopy growth by improving the soil hydrothermal environment to increase the accumulated dry matter grain yield and wue zhang et al 2019a 2019b based on the superiority of rfms it is widely used in agricultural production areas where moisture is limited such as east africa south korea north korea and northwest china gan et al 2013 gan et al 2013 changing the ratio of the ridge width relative to the furrow width in rfms will lead to water collection areas film covered areas and planting areas with different sizes thereby modifying the soil hydrothermal environment for crop growth in a previous meta analysis we found that the improvement effect of soil hydrothermal environment increased with the increase of ridge furrow ratio compared to fp zhang et al 2021a the responses of the crop grain yield and wue to different ridge furrow ratios will vary because differences in the hydrothermal micro environment duan et al 2021 zhao et al 2014 in particular luo et al 2021 found that the optimal ridge furrow ratio for rain fed wheat production in east africa were 1 and 1 5 20 cm 20 cm and 30 cm 20 cm which obtained the highest wheat productivity and precipitation use efficiency liu et al 2020 concluded that the best ridge furrow ratio for winter wheat growing in semi arid areas of the loess plateau region in china was 60 60 cm which obtained the highest accumulated dry matter crop yield net profit and hydrothermal utilization efficiency li et al 2019 found that the spring maize grain yield and wue increased as the ridge furrow ratio increased 40 70 cm 55 55 cm and 70 40 cm in addition to differences in the region which may lead to differences in the climate and the physical and chemical properties of soil and crop varieties in these previous studies differences in the nutrient supply especially nitrogen may have influenced the optimal ridge furrow ratio zhang et al 2021b the loess plateau is the main grain producing area in northern china and rain fed agriculture is conducted in more than 60 of the total cultivated area in this region wang et al 2015 spring maize is planted widely in this region xue et al 2008 and it accounts for more than 27 of the cultivated area liu et al 2010a the productivity of spring maize in this area is generally low and the limitation of water resources and the low n use efficiency caused by low water availability are the two key factors leading to this phenomenon li et al 2009 the n application rate in this area is usually much higher than the 97 141 kg n ha 1 required to achieve a maize grain yield of 4900 7800 kg ha 1 and it is even as high as 330 kg n ha 1 hou et al 2012 liu et al 2015 under limited soil water conditions excessive n inputs can reduce the n utilization efficiency as well as aggravating crop water stress by increasing evapotranspiration zhang et al 2021b thereby restricting root and canopy growth pandey et al 2000 to ultimately decrease the grain yield and wue some recent studies have shown that harnessing positive synergies between the soil water and nutrient supply can enhance crop productivity wang et al 2019 zhang et al 2021b i e promote fertilizer utilization with water and adjust water with fertilizer hong et al 2021 in particular increasing the availability of soil water as a medium promotes the flow of nutrients especially n and increases the nutrient availability for crops to ultimately increase the accumulated dry matter and grain yield di paolo and rinaldi 2008 an appropriate nutrient supply can promote the growth and activity of crop roots gao et al 2014 jia et al 2018 and increasing the space accessed for soil water absorption to alleviate the limitation caused by extreme drought on crop productivity therefore optimizing the soil water environment and n supply may enhance their positive interactions to improve spring maize growth the grain yield and wue under rain fed agriculture in the loess plateau region previous studies have investigated the effects of the ridge furrow ratio or n application rate on the productivity of rain fed spring maize in the loess plateau region li et al 2019 qiang et al 2019 however optimizing a single management strategy will have a limited positive effect on spring maize productivity few studies have investigated the combined effect of different ridge furrow ratios and n application rates on crop productivity according to the differences in soil water availability we hypothesized that optimizing the ridge furrow ratio and n application rate could improve the soil hydrothermal environment to promote the growth of rain fed spring maize and increase the grain yield and wue therefore the aims of the present study were 1 to investigate the effects of different ridge furrow ratios and n application rates on the temporal and spatial variations in the soil hydrothermal environment 2 to analyze the effects of different ridge furrow ratios and n application rates on growth the grain yield and wue in rain fed spring maize and 3 to determine the most suitable combination of the ridge furrow ratio and n application rate for rain fed spring maize production in the loess plateau region 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental site the field experiment was conducted during the spring maize growing seasons in 2020 2021 at changwu agro ecological experimental station in the loess plateau shaanxi province china 107 40 e 35 12 n the mean annual precipitation in the region is about 548 mm and more than half of the precipitation occurs from july to september under the influence of the continental monsoon climate the air temperature and precipitation during the experiment are shown in fig 1 the soil type in the area is typical calaric regosol fao 1988 in the 0 20 cm soil layer the organic carbon total nitrogen available nitrogen and available potassium contents and ph were 6 95 g kg 1 0 91 g kg 1 60 73 mg kg 1 103 70 mg kg 1 and 8 1 respectively 2 2 experimental design and field management two planting patterns and three n application rates were tested in the field experiment the two planting patterns were fp fig 2 a and rfms with three different ridge furrow ratios the three commonly used ridge furrow ratios in the local area were selected as described by li et al 2017 2019 comprising 40 70 cm rf40 70 55 55 cm rf55 55 and 70 40 cm rf70 40 fig 2 b d under rfms the height of the ridge was 15 cm and the plastic film covering had a thickness of 0 008 mm the three n application rates were 180 kg ha 1 240 kg ha 1 and 300 kg ha 1 as for the determination of n application rate we investigated the n application rate of spring maize in this area before the start of the experimental design and concluded that 300 kg ha 1 was the most common maximum n application rate of farmers in this area we set the n application rate of 240 kg ha 1 and 180 kg ha 1 in descending gradient of 60 kg ha 1 a two factor randomized block design was used in this experiment with a total of 12 treatments where each treatment was repeated three times to give a total of 36 plots and each had an area of 48 m2 length 8 m width 6 m a ridge with a height of 20 cm was built at the edge of each plot to prevent runoff between plots in both growing seasons each treatment was performed in the same plot the n fertilizer used in the experiment was urea pure n content 46 the application rate of phosphate fertilizer p2o5 in this study was 75 kg ha 1 according to local fertilization practices n and phosphate fertilizers were evenly spread over the soil before preparing the ridges and furrows then use a rotary cultivator to get it into the soil under rfms ridges and furrows are artificially formed and the plastic film was fixed in the soil at the junction of the ridge and furrow in order to prevent uneven precipitation accumulation in the furrow manually smooth the furrow on may 10 2020 and may 5 2021 spring maize seeds were spot seeded at the ridge and furrow junction with a manual seeder harvesting was conducted manually on october 5 2020 and september 29 2021 the planting density of spring maize xianyu 335 which is a commonly used variety in the local area was the same in all plots at 75 000 plant ha 1 irrigation was not applied during the two year experiment and manual weeding was conducted to avoid the adverse effects of chemical herbicides on spring maize growth after the harvest in 2020 the plastic film was kept in each plot to retain the soil moisture and collect precipitation during the fallow season the plastic film was removed and replaced with new plastic film before sowing in 2021 2 3 measurements and calculations 2 3 1 soil water and temperature in order to determine the spatiotemporal changes in the soil moisture contents during 2020 and 2021 three sampling points were randomly selected in each plot in the spring maize sowing six leaf v6 12 leaf v12 tasseling vt milk r3 and physiological maturity r6 stages and soil samples were collected from the 0 200 cm soil layer 20 cm per layer using threaded soil drills the soil water content was measured using the drying method and then averaged over the three sampling points the soil water storage sws mm in the 0 200 cam layer was calculated as follows zhang et al 2021 1 sws mm swc ρ b sd 10 where ρb g cm 3 is the soil bulk density in each soil layer and sd cm is the soil depth in 2020 and 2021 one day after sowing geothermal probes jiangsu jingchuang electric appliance co ltd china were buried at depths of 5 cm and 15 cm in the soil between two spring maize plants in the same row in each plot and the temperature was recorded every 1 h 2 3 2 maize phenology the growth of spring maize was monitored in each plot where the numbers of days when more than half of the plants in each plot reached the v6 v12 vt r3 and r6 stages were recorded by referring to the maize development stage system qin et al 2019 ritchie et al 1992 2 3 3 plant height leaf area index and accumulated dry matter in the v6 v12 vt r3 and r6 stages in the two growing seasons three maize plants with uniform growth were collected from each plot and their heights were measured according to the method described by mckee 1964 the fully expanded green leaf area m2 of each spring maize plant was calculated as follows 2 2 leaf area l w 0 75 where l and w are the maximum length and width of each leaf respectively the leaf area index was calculated as the ratio of the leaf area on each plant relative to the area occupied by a single plant 0 1334 m2 the plants were then collected and placed into envelopes before drying in an oven at 105 c for 0 5 h and then drying to constant weight at 80 c to determine the accumulated dry matter 2 3 4 photosynthetic properties from 9 00 a m to 11 00 a m on a sunny day in the vt stage three spring maize plants with uniform growth were selected in each plot and the net photosynthetic rate pn stomatal conductance gs and transpiration rate tr were measured for leaves in the ear position using a portable li 6400 instrument li cor inc lincoln ne usa 2 3 5 grain yield and yield components two rows of maize ears were collected from each plot at physiological maturity and the grain number diameter length and bare tip length were measured for all ears the grain yield was determined at a moisture content of 14 the harvest index was calculated as the ratio of the grain yield relative to the dry matter mass for the aboveground parts 2 3 6 wue during the spring maize growth period no water was provided except for precipitation so the evapotranspiration et was calculated as follows 3 3 et p sws where p mm is the precipitation in the growing season and δsws mm is the difference in sws in the 0 200 cm soil layer between harvesting and sowing the wue was calculated as follows 4 4 wue grain yield et 2 3 7 statistical analyses spss 18 0 software ibm inc armonk ny usa was used for data analyses the least significant difference test lsd was used to identify differences between means and a significant treatment effect at p 0 05 all images were drawn using graphpad prism 8 0 software 3 results 3 1 effects of planting pattern and n application rate on soil hydrothermal environment 3 1 1 soil water content the planting pattern and n application rate clearly affected the soil water contents fig 3 in both growing seasons all three ridge furrow ratios generally increased the soil water content in the 0 200 cm layer compared with fp regardless of the n application rate compared with fp rf40 70 rf55 55 and rf70 40 significantly increased the mean soil water contents by 3 37 5 18 and 7 58 p 0 05 two year mean respectively rfms was still effective at storing and retaining water during the fallow period and thus it significantly increased the soil water content in the 0 130 cm soil layer when sowing in 2021 p 0 05 fig 4 a and this effect increased as the ridge furrow ratio increased during the r6 stage in 2021 the differences in the soil water contents between treatments were not obvious fig 4 f due to continuous precipitation fig 1 in the two growing seasons the soil water content decreased as the n application rate increased fig 5 and the soil water contents of the different soil layers were affected differently by the n application rates in particular compared with n1 the shallow 0 40 cm soil water contents were 2 93 and 3 89 lower under n2 and n3 respectively whereas the soil water contents in the 40 100 cm layer were 1 32 and 1 92 lower and the soil water contents in the 100 200 cm layer were 1 15 and 0 72 lower therefore soil water content was the highest under the combination rf70 40 and n1 and the lowest under the combination fp and n3 3 1 2 soil temperature fig 6 shows the changes in the soil temperature at soil depths of 5 cm and 15 cm under different planting patterns there were no obvious differences in the soil temperatures under different n application rates so they are not shown in the figure compared with fp the three ridge furrow ratios significantly increased the soil temperature compared with fp the two year mean soil temperatures at 5 cm increased by 0 47 c 0 84 c and 1 19 c under rf40 70 rf55 55 and rf70 40 respectively and those at 15 cm increased by 0 42 c 0 60 c and 1 06 c respectively fig 6 it is obvious that the warming effect of three ridge furrow in 5 cm soil layer is greater than that in 15 cm soil layer clearly the effects of the different ridge furrow ratios on the soil temperature varied in the different growth stages compared with fp fig 6 in the sowing v6 stage compared with fp the mean soil temperatures at 5 cm increased by 1 17 c 2 10 c and 2 70 c under rf40 70 rf55 55 and rf70 40 respectively two year mean values and the same applies in the following and by 1 21 c 1 90 c and 2 50 c at 15 cm in the v6 vt stage the mean soil temperatures at 5 cm increased by 0 35 c 0 66 c and 1 19 c under rf40 70 rf55 55 and rf70 40 respectively and by 0 05 c 0 21 c and 0 60 c at 15 cm in the vt r6 stage the mean soil temperatures at 5 cm increased by 0 18 c 0 25 c and 0 34 c under rf40 70 rf55 55 and rf70 40 respectively and by 0 23 c 0 22 c and 0 05 c at 15 cm in general the warming effects of the three ridge furrow ratios gradually weakened throughout the growth process 3 2 effects of planting pattern and n application rate on spring maize physiological characteristics 3 2 1 spring maize phenology the n application rates and planting patterns clearly affected the phenology of spring maize fig 7 as the n application rate increased the growth period of spring maize was prolonged under different planting patterns under the three n application rates compared with fp the three ridge furrow ratios shortened the spring maize emergence time by 4 5 days under n1 compared with fp the three ridge furrow ratios all accelerated the spring maize growth process rf40 70 rf55 55 and rf70 40 advanced the maturity of spring maize by 1 day 2 5 days and 3 5 days two year means respectively mainly because the three ridge furrow ratios advanced the spring maize emergence time by 4 6 days compared with fp under n2 and n3 the three ridge furrow ratios shortened the time required for spring maize to reach the vt stage by 1 4 days but extended the time from the vt stage to r6 stage by 5 8 days thereby resulting in a longer spring maize growth period 1 4 days longer therefore reasonable ridge furrow ratio and n application rate combination can promote the emergence of spring maize and prolong the growth process of spring maize 3 2 2 photosynthetic characteristics the n application rates and planting patterns had significant effects on pn tr and gs fig 8 increasing the n application rate enhanced the photosynthetic characteristics in particular compared with n1 pn significantly increased by 6 36 and 9 02 under n2 and n3 respectively two year means and the same applies in the following fig 8a and b while tr significantly increased by 4 27 and 8 38 fig 8c and d and gs significantly increased by 8 30 and 10 96 p 0 05 fig 8e and f interestingly pn tr and gs did not respond significantly to the different n application rates under fp compared with fp pn significantly increased significantly by 7 13 14 69 and 24 51 under rf40 70 rf55 55 and rf70 40 respectively while tr significantly increased by 7 06 16 74 and 31 50 and gs significantly increased by 6 55 17 78 and 20 91 p 0 05 in general increasing the n application rate and the ridge furrow ratio can increase the photosynthetic capacity of spring maize 3 2 3 leaf area and accumulated dry matter figs 9 and 10 show the differences in the leaf area per plant and accumulated dry matter in two spring maize growing seasons the leaf area per plant increased initially and then decreased during the growth process and the accumulated dry matter exhibited logistic growth the effects of the n application rate and planting pattern on the leaf area and accumulated dry matter were consistent the leaf area per plant and accumulated dry matter increased as the n application rate increased and they both increased as the ridge furrow ratio increased compared with fp in particular when the maximum leaf area per plant was reached in the vt stage compared with n1 the leaf area per plant significantly increased by 5 66 and 9 45 under n2 and n3 respectively p 0 05 two year means and the same applies in the following in addition the leaf area per plant significantly increased by 10 66 21 35 and 32 32 under rf40 70 rf55 55 and rf70 40 respectively compared with fp compared with n1 the final accumulated dry matter per plant significantly increased by 6 69 and 9 94 under n2 and n3 respectively p 0 05 compared with fp the accumulated dry matter significantly increased by 15 02 27 79 and 40 00 under rf40 70 rf55 55 and rf70 40 respectively p 0 05 however there was no significant difference in the accumulated dry matter under rf70 40 with n2 and n3 3 3 effects of planting pattern and n application rate on grain yield and wue 3 3 1 ear characteristics grain yield and yield components the ear characteristics were significantly affected by the year n application rate and planting pattern table 1 the ear characteristics were better in 2020 than 2021 increasing the n application rate improved the ear characteristics but the ear characteristics kernels per row ear length ear diameter and length of bare tip generally did not differ significantly between n2 and n3 compared with fp the three ridge furrow ratios all improved the ear characteristics and the enhancements increased as the ridge furrow ratio increased the year n application rate and planting pattern had significant effects on the grain yield grain number per ear 100 grain weight and ear number per unit area table 2 the 100 grain weight and ear number per unit area were lower in 2020 than 2021 but the grain number per ear was greater in 2020 than in 2021 because the significantly higher spring maize grain yield the grain number per ear and ear number per unit area increased as the n application rate increased but the 100 grain weight decreased the grain yields under n1 n2 and n3 were 10 97 t ha 1 11 90 t ha 1 and 12 18 t ha 1 respectively compared with fp the three ridge furrow ratios significantly increased the grain yield because improvements in the yield components in particular rf40 70 rf55 55 and rf70 40 significantly increased the grain yields by 12 96 20 28 and 28 98 respectively p 0 05 in both years rf70 40 obtained the highest grain yield under n3 table s2 however the grain yield with rf70 40 did not differ significantly under n2 and n3 p 0 05 mainly because there were generally no significant differences in the ear characteristics and yield components tables s1 and s2 3 3 2 wue in both years the n application rate and planting pattern significantly affected the wue fig 11 compared with fp rfms significantly increased the wue and the effect increased as the ridge furrow ratio increased in particular compared with fp the wue significantly increased by 16 01 22 35 and 31 83 under rf40 70 rf55 55 and rf70 40 respectively p 0 05 increasing the n application rate increased the wue but there were no significant differences between n2 and n3 in some cases especially under rf70 40 4 discussion 4 1 effects of planting pattern and n application rate on soil hydrothermal environment the soil moisture content is considered one of the most critical factors for regulating plant growth and development silvente et al 2012 liao et al 2021 and small differences in soil moisture may also have large impacts on crop productivity liu et al 2010b especially under dryland conditions gan et al 2013 luo et al 2021 mo et al 2016 zhang et al 2019a 2019b and 2019c in the present study both ridge furrow ratio and n application rate had significant effects on soil water content but the increase of both had opposite effects on soil water content compared with fp the soil water content increased significantly under all three ridge furrow ratios and this positive effect increased as the ridge furrow ratio increased figs 3 and 4 which was consistent with the results of li et al 2017 the reason for this phenomenon may be that increasing the ridge furrow ratio enlarges the surface area for collecting precipitation and reduces the contact area between the soil and atmosphere thereby allowing more rainwater to be collected and reducing the non productive consumption of soil water in addition increasing the film coverage can enhance water infiltration zhang et al 2019a and thus a larger ridge furrow ratio is more advantageous in areas with low precipitation li et al 2019 mo et al 2013 li and gong 2002 different from the ridge furrow ratio the increase of n application rate reduced soil water content fig 5 previous studies indicated that this maybe related to the increase of n application rate promote crop dry matter accumulation and intensifies soil water consumption lian et al 2016 di paolo and rinaldi 2008 in other words increased n application rate may exacerbate drought stress in summary soil water content was the highest under the combination rf70 40 and n1 and the lowest under the combination fp and n3 in the loess plateau region drought is one of the most important causes of retarded emergence and weak seedlings in spring maize mo et al 2013 the results obtained in the present study indicate that maintaining the ridge and furrow configuration in the fallow season can enhance the storage and conservation of water especially in the 0 130 cm soil layer thereby facilitating the emergence of spring maize in the following year and maintaining an adequate water supply in the seedling stage we also found that compared with the soil water contents in the medium 40 100 cm and deep 100 200 cm soil layers the different n application rates had more obvious effects on the soil water content in the shallow soil 0 40 cm fig 5 which may be related to the fact that the increase of n application rate mainly promoted the root growth in 0 40 cm soil layer data not shown and 0 40 cm soil layer was the main water absorbing soil layer of spring maize zhang et al 2021c the soil temperature greatly affects plant growth and various physiological and biochemical reactions qin et al 2018 pramanik et al 2015 zhou et al 2012 gan et al 2013 showed that the soil temperature is more important for crop growth than the air temperature in the different spring maize growth stages increasing the soil temperature had opposite effects in the loess plateau region increasing the soil temperature in the early growth period alleviated the restriction on seed germination due to low temperatures thereby ensuring a higher emergence rate however increasing the soil temperature in the later growth period reduced the activity of the roots and accelerated root senescence bu et al 2013b li et al 1999 we found that the soil temperature was only affected by the different planting patterns and not by the n application rates compared with fp the warming effects of the three ridge furrow ratios were not continuous and uniform fig 6 in the early growth stage the spring maize canopy is not established and short wave solar radiation penetrates the film to increase the soil temperature whereas long wave ground radiation cannot penetrate the film liu et al 2020 therefore compared with fp the three ridge furrow ratios all significantly increased the soil temperature we found that the warming effect increased as the ridge furrow ratio increased fig 6 which is consistent with the results obtained by liu et al 2020 in the later growth stage it is difficult for solar short wave radiation to directly reach the ground to increase the soil temperature because the influence of the dense canopy in addition the three ridge furrows ratios all increased the soil water content compared with fp fig 3 and fig 4 it is difficult to increase the soil temperature because the higher specific heat capacity of water wang et al 2008 which leads to no significant differences in the soil temperature under the three ridge furrow ratios and fp and they were even slightly lower than that under fp thus the lack of warming effects under the three ridge furrow ratios could avoid negative impacts on spring maize in the later growth period 4 2 effects of planting pattern and n application rate on spring maize phenology and growth changes in the soil hydrothermal environment and nutrient supply will clearly affect the phenology and growth of plants wu et al 2021 increasing the temperature usually accelerates the growth of plants oteros et al 2015 xu et al 2019 previous studies have shown that rfms shortens the spring maize growth process bu et al 2013b qin et al 2018 where rfms may increase the soil temperature and reduce the activity of superoxide dismutase in the root system to accelerate the senescence of the root system we observed a similar phenomenon under n1 where the three ridge furrow ratios shortened the spring maize growth process by 1 4 days compared with fp fig 7 it is well known that increasing the n application rate can delay plant senescence wen et al 2020 a similar phenomenon was observed in this study fig 7 interestingly under the n2 and n3 application rates the growth process under the three ridge furrow ratios was higher than that under fp especially under rf55 55 and rf70 40 which indicated that the effect of increasing the n application rate on the growth process is more prominent under the three ridge furrow ratios fig 7 we speculated that this phenomenon may be related to the improvement of soil water content which is conducive to the effect of n fertilizer zhang et al 2020 it has been shown that when the grain filling duration is longer more dry matter is transferred from the vegetative organs to the reproductive organs which is more conducive to high yields zhang et al 2019c under drought stress plants tend to reduce water losses by closing the stomata and reducing expansion of the leaf area in order to survive adaptively mwale et al 2007b these plant responses reduce their photosynthetic capacity and the effective interception of solar radiation thereby limiting the accumulation of dry matter liu et al 2010a mwale et al 2007b in the present study under three n application rates compared with fp the three ridge furrow ratios increased the leaf area per plant by improving the soil hydrothermal environment and tr and pn increased because the enhancement of gs zhang et al 2019c these changes have to ultimately promoted the accumulation of dry matter where these effects increased as the ridge furrow ratio increased figs 8 9 and 10 n is an essential element for crop canopy expansion and the maintenance of efficient photosynthesis ali et al 2011 wen et al 2020 but the increased application of n under water stress conditions may damage the leaf structure and reduce photosynthesis xing et al 2021 which may explain why increasing the n application rate had no significant effects on the photosynthetic efficiency and leaf area under fp figs 8 and 9 however the three ridge furrow ratios increased the availability of n by improving the hydrothermal environment thereby leading to increases in the photosynthetic efficiency and leaf area as the n application rate increased the accumulated dry matter exhibited the same trend as the photosynthetic efficiency and leaf area fig 10 the highest accumulated dry matter was obtained under rf70 40 with all three n application rates but there was no significant difference between n2 and n3 this phenomenon may be explained by the limitation of rf70 40 in improving the soil hydrothermal environment leading to a threshold for the n application rate located between n2 and n3 as supported by regression analysis fig s1 4 3 effects of planting pattern and n application rate on spring maize grain yield and wue the core focus of our study is the combined effect of ridge furrow ratio and n application rate on spring maize productivity it is well known that water and n are the main factors affecting crop productivity especially in rain fed farming areas there is a strong interaction between soil water and n on crop productivity ma et al 2021 generally speaking the improvement of the water environment increases the flow of n which is more conducive to being captured by the plant roots in turn to the increase of n absorption will further promote the roots growth and increase the absorption of soil water the coupling effect of the two has a significant positive effect on crop productivity hammad et al 2011 singandhupe et al 2003 this study further proved this coupling effect that is the grain yield and wue of spring maize increased with the increase in the ridge furrow ratio and n application rate table 2 and fig 11 and the correlation analysis showed that this was related to the improvement of photosynthetic characteristics leaf area and dry matter accumulation table s3 at the same time these results also confirmed our hypothesis in general there are thresholds for both the water and n supplies and the crop productivity maybe adversely affected if either of these thresholds is exceeded zhang et al 2019d regression analysis results showed that compared with the other three planting patterns it is obvious that rf70 40 reduced the n input threshold fig s1 therefore we recommend combining rf70 40 with an n application rate of 268 56 274 14 kg ha 1 as a field management strategy for rain fed spring maize planting in the loess plateau region 4 4 implications of this study this study provided a theoretical basis for the optimization of rain fed spring maize management practices in the loess plateau at the same time it provided a reference for other regions in the world that face the same agricultural production environment as this region such as east africa south korea and north korea although the increase in ridge and furrow ratio may have the potential to achieve higher yield per plant the larger ridge and furrow ratio reduces the planting area for example pan et al 2019 found that sunflower has a greater growth advantage under a large ridge furrow ratio but this does not offset the reduction in yield caused by the reduction in planting area therefore the choice of ridge and furrow ratio should be established on the basis of not reducing the number of plants per unit area in addition the choice of field management practices largely depends on climatic conditions soil types farming methods etc the above factors should be considered comprehensively in the optimization of ridge furrow ratio and n application rate in other areas another point of concern is that although large ridge furrow ratio have a higher yield and wue it also increased the area covered by plastic mulch which leads to an increased risk of white pollution therefore future study need to focus on the development and application of alternative plastic film such as degradable film 5 conclusion in the rain fed area of the loess plateau we found that optimizing the ridge furrow ratio and n application rate could improve the hydrothermal environment of the spring maize rhizosphere to stimulate the growth of the canopy thereby increasing the grain yield and wue compared with fp rf70 40 had the most positive effect among the different ridge furrow ratios and it lowered the threshold n application rate we suggest that rf70 40 can be combined with n application at a rate of 268 56 274 14 kg ha 1 to optimize rain fed spring maize growing in the loess plateau region in this study we applied the n fertilizer management strategy used most commonly by local farmers where all of the n fertilizer was applied as a base which may limit the effectiveness of n fertilizer future research should focus on the effects of different n fertilizer application

9701,the shallow lower mississippi river valley alluvial aquifer which supports irrigated agriculture in the lower mississippi delta lmd region is fast depleting from unsustainable water extractions for irrigations the survival of irrigated agriculture in the region today hinges on enhancing the irrigation use efficiencies of the water pumped out furrow irrigation practices surface or flood irrigation dominate the lmd region s irrigated agriculture scenario we investigated soybean productivity in response to irrigations applied through every furrow fi applied through alternate furrow afi and rainfed rf no irrigation approximately half the volume of water applied in fi was applied in the afi the experiments were conducted in 2016 2018 and 2020 which constituted the soybean phases of a corn soybean rotation trial conducted on a clay soil in farm scale plots 15 ha the plots were equipped with eddy covariance systems for quantifying crop water use et evapotranspiration there was no appreciable difference in soybean grain yield between fi and afi but rf yielded significantly lower than fi and afi leaf area index was also significantly lower in rf compared to fi and afi across the three years the average reduction in soybean yield was only 2 in afi while it was 24 in rf compared to fi average grain yields were 4507 4413 and 3422 kg ha 1 seasonal et were 549 562 and 527 mm and water use efficiencies wue were 8 8 and 7 kg ha 1 mm 1 in fi afi and rf respectively this large farm scale study demonstrated that grain yields from irrigating soybean through alternate furrows were comparable to irrigating through every furrow thus saving about half the water pumped out of the aquifer this unique study was conducted in farm scale fields as such the results obtained directly

irrigated agriculture depends on increasing productivity of the groundwater pumped out for irrigations wada et al 2014 gleeson et al 2010 scanlon et al 2012 wada et al 2012 estimated the nonrenewable

delta lmd region is drying up from unsustainable water extractions which far exceeds its natural recharge capacities wax et al 2009 guzman et al 2014 with limited access to surface water resources groundwater is the main source of irrigation water in this region furrow irrigation practices surface or flood irrigation dominate the lmd region s irrigated agriculture scenario in which water delivered at the head of the furrows flows down to their tail end irrigating crops grown on raised beds on either side wood et al 2017 the efficiency of furrow irrigation systems was below 55 the lowest compared to sprinkler and drip irrigation systems irmak et al 2011 notwithstanding the flat terrain and sufficient groundwater availability combined with ample rainfall make furrow irrigation the most viable irrigation method widely accepted by the farmers in the region snipes et al 2005 to check the continued decline of the mrvaa with the realization that the mrvaa water is finite we must generate technologies and information focused on enhancing the productivity of the water pumped out of it for irrigations investigations for improving water use efficiencies wue the amount of water needed to produce grains in specific soil climates of cropping systems have been in general hampered by the absence of viable methods for accurately quantifying water used by the crop in response to water applications soil and climate variability and change howell 2001 wada et al 2012 hanasaki et al 2010 anapalli et al 2019a seckler 1996 and seckler et al 1998 demonstrated that one of the prime opportunities for enhancing the productivity of applied irrigation water lies in enhancing the productivity of water applied by reducing the loss from evaporation runoff and percolation while water is transported to the crops for irrigations many irrigated agricultural systems in the world use much more water to irrigate crops than the crop s need for consumptive water requirements howell 2001 wada et al 2012 grain yield response to irrigation rises linearly with water inputs to a maximum but falls with higher input rates geerts and raes 2009 saseendran et al 2015 optimizing return from irrigation water applications at locations climates and soils requires accurate information on actual water used by crops and the grain yield returns technology that is portable across soils and cropping systems and easy to set up and collect data are prerequisites in this regard varzi 2016 measuring crop water requirements directly by growing crops in large scale field lysimeters was considered one of the highly accurate methods for quantification of et from cropping systems these systems often require sophisticated costly equipment and highly technical personnel to install maintain and collect data howell et al 1995 2004 moorhead et al 2019 the data collected also represents only the location specific climate soil and crop conditions but for research aimed at enhancing wue in agricultural systems continuous monitoring of et across multiple soils and climates representing the landscapes of interest is often required which lysimeters are seldom capable of due to their non portability in these circumstances the latest advancements in environmental monitoring and computing technology offer a portable sound micrometeorological theory based method the eddy covariance ec technique for quantifying et foken et al 2012 nicolini et al 2017 anapalli et al 2019a 2020 in the pilot stages of development the ec systems often had problems in balancing energy inputs and outputs from landscapes by about 0 30 baldocchi 2003 foken et al 2006 over the last couple of decades sound micrometeorological theory and measurement based methods have been developed for overcoming the energy balance non closure issue in the ec measurements for examples mauder and foken 2006 meyers and hollinger 2004 fratini and mauder 2014 de roo et al 2018 denager et al 2020 measured and compared six year ec based et from an agricultural field with detailed water balance measurements irrespective of the energy balance non closure in half hour energy fluxes et estimates from the two methods were comparable over a monthly scale using parameterizations based on large eddy simulation studies de roo et al 2018 developed methods for applying energy balance residual corrections to sensible and latent heat fluxes to achieve energy balance closure between 90 and 100 using this method for analyzing ec flux data anapalli et al 2018 2019b 2020 quantified and compared the et and wue efficiencies of corn zea mays l soybean glycine max l and cotton gossypium hirsutum l crops in the lmd for helping producers in selecting the best crop mix for natural resources conservation in the region leininger et al 2019 demonstrated that by irrigating alternate furrows instead of every furrow a 1 8 fold increase in irrigation wue could be achieved in peanut cropping systems in sandy loam soils in the lmd the investigations were based on the irrigations applied lacking measurements of actual water used by the crop notwithstanding the substantial enhancement in wue indirectly established that even with alternate furrow irrigations which delivered about half of the water supplied through all furrow irrigations the et demand of the crop could be fully met from the water available in the soil for the plant uptake pinnamaneni et al 2020a 2020b reported comparable yield and economic returns from cotton and soybean in a silt loam soil in the lmd when irrigations were applied through all the furrows and half that much water was applied through alternate furrows however actual water used by the crops was not established in those experiments for strong recommendations for adopting the technologies developed in small plot experiments repeating the experiments at multi locations and climates in farm scale plots was advocated yan et al 2002 schmidt et al 2018 the farm scale on farm trials provide the opportunity to evaluate irrigation water management technologies under realistic farming conditions yet another need for farm scale experiments from the concept of soil water plant atmosphere the pathway for water moving through the crop system which render water applied through irrigations spread three dimensionally as the water in the system spread in all directions in small plots we may not be able to do experiments without treatment interactions but this may be possible in larger farm scale plots this necessitates the instruments like lysimeters eddy covariance systems and energy balance systems used in the quantification of et from cropping systems to have enough land size farm scale for example for the air entering the crop field to have homogenized with the physical properties of the crop canopy environment for measurements burba and anderson 2005 moorhead et al 2019 objectives of our study were to 1 evaluate soybean yield responses to irrigations applied through all the furrows fi full irrigation alternate furrows afi half of fi and rainfed rf no irrigation and 2 quantify et and wue responses of the crop in response to these irrigations using eddy covariance instrumentation in farm scale experiments 2 materials and methods 2 1 soybean experiments the experiment was an irrigated corn soybean rotation conducted

elevation above mean sea level located in the lmd data from the soybean phase of the experiments in 2016 2018 and 2020 were used in this investigation the investigation aimed to evaluate soybean production responses to fi afi and rf in the furrow irrigation scenario and quantify the water used by the crop in these systems using the ec technology the sensors used in the ec system for measuring water and energy fluxes from landscapes require a measurement height to horizontal distance to the edge of the field the fetch ratio of at least 1 100 in all directions nicolini et al 2017 burba and anderson 2005 to achieve these conditions the field trials were conducted in three 15 ha farm scale fields and the ec sensors were centrally located in the fields to obtain maximum fetch in all directions the three farm size plots required for this research restricted the experiments to be conducted without replications in a single season however we randomly applied the fi afi and rf treatments to the three plots and repeated the experiment over three years the three years were considered as three blocks in which the three treatments were randomly applied this unique layout rendered the experiments a randomized complete block design with three replications for statistical analysis casler 2015 irrigations were surface applied flood at the head of furrows through lay flat polyethylene pipes to run continuously down the 1 slope artificially maintained in the plots the ec sensors were periodically adjusted at about twice the plant height above the soybean canopy using hand pump operated height adjustable towers this procedure gave confidence that the sensors are in the constant flux layer above the frictional sublayer in the atmosphere above the plant canopy irrigations were initiated when the measured water content in the top 30 cm soil layer declined to about 65 of plant available water paw irrigation supply to individual furrows was shut down when water running down the field reached their tail ends when 80 of the furrows were completely irrigated this way irrigation to the whole fi plots was shut down as there was water loss between the flow meter and delivery point at the head of the furrow we could not get the exact amount of water applied in each irrigation based on measurements in 2016 we estimated that one irrigation at fi rate consumed about 30 mm of water if water was shut down when about 80 of the rows were fully irrigated irrigations in afi were about half of fi irrigations and this was achieved by shutting down irrigations when about 70 of the rows in which irrigations were applied were completely irrigated in two parallel experiments with fi and afi trials in soybean and cotton at the location we established that afi treatment consumes about half the amount of irrigation water applied in the fi pinnamaneni et al 2020a 2020b in the fi we applied two irrigations 60 mm in 2016 and three irrigations 90 mm per season in 2018 and 2020 table 5 fig 1 the afi treatments were 30 45 and 45 mm of water per season in 2016 2018 and 2020 respectively from the textural analysis of soil samples to

across the three plots table 1 the crops were planted under conventional tillage practices prevalent in the lmd region which consisted of one or two tillage passes with a row crop cultivator for killing weeds and a pass of post harvest chisel plow or disk harrow tillage to destroy weeds and incorporate previous crop residue and to generate raised bed ridges for soybean planting and furrows in between to facilitate furrow irrigations before planting in spring a passage of a spike tooth harrow was used to smooth the seedbeds for planting pre and post emergent herbicides as required were applied to control weeds a row crop cultivator with shallow sweeps was used after plant emergence to improve furrows between planted soybean rows for smooth flow of rain or irrigation water 2 2

hand pump operated telescopic height adjustable mast ec tower centrally located in each plot was used for installing the sonic anemometer and infrared gas analyzer above the crop canopy the sensor heights were constantly maintained at about twice the plant canopy height above the plant canopy that is within the constant flux layer we recorded the measurements at 10 hz on a data logger for characterizing the microclimate and energy balance of the crop canopy we also measured 1 soil heat flux using six self calibrating soil heat flux plates hp01sc hukseflux thermal sensors b v delft the

differences at alpha 0 05 3 results and discussion 3 1 weather during the crop seasons the lmd region has a humid subtropical climate with mild winters and warm summers kottek et al 2006 the mean annual rainfall is about 130 cm out of which only about 30 is usually received during the core soybean growing season from may to august anapalli et al 2016 in the three years of this experiment soybean plantings were on may 4 2016 may 10 2018 and april 30 2020 table 2 variations in planting dates across crop seasons were primarily due to rains that rendered the fields too wet for planting seeds the crop reached full maturity stage r8 on 126 117 and 125 days in 2016 2018 and 2020 respectively effective growth periods egp that is from planting to beginning maturity stage r7 during which the plant roots uptake water from the soil for active growth were 112 107 and 115 days after planting dap the plant senesces quickly from the r7 stage until full maturity r8 rainfall received in the three years during the egp were 493 516 and 472 mm respectively figs 1 2 and the number of rainy days in the three years was 28 30 and 41 the highest daily rainfalls recorded were 106 mm in 2016 103 mm in 2018 and 76 mm in 2020 the three largest continuous rain free days were 10 11 and 15 days in 2016 5 6 and 9 days in 2018 and 4 9 and 9 days in 2020 these long non rainy days together with insignificant rainy days during the egp necessitated irrigations twice in 2016 and thrice each in 2018 and 2020 crop seasons fig 1 air temperature across the three growing seasons varied between 7 c daily minimum temperature in may and 37 c daily maximum temperature in july fig 3 the weather variable that exhibited the highest variability during the crop growth period was solar radiation received at the crop canopy and varied between 4 and 28 mj m 2 d 1 owing to skies partially to fully overcast from frequent cloud developments in the humid climate of this region 3 2 phenology there were no noticeable differences in occurrences of the phenological stages of growth of the soybean plants across the three irrigation treatments soybean seeds emerged 7 7 and 5 days after planting dap in 2016 2018 and 2020 respectively table 2 soybean phenology depends on the number of growing degree days gdd above a base temperature 10 c the plant is subjected to starting from the seedling emergence desclaux and roumet 1996 the cumulative gdds from planting to the r8 stage in the three crop seasons were 1871 1893 and 1814 the crop reached the full seed stage r6 determining the yield potential in each crop season on 109 102 and 99 dap respectively the full maturity stage r8 the harvest stage after which the seed weight does not change was achieved on 126 117 and 125 dap in the three years across the three crop seasons the crop duration differed by 9 days it is possible the differences in growth duration had occurred from across the year variations in the soil water weather parameters interacting with the genotype that resulted in early crop maturity in 2018 117 days when it took 126 days to mature in 2016 3 3 lai measured lai differed considerably across the fi afi and rf irrigation treatments however differences between fi and afi treatments were low compared to the differences between fi and afi differences from rf fig 4 in general the measured lai under the fi treatment remained higher than those measured under the afi and rf treatments this means that applied irrigation water helped the plant alleviate adverse soil water stress effects on leaf expansion plant growth and grow better vegetatively producing more leaf area however taller plants with increased leaf growth were reported not to translate to a proportional increase in grain yield returns in soybean eck et al 1988 like soil water deficit stress excess water in the soil less oxygen also compromises yield in soybeans owing to root tip decay sugimoto et al 1988 1989 during the 2016 crop season under the fi afi and rf treatments the measured seasonal maximum lai were 6 8 6 2 and 4 8 respectively seasonal maximum lai measured during the 2018 season were 6 2 6 2 and 4 9 in the fi afi and rf treatments during the 2020 crop season the lai recorded were 6 5 6 5 and 4 6 the lower lai observed in the rf treatments translated into significant grain yield reductions across the three crop seasons as described below 3 4 evapotranspiration using these methodologies developed based on sound micrometeorological theories the computed 30 minute energy balance closure in the three crop seasons across three irrigation levels varied between 91 and 97 with an average of 94 moorhead et al 2019 obtained 64 and 67 closure in energy balance without applying any corrections for fluxes with this closure level they found that at a daily time scale the error in et estimation compared to those measured using large scale field lysimeters were between 10 and 15 in our study we did not have lysimeter measurements for comparing the ec estimated et to compare against for accuracy but the average 94 energy balance closure can reasonably provide a better level of accuracy in et estimates for use in water management applications across the three crop seasons both half hourly and daily soybean et estimates in the afi treatment were marginally higher than the et measured in the fi treatment figs 2 5 6 7b however et in the rf treatments was substantially lower than et in both fi and afi across the different months may june july and august of the three crop seasons 2016 2018 and 2020 measured et in the fi treatment varied between 2 1 and 6 1 mm measured daily et in the afi treatment varied between 2 4 and 6 3 mm and between 2 3 and 5 8 in the rf treatment table 3 seasonal average daily et averaged across the three seasons were 4 9 5 0 and 4 7 mm respectively in fi afi and rf seasonal emergence to r7 et varied between 514 and 555 mm in fi 535 and 598 mm in the afi and 494 and 557 in the rf treatments table 5 fig 2 averaged across three seasons seasonal et in the three treatments were 539 562 and 527 mm respectively table 5 averaged across the three crop seasons seasonal rainfall was 494 mm and total water applied rainfall irrigation in fi and afi were 573 mm and 534 mm respectively as above the measured lai under the fi treatment was slightly higher than that measured in afi however the potential contribution of the higher leaf area available for transpiring more water t transpiration component of et did not translate into higher et from this treatment it is possible the higher lai under the fi closed the canopy over the bare soil between rows faster and better than the afi with less lai this possibly lead to less direct evaporation e bare soil evaporation component of et from the soil surface resulting in less total water loss et e t figs 2 4 5 6 the frequent rainfall events combined with the added water from the irrigation events maintained the soil surface wet for keeping e at a higher rate in the afi treatment with less canopy closure 3 5 grain yield and wue spatial average yields across the three crop seasons in the fi afi and rf were 4507 4413 and 3422 kg ha 1 respectively table 4 fig 7a though significantly different at p 0 05 yield in the afi treatment was only 94 kg ha 1 less than fi that means only a 2 decrease in grain yield compared to fi in irrigation trials in a silt loam soil in the lmd pinnamaneni et al 2020a 2020b demonstrated that comparable yield and economic returns from cotton and soybean are possible when irrigations were applied through conventional all furrows and half as much water were applied through alternate furrows in a semiarid climate in nebraska usa graterol et al 1993 reported similar soybean grain yields across fi and afi irrigation experiments in this experiment in afi treatments irrigation water applied was only about half the irrigation water applied in the fi treatment in our experiments grain yield in rf treatment was significantly lower than grain yields harvested in fi and afi treatments averaged across 2016 2018 and 2020 crop seasons by 1085 and 991 kg ha 1 respectively averaged across the three years grain yield harvested in rf was 24 lower than grain yield in fi treatment tables 4 and 5 fig 7a across the three crop seasons the grain yields in afi were less than fi by 0 in 2016 to 4 in 2018 grain yield reduction in rf treatment compared to fi varied between 14 in 2016 and 30 in 2020 the consistent significant reduction in soybean yields in rf treatment shows the importance of irrigating soybean in the lmd to increase net returns from soybean cropping systems in small plot studies in the lmd leininger et al 2019 reported increased yield returns from the practice of applying irrigations through afi they reported that fi treatments could lead to over irrigation related yield losses in peanut production systems in the lmd our study in farm scale plots over multiple years demonstrated the importance of adopting the afi system for water conservation in soybean cropping systems in the lmd wue defined as the amount of grain yield per amount of water consumed by the plant in meeting the et demands in fi and afi were similar in magnitude but higher than the values obtained for the rf treatment averaged across the three crop seasons wue in rf was lower than afi and fi by 1 kg ha 1 mm 1 table 5 fig 7c in small plot studies in the semiarid climate of nebraska usa graterol et al 1993 obtained a wue of 7 kg ha 1 mm 1 under fi irrigation and 6 kg ha 1 mm 1 under afi irrigation in our study wue between the afi and fi treatments coincided during the three crop seasons wue varied between 7 and 9 kg ha 1 mm 1 under the fi and afi treatments and 6 and 7 kg ha 1 mm 1 under rf in summary the afi treatment needs only about half the irrigation water required for the fi however both treatments resulted in similar water use efficiencies and comparable grain yield returns 4 conclusions conventional furrow surface flood irrigations have the lowest irrigation efficiency among various irrigation methods sprinkler and drip irrigations have better irrigation efficiencies available to farmers in the lower mississippi delta region while the irrigation efficiency is low it is also true that the irrigations applied to crops through furrow irrigations exceed the crop water demands it is unequivocal that the shallow mrvaa underlying this region is declining from exploitation far exceeding the natural recharge rates of this aquifer using eddy covariance based sensors in large farm scale fields we quantified water used by the crops in all furrow fi alternate furrow afi irrigations and rainfed unirrigated treatments soybean irrigated through fi and afi supplied enough water for the optimum production of the crop consequently soybean grain yields were similar in afi and fi the rf consumed less water however it yielded significantly lower as well this large farm scale study in the lmd region indicated that crops can be irrigated through afi saving about half the irrigation water while producing comparable grain yields this farm scale study is being continued for quantifying similar irrigation responses of corn cotton and rice crops across major soils and climates in the region for developing decision

9701,the shallow lower mississippi river valley alluvial aquifer which supports irrigated agriculture in the lower mississippi delta lmd region is fast depleting from unsustainable water extractions for irrigations the survival of irrigated agriculture in the region today hinges on enhancing the irrigation use efficiencies of the water pumped out furrow irrigation practices surface or flood irrigation dominate the lmd region s irrigated agriculture scenario we investigated soybean productivity in response to irrigations applied through every furrow fi applied through alternate furrow afi and rainfed rf no irrigation approximately half the volume of water applied in fi was applied in the afi the experiments were conducted in 2016 2018 and 2020 which constituted the soybean phases of a corn soybean rotation trial conducted on a clay soil in farm scale plots 15 ha the plots were equipped with eddy covariance systems for quantifying crop water use et evapotranspiration there was no appreciable difference in soybean grain yield between fi and afi but rf yielded significantly lower than fi and afi leaf area index was also significantly lower in rf compared to fi and afi across the three years the average reduction in soybean yield was only 2 in afi while it was 24 in rf compared to fi average grain yields were 4507 4413 and 3422 kg ha 1 seasonal et were 549 562 and 527 mm and water use efficiencies wue were 8 8 and 7 kg ha 1 mm 1 in fi afi and rf respectively this large farm scale study demonstrated that grain yields from irrigating soybean through alternate furrows were comparable to irrigating through every furrow thus saving about half the water pumped out of the aquifer this unique study was conducted in farm scale fields as such the results obtained directly

irrigated agriculture depends on increasing productivity of the groundwater pumped out for irrigations wada et al 2014 gleeson et al 2010 scanlon et al 2012 wada et al 2012 estimated the nonrenewable

groundwater is the main source of irrigation water in this region furrow irrigation practices surface or flood irrigation dominate the lmd region s irrigated agriculture scenario in which water delivered at the head of the furrows flows down to their tail end irrigating crops grown on raised beds on either side wood et al 2017 the efficiency of furrow irrigation systems was below 55 the lowest compared to sprinkler and drip irrigation systems irmak et al 2011 notwithstanding the flat terrain and sufficient groundwater availability combined with ample rainfall make furrow irrigation the most viable irrigation method widely accepted by the farmers in the region snipes et al 2005 to check the continued decline of the mrvaa with the realization that the mrvaa water is finite we must generate technologies and information focused on enhancing the productivity of the water pumped out of it for irrigations investigations for improving water use efficiencies wue the amount of water needed to produce grains in specific soil climates of cropping systems have been in general hampered by the absence of viable methods for accurately quantifying water used by the crop in response to water applications soil and climate variability and change howell 2001 wada et al 2012 hanasaki et al 2010 anapalli et al 2019a seckler 1996 and seckler et al 1998 demonstrated that one of the prime opportunities for enhancing the productivity of applied irrigation water lies in enhancing the productivity of water applied by reducing the loss from evaporation runoff and percolation while water is transported to the crops for irrigations many irrigated agricultural systems in the world use much more water to irrigate crops than the crop s need for consumptive water requirements howell 2001 wada et al 2012 grain yield response to irrigation rises linearly with water inputs to a maximum but falls with higher input rates geerts and raes 2009 saseendran et al 2015 optimizing return from irrigation water applications at locations climates and soils requires accurate information on actual water used by crops and the grain yield returns technology that is portable across soils and cropping systems and easy to set up and collect data are prerequisites in this regard varzi 2016 measuring crop water requirements directly by growing crops in large scale field lysimeters was considered one of the highly accurate methods for quantification of et from cropping systems these systems often require sophisticated costly equipment and highly technical personnel to install maintain and collect data howell et al 1995 2004 moorhead et al 2019 the data collected also represents only the location specific climate soil and crop conditions but for research aimed at enhancing wue in agricultural systems continuous monitoring of et across multiple soils and climates representing the landscapes of interest is often required which lysimeters are seldom capable of due to their non portability in these circumstances the latest advancements in environmental monitoring and computing technology offer a portable sound micrometeorological theory based method the eddy covariance ec technique for quantifying et foken et al 2012 nicolini et al 2017 anapalli et al 2019a 2020 in the pilot stages of development the ec systems often had problems in balancing energy inputs and outputs from landscapes by about 0 30 baldocchi 2003 foken et al 2006 over the last couple of decades sound micrometeorological theory and measurement based methods have been developed for overcoming the energy balance non closure issue in the ec measurements for examples mauder and foken 2006 meyers and hollinger 2004 fratini and mauder 2014 de roo et al 2018 denager et al 2020 measured and compared six year ec based et from an agricultural field with detailed water balance measurements irrespective of the energy balance non closure in half hour energy fluxes et estimates from the two methods were comparable over a monthly scale using parameterizations based on large eddy simulation studies de roo et al 2018 developed methods for applying energy balance residual corrections to sensible and latent heat fluxes to achieve energy balance closure between 90 and 100 using this method for analyzing ec flux data anapalli et al 2018 2019b 2020 quantified and compared the et and wue efficiencies of corn zea mays l soybean glycine max l and cotton gossypium hirsutum l crops in the lmd for helping producers in selecting the best crop mix for natural resources conservation in the region leininger et al 2019 demonstrated that by irrigating alternate furrows instead of every furrow a 1 8 fold increase in irrigation wue could be achieved in peanut cropping systems in sandy loam soils in the lmd the investigations were based on the irrigations applied lacking measurements of actual water used by the crop notwithstanding the substantial enhancement in wue indirectly established that even with alternate furrow irrigations which delivered about half of the water supplied through all furrow irrigations the et demand of the crop could be fully met from the water available in the soil for the plant uptake pinnamaneni et al 2020a 2020b reported comparable yield and economic returns from cotton and soybean in a silt loam soil in the lmd when irrigations were applied through all the furrows and half that much water was applied through alternate furrows however actual water used by the crops was not established in those experiments for strong recommendations for adopting the technologies developed in small plot experiments repeating the experiments at multi locations and climates in farm scale plots was advocated yan et al 2002 schmidt et al 2018 the farm scale on farm trials provide the opportunity to evaluate irrigation water management technologies under realistic farming conditions yet another need for farm scale experiments from the concept of soil water plant atmosphere the pathway for water moving through the crop system which render water applied through irrigations spread three dimensionally as the water in the system spread in all directions in small plots we may not be able to do experiments without treatment interactions but this may be possible in larger farm scale plots this necessitates the instruments like lysimeters eddy covariance systems and energy balance systems used in the quantification of et from cropping systems to have enough land size farm scale for example for the air entering the crop field to have homogenized with the physical properties of the crop canopy environment for measurements burba and anderson 2005 moorhead et al 2019 objectives of our study were to 1 evaluate soybean yield responses to irrigations applied through all the furrows fi full irrigation alternate furrows afi half of fi and rainfed rf no irrigation and 2 quantify et and wue responses of the crop in response to these irrigations using eddy covariance instrumentation in farm scale experiments 2 materials and methods 2 1 soybean experiments the experiment was an irrigated corn soybean rotation conducted

elevation above mean sea level located in the lmd data from the soybean phase of the experiments in 2016 2018 and 2020 were used in this investigation the investigation aimed to evaluate soybean production responses to fi afi and rf in the furrow irrigation scenario and quantify the water used by the crop in these systems using the ec technology the sensors used in the ec system for measuring water and energy fluxes from landscapes require a measurement height to horizontal distance to the edge of the field the fetch ratio of at least 1 100 in all directions nicolini et al 2017 burba and anderson 2005 to achieve these conditions the field trials were conducted in three 15 ha farm scale fields and the ec sensors were centrally located in the fields to obtain maximum fetch in all directions the three farm size plots required for this research restricted the experiments to be conducted without replications in a single season however we randomly applied the fi afi and rf treatments to the three plots and repeated the experiment over three years the three years were considered as three blocks in which the three treatments were randomly applied this unique layout rendered the experiments a randomized complete block design with three replications for statistical analysis casler 2015 irrigations were surface applied flood at the head of furrows through lay flat polyethylene pipes to run continuously down the 1 slope artificially maintained in the plots the ec sensors were periodically adjusted at about twice the plant height above the soybean canopy using hand pump operated height adjustable towers this procedure gave confidence that the sensors are in the constant flux layer above the frictional sublayer in the atmosphere above the plant canopy irrigations were initiated when the measured water content in the top 30 cm soil layer declined to about 65 of plant available water paw irrigation supply to individual furrows was shut down when water running down the field reached their tail ends when 80 of the furrows were completely irrigated this way irrigation to the whole fi plots was shut down as there was water loss between the flow meter and delivery point at the head of the furrow we could not get the exact amount of water applied in each irrigation based on measurements in 2016 we estimated that one irrigation at fi rate consumed about 30 mm of water if water was shut down when about 80 of the rows were fully irrigated irrigations in afi were about half of fi irrigations and this was achieved by shutting down irrigations when about 70 of the rows in which irrigations were applied were completely irrigated in two parallel experiments with fi and afi trials in soybean and cotton at the location we established that afi treatment consumes about half the amount of irrigation water applied in the fi pinnamaneni et al 2020a 2020b in the fi we applied two irrigations 60 mm in 2016 and three irrigations 90 mm per season in 2018 and 2020 table 5 fig 1 the afi treatments were 30 45 and 45 mm of water per season in 2016 2018 and 2020 respectively from the textural analysis of soil samples to a depth of 45 cm the soil was identified as clay sharkey clay clayey over loamy montmorillonitic non acid thermic vertic halaquepet https websoilsurvey nrcs usda gov app websoilsurvey aspx uniform across the three plots table 1 the crops were planted under conventional tillage practices prevalent in the lmd region which consisted of one or two tillage passes with a row crop cultivator for killing weeds and a pass of post harvest chisel plow or disk harrow tillage to destroy weeds and incorporate previous crop residue and to generate raised bed ridges for soybean planting and furrows in between to facilitate furrow irrigations before planting in spring a passage of a spike tooth harrow was used to smooth the seedbeds for planting pre and post emergent herbicides as required were applied to control weeds a row crop cultivator with shallow sweeps was used after plant emergence to improve furrows between planted soybean rows for smooth flow of rain or irrigation water 2 2

reference the data for geo spatial analysis grains were harvested every year after about a week from the full seed maturity stage r8 stage table 2 moisture contents of harvested grain weights were adjusted to 13 soil water contents at 8 and 30 cm depths two on either side of ridges and one in the middle of furrows were monitored using stevens hydraprobe stevens water monitoring systems inc portland or usa 2 3 eddy covariance measurements for quantifying et in the ec system a sonic anemometer gill new wind master gill instruments lymington uk was used for measuring the velocity of components for wind speed of propagation of eddies and sonic temperature an open path infrared gas analyzer li 7500 rs li cor inc nebraska usa was used to measure water vapor density in the eddies a hand pump operated telescopic height adjustable mast ec tower centrally located in each plot was used for installing the sonic anemometer and infrared gas analyzer above the crop canopy the sensor heights were constantly maintained at about twice the plant canopy height above the plant canopy that is within the constant flux layer we recorded the measurements at 10 hz on a data logger for characterizing the microclimate and energy balance of the crop canopy we also measured 1 soil heat flux using six self calibrating soil heat flux plates hp01sc hukseflux thermal sensors b v delft the

differences at alpha 0 05 3 results and discussion 3 1 weather during the crop seasons the lmd region has a humid subtropical climate with mild winters and warm summers kottek et al 2006 the mean annual rainfall is about 130 cm out of which only about 30 is usually received during the core soybean growing season from may to august anapalli et al 2016 in the three years of this experiment soybean plantings were on may 4 2016 may 10 2018 and april 30 2020 table 2 variations in planting dates across crop seasons were primarily due to rains that rendered the fields too wet for planting seeds the crop reached full maturity stage r8 on 126 117 and 125 days in 2016 2018 and 2020 respectively effective growth periods egp that is from planting to beginning maturity stage r7 during which the plant roots uptake water from the soil for active growth were 112 107 and 115 days after planting dap the plant senesces quickly from the r7 stage until full maturity r8 rainfall received in the three years during the egp were 493 516 and 472 mm respectively figs 1 2 and the number of rainy days in the three years was 28 30 and 41 the highest daily rainfalls recorded were 106 mm in 2016 103 mm in 2018 and 76 mm in 2020 the three largest continuous rain free days were 10 11 and 15 days in 2016 5 6 and 9 days in 2018 and 4 9 and 9 days in 2020 these long non rainy days together with insignificant rainy days during the egp necessitated irrigations twice in 2016 and thrice each in 2018 and 2020 crop seasons fig 1 air temperature across the three growing seasons varied between 7 c daily minimum temperature in may and 37 c daily maximum temperature in july fig 3 the weather variable that exhibited the highest variability during the crop growth period was solar radiation received at the crop canopy and varied between 4 and 28 mj m 2 d 1 owing to skies partially to fully overcast from frequent cloud developments in the humid climate of this region 3 2 phenology there were no noticeable differences in occurrences of the phenological stages of growth of the soybean plants across the three irrigation treatments soybean seeds emerged 7 7 and 5 days after planting dap in 2016 2018 and 2020 respectively table 2 soybean phenology depends on the number of growing degree days gdd above a base temperature 10 c the plant is subjected to starting from the seedling emergence desclaux and roumet 1996 the cumulative gdds from planting to the r8 stage in the three crop seasons were 1871 1893 and 1814 the crop reached the full seed stage r6 determining the yield potential in each crop season on 109 102 and 99 dap respectively the full maturity stage r8 the harvest stage after which the seed weight does not change was achieved on 126 117 and 125 dap in the three years across the three crop seasons the crop duration differed by 9 days it is possible the differences in growth duration had occurred from across the year variations in the soil water weather parameters interacting with the genotype that resulted in early crop maturity in 2018 117 days when it took 126 days to mature in 2016 3 3 lai measured lai differed considerably across the fi afi and rf irrigation treatments however differences between fi and afi treatments were low compared to the differences between fi and afi differences from rf fig 4 in general the measured lai under the fi treatment remained higher than those measured under the afi and rf treatments this means that applied irrigation water helped the plant alleviate adverse soil water stress effects on leaf expansion plant growth and grow better vegetatively producing more leaf area however taller plants with increased leaf growth were reported not to translate to a proportional increase in grain yield returns in soybean eck et al 1988 like soil water deficit stress excess water in the soil less oxygen also compromises yield in soybeans owing to root tip decay sugimoto et al 1988 1989 during the 2016 crop season under the fi afi and rf treatments the measured seasonal maximum lai were 6 8 6 2 and 4 8 respectively seasonal maximum lai measured during the 2018 season were 6 2 6 2 and 4 9 in the fi afi and rf treatments during the 2020 crop season the lai recorded were 6 5 6 5 and 4 6 the lower lai observed in the rf treatments translated into significant grain yield reductions across the three crop seasons as described below 3 4 evapotranspiration using these methodologies developed based on sound micrometeorological theories the computed 30 minute energy balance closure in the three crop seasons across three irrigation levels varied between 91 and 97 with an average of 94 moorhead et al 2019 obtained 64 and 67 closure in energy balance without applying any corrections for fluxes with this closure level they found that at a daily time scale the error in et estimation compared to those measured using large scale field lysimeters were between 10 and 15 in our study we did not have lysimeter measurements for comparing the ec estimated et to compare against for accuracy but the average 94 energy balance closure can reasonably provide a better level of accuracy in et estimates for use in water management applications across the three crop seasons both half hourly and daily soybean et estimates in the afi treatment were marginally higher than the et measured in the fi treatment figs 2 5 6 7b however et in the rf treatments was substantially lower than et in both fi and afi across the different months may june july and august of the three crop seasons 2016 2018 and 2020 measured et in the fi treatment varied between 2 1 and 6 1 mm measured daily et in the afi treatment varied between 2 4 and 6 3 mm and between 2 3 and 5 8 in the rf treatment table 3 seasonal average daily et averaged across the three seasons were 4 9 5 0 and 4 7 mm respectively in fi afi and rf seasonal emergence to r7 et varied between 514 and 555 mm in fi 535 and 598 mm in the afi and 494 and 557 in the rf treatments table 5 fig 2 averaged across three seasons seasonal et in the three treatments were 539 562 and 527 mm respectively table 5 averaged across the three crop seasons seasonal rainfall was 494 mm and total water applied rainfall irrigation in fi and afi were 573 mm and 534 mm respectively as above the measured lai under the fi treatment was slightly higher than that measured in afi however the potential contribution of the higher leaf area available for transpiring more water t transpiration component of et did not translate into higher et from this treatment it is possible the higher lai under the fi closed the canopy over the bare soil between rows faster and better than the afi with less lai this possibly lead to less direct evaporation e bare soil evaporation component of et from the soil surface resulting in less total water loss et e t figs 2 4 5 6 the frequent rainfall events combined with the added water from the irrigation events maintained the soil surface wet for keeping e at a higher rate in the afi treatment with less canopy closure 3 5 grain yield and wue spatial average yields across the three crop seasons in the fi afi and rf were 4507 4413 and 3422 kg ha 1 respectively table 4 fig 7a though significantly different at p 0 05 yield in the afi treatment was only 94 kg ha 1 less than fi that means only a 2 decrease in grain yield compared to fi in irrigation trials in a silt loam soil in the lmd pinnamaneni et al 2020a 2020b demonstrated that comparable yield and economic returns from cotton and soybean are possible when irrigations were applied through conventional all furrows and half as much water were applied through alternate furrows in a semiarid climate in nebraska usa graterol et al 1993 reported similar soybean grain yields across fi and afi irrigation experiments in this experiment in afi treatments irrigation water applied was only about half the irrigation water applied in the fi treatment in our experiments grain yield in rf treatment was significantly lower than grain yields harvested in fi and afi treatments averaged across 2016 2018 and 2020 crop seasons by 1085 and 991 kg ha 1 respectively averaged across the three years grain yield harvested in rf was 24 lower than grain yield in fi treatment tables 4 and 5 fig 7a across the three crop seasons the grain yields in afi were less than fi by 0 in 2016 to 4 in 2018 grain yield reduction in rf treatment compared to fi varied between 14 in 2016 and 30 in 2020 the consistent significant reduction in soybean yields in rf treatment shows the importance of irrigating soybean in the lmd to increase net returns from soybean cropping systems in small plot studies in the lmd leininger et al 2019 reported increased yield returns from the practice of applying irrigations through afi they reported that fi treatments could lead to over irrigation related yield losses in peanut production systems in the lmd our study in farm scale plots over multiple years demonstrated the importance of adopting the afi system for water conservation in soybean cropping systems in the lmd wue defined as the amount of grain yield per amount of water consumed by the plant in meeting the et demands in fi and afi were similar in magnitude but higher than the values obtained for the rf treatment averaged across the three crop seasons wue in rf was lower than afi and fi by 1 kg ha 1 mm 1 table 5 fig 7c in small plot studies in the semiarid climate of nebraska usa graterol et al 1993 obtained a wue of 7 kg ha 1 mm 1 under fi irrigation and 6 kg ha 1 mm 1 under afi irrigation in our study wue between the afi and fi treatments coincided during the three crop seasons wue varied between 7 and 9 kg ha 1 mm 1 under the fi and afi treatments and 6 and 7 kg ha 1 mm 1 under rf in summary the afi treatment needs only about half the irrigation water required for the fi however both treatments resulted in similar water use efficiencies and comparable grain yield returns 4 conclusions conventional furrow surface flood irrigations have the lowest irrigation efficiency among various irrigation methods sprinkler and drip irrigations have better irrigation efficiencies available to farmers in the lower mississippi delta region while the irrigation efficiency is low it is also true that the irrigations applied to crops through furrow irrigations exceed the crop water demands it is unequivocal that the shallow mrvaa underlying this region is declining from exploitation far exceeding the natural recharge rates of this aquifer using eddy covariance based sensors in large farm scale fields we quantified water used by the crops in all furrow fi alternate furrow afi irrigations and rainfed unirrigated treatments soybean irrigated through fi and afi supplied enough water for the optimum production of the crop consequently soybean grain yields were similar in afi and fi the rf consumed less water however it yielded significantly lower as well this large farm scale study in the lmd region indicated that crops can be irrigated through afi saving about half the irrigation water while producing comparable grain yields this farm scale study is being continued for quantifying similar irrigation responses of corn cotton and rice crops across major soils and climates in the region for developing decision

statistical analysis the analysis of variance anova was performed using the spss statistical product and service solutions software with urea type placement depth and planting year as the main effects including one two and three way interactions the means of the treatments were tested using the least significant difference lsd test at the p 0 05 significance level figures were created using the origin 8 0 software 3 results 3 1 grain yield and water productivity ut y pd ut y and pd y interactions significantly affected gy and wp table 1 the application of cru resulted in higher gy and wp compared with cu gy and wp generally increased with the increasing pd the maximum gy and wp of 8417 8 kg ha 1 and 21 4 kg ha 1 mm 1 were achieved under d16 but no significant difference was observed between d16 and d24 the maximum gy and wp were achieved in 2018 than 2017 and 2019 due to the greater rainfall amount favorable for maize growth the lowest gy was observed in 2019 as a result of the severe drought occurred during the growing season fig 1 the effects of ut pd interaction on gy and wp were not significant indicating that these indicators responded similarly independent of cru or cu and they had a similar response to pd ut y and pd y effects on gy and wp were significant suggesting that the effects of ut and pd on these indicators varied among different planting years 3 2 partial factor productivity of n the utilization of applied n by spring maize was evaluated using pfpn fig 2a c pfpn significantly increased with the increase in pd the maximum pfpn occurred under d16 in 2017 and 2018 but under d24 in 2019 probably because rainfall was scarce in 2019 pfpn was higher under cru than cu in 2017 and 2018 but there was no significant difference in 2019 pfpn over the three growing seasons followed the order 2018 2017 2019 with values of 59 9 43 7 and 32 3 kg kg 1 respectively pd ut effect on pfpn was not significant suggesting that the positive effect of pd on pfpn was the same for both ut 3 3 change in soil water storage and crop evapotranspiration sws and et were significantly affected by ut pd and y as well as ut y and pd y interactions during the growing seasons table 1 sws and et during the whole growing season were higher when cru was applied compared with cu with mean values of 91 3 and 395 4 mm under cru and 70 2 and 374 4 mm under cu respectively d16 produced the highest sws and et of 84 3 and 388 5 mm respectively y also affected the two indicators in the order of 2018 2017 2019 which was greatly associated with the precipitation amount and its distribution during the growing season the effects of ut y and pd y interactions on sws and et were significant indicating that their effects varied among different planting years in addition et from sowing to silking and et from silking to maturity in 2017 2018 and 2019 were also analyzed table 2 no significant difference in et from sowing to silking stage was observed between the cru and cu in any of the three years however et during the whole growing season was higher under cru compared with cu with mean values of 328 7 232 9 and 107 5 mm under cru and 319 8 225 6 and 104 2 mm under cu in the three years respectively the effects of pd on et were mainly observed after the silking stage et generally increased with increasing pd with the maximum value under d16 or d24 3 4 dry matter accumulation and remobilization the differences in grain yield among different treatments can be explained by the post silking dm accumulation and or remobilization of dm from vegetative organs chen et al 2015 these two indicators were significantly affected by pd ut y and y ut interaction table 3 compared with cu cru produced greater post silking dm accumulation and lowered dm remobilization increasing pd increased the post silking dm accumulation and reduced dm remobilization the application of cru and greater pd 16 cm was conducive to lowering the dm remobilization efficiency dre which indicated that n and water availability after the silking stage were superior pd ut interaction effect on dre was not significant suggesting that the positive effect of pd on dre was the same for cu and cru 3 5 pre and post silking n uptake and remobilization the application of cru produced greater n uptake pre and post silking and lowered n remobilization efficiency nre compared with cu which implied that cru improved and prolonged soil n availability pd affected the total plant n content and post silking n uptake which reached the maximum values under d16 increasing pd decreased nre dramatically indicating that more n was stored in straw especially in leaves which was useful for photosynthesis and resulted in higher gy nre was highest in 2019 followed by 2018 and 2017 with values of 59 4 51 5 and 51 1 respectively ut pd interaction had no significant effect on any indicator indicating that these indicators had a similar responses to pd independent of cru or cu 3 6 soil nitrate n residue at harvest ut pd and y significantly affected soil nr at harvest fig 3a c averaged across pd soil nr at harvest followed the order cru cu cu cru and cru cu in 2017 2018 and 2019 respectively averaged across ut soil nr decreased as pd increased from 8 to 16 cm but no difference was found between d16 and d24 soil nr was greater under cru than cu in the 0 40 cm and 40 80 cm soil layers but it was lower in the 80 120 cm soil layer in all three years increasing pd decreased soil nr in the 0 40 cm and 40 80 cm soil layers in 2017 and 2018 3 7 crop phenology the days from sowing to silking were not significantly affected by different treatments in any of the three years which indicated that the n availability level was similar under various ut and pd fig 4 averaged across pd the phenological events occurred more rapidly under cu than cru by approximately 4 2 and 2 days in 2017 2018 and 2019 respectively additionally the differences mainly occurred from silking to maturity no significant difference was observed among pd p 0 05 pd ut interaction effect on crop phenology was not significant which indicated that phenology had similar responses to pd 4 discussion 4 1 effects of placement depth and urea type on evapotranspiration water scarcity and nutrient deficiency are two main factors that constrain the stabilized agricultural productivity and potential crop yield in rain fed farming systems li et al 2009 qiang et al 2019 fertilization not only can significantly improve soil fertility but also ease the contradiction between water demand and supply between the crop and soil yan et al 2021 in our study cru resulted in greater et during the whole growing season of spring maize compared with cu table 1 it was mainly attributed to that applying cru improved soil n availability throughout the whole growing season of spring maize mueller and vyn 2016 ikezawa al 2022 and maize plants thus absorbed more soil water fageria and carvalho 2014 nasielski et al 2020 in our study sws and et were greater under d16 and d24 compared with d8 that s because deep placement provided a more moist environment for the dissolution and migration of urea in semi arid areas mclaughlin et al 2011 farmaha et al 2013 thereby increasing the root growth depth promoting the extension of roots into deeper soils which resulted in more soil water consumption and et fageria and carvalho 2014 nasielski et al 2020 further analysis showed that the effect of ut and pd on et was significant from silking to maturity in our study table 2 it was mainly attributed to that cru or greater pd improved the soil n availability for maize at the later growth stages which improved the root activity nkebiwe et al 2016 delayed premature leaf senescence chatzistathis al 2020 promoted dry matter accumulation qiang et al 2021 and ultimately increased soil water consumption and et 4 2 effects of placement depth and urea type on grain yield and water productivity ensuring the n supply for maize at the later growth stages is essential for high grain yield and crop water productivity mueller and vyn 2016 tian et al 2018 li et al 2020 in our study the mean annual gy and wp were 8754 5 kg ha 1 and 21 8 kg ha 1 mm 1 under cru and 7554 6 kg ha 1 and 20 2 kg ha 1 mm 1 under cu respectively this can be due to that cu caused n deficiency around the plant roots after flowering while cru ensured the n supply for maize throughout the growing season of spring maize naz and sulaiman 2016 vejan et al 2021 nasielski et al 2020 this can be also confirmed by higher dm accumulation and lower dre under cru in our study table 3 urea deep placement was generally conducive to achieving higher gy nkebiwe et al 2016 qiang et al 2021 which was similar to our result that the maximum gy occurred under d16 compared with d8 and d24 additionally urea deep placement was a useful way to improve wp which reached a maximum value under d16 the effects of pd y interaction on gy and wp were significant suggesting that the positive effect of pd on gy and wp varied among the planting years however the effects of pd ut interaction on gy and wp were not significant indicating that these indicators had similar responses to pd independent of cru or cu overall placing cru at 16 cm depth maximized rain fed maize gy and wp previous studies have shown that the n release rate and availability were affected by the unique hydrothermal conditions and microorganisms of different soil layers singh et al 2005 guo et al 2016 therefore how to distribute fertilizers at different soil depths to maximize grain yield and resource efficiency is worth further studying 4 3 effects of placement depth and urea type on n uptake and partial factor productivity of n enhancing the n uptake of a crop is an effective way to improve nue qiang et al 2019 zheng et al 2021 in our study the amount of n uptake was greater under cru compared with cu which was more obvious when the fertilizer was placed at 16 or 24 cm depth compared with 8 cm depth this can be explained as follows first cru and greater pd provided n directly to the crop root zone thereby reducing n loss to the environment and enhancing plant n uptake compared to cu and smaller pd li et al 2020 gaihre et al 2020 zhang et al 2021 second lower ner under cru or greater pd indicated greater n content in straw particularly in leaves table 4 which helped delay leaf senescence and maintain photosynthetic activity thereby increasing plant n uptake chen et al 2015 liu et al 2019 chatzistathis al 2020 in our study the optimal pd based on the maximum pfpn varied among the years which was 16 cm in 2017 and 2018 but 24 cm in 2019 fig 2 this can be due to that the scarce rainfall in 2019 prolonged the drought stress in the topsoil and placing the fertilizer at 24 cm depth was thus more conducive to fertilizer dissolution nevertheless due to the relatively sufficient rainfall in 2017 and 2018 placing the fertilizer at 16 cm depth was able to dissolve the fertilizer previous studies have suggested that cru resulted in higher pfpn than cu guo et al 2016 nasielski et al 2020 ikezawa al 2022 which was similar to our results in 2017 and 2018 fig 2a and b however no difference was observed between cru and cu in 2019 fig 2c this can be due to that the scare rainfall was not conducive to nutrient dissolution so the difference in soil n availability between cru and cu was minimal it is thus concluded that pd affected pfpn but the effects of ut on pfpn differed among the planting years in rain fed agriculture 4 4 effects of placement depth and urea type on soil nitrogen residual in general because of the slow n release rate from cru more n was absorbed by maize plants and lower nitrate n residual was observed at maturity under cru than cu zhou et al 2016 tian et al 2018 the result in 2017 was not consistent with this conclusion fig 3a which can be probably because the heavy rainfall that occurred in late july resulted in more no3 n leaching out of the 120 cm soil profile under cu than cru halvorson and bartolo 2014 zhou et al 2016 tian et al 2018 in 2019 nr was almost equal between cru and cu owing to the scare rainfall which was not conducive to the dissolution of cru and cu therefore the differences in n leaching and n uptake between cru and cu disappeared urea deep placement was conducive to lower nr in the soil profile yao et al 2018 which was similar to our results in 2017 and 2018 fig 3a and b but no significant difference was observed under cru among the three pd in 2019 fig 3c this indicated that the placement depth of cru did not affect nr under drought conditions ut and pd also affected the distribution of nr in the soil profile the nr in the 0 80 cm soil profile was lower under cu compared with cru in 2017 and 2018 this may be attributed to no3 n being easily leached beyond the 80 cm soil depth when cu was applied fig 3 increasing pd decreased the nr in the 0 40 cm and 40 80 cm soil profiles in 2017 and 2018 this was likely because deep placement promoted root growth and increased the nutrient absorption shen et al 2013 nkebiwe et al 2016 ikezawa al 2022 5 conclusions cru or greater pd could increase dm and n accumulation enhance sws and et and ultimately improve maize gy nue and wp at maturity the nr in the 0 80 cm soil profile was higher under cru than cu the most efficient way to obtain higher gy wp and nue values was to place cru at a depth of 16 cm these results will help researchers and policy makers to develop fertilization strategies for optimizing maize production wp and

n residue nr were evaluated compared with d8 d16 and d24 enhanced evapotranspiration dry matter and n uptake of spring maize and the increases were greater under cru than cu d16 produced the highest gy and wp among the placement depths with mean values of 8417 8 kg ha 1 and 21 4 kg ha 1 mm 1 respectively compared with cu cru obtained higher mean gy 8754 5 vs 7554 6 kg ha 1 and wp 21 8 vs 20 2 kg ha 1 mm 1 the effects of ut year and pd year interactions on gy and wp were significant indicating that these indicators had various responses to the planting year the effects of ut pd interaction on gy wp and pfpn were not significant suggesting that these indicators had similar responses to pd independent of cru or cu cru increased nr in the 0 80 cm soil profile whereas it lowered nr in the 80

concentration in the dry straw and grain was measured using the kjeldahl method horowitz 1970 based on the measured plant dry matter dm and n concentration the following parameters were further calculated chen et al 2015 3 vegetative dm n remobilization efficiency 100 vegetative dm n content at silking vegetative dm n content at maturity vegetative dm n content at silking 4 contribution to grain dm by vegetative dm remobilization 100 vegetative dm at silking vegetative dm at maturity grain dm at maturity 2 3 4 grain yield at harvest 24 plants were manually collected in the center of each plot to determine grain yield gy gy was expressed at 15 5 moisture content according to the standard moisture content for maize grain koide and peoples 2012 2 3 5 evapotranspiration crop water productivity and partial factor productivity of n the evapotranspiration et mm was determined according to the following equation zheng et al 2021 5 et sws p where the sws mm is the change in soil water storage before planting and after harvest and p is the amount of precipitation over the growing season mm crop water productivity wp kg ha 1 mm 1 and partial factor productivity of n pfpn kg 1 were calculated with eq 6 and eq 7 respectively guo et al 2016 qiang et al 2019 6 wp gy et 7 pfpn gy fn where gy is the grain yield kg ha 1 at a specific level of n fertilizer applied fn kg ha 1 2 4 statistical analysis the analysis of variance anova was performed using the spss statistical product and service solutions software with urea type placement depth and planting year as the main effects including one two and three way interactions the means of the treatments were tested using the least significant difference lsd test at the p 0 05 significance level figures were created using the origin 8 0 software 3 results 3 1 grain yield and water productivity ut y pd ut y and pd y interactions significantly affected gy and wp table 1 the application of cru resulted in higher gy and wp compared with cu gy and wp generally increased with the increasing pd the maximum gy and wp of 8417 8 kg ha 1 and 21 4 kg ha 1 mm 1 were achieved under d16 but no significant difference was observed between d16 and d24 the maximum gy and wp were achieved in 2018 than 2017 and 2019 due to the greater rainfall amount favorable for maize growth the lowest gy was observed in 2019 as a result of the severe drought occurred during the growing season fig 1 the effects of ut pd interaction on gy and wp were not significant indicating that these indicators responded similarly independent of cru or cu and they had a similar response to pd ut y and pd y effects on gy and wp were significant suggesting that the effects of ut and pd on these indicators varied among different planting years 3 2 partial factor productivity of n the utilization of applied n by spring maize was evaluated using pfpn fig 2a c pfpn significantly increased with the increase in pd the maximum pfpn occurred under d16 in 2017 and 2018 but under d24 in 2019 probably because rainfall was scarce in 2019 pfpn was higher under cru than cu in 2017 and 2018 but there was no significant difference in 2019 pfpn over the three growing seasons followed the order 2018 2017 2019 with values of 59 9 43 7 and 32 3 kg kg 1 respectively pd ut effect on pfpn was not significant suggesting that the positive effect of pd on pfpn was the same for both ut 3 3 change in soil water storage and crop evapotranspiration sws and et were significantly affected by ut pd and y as well as ut y and pd y interactions during the growing seasons table 1 sws and et during the whole growing season were higher when cru was applied compared with cu with mean values of 91 3 and 395 4 mm under cru and 70 2 and 374 4 mm under cu respectively d16 produced the highest sws and et of 84 3 and 388 5 mm respectively y also affected the two indicators in the order of 2018 2017 2019 which was greatly associated with the precipitation amount and its distribution during the growing season the effects of ut y and pd y interactions on sws and et were significant indicating that their effects varied among different planting years in addition et from sowing to silking and et from silking to maturity in 2017 2018 and 2019 were also analyzed table 2 no significant difference in et from sowing to silking stage was observed between the cru and cu in any of the three years however et during the whole growing season was higher under cru compared with cu with mean values of 328 7 232 9 and 107 5 mm under cru and 319 8 225 6 and 104 2 mm under cu in the three years respectively the effects of pd on et were mainly observed after the silking stage et generally increased with increasing pd with the maximum value under d16 or d24 3 4 dry matter accumulation and remobilization the differences in grain yield among different treatments can be explained by the post silking dm accumulation and or remobilization of dm from vegetative organs chen et al 2015 these two indicators were significantly affected by pd ut y and y ut interaction table 3 compared with cu cru produced greater post silking dm accumulation and lowered dm remobilization increasing pd increased the post silking dm accumulation and reduced dm remobilization the application of cru and greater pd 16 cm was conducive to lowering the dm remobilization efficiency dre which indicated that n and water availability after the silking stage were superior pd ut interaction effect on dre was not significant suggesting that the positive effect of pd on dre was the same for cu and cru 3 5 pre and post silking n uptake and remobilization the application of cru produced greater n uptake pre and post silking and lowered n remobilization efficiency nre compared with cu which implied that cru improved and prolonged soil n availability pd affected the total plant n content and post silking n uptake which reached the maximum values under d16 increasing pd decreased nre dramatically indicating that more n was stored in straw especially in leaves which was useful for photosynthesis and resulted in higher gy nre was highest in 2019 followed by 2018 and 2017 with values of 59 4 51 5 and 51 1 respectively ut pd interaction had no significant effect on any indicator indicating that these indicators had a similar responses to pd independent of cru or cu 3 6 soil nitrate n residue at harvest ut pd and y significantly affected soil nr at harvest fig 3a c averaged across pd soil nr at harvest followed the order cru cu cu cru and cru cu in 2017 2018 and 2019 respectively averaged across ut soil nr decreased as pd increased from 8 to 16 cm but no difference was found between d16 and d24 soil nr was greater under cru than cu in the 0 40 cm and 40 80 cm soil layers but it was lower in the 80 120 cm soil layer in all three years increasing pd decreased soil nr in the 0 40 cm and 40 80 cm soil layers in 2017 and 2018 3 7 crop phenology the days from sowing to silking were not significantly affected by different treatments in any of the three years which indicated that the n availability level was similar under various ut and pd fig 4 averaged across pd the phenological events occurred more rapidly under cu than cru by approximately 4 2 and 2 days in 2017 2018 and 2019 respectively additionally the differences mainly occurred from silking to maturity no significant difference was observed among pd p 0 05 pd ut interaction effect on crop phenology was not significant which indicated that phenology had similar responses to pd 4 discussion 4 1 effects of placement depth and urea type on evapotranspiration water scarcity and nutrient deficiency are two main factors that constrain the stabilized agricultural productivity and potential crop yield in rain fed farming systems li et al 2009 qiang et al 2019 fertilization not only can significantly improve soil fertility but also ease the contradiction between water demand and supply between the crop and soil yan et al 2021 in our study cru resulted in greater et during the whole growing season of spring maize compared with cu table 1 it was mainly attributed to that applying cru improved soil n availability throughout the whole growing season of spring maize mueller and vyn 2016 ikezawa al 2022 and maize plants thus absorbed more soil water fageria and carvalho 2014 nasielski et al 2020 in our study sws and et were greater under d16 and d24 compared with d8 that s because deep placement provided a more moist environment for the dissolution and migration of urea in semi arid areas mclaughlin et al 2011 farmaha et al 2013 thereby increasing the root growth depth promoting the extension of roots into deeper soils which resulted in more soil water consumption and et fageria and carvalho 2014 nasielski et al 2020 further analysis showed that the effect of ut and pd on et was significant from silking to maturity in our study table 2 it was mainly attributed to that cru or greater pd improved the soil n availability for maize at the later growth stages which improved the root activity nkebiwe et al 2016 delayed premature leaf senescence chatzistathis al 2020 promoted dry matter accumulation qiang et al 2021 and ultimately increased soil water consumption and et 4 2 effects of placement depth and urea type on grain yield and water productivity ensuring the n supply for maize at the later growth stages is essential for high grain yield and crop water productivity mueller and vyn 2016 tian et al 2018 li et al 2020 in our study the mean annual gy and wp were 8754 5 kg ha 1 and 21 8 kg ha 1 mm 1 under cru and 7554 6 kg ha 1 and 20 2 kg ha 1 mm 1 under cu respectively this can be due to that cu caused n deficiency around the plant roots after flowering while cru ensured the n supply for maize throughout the growing season of spring maize naz and sulaiman 2016 vejan et al 2021 nasielski et al 2020 this can be also confirmed by higher dm accumulation and lower dre under cru in our study table 3 urea deep placement was generally conducive to achieving higher gy nkebiwe et al 2016 qiang et al 2021 which was similar to our result that the maximum gy occurred under d16 compared with d8 and d24 additionally urea deep placement was a useful way to improve wp which reached a maximum value under d16 the effects of pd y interaction on gy and wp were significant suggesting that the positive effect of pd on gy and wp varied among the planting years however the effects of pd ut interaction on gy and wp were not significant indicating that these indicators had similar responses to pd independent of cru or cu overall placing cru at 16 cm depth maximized rain fed maize gy and wp previous studies have shown that the n release rate and availability were affected by the unique hydrothermal conditions and microorganisms of different soil layers singh et al 2005 guo et al 2016 therefore how to distribute fertilizers at different soil depths to maximize grain yield and resource efficiency is worth further studying 4 3 effects of placement depth and urea type on n uptake and partial factor productivity of n enhancing the n uptake of a crop is an effective way to improve nue qiang et al 2019 zheng et al 2021 in our study the amount of n uptake was greater under cru compared with cu which was more obvious when the fertilizer was placed at 16 or 24 cm depth compared with 8 cm depth this can be explained as follows first cru and greater pd provided n directly to the crop root zone thereby reducing n loss to the environment and enhancing plant n uptake compared to cu and smaller pd li et al 2020 gaihre et al 2020 zhang et al 2021 second lower ner under cru or greater pd indicated greater n content in straw particularly in leaves table 4 which helped delay leaf senescence and maintain photosynthetic activity thereby increasing plant n uptake chen et al 2015 liu et al 2019 chatzistathis al 2020 in our study the optimal pd based on the maximum pfpn varied among the years which was 16 cm in 2017 and 2018 but 24 cm in 2019 fig 2 this can be due to that the scarce rainfall in 2019 prolonged the drought stress in the topsoil and placing the fertilizer at 24 cm depth was thus more conducive to fertilizer dissolution nevertheless due to the relatively sufficient rainfall in 2017 and 2018 placing the fertilizer at 16 cm depth was able to dissolve the fertilizer previous studies have suggested that cru resulted in higher pfpn than cu guo et al 2016 nasielski et al 2020 ikezawa al 2022 which was similar to our results in 2017 and 2018 fig 2a and b however no difference was observed between cru and cu in 2019 fig 2c this can be due to that the scare rainfall was not conducive to nutrient dissolution so the difference in soil n availability between cru and cu was minimal it is thus concluded that pd affected pfpn but the effects of ut on pfpn differed among the planting years in rain fed agriculture 4 4 effects of placement depth and urea type on soil nitrogen residual in general because of the slow n release rate from cru more n was absorbed by maize plants and lower nitrate n residual was observed at maturity under cru than cu zhou et al 2016 tian et al 2018 the result in 2017 was not consistent with this conclusion fig 3a which can be probably because the heavy rainfall that occurred in late july resulted in more no3 n leaching out of the 120 cm soil profile under cu than cru halvorson and bartolo 2014 zhou et al 2016 tian et al 2018 in 2019 nr was almost equal between cru and cu owing to the scare rainfall which was not conducive to the dissolution of cru and cu therefore the differences in n leaching and n uptake between cru and cu disappeared urea deep placement was conducive to lower nr in the soil profile yao et al 2018 which was similar to our results in 2017 and 2018 fig 3a and b but no significant difference was observed under cru among the three pd in 2019 fig 3c this indicated that the placement depth of cru did not affect nr under drought conditions ut and pd also affected the distribution of nr in the soil profile the nr in the 0 80 cm soil profile was lower under cu compared with cru in 2017 and 2018 this may be attributed to no3 n being easily leached beyond the 80 cm soil depth when cu was applied fig 3 increasing pd decreased the nr in the 0 40 cm and 40 80 cm soil profiles in 2017 and 2018 this was likely because deep placement promoted root growth and increased the nutrient absorption shen et al 2013 nkebiwe et al 2016 ikezawa al 2022 5 conclusions cru or greater pd could increase dm and n accumulation enhance sws and et and ultimately improve maize gy nue and wp at maturity the nr in the 0 80 cm soil profile was higher under cru than cu the most efficient way to obtain higher gy wp and nue values was to place cru at a depth of 16 cm these results will help researchers and policy makers to develop fertilization strategies for optimizing maize production wp and

9703,water resources are distributed in the form of virtual water through international trade which influences the water supply and consumption of each country therefore it is of significance to study the driving factors of grain virtual water trade to alleviate water stress and guarantee food security in this paper the virtual water volume of grain crops traded between china and countries along the belt and road b r from 2000 to 2019 was calculated and a gravity model using panel data was applied to explore the effect of natural and socioeconomic factors on virtual water trade the virtual water export from b r countries to china obviously increased in the twenty years and the contributions of various crops to virtual water were more balanced the regression results indicate that gdp and exchange rate were positively correlated with virtual water inflow while per capital water resources arable land geographic distance and population were negative factors that hindered virtual water import the most powerful driving force for grain virtual water trade is water endowment gdp is an important driver on importing virtual water for countries without water shortage and a large number of local water resources will not obviously inhibit the driving force of economic strength by comparing the contribution of factors to virtual water in the past ten years it can be found that the contribution rate of distance decreased due to the development of transportation industry which reduced the transportation cost of exporting products the contribution rate of gdp and exchange rate increased because economic globalization has promoted the effect of economic factors on grain trade therefore the trade structure of agricultural products should be modified based on the characteristics of virtual water flow for countries without high economic level but water shortage export crops with high water consumption be reasonably controlled graphical abstract ga1 keywords virtual water driving factors belt and road grain trade gravity model 1 introduction water is an essential natural resource for humans and societal development the water consumption of various industries has increased in recent decades to accommodate the growth of the economy and the human population distefano and kelly 2017 insufficient water supplies pose a major challenge to the economic development of many countries jacobs et al 2016 indeed the water supply crisis is considered the greatest risk currently facing humanity hanjra and qureshi 2010 more than 40 countries worldwide are under severe water pressure and the number of people facing insufficient water resources is estimated to reach 3 billion by 2025 annukka and bonvoisin 2015 traditionally engineering measures for physical water distribution such as cross basin water transfer and pipeline water delivery have been used to deal with water supply crises however some virtual water resources are transferred between regions through trade allan 2003 the part of the water that is used in the production and consumption of commodities is considered virtual water allan 1993 the virtual water trade is a transaction in which one party purchases water consuming products from the other party through commodity trade to meet their own water and food security needs dalin et al 2012 in the past solving water resource problems only involved taking measures at the site of the actual problem now the concept of virtual water strategy permits resource deployment to be considered from a global perspective therefore studying international trade from the perspective of virtual water can provide effective suggestions of national policy to alleviate water pressure nowadays international trade has developed rapidly as the economy has become increasingly globalized the status of grain trade is critically important and involves water and food liu et al 2013 water is essential for agricultural development and 70 of the freshwater humans consume is used for irrigation liu et al 2013 most of the virtual water flow is used for agricultural products and the virtual water trade associated with agricultural products accounts for more than 60 of total virtual water trade hoekstra 2003 in 2013 china introduced the belt and road b r initiative which is an economic development and commercial project liu 2015 that has greatly affected regional economy and trade china s agricultural exports to b r countries have grown rapidly from approximately 3 39 billion usd in 2002 to approximately 15 2 billion usd in 2015 huijuan 2020 at present studies on the belt and road initiative are mainly at the political and economic levels or studying the differences in natural resource conditions lacking comprehensive consideration of trade and water resources so it is worthwhile to study the characteristics of virtual water flow between china and b r countries regional virtual water trade patterns are related to the water security and stability of countries zhao et al 2020 so it has attracted widespread attention from scholars as the theory of virtual water gradually enriched there are mainly two types of calculation methods the first is take the direct water consumption of products in the production process as virtual water content hoekstra 2003 for crops it is calculated based on the total evapotranspiration in the growing period combined with the yield hoekstra and hung 2005 yang et al 2006 the second is to estimate the water consumption according to the regional input output situation including single region input output model guan and hubacek 2007 and multi regional input output model zhang et al 2020 many scholars use the multi regional input output model to study the virtual water flow of international trade from macro level or calculate the virtual water trade between countries by referring to the global average data of virtual water content mekonnen and hoekstra 2011 2012 however the input output method can not quantify the virtual water content of crops accurately resulting in great differences in the calculation results among countries therefore when studying virtual water for international grain trade it is better to use evapotranspiration calculation method to quantify virtual water but there are few such studies many researches have carried out quantitative analysis of virtual water flow in different countries and regions at different scales for countries suffering from water scarcity the actual virtual water flow has been calculated it has been successfully applied in the implementation of virtual water trade in jordan egypt and america el fadel and maroun 2003 abu sharar et al 2012 affuso and mixon jr 2014 also the virtual water trade of china with foreign countries has been studied as well as the main destinations and origins ali et al 2017 chen et al 2018 tian et al 2018 on a regional scale the characteristics of virtual water trade pattern and its positive impact on maintaining water security and alleviating water stress has been discussed for the mediterranean region nile basin and pakistan region nassar 2007 roson and sartori 2010 zeitoun et al 2010 for smaller spatial scales some studies on the spatial characteristics of virtual water flow at sub national have been reported garcia and mejia 2019 wang et al 2021 there are also some studies reported on the global scale dalin et al 2012 lenzen et al 2013 odorico et al 2019 for example dalin et al 2012 constructed a virtual water trade network with international food based on trade data and virtual water content data and analyzed the evolution trend of this network from 1986 to 2007 however unfortunately the existing studies have focused on the calculation of national virtual water trade volume and the analysis of flow pattern there are few empirical studies on the driving mechanism of virtual water flow for the research on the driving mechanism of virtual water trade the influencing factors and driving effects of the total amount of virtual water import and export in a single country have been reported yang et al 2016 deng et al 2016 feng et al 2017 the drivers of virtual water trade between countries have also attracted much attention and gravity model is usually used to solve this problem garcia and mejia 2019 song et al 2020 fu et al 2021 however as far as we know virtual water transfer takes products as the carriers so its driving factors involve resource conditions and social economy the condition of water resources and water demand have been shown to be important factors driving food trade and the phenomenon of virtual water import is quite serious in arid countries fracasso et al 2016 delbourg and dinar 2020 in addition the flow of virtual water among countries is also affected by socioeconomic factors kumar and jain 2011 suweis et al 2011 mubako and lant 2013 population gross domestic product and geographical distance are the major drivers on global virtual water fluxes tamea et al 2014a chouchane et al 2018 sun et al 2019 literature review reveals that most studies on the drivers of virtual water flow have focused on analyzing the factors affecting virtual water imports and exports and the water footprint in a single country or region however empirical research on multiple countries is relatively scarce and most studies have used average cross section data of a certain year or years which is unable to capture dynamic temporal changes panel data models have some advantages over the cross section data models or time series models hsiao 2007 which mainly reflected in adding the time dimension so as to represent driving law of each factor more generally and accurately although previous studies have been successfully reported the literature review shows that there is a lack of research on some key aspects of these studies first the virtual water content of the major trade grains between china and b r countries was calculated and the virtual water trade volume was obtained using the trade data and the virtual water content of each crop second we analyze the spatial and temporal flow characteristics of the grain virtual water trade between china and b r countries thirdly a gravity model was constructed to explore the effect of natural factors and socioeconomic factors on virtual water trade using panel data finally we compared the influence degree and change of each influencing factor on the virtual water trade volume in the two decades and the joint effect of water endowment and economic strength was emphatically studied our study can provide important theoretical support for countries to formulate effective policies and take adaptive measures based on their own conditions the remainder of this paper is organized as follows section 2 describes countries participating in the b r natural and socioeconomic factors virtual water calculation gravity model and model verification section 3 presents virtual water content and virtual water trade volume of the b r countries factors affecting virtual water trade and joint effect of water endowment and economic strength section 4 discussions about the reason analysis of the impact of each variable on the virtual water trade volume and the rationality of our results section 5 provides conclusions about the characteristics of virtual water trade between china and the b r countries and the driving mechanism of natural and socioeconomic factors 2 methods and data 2 1 data sources 2 1 1 countries along the b r route the b r initiative covers the continents of asia europe and africa we ve set a range of countries along the b r route on the basis of the belt and road network in china www yidaiyilu gov cn in addition to china there are 71 b r countries and these countries can be divided into six regions based on geography table 1 a large part of the b r countries experience water shortages based on the ratio of water withdrawals to supply for each country gassert et al 2013 there are thirty six countries experiencing greater than medium levels of water stress fig 1 water stress varies among countries whereas pakistan bahrain iran israel jordan kuwait lebanon oman qatar saudi arabia united arab emirates and turkmenistan which are located in south asia and the middle east experience extremely high levels of water stress countries in east asia southeast asia and eastern europe do not experience appreciable levels of water stress 2 1 2 natural and socioeconomic factors the factors affecting virtual water trade can be classified into two types natural factors and socioeconomic factors given that virtual water trade is based on economic activities the social and economic conditions of importing and exporting countries inevitably affect virtual water flow otherwise the virtual water content is determined by the water consumption of crops during growth period therefore the virtual water flow among countries is related to water resource conditions meteorological conditions and other natural factors agricultural products are central to virtual water trade and variation in resource endowment is a critically important natural factor related to the trade of agricultural products olper and raimondi 2009 thus water resources have a major effect on virtual water trade in water scarce areas countries tend to grow crops that consume less water and import virtual water from abroad so that the saved water can be used in industry where it can produce greater benefits arable land a basic resource for crop planting also has a non negligible effect on virtual water trade virtual water generally flows out of countries with abundant water and soil resources and flows into countries with poor water and soil resources kumar and singh 2005 virtual water trade requires both the importer and exporter with sufficient economic strength in countries with water shortages higher economic strength is essential for ensuring that the purchasing power of citizens is sufficient for products from other countries to be purchased in countries with abundant water resources economic strength is related to the government s investment in agriculture economic power is a key factor affecting the potential of a country or region s virtual water trade turton 2000 the currency exchange rate also affects the purchasing power of the importing country and the price of the products of the exporting country in addition population growth increases water and food consumption and thus affects virtual water trade odorico et al 2019 delbourg and dinar 2020 transaction costs also play an important role in virtual water circulation as the geographical distance between countries affects the cost of transportation this distance can be used as an indicator of transportation costs commodity trade is impeded when the geographical distance is high soloaga and wintersb 2001 six main indicators influencing the virtual water trade were used to construct the panel data model the relationship between these six indicators and the volume of virtual water net imports was assessed these indicators are renewable freshwater resources per capita water arable land land geographic distance dist gross domestic product gdp population pop and exchange rate exp as shown in table the data on renewable freshwater resources per capita and cultivated area were taken from aquastat http www fao org aquastat en databases the gross domestic product population and exchange rate of each country were obtained from world bank open data https data worldbank org geographic distance data between countries were obtained from the cepii database http www cepii fr anglaisgraph bdd distances htm 2 2 methods 2 2 1 virtual water calculation many studies have explored methods for quantifying the virtual water content of products there are generally two main approaches used for these calculations the production tree method chapagain and hoekstra 2003 and the classification of different types of products zimmer and renault 2003 in this paper the crop water demand was calculated by penman formula which is used as the virtual water content for calculation the eight major grain crops including barley maize rice wheat groundnuts pulses soybeans and potatoes were used for virtual water trade calculations which are classified based on the hs convention the volume of virtual water trade was calculated by multiplying the virtual water volume of grain per unit and the trade volume as the virtual water content of grain crops varies among countries the water demand of crops in the producing countries should be used for virtual water trade calculations the volume of virtual water exported from china to countries was calculated by multiplying the virtual water content of crops in china and the export volume of crops and the virtual water imported into china from countries along the routes was calculated by multiplying the virtual water content of crops in the exporting country and the import volume of crops 1 vwt ex i j 1 8 cvw i j ex i j where vwt ex i is the virtual water export from country i to china m3 cvw i j is the virtual water content per unit mass of the product j in country i m3 t and ex i j is the j type of agricultural product that country i exports to china because the imported grain crops were obtained using the water production of other countries the importing countries receive the grain crops as a carrier and introduce water resources from abroad in the form of virtual water therefore the virtual water flow of grain crops imported from china by b r countries was calculated based on the water demand data of china through the substitution effect 2 vwt im i j 1 8 cvw 0 j im i j where vwt im i is the virtual water import of country i from china m3 cvw 0 j is the virtual water content per unit mass m3 t of product j in china and im i j is the j type of agricultural product that country i imports from china the virtual water content of crops mainly includes all the water consumed during crop growth and development through evapotranspiration the cropwat model was used to calculate crop water requirements by combining relevant data in the climwat weather database and the faostat database cropwat is a decision support tool developed by the land and water development division of fao it collects climate and soil parameters at various locations uses penman s formula to calculate the water demand of certain reference crops and then uses k c to correct the calculation and obtain the water demand of different crops this is then combined with the yield data per unit area to obtain the virtual water content per unit of grain crops the virtual water content of each crop was calculated as 3 cv w i j cw r i j c y i j where cvw i j is the virtual water content per unit of crop j in country i m3 t cwr i j is the water demand per unit area of crop j in country i m3 hm2 and cy i j is the yield per unit area of crop j in country i t hm2 the water demand per unit area cwr i j was calculated as 4 cw r i j e t 0 k c where et 0 indicates the water requirements of the reference crop in country i mm d and k c is the correction coefficient et 0 was calculated by the penman monteith formula pereira et al 1999 as 5 e t 0 0 408 δ r n g 900 t 273 u 2 e a e d δ γ 1 0 34 u 2 where r n is the net radiation on the surface of the crop mj m d g is the soil heat flow mj m2 d t is the average temperature u 2 is wind speed two meters above the ground m s e a is the steam pressure at saturation kpa e d is the actual steam pressure kpa e a e d is the difference in steam pressure kpa δ is the slope of the steam pressure curve kpa and γ is the dry humidity constant kpa annual grain trade data from 2000 to 2019 between china and b r countries were obtained from the united nations commodity trade statistics database http comtrade un org db the meteorological data required for the calculations were obtained from the climwat database from fao which includes meteorological data from 3262 different stations in 144 countries for countries with a small area weather station data from the center of the country were used for countries with a large area e g china russia and india weather station data from the main production areas of each crop within the country were used if there were multiple sites the average value was taken the crop yield per unit area required for the calculation was obtained from the faostat database http faostat fao org 2 2 2 gravity models using panel data the gravity model is derived from the law of universal gravitation it assumes that the trade flow between two countries mainly depends on their economic strength and the geographical distance between them tinbergen 1962 this model is widely used in studies of international trade flows this model has also been used to quantitatively analyze the mechanisms of international trade anderson and van wincoop 2003 head and mayer 2014 and many factors aside from the economic scale and distance can be used in the model duarte et al 2018 virtual water trade a trade activity with commodity trade as the carrier is also suitable for constructing gravity models as shown by some previous studies duarte et al 2019 in this paper econometrics and a panel data model were used and this allowed the time dimension to be considered when estimating the factors affecting virtual water trade this method is more effective and improves the efficiency and accuracy of parameter estimation under changeable globalization and trade patterns the basic form of the gravity model was as follows 6 w i j k x i x j d i j where w ij is the bilateral trade volume which is the balance of the volume of imports and exports x i is the gdp of country i x j is the gdp of country j d ij is the geographical distance between country i and country j and k is the proportional constant in empirical studies the logarithm is usually taken on both sides of the equation which turns formula 6 into formula 7 and the independent variable x is enriched in addition to the original indicator gdp 7 ln w i j ln x i ln x j ln d i j c dynamic methods are more effective than cross sectional data under continually changing patterns of globalization and trade the cross section data model can only reflect the characteristics in the corresponding time of the data and can not fully represent the general law the time series data is suitable for specific research on a single individual to reflect the characteristics of a single individual in order to study the driving effect of impact factors on virtual water trade between the b r countries and china there are 71 b r countries which cannot be analyzed by using the time series data of one country and the trade volume between countries fluctuates obviously over time so the panel data model with both time dimensions t periods and cross sectional dimensions n individuals panel data can be obtained by intercepting multiple cross sectional data from the time series arellano and honoré 2001 hsiao 2001 let i i 1 n denote the individual and t t 1 t denote the time the logarithmic linear panel model can then be set to 8 lny it β i lnx it α i λ t μ it where y it is the dependent variable of

trade between china and other b r countries virtual water exports and virtual water imports were used as the response variables the explanatory variables were renewable freshwater resources per capita water arable land land gross domestic product gdp population pop exchange rate exp and distance from china dist all variables except distance were proportional to the value of the variables of china in the model the equation for the model of virtual water flow driven by natural and social factors was as follows 9 ln vw t ex it β 1 ln wate r it water c t β 2 ln lan d it lan d c t β 3 ln dis t it β

panel data for regression after passing the unit root test the stationarity of each series was first tested to determine whether they have the same unit root four statistics were used including levin lin chu t llc im pesaran shin w ips fisher chi square adf and fisher chi square pp eviews10 0 was used to test each variable and the results are shown in table 3 because only variables that pass the unit root test can be used to establish panel data for regression we first tested the stationarity of each series to determine whether they have the same unit root the virtual water exported from china lnvwt ex and imported to china lnvwt im renewable freshwater resources per capita water arable land land geographic distance dist gross domestic product gdp population pop and exchange rate exp met the 5 significance threshold using the four statistics table 2 next the f test and hausman test were conducted and these tests indicated that an individual fixed effect was most suitable the fact that the number of data sections was greater than the number of time series also indicated that an individual fixed effect model is more appropriate the regression coefficients of model parameters were estimated using the ordinary least squares method significant variables were identified using a t test at a 5 significance level 3 results 3 1 virtual water content of grain crops the virtual water content of grain crops varied in china from 2000 to 2019 fig 2 among the eight types of grain crops the virtual water content of soybeans was the highest 2000 m3 t followed by pulses and groundnuts both of which were approximately 1700 m3 t the virtual water content per unit mass of potato was the lowest 500 m3 t from 2000 2019 the virtual water content of all types of food crops decreased and this mainly stemmed from the development of agricultural technology and the optimization of crop varieties in recent years the steady increase in grain yield and the decrease in water demand per unit weight of crops led to a decrease in the virtual water content per unit weight of crops thus the virtual water content of agricultural products is not only related to the local natural climate conditions and soil types but also to the sophistication of planting technology the virtual water content of agricultural products is affected by several factors including regional meteorological conditions soil type farming mode and production level which leads to variation in the water demand of crops among countries given that the virtual water content of different crops is different the water intensive agricultural products for one country differ from those of another country the virtual water content of pulses and groundnuts per unit mass was greater than that of potatoes in b r countries fig 3 the virtual water content of grain crops was generally higher in most countries in western asia central asia and southern asia but lower in countries in eastern asia and eastern europe crops with high virtual water content in eastern asia and oceania were pulses and wheat followed by rice and maize crops with low virtual water content were potatoes maize and wheat in central asian countries pulses ground nuts and barley were the main crops with high virtual water content while potatoes and maize were the crops with low virtual water content in west asia and south asia pulses had the highest virtual water content followed by wheat and barley while potatoes and maize had the lowest virtual water content in eastern european countries pulses had the highest virtual water content followed by groundnuts and soybeans while potatoes maize and wheat had the lowest virtual water content 3 2 virtual water flow in grain trade in the process of grain trade between china and other b r countries water resources achieve inter regional flow through different grain crops as carriers the share of various grain crops in the total trade volume between china and other b r countries varies fig 4 among all food crops exported from china to other countries maize accounted for the highest proportion of exported virtual water in 2000 66 followed by rice in 2010 pulses accounted for the highest proportion of exported virtual water 32 followed by maize and rice in 2019 rice accounted for the highest proportion of virtual water flowing out of china 32 followed by maize barley and soybeans among all the grain crops imported by china from b r countries rice and soybean accounted for the highest proportion of imported virtual water in 2000 51 and 40 respectively in 2010 rice and soybean accounted for the highest proportion of imported virtual water 30 and 26 respectively the proportion of imported virtual water of pulses increased in 2019 the proportion of virtual water flowing imported to china through rice was the highest 38 followed by maize wheat and soybeans the volume of virtual water trade through grain crops between china and b r countries from 2000 to 2019 was calculated and the temporal characteristics of virtual water trade were analyzed fig 5 shows the virtual water exports and imports of china over the past twenty years the amount of imported virtual water significantly increased during this period from 2009 2015 the net import of virtual water continued to increase annually and the virtual water trade of grains changed from net outflow to net inflow in 2011 in the last five years the net import volume of virtual water fluctuated around one billion from 2000 2019 the total amount of grain virtual water exports between china and b r countries decreased exports peaked in 2003 in 2004 exports decreased significantly and remained stable at approximately 3 billion cubic meters over the past decade from 2000 2019 the total amount of grain virtual water imported by china from b r countries increased especially from 2009 to 2015 from 2000 to 2019 the characteristics of grain virtual water trade between china and b r countries were altered in response to changes in the natural conditions and socioeconomic conditions of each country in addition to international food prices and the global food market in 2000 most of the participating countries were virtual water inflow regions and the virtual water for grain flowed from china to countries in southeast asia e g indonesia malaysia and vietnam the middle east e g iran and iraq west asia and eastern europe fig 6 thailand and myanmar in southeast asia and india and nepal in south asia were virtual water outflow regions by 2010 the import and export patterns of food virtual water were more balanced the net outflow of virtual water increased and the net inflow decreased virtual water was mainly derived from countries in southeast asia vietnam laos thailand myanmar and cambodia countries in south asia india and pakistan kazakhstan in west asia ethiopia in east africa russia in eastern europe ukraine and other countries virtual water mainly flowed from china to indonesia malaysia the philippines south korea south africa the middle east and some eastern european countries some countries including vietnam laos thailand pakistan ethiopia kazakhstan russia and ukraine have changed from net importers of virtual water to net exporters by 2019 the import and export trade patterns of grain virtual water were similar to those in 2010 and countries with net inflow and outflow of virtual water did not change overall the virtual water quantity imported from china decreased and the virtual water quantity exported to china increased with china s participation in the world trade organization increased economic globalization and the development of the transportation industry trade exchange between countries has increased over the past two decades the export volume of grain virtual water has increased in many countries in addition to china such as ukraine kazakhstan russia myanmar and thailand countries in southeast asia west asia and eastern europe are relatively developed agriculturally and have the potential to be large food producers southeast asia and south asia have climates suitable for food cultivation russia kazakhstan and mongolia are large and rich in land resources while the population density is low such conditions make these countries suitable for large scale grain cultivation and grain export ukraine lithuania belarus and bulgaria are located in eastern europe close to the black sea they also have rivers water resources low water pressure and small population sizes these properties increase the export potential of these countries however the import volume of grain virtual water in many countries e g south korea malaysia indonesia the philippines and china is decreasing which may stem from the tightening of china s foreign trade of grain the growth of china s population and the development of the social economy in recent years countries in the middle east and central europe have been importing virtual water from china because of the scarcity of water resources in the middle east many countries in this region are facing severe water shortages and large areas of desert are not conducive to food cultivation despite decreases in the runoff of the two river basins in recent years there is a shortage of local resources the strong demand for food has made countries in the middle east continue to import food and water however some countries in the middle east have strong purchasing power associated with their oil exports countries in central europe also occupy a dominant position in other industries indonesia malaysia and singapore in southeast asia and the philippines in east asia are virtual net water importers although indonesia malaysia and the philippines are located in the tropics and experience a hot and rainy climate some food crops such as soybeans are not suitable for planting moreover the islands lack large areas of plains fertile land but typhoons floods and other types of meteorological disasters are frequent and reduce production consequently these countries mainly export fruits in the grain trade between china and b r countries the major import and export countries and the relative contribution of each country have also changed from 2000 to 2019 fig 7 the virtual water exported from china to thailand and india accounted for 52 and 29 of the total exports respectively followed by that from russia 9 and other countries such as vietnam indonesia and malaysia 2 by 2010 the pattern of grain virtual water trade changed little thailand and india were still the top exporters but the proportion of virtual water exports from india was much higher than that of thailand in 2000 47 the proportion of virtual water exports from thailand decreased to 25 followed by kazakhstan myanmar laos and vietnam which ranged from 5 to 9 in 2019 the trade structure was more diversified and the export volume was more balanced among countries ukraine and pakistan had the highest export volume 25 and 17 respectively followed by kazakhstan russia myanmar thailand and india the number of importers was more than that of exporters and the trade structure was becoming more diversified in 2000 malaysia and indonesia accounted for 38 and 20 of imports from china followed by the philippines south korea thailand and russia which accounted for approximately 5 by 2010 the proportion of imports to china for each country was average and the proportion of imports to china for many countries increased south korea vietnam and indonesia were the largest importers accounting for 16 12 and 10 of the import volume from china compared with 2000 the proportion of china s import volume from indonesia decreased to 10 malaysia s share decreased to 7 the trade structure of food virtual water in 2019 was more diversified and balanced in 2010 south korea accounted for 20 of the total import volume from china followed by egypt indonesia turkey vietnam malaysia the philippines and thailand which accounted for 6 9 among all b r countries china imported the most virtual water from east asia and south asia followed by central asia and eastern europe but the proportion of virtual water flowing into china from west asia africa and latin america was small fig 8 over the past two decades the virtual water volume of grain imported from china has gradually increased especially from 2010 to 2019 china s virtual flow of grain to east asia and the pacific region was the highest that to south asia west asia eastern europe and other regions was less than 10 million m3 and exports to the middle east region were the lowest from 2000 2019 china s virtual water exports to countries in various regions decreased significantly from 2010 2019 the exports of east asia and the pacific south asia latin america and africa rebounded 3 3 factors affecting virtual water trade regression analysis of all parameter panel data from 2000 to 2009 and from 2010 to 2019 was conducted using the virtual water trade volume as dependent variables the model regression results were obtained by the least squares method tables 3 and 4 each independent variable had the same coefficient but the intercept terms differed among countries water resources per capita arable land geographic distance and population were negatively correlated with the virtual water quantity of grain that b r countries import from china and the gdp and exchange rate were positively correlated with the virtual water volume water resources per capita arable land and population were positively correlated with the virtual water quantity of grain that b r countries export to china and the distance and gdp were negatively correlated with the virtual water quantity based on the results of the regression analysis the economic strength and exchange rate were the most important factors affecting virtual water inflow but domestic water resource endowment arable land resource endowment agricultural labor force and transportation costs hindered virtual water imports in addition domestic water resource endowment arable land resource endowment and agricultural labor force enhanced virtual water outflow but economic strength and exchange rate positively affected virtual water exports there were also differences in the regression results of variable coefficients from 2000 to 2009 and from 2010 to 2019 the direction of the effect of each factor did not change but the magnitude of the coefficient changed this indicates that the effect of natural and socioeconomic factors on the imports and exports of virtual water changed over the past two decades given that each variable has different units the magnitude of the regression coefficient in the model cannot be used to reflect the effect of factors on virtual water trade in this paper the average value of the variable sample data was multiplied by its corresponding coefficient to calculate the contribution value of each variable which indicates the weight of each variable the proportion of each contribution value to the total is the contribution rate for imported virtual water per capita water resources and population followed by land resources and distance had the highest contribution rates fig 9 the contribution rate of each variable changed little over the two decades differences in the condition of water resources between importing and exporting countries had the greatest effect indicating that the virtual water flow between china and b r countries was governed by the principle of comparative advantage and was greatly affected by resource conditions population had an inhibitory effect on virtual water imports and this demonstrates that the effect of an increased labor force on virtual water trade was greater than that of food demand pressure gdp and virtual water imports were positively correlated which indicates that a high economic level facilitates the import of needed resources additionally geographical distance had a negative effect on virtual water imports suggesting that transportation costs hinder virtual water trade and trade exchange is affected by geographical location the exchange rate was positively correlated with the net import volume of virtual water indicating that the currency appreciation of the importing country has a positive effect on imports the influence of each variable on the virtual water export is different from that on the virtual water import population per capita water resources and geographical distance had the largest contribution rates to virtual water exports from 2000 to 2009 from 2010 2019 gdp per capita water resources and population had the largest contribution rates this indicates that the contribution rate to virtual water exports of distance decreased due to the development of transportation industry which reduced the transportation cost of exporting products studies have shown that the b r could significantly reduce times for transportation and trade costs de soyres et al 2019 the contribution rate to virtual water exports of gdp and exchange rate increased because economic globalization has promoted the effect of economic factors on grain trade the gdp scale of b r countries in the latter decade significantly higher than that in the former decade the effect of arable land resources on the imports and exports of virtual water was weak probably because china has a large area of arable land consequently the proportion of arable land resources among b r countries varied little and their contribution rates were small 3 4 joint effect of water endowment and economic scale on virtual water trade water resource endowment among the natural factors and national economic level among the social and economic factors were the most important factors affecting virtual water trade the virtual water import volume and export volume of 71 countries were converted into three dimensional coordinates in the logarithmic form of the corresponding per capita water resources amount and gdp then the coordinate points were classified into three classes by k means clustering method the virtual water that b r countries imported from china was divided based on the per capita water resources and gdp fig 10 the first class included countries in which water conditions are satisfactory but gdp is relatively low in this case the virtual water imported is low and countries import less virtual water as water resources increase and gdp decreases this stems from the fact that countries that are abundant in water resources generally do not need to meet domestic demand with high virtual water imports in addition when the economic level is low countries lack purchasing power which reduces the quantity of imported grain for countries with a low economic level agriculture accounts for a larger proportion of the industrial structure local food is thus more abundant in such countries the second class included countries in which water resource conditions are good and gdp is high in this case virtual water imports are high and are mostly affected by gdp the economic level of a country has a positive effect on virtual water imports even if a country is rich in water resources it lacks other conditions e g land and labor needed for the development of grain planting preventing increases in virtual water imports for countries with a high economic level agriculture is not necessarily the dominant industry and most water resources are not necessarily consumed by agriculture thus there is still a high demand for food virtual water imports in this case the virtual water import volume is relatively high and the import volume increases as the gdp increases as local water resources are insufficient the third class included countries in which water resources are scarce and gdp is satisfactory in this case the virtual water import volume is relatively high and the import volume increases as gdp increases mainly because local water resources are insufficient countries have the purchasing power to import virtual water through trade in addition the third class generally has higher volume of virtual water imported than the first class which indicates that the purchasing power of virtual water importers is a strong driver of virtual water trade when their water resources condition is good a high abundance of local water resources does not inhibit the effect of purchasing power but economic strength restricts the positive effect of water shortages on virtual water imports the b r countries exporting virtual water to china can be divided into three classes according to different water resource conditions and gdp fig 10 there were no obvious differences in gdp between the three classes and differences were mainly reflected in the index of per capita water resources the first class included countries in which water resources are low and gdp is medium in this case the volume of virtual water exported is small which mainly stems from the fact that local water resources are insufficient and countries lack the resource advantage required to export grain indeed even countries with low gdp and high agricultural production do not have high virtual water export volume the second class includes countries in which water resources are sufficient but gdp is medium in this case the virtual water export volume is relatively large mainly because of the satisfactory water resource conditions and the comparative advantage of grain export the third class includes countries in which the water volume gdp and virtual water volume are high this can be explained by the effect of water resource endowment on virtual water exports in addition countries with a high economic level always have strong purchasing power the import and export trade of these countries was relatively balanced and they can export more agricultural products and receive imports to ensure that demand is met therefore the key factor for virtual water exports is the condition of natural resources the effect of social and economic conditions is relatively weak by comparison as water resources ultimately restrict grain production methods such as water transfer projects are often used to solve food inadequacy issues caused by water shortages however the importing of grain from countries with a comparative advantage is a more direct and rapid approach for meeting demand through trade the cost is relatively low and the efficiency of water use is improved 4 discussion virtual water trade can facilitate international relations among countries as virtual water importers rely on the water resources of exporters the dependence on foreign water resources by countries worldwide has become increasingly pronounced clark et al 2015 trade volume and mode promote increases in virtual water flow duarte et al 2014 our results indicate that there was an increase in the virtual water volume of agricultural products exported to china from b r countries thus china s dependence on the water resources of b r countries is increasing previous studies have shown that china has a surplus of virtual water in the international trade of agricultural products zhang et al 2016 this is consistent with our results indicating that china is a net importer of virtual water the relationship between the availability of water resources and virtual water trade volume is controversial our regression analysis shows that in the virtual water trade of agricultural products between china and b r countries the net import of virtual water was obviously affected by water resource endowment countries with better water resource conditions tend to export virtual water to china which is also consistent with the principle of comparative advantage in trade however the empirical results of many regional studies are not consistent with expectations of the effect of resource conditions on virtual water trade as well as the area of arable land some studies have shown that greater water discharges do not necessarily lead to increased virtual water exports el fadel and maroun 2003 kumar and singh 2005 hoekstra et al 2011 the reason for the differences in these studies might be differences in research objectives and modeling structure the methods used to calculate virtual water data are also diverse our results indicate that gdp is positively correlated with the virtual water quantity of agricultural products imported from china a positive effect of the gdp of importing countries compared with exporting countries on virtual water inflows has been consistently noted by many studies suweis et al 2011 tamea et al 2014a oki et al 2017 chouchane et al 2018 population had two effects on virtual water trade on the one hand population contributes to the demand for food and thus the demand for agricultural products bajželj et al 2014 on the other hand population contributes to the labor force of the country that can participate in agricultural production konar et al 2013 our results show that population negatively affects virtual water imports thus the increased labor associated with the increase in population has a greater effect than the strain caused by food demand on the agricultural trade between china and b r countries to reduce water scarcity and ensure food availability virtual water should be actively integrated into national water management strategies countries with a high dependence on foreign virtual water imports need to consider trade risks while implementing virtual water trade strategies improve domestic water use efficiency locate non traditional water resources and take measures to control domestic water demand china needs to modify its trade strategy based on the degree to which other countries depend on china to enhance trade relationships and receive higher returns according to the analysis results of this paper the net import of virtual water in china s grain trade has continued to increase from 2000 to 2019 and the demand for virtual water will further increase with population growth in the future therefore china needs to focus on strengthening the trade cooperation with belt and road countries which are capable of exporting grain especially for the main virtual water exporters like southeast asian countries vietnam laos thailand and south asian countries india pakistan ukraine kazakhstan moreover from the driving factors of virtual water for grain trade water resource endowment is the key driving factor china should expand grain import countries based on water endowment and import more grain from countries with abundant water resources because china s imports of wheat soybeans are highly dependent on a few countries for wheat china s imports are mainly from kazakhstan russia and other countries for wheat china s imports are mainly russia so in order to disperse risk of virtual water trade it s suggested that china should discover the export capacity of other countries further and expand the structure of china s importers so that large grain exporters tilt more towards the chinese market at the same time china needs to optimize the categories of grain imports such as moderately increasing the import of water intensive grains such as rice which is of significance to reduce market risks and ensure food security in addition economic distance is a cost factor affecting china s grain virtual water trade and the comparative advantage of transportation cost should be rationally utilized to increase trade cooperation with vietnam laos and other countries bordering china in terms of exports china should focus on reducing the proportion of exporting crops with high water consumption such as rice and increasing exports of crops with low water consumption such as maize it is necessary to adjust the structure of grain trade and reduce the loss of water resources in the belt and road region from the perspective of water conservation as for belt and road countries with the development of trade among countries due to economic globalization the export pattern of virtual water trade in many countries such as india pakistan and vietnam shows an expanding trend countries should consider the driving mechanism of virtual water flow comprehensively avoid excessive tree cutting and lake reclamation rationally control cultivated land area optimize crop planting structure improve irrigation water efficiency and crop yield and strive to reduce the consumption of its freshwater resources by net export of virtual water for crops several limitations of this paper require consideration in this paper the virtual water quantity of all b r countries was not calculated only the virtual water trade flows of grain crops were calculated in the future virtual water flow calculations of other b r countries and commodities in other industries are needed to obtain more comprehensive and accurate findings furthermore we only considered resource conditions that included water and land as natural factors however agriculture is greatly affected by climatic conditions and natural disasters e g drought and floods which inevitably affect the food trade and water use plans of importing and exporting countries there is thus a need to study the effect of natural disasters on virtual water trade patterns and their cascading effects through the trade network there are also often competing demands for water resources and food resources within a country given that water and food are necessities and water is a necessary condition for food production for example industrial water demand service water demand and ecological environment demand compete with agricultural water demand competing demands also characterize the grain trade between china and foreign countries the effect of water resources on resource trade in different industries also needs to be studied 5 conclusions in this paper the volume of virtual water imports and exports of grain crops between china and b r countries was calculated from 2000 to 2019 the characteristics of virtual water flow in b r countries during this period and changes of these characteristics over the twenty years were studied from 2000 2019 rice and maize were the major crops in china s food virtual water trade with b r countries the virtual water volumes imported from b r countries to china increased and total water exported from b r countries to china decreased in 2000 2019 in particular the virtual water net inflow increased annually from 2009 to 2015 which caused china to become a net importer in 2011 many b r countries have converted from imports to exports and the contributions of various crops to virtual water were more balanced countries in east asia and south asia were the main sources of virtual water flow followed by central and eastern europe and countries in the east asia and pacific region were the main sinks of virtual water flow a gravity panel data model was constructed and the effect of natural and socioeconomic driving factors on virtual water trade was explored the results show that per capita water resources arable land geographic distance and population were negatively correlated with virtual water inflow but these factors except geographic distance were positively correlated with virtual water outflow the gdp and exchange rate were positively correlated with virtual water inflow but gdp was negatively correlated with virtual water inflow therefore water resource endowment land resource endowment agricultural labor force and transportation costs will hinder countries from importing virtual water economic strength and the exchange rate will promote countries to import virtual water by comparing the contribution rate of each factor the key factor for virtual water trade is the water resources endowment in addition it s illustrated that the joint effect of gdp and water resources differed between virtual water imports and exports through the k means clustering method as for countries with more water and more gdp generally import more virtual water than countries with less water and less gdp it indicates that a high abundance of local water resources did not inhibit the effect of purchasing power but economic strength noticeably hindered the positive effect of water shortages on virtual water imports so countries with poor economic strength should be cautious to take virtual water trade strategy to alleviate domestic water stress in terms of virtual water export the key factor is the water resources condition water resources is the rigid restriction of grain production but the joint effect between gdp and water resources to virtual water export is not obvious therefore for exporters it is necessary to reasonably evaluate the supply and demand of local water resources and food take full account of local comparative advantages and export more crops with high water efficiency for importers it is essential to enrich the types of traded agricultural products and increase the number of trade partners so as to spread risks and improve the stability of trade structure declaration of competing interest the authors declare that

9703,water resources are distributed in the form of virtual water through international trade which influences the water supply and consumption of each country therefore it is of significance to study the driving factors of grain virtual water trade to alleviate water stress and guarantee food security in this paper the virtual water volume of grain crops traded between china and countries along the belt and road b r from 2000 to 2019 was calculated and a gravity model using panel data was applied to explore the effect of natural and socioeconomic factors on virtual water trade the virtual water export from b r countries to china obviously increased in the twenty years and the contributions of various crops to virtual water were more balanced the regression results indicate that gdp and exchange rate were positively correlated with virtual water inflow while per capital water resources arable land geographic distance and population were negative factors that hindered virtual water import the most powerful driving force for grain virtual water trade is water endowment gdp is an important driver on importing virtual water for countries without water shortage and a large number of local water resources will not obviously inhibit the driving force of economic strength by comparing the contribution of factors to virtual water in the past ten years it can be found that the contribution rate of distance decreased due to the development of transportation industry which reduced the transportation cost of exporting products the contribution rate of gdp and exchange rate increased because economic globalization has promoted the effect of economic factors on grain trade therefore the trade structure of agricultural products should be modified based on the characteristics of virtual water flow for countries without high economic level but water shortage export crops with high water consumption be reasonably controlled graphical abstract ga1 keywords virtual water driving factors belt and road grain trade gravity model 1 introduction water is an essential natural resource for humans and societal development the water consumption of various industries has increased in recent decades to accommodate the growth of the economy and the human population distefano and kelly 2017 insufficient water supplies pose a major challenge to the economic development of many countries jacobs et al 2016 indeed the water supply crisis is considered the greatest risk currently facing humanity hanjra and qureshi 2010 more than 40 countries worldwide are under severe water pressure and the number of people facing insufficient water resources is estimated to reach 3 billion by 2025 annukka and bonvoisin 2015 traditionally engineering measures for physical water distribution such as cross basin water transfer and pipeline water delivery have been used to deal with water supply crises however some virtual water resources are transferred between regions through trade allan 2003 the part of the water that is used in the production and consumption of commodities is considered virtual water allan 1993 the virtual water trade is a transaction in which one party purchases water consuming products from the other party through commodity trade to meet their own water and food security needs dalin et al 2012 in the past solving water resource problems only involved taking measures at the site of the actual problem now the concept of virtual water strategy permits resource deployment to be considered from a global perspective therefore studying international trade from the perspective of virtual water can provide effective suggestions of national policy to alleviate water pressure nowadays international trade has developed rapidly as the economy has become increasingly globalized the status of grain trade is critically important and involves water and food liu et al 2013 water is essential for agricultural development and 70 of the freshwater humans consume is used for irrigation liu et al 2013 most of the virtual water flow is used for agricultural products and the virtual water trade associated with agricultural products accounts for more than 60 of total virtual water trade hoekstra 2003 in 2013 china introduced the belt and road b r initiative which is an economic development and commercial project liu 2015 that has greatly affected regional economy and trade china s agricultural exports to b r countries have grown rapidly from approximately 3 39 billion usd in 2002 to approximately 15 2 billion usd in 2015 huijuan 2020 at present studies on the belt and road initiative are mainly at the political and economic levels or studying the differences in natural resource conditions lacking comprehensive consideration of trade and water resources so it is worthwhile to study the characteristics of virtual water flow between china and b r countries regional virtual water trade patterns are related to the water security and stability of countries zhao et al 2020 so it has attracted widespread attention from scholars as the theory of virtual water gradually enriched there are mainly two types of calculation methods the first is take the direct water consumption of products in the production process as virtual water content hoekstra 2003 for crops it is calculated based on the total evapotranspiration in the growing period combined with the yield hoekstra and hung 2005 yang et al 2006 the second is to estimate the water consumption according to the regional input output situation including single region input output model guan and hubacek 2007 and multi regional input output model zhang et al 2020 many scholars use the multi regional input output model to study the virtual water flow of international trade from macro level or calculate the virtual water trade between countries by referring to the global average data of virtual water content mekonnen and hoekstra 2011 2012 however the input output method can not quantify the virtual water content of crops accurately resulting in great differences in the calculation results among countries therefore when studying virtual water for international grain trade it is better to use evapotranspiration calculation method to quantify virtual water but there are few such studies many researches have carried out quantitative analysis of virtual water flow in different countries and regions at different scales for countries suffering from water scarcity the actual virtual water flow has been calculated it has been successfully applied in the implementation of virtual water trade in jordan egypt and america el fadel and maroun 2003 abu sharar et al 2012 affuso and mixon jr 2014 also the virtual water trade of china with foreign countries has been studied as well as the main destinations and origins ali et al 2017 chen et al 2018 tian et al 2018 on a regional scale the characteristics of virtual water trade pattern and its positive impact on maintaining water security and alleviating water stress has been discussed for the mediterranean region nile basin and pakistan region nassar 2007 roson and sartori 2010 zeitoun et al 2010 for smaller spatial scales some studies on the spatial characteristics of virtual water flow at sub national have been reported garcia and mejia 2019 wang et al 2021 there are also some studies reported on the global scale dalin et al 2012 lenzen et al 2013 odorico et al 2019 for example dalin et al 2012 constructed a virtual water trade network with international food based on trade data and virtual water content data and analyzed the evolution trend of this network from 1986 to 2007 however unfortunately the existing studies have focused on the calculation of national virtual water trade volume and the analysis of flow pattern there are few empirical studies on the driving mechanism of virtual water flow for the research on the driving mechanism of virtual water trade the influencing factors and driving effects of the total amount of virtual water import and export in a single country have been reported yang et al 2016 deng et al 2016 feng et al 2017 the drivers of virtual water trade between countries have also attracted much attention and gravity model is usually used to solve this problem garcia and mejia 2019 song et al 2020 fu et al 2021 however as far as we know virtual water transfer takes products as the carriers so its driving factors involve resource conditions and social economy the condition of water resources and water demand have been shown to be important factors driving food trade and the phenomenon of virtual water import is quite serious in arid countries fracasso et al 2016 delbourg and dinar 2020 in addition the flow of virtual water among countries is also affected by socioeconomic factors kumar and jain 2011 suweis et al 2011 mubako and lant 2013 population gross domestic product and geographical distance are the major drivers on global virtual water fluxes tamea et al 2014a chouchane et al 2018 sun et al 2019 literature review reveals that most studies on the drivers of virtual water flow have focused on analyzing the factors affecting virtual water imports and exports and the water footprint in a single country or region however empirical research on multiple countries is relatively scarce and most studies have used average cross section data of a certain year or years which is unable to capture dynamic temporal changes panel data models have some advantages over the cross section data models or time series models hsiao 2007 which mainly reflected in adding the time dimension so as to represent driving law of each factor more generally and accurately although previous studies have been successfully reported the literature review shows that there is a lack of research on some key aspects of these studies first the virtual water content of the major trade grains between china and b r countries was calculated and the virtual water trade volume was obtained using the trade data and the virtual water content of each crop second we analyze the spatial and temporal flow characteristics of the grain virtual water trade between china and b r countries thirdly a gravity model was constructed to explore the effect of natural factors and socioeconomic factors on virtual water trade using panel data finally we compared the influence degree and change of each influencing factor on the virtual water trade volume in the two decades and the joint effect of water endowment and economic strength was emphatically studied our study can provide important theoretical support for countries to formulate effective policies and take adaptive measures based on their own conditions the remainder of this paper is organized as follows section 2 describes countries participating in the b r natural and socioeconomic factors virtual water calculation gravity model and model verification section 3 presents virtual water content and virtual water trade volume of the b r countries factors affecting virtual water trade and joint effect of water endowment and economic strength section 4 discussions about the reason analysis of the impact of each variable on the virtual water trade volume and the rationality of our results section 5 provides conclusions about the characteristics of virtual water trade between china and the b r countries and the driving mechanism of natural and socioeconomic factors 2 methods and data 2 1 data sources 2 1 1 countries along the b r route the b r initiative covers the continents of asia europe and africa we ve set a range of countries along the b r route on the basis of the belt and road network in china www yidaiyilu gov cn in addition to china there are 71 b r countries and these countries can be divided into six regions based on geography table 1 a large part of the b r countries experience water shortages based on the ratio of water withdrawals to supply for each country gassert et al 2013 there are thirty six countries experiencing greater than medium levels of water stress fig 1 water stress varies among countries whereas pakistan bahrain iran israel jordan kuwait lebanon oman qatar saudi arabia united arab emirates and turkmenistan which are located in south asia and the middle east experience extremely high levels of water stress countries in east asia southeast asia and eastern europe do not experience appreciable levels of water stress 2 1 2 natural and socioeconomic factors the factors affecting virtual water trade can be classified into two types natural factors and socioeconomic factors given that virtual water trade is based on economic activities the social and economic conditions of importing and exporting countries inevitably affect virtual water flow otherwise the virtual water content is determined by the water consumption of crops during growth period therefore the virtual water flow among countries is related to water resource conditions meteorological conditions and other natural factors agricultural products are central to virtual water trade and variation in resource endowment is a critically important natural factor related to the trade of agricultural products olper and raimondi 2009 thus water resources have a major effect on virtual water trade in water scarce areas countries tend to grow crops that consume less water and import virtual water from abroad so that the saved water can be used in industry where it can produce greater benefits arable land a basic resource for crop planting also has a non negligible effect on virtual water trade virtual water generally flows out of countries with abundant water and soil resources and flows into countries with poor water and soil resources kumar and singh 2005 virtual water trade requires both the importer and exporter with sufficient economic strength in countries with water shortages higher economic strength is essential for ensuring that the purchasing power of citizens is sufficient for products from other countries to be purchased in countries with abundant water resources economic strength is related to the government s investment in agriculture economic power is a key factor affecting the potential of a country or region s virtual water trade turton 2000 the currency exchange rate also affects the purchasing power of the importing country and the price of the products of the exporting country in addition population growth increases water and food consumption and thus affects virtual water trade odorico et al 2019 delbourg and dinar 2020 transaction costs also play an important role in virtual water circulation as the geographical distance between countries affects the cost of transportation this distance can be used as an indicator of transportation costs commodity trade is impeded when the geographical distance is high soloaga and wintersb 2001 six main indicators influencing the virtual water trade were used to construct the panel data model the relationship between these six indicators and the volume of virtual water net imports was assessed these indicators are renewable freshwater resources per capita water arable land land geographic distance dist gross domestic product gdp population pop and exchange rate exp as shown in table the data on renewable freshwater resources per capita and cultivated area were taken from aquastat http www fao org aquastat en databases the gross domestic product population and exchange rate of each country were obtained from world bank open data https data worldbank org geographic distance data between countries were obtained from the cepii database http www cepii fr anglaisgraph bdd distances htm 2 2 methods 2 2 1 virtual water calculation many studies have explored methods for quantifying the virtual water content of products there are generally two main approaches used for these calculations the production tree method chapagain and hoekstra 2003 and the classification of different types of products zimmer and renault 2003 in this paper the crop water demand was calculated by penman formula which is used as the virtual water content for calculation the eight major grain crops including barley maize rice wheat groundnuts pulses soybeans and potatoes were used for virtual water trade calculations which are classified based on the hs convention the volume of virtual water trade was calculated by multiplying the virtual water volume of grain per unit and the trade volume as the virtual water content of grain crops varies among countries the water demand of crops in the producing countries should be used for virtual water trade calculations the volume of virtual water exported from china to countries was calculated by multiplying the virtual water content of crops in china and the export volume of crops and the virtual water imported into china from countries along the routes was calculated by multiplying the virtual water content of crops in the exporting country and the import volume of crops 1 vwt ex i j 1 8 cvw i j ex i j where vwt ex i is the virtual water export from country i to china m3 cvw i j is the virtual water content per unit mass of the product j in country i m3 t and ex i j is the j type of agricultural product that country i exports to china because the imported grain crops were obtained using the water production of other countries the importing countries receive the grain crops as a carrier and introduce water resources from abroad in the form of virtual water therefore the virtual water flow of grain crops imported from china by b r countries was calculated based on the water demand data of china through the substitution effect 2 vwt im i j 1 8 cvw 0 j im i j where vwt im i is the virtual water import of country i from china m3 cvw 0 j is the virtual water content per unit mass m3 t of product j in china and im i j is the j type of agricultural product that country i imports from china the virtual water content of crops mainly includes all the water consumed during crop growth and development through evapotranspiration the cropwat model was used to calculate crop water requirements by combining relevant data in the climwat weather database and the faostat database cropwat is a decision support tool developed by the land and water development division of fao it collects climate and soil parameters at various locations uses penman s formula to calculate the water demand of certain reference crops and then uses k c to correct the calculation and obtain the water demand of different crops this is then combined with the yield data per unit area to obtain the virtual water content per unit of grain crops the virtual water content of each crop was calculated as 3 cv w i j cw r i j c y i j where cvw i j is the virtual water content per unit of crop j in country i m3 t cwr i j is the water demand per unit area of crop j in country i m3 hm2 and cy i j is the yield per unit area of crop j in country i t hm2 the water demand per unit area cwr i j was calculated as 4 cw r i j e t 0 k c where et 0 indicates the water requirements of the reference crop in country i mm d and k c is the correction coefficient et 0 was calculated by the penman monteith formula pereira et al 1999 as 5 e t 0 0 408 δ r n g 900 t 273 u 2 e a e d δ γ 1 0 34 u 2 where r n is the net radiation on the surface of the crop mj m d g is the soil heat flow mj m2 d t is the average temperature u 2 is wind speed two meters above the ground m s e a is the steam pressure at saturation kpa e d is the actual steam pressure kpa e a e d is the difference in steam pressure kpa δ is the slope of the steam pressure curve kpa and γ is the dry humidity constant kpa annual grain trade data from 2000 to 2019 between china and b r countries were obtained from the united nations commodity trade statistics database http comtrade un org db the meteorological data required for the calculations were obtained from the climwat database from fao which includes meteorological data from 3262 different stations in 144 countries for countries with a small area weather station data from the center of the country were used for countries with a large area e g china russia and india weather station data from the main production areas of each crop within the country were used if there were multiple sites the average value was taken the crop yield per unit area required for the calculation was obtained from the faostat database http faostat fao org 2 2 2 gravity models using panel data the gravity model is derived from the law of universal gravitation it assumes that the trade flow between two countries mainly depends on their economic strength and the geographical distance between them tinbergen 1962 this model is widely used in studies of international trade flows this model has also been used to quantitatively analyze the mechanisms of international trade anderson and van wincoop 2003 head and mayer 2014 and many factors aside from the economic scale and distance can be used in the model duarte et al 2018 virtual water trade a trade activity with commodity trade as the carrier is also suitable for constructing gravity models as shown by some previous studies duarte et al 2019 in this paper econometrics and a panel data model were used and this allowed the time dimension to be considered when estimating the factors affecting virtual water trade this method is more effective and improves the efficiency and accuracy of parameter estimation under changeable globalization and trade patterns the basic form of the gravity model was as follows 6 w i j k x i x j d i j where w ij is the bilateral trade volume which is the balance of the volume of imports and exports x i is the gdp of country i x j is the gdp of country j d ij is the geographical distance between country i and country j and k is the proportional constant in empirical studies the logarithm is usually taken on both sides of the equation which turns formula 6 into formula 7 and the independent variable x is enriched in addition to the original indicator gdp 7 ln w i j ln x i ln x j ln d i j c dynamic methods are more effective than cross sectional data under continually changing patterns of globalization and trade the cross section data model can only reflect the characteristics in the corresponding time of the data and can not fully represent the general law the time series data is suitable for specific research on a single individual to reflect the characteristics of a single individual in order to study the driving effect of impact factors on virtual water trade between the b r countries and china there are 71 b r countries which cannot be analyzed by using the time series data of one country and the trade volume between countries fluctuates obviously over time so the panel data model with both time dimensions t periods and cross sectional dimensions n individuals panel data can be obtained by intercepting multiple cross sectional data from the time series arellano and honoré 2001 hsiao 2001 let i i 1 n denote the individual and t t 1 t denote the time the logarithmic linear panel model can then be set to 8 lny it β i lnx it α i λ t μ it where y it is the dependent variable of n 1 x it is the independent variable of n k β i is the parameter to be estimated α i is the individual effect λ t is the time effect and μ it is the error term using the model to express virtual water trade between china and other b r countries virtual water exports and virtual water imports were used as the response variables the explanatory variables were renewable freshwater resources per capita water arable land land gross domestic product gdp population pop exchange rate exp and distance from china dist all variables except distance were proportional to the value of the variables of china in the model the equation for the model of virtual water flow driven by natural and social factors was as follows 9 ln vw t ex it β 1 ln wate r it water c t β 2 ln lan d it lan d c t β 3 ln dis t it β

panel data for regression after passing the unit root test the stationarity of each series was first tested to determine whether they have the same unit root four statistics were used including levin lin chu t llc im pesaran shin w ips fisher chi square adf and fisher chi square pp eviews10 0 was used to test each variable and the results are shown in table 3 because only variables that pass the unit root test can be used to establish panel data for regression we first tested the stationarity of each series to determine whether they have the same unit root the virtual water exported from china lnvwt ex and imported to china lnvwt im renewable freshwater resources per capita water arable land land geographic distance dist gross domestic product gdp population pop and exchange rate exp met the 5 significance threshold using the four statistics table 2 next the f test and hausman test were conducted and these tests indicated that an individual fixed effect was most suitable the fact that the number of data sections was greater than the number of time series also indicated that an individual fixed effect model is more appropriate the regression coefficients of model parameters were estimated using the ordinary least squares method significant variables were identified using a t test at a 5 significance level 3 results 3 1 virtual water content of grain crops the virtual water content of grain crops varied in china from 2000 to 2019 fig 2 among the eight types of grain crops the virtual water content of soybeans was the highest 2000 m3 t followed by pulses and groundnuts both of which were approximately 1700 m3 t the virtual water content per unit mass of potato was the lowest 500 m3 t from 2000 2019 the virtual water content of all types of food crops decreased and this mainly stemmed from the development of agricultural technology and the optimization of crop varieties in recent years the steady increase in grain yield and the decrease in water demand per unit weight of crops led to a decrease in the virtual water content per unit weight of crops thus the virtual water content of agricultural products is not only related to the local natural climate conditions and soil types but also to the sophistication of planting technology the virtual water content of agricultural products is affected by several factors including regional meteorological conditions soil type farming mode and production level which leads to variation in the water demand of crops among countries given that the virtual water content of different crops is different the water intensive agricultural products for one country differ from those of another country the virtual water content of pulses and groundnuts per unit mass was greater than that of potatoes in b r countries fig 3 the virtual water content of grain crops was generally higher in most countries in western asia central asia and southern asia but lower in countries in eastern asia and eastern europe crops with high virtual water content in eastern asia and oceania were pulses and wheat followed by rice and maize crops with low virtual water content were potatoes maize and wheat in central asian countries pulses ground nuts and barley were the main crops with high virtual water content while potatoes and maize were the crops with low virtual water content in west asia and south asia pulses had the highest virtual water content followed by wheat and barley while potatoes and maize had the lowest virtual water content in eastern european countries pulses had the highest virtual water content followed by groundnuts and soybeans while potatoes maize and wheat had the lowest virtual water content 3 2 virtual water flow in grain trade in the process of grain trade between china and other b r countries water resources achieve inter regional flow through different grain crops as carriers the share of various grain crops in the total trade volume between china and other b r countries varies fig 4 among all food crops exported from china to other countries maize accounted for the highest proportion of exported virtual water in 2000 66 followed by rice in 2010 pulses accounted for the highest proportion of exported virtual water 32 followed by maize and rice in 2019 rice accounted for the highest proportion of virtual water flowing out of china 32 followed by maize barley and soybeans among all the grain crops imported by china from b r countries rice and soybean accounted for the highest proportion of imported virtual water in 2000 51 and 40 respectively in 2010 rice and soybean accounted for the highest proportion of imported virtual water 30 and 26 respectively the proportion of imported virtual water of pulses increased in 2019 the proportion of virtual water flowing imported to china through rice was the highest 38 followed by maize wheat and soybeans the volume of virtual water trade through grain crops between china and b r countries from 2000 to 2019 was calculated and the temporal characteristics of virtual water trade were analyzed fig 5 shows the virtual water exports and imports of china over the past twenty years the amount of imported virtual water significantly increased during this period from 2009 2015 the net import of virtual water continued to increase annually and the virtual water trade of grains changed from net outflow to net inflow in 2011 in the last five years the net import volume of virtual water fluctuated around one billion from 2000 2019 the total amount of grain virtual water exports between china and b r countries decreased exports peaked in 2003 in 2004 exports decreased significantly and remained stable at approximately 3 billion cubic meters over the past decade from 2000 2019 the total amount of grain virtual water imported by china from b r countries increased especially from 2009 to 2015 from 2000 to 2019 the characteristics of grain virtual water trade between china and b r countries were altered in response to changes in the natural conditions and socioeconomic conditions of each country in addition to international food prices and the global food market in 2000 most of the participating countries were virtual water inflow regions and the virtual water for grain flowed from china to countries in southeast asia e g indonesia malaysia and vietnam the middle east e g iran and iraq west asia and eastern europe fig 6 thailand and myanmar in southeast asia and india and nepal in south asia were virtual water outflow regions by 2010 the import and export patterns of food virtual water were more balanced the net outflow of virtual water increased and the net inflow decreased virtual water was mainly derived from countries in southeast asia vietnam laos thailand myanmar and cambodia countries in south asia india and pakistan kazakhstan in west asia ethiopia in east africa russia in eastern europe ukraine and other countries virtual water mainly flowed from china to indonesia malaysia the philippines south korea south africa the middle east and some eastern european countries some countries including vietnam laos thailand pakistan ethiopia kazakhstan russia and ukraine have changed from net importers of virtual water to net exporters by 2019 the import and export trade patterns of grain virtual water were similar to those in 2010 and countries with net inflow and outflow of virtual water did not change overall the virtual water quantity imported from china decreased and the virtual water quantity exported to china increased with china s participation in the world trade organization increased economic globalization and the development of the transportation industry trade exchange between countries has increased over the past two decades the export volume of grain virtual water has increased in many countries in addition to china such as ukraine kazakhstan russia myanmar and thailand countries in southeast asia west asia and eastern europe are relatively developed agriculturally and have the potential to be large food producers southeast asia and south asia have climates suitable for food cultivation russia kazakhstan and mongolia are large and rich in land resources while the population density is low such conditions make these countries suitable for large scale grain cultivation and grain export ukraine lithuania belarus and bulgaria are located in eastern europe close to the black sea they also have rivers water resources low water pressure and small population sizes these properties increase the export potential of these countries however the import volume of grain virtual water in many countries e g south korea malaysia indonesia the philippines and china is decreasing which may stem from the tightening of china s foreign trade of grain the growth of china s population and the development of the social economy in recent years countries in the middle east and central europe have been importing virtual water from china because of the scarcity of water resources in the middle east many countries in this region are facing severe water shortages and large areas of desert are not conducive to food cultivation despite decreases in the runoff of the two river basins in recent years there is a shortage of local resources the strong demand for food has made countries in the middle east continue to import food and water however some countries in the middle east have strong purchasing power associated with their oil exports countries in central europe also occupy a dominant position in other industries indonesia malaysia and singapore in southeast asia and the philippines in east asia are virtual net water importers although indonesia malaysia and the philippines are located in the tropics and experience a hot and rainy climate some food crops such as soybeans are not suitable for planting moreover the islands lack large areas of plains fertile land but typhoons floods and other types of meteorological disasters are frequent and reduce production consequently these countries mainly export fruits in the grain trade between china and b r countries the major import and export countries and the relative contribution of each country have also changed from 2000 to 2019 fig 7 the virtual water exported from china to thailand and india accounted for 52 and 29 of the total exports respectively followed by that from russia 9 and other countries such as vietnam indonesia and malaysia 2 by 2010 the pattern of grain virtual water trade changed little thailand and india were still the top exporters but the proportion of virtual water exports from india was much higher than that of thailand in 2000 47 the proportion of virtual water exports from thailand decreased to 25 followed by kazakhstan myanmar laos and vietnam which ranged from 5 to 9 in 2019 the trade structure was more diversified and the export volume was more balanced among countries ukraine and pakistan had the highest export volume 25 and 17 respectively followed by kazakhstan russia myanmar thailand and india the number of importers was more than that of exporters and the trade structure was becoming more diversified in 2000 malaysia and indonesia accounted for 38 and 20 of imports from china followed by the philippines south korea thailand and russia which accounted for approximately 5 by 2010 the proportion of imports to china for each country was average and the proportion of imports to china for many countries increased south korea vietnam and indonesia were the largest importers accounting for 16 12 and 10 of the import volume from china compared with 2000 the proportion of china s import volume from indonesia decreased to 10 malaysia s share decreased to 7 the trade structure of food virtual water in 2019 was more diversified and balanced in 2010 south korea accounted for 20 of the total import volume from china followed by egypt indonesia turkey vietnam malaysia the philippines and thailand which accounted for 6 9 among all b r countries china imported the most virtual water from east asia and south asia followed by central asia and eastern europe but the proportion of virtual water flowing into china from west asia africa and latin america was small fig 8 over the past two decades the virtual water volume of grain imported from china has gradually increased especially from 2010 to 2019 china s virtual flow of grain to east asia and the pacific region was the highest that to south asia west asia eastern europe and other regions was less than 10 million m3 and exports to the middle east region were the lowest from 2000 2019 china s virtual water exports to countries in various regions decreased significantly from 2010 2019 the exports of east asia and the pacific south asia latin america and africa rebounded 3 3 factors affecting virtual water trade regression analysis of all parameter panel data from 2000 to 2009 and from 2010 to 2019 was conducted using the virtual water trade volume as dependent variables the model regression results were obtained by the least squares method tables 3 and 4 each independent variable had the same coefficient but the intercept terms differed among countries water resources per capita arable land geographic distance and population were negatively correlated with the virtual water quantity of grain that b r countries import from china and the gdp and exchange rate were positively correlated with the virtual water volume water resources per capita arable land and population were positively correlated with the virtual water quantity of grain that b r countries export to china and the distance and gdp were negatively correlated with the virtual water quantity based on the results of the regression analysis the economic strength and exchange rate were the most important factors affecting virtual water inflow but domestic water resource endowment arable land resource endowment agricultural labor force and transportation costs hindered virtual water imports in addition domestic water resource endowment arable land resource endowment and agricultural labor force enhanced virtual water outflow but economic strength and exchange rate positively affected virtual water exports there were also differences in the regression results of variable coefficients from 2000 to 2009 and from 2010 to 2019 the direction of the effect of each factor did not change but the magnitude of the coefficient changed this indicates that the effect of natural and socioeconomic factors on the imports and exports of virtual water changed over the past two decades given that each variable has different units the magnitude of the regression coefficient in the model cannot be used to reflect the effect of factors on virtual water trade in this paper the average value of the variable sample data was multiplied by its corresponding coefficient to calculate the contribution value of each variable which indicates the weight of each variable the proportion of each contribution value to the total is the contribution rate for imported virtual water per capita water resources and population followed by land resources and distance had the highest contribution rates fig 9 the contribution rate of each variable changed little over the two decades differences in the condition of water resources between importing and exporting countries had the greatest effect indicating that the virtual water flow between china and b r countries was governed by the principle of comparative advantage and was greatly affected by resource conditions population had an inhibitory effect on virtual water imports and this demonstrates that the effect of an increased labor force on virtual water trade was greater than that of food demand pressure gdp and virtual water imports were positively correlated which indicates that a high economic level facilitates the import of needed resources additionally geographical distance had a negative effect on virtual water imports suggesting that transportation costs hinder virtual water trade and trade exchange is affected by geographical location the exchange rate was positively correlated with the net import volume of virtual water indicating that the currency appreciation of the importing country has a positive effect on imports the influence of each variable on the virtual water export is different from that on the virtual water import population per capita water resources and geographical distance had the largest contribution rates to virtual water exports from 2000 to 2009 from 2010 2019 gdp per capita water resources and population had the largest contribution rates this indicates that the contribution rate to virtual water exports of distance decreased due to the development of transportation industry which reduced the transportation cost of exporting products studies have shown that the b r could significantly reduce times for transportation and trade costs de soyres et al 2019 the contribution rate to virtual water exports of gdp and exchange rate increased because economic globalization has promoted the effect of economic factors on grain trade the gdp scale of b r countries in the latter decade significantly higher than that in the former decade the effect of arable land resources on the imports and exports of virtual water was weak probably because china has a large area of arable land consequently the proportion of arable land resources among b r countries varied little and their contribution rates were small 3 4 joint effect of water endowment and economic scale on virtual water trade water resource endowment among the natural factors and national economic level among the social and economic factors were the most important factors affecting virtual water trade the virtual water import volume and export volume of 71 countries were converted into three dimensional coordinates in the logarithmic form of the corresponding per capita water resources amount and gdp then the coordinate points were classified into three classes by k means clustering method the virtual water that b r countries imported from china was divided based on the per capita water resources and gdp fig 10 the first class included countries in which water conditions are satisfactory but gdp is relatively low in this case the virtual water imported is low and countries import less virtual water as water resources increase and gdp decreases this stems from the fact that countries that are abundant in water resources generally do not need to meet domestic demand with high virtual water imports in addition when the economic level is low countries lack purchasing power which reduces the quantity of imported grain for countries with a low economic level agriculture accounts for a larger proportion of the industrial structure local food is thus more abundant in such countries the second class included countries in which water resource conditions are good and gdp is high in this case virtual water imports are high and are mostly affected by gdp the economic level of a country has a positive effect on virtual water imports even if a country is rich in water resources it lacks other conditions e g land and labor needed for the development of grain planting preventing increases in virtual water imports for countries with a high economic level agriculture is not necessarily the dominant industry and most water resources are not necessarily consumed by agriculture thus there is still a high demand for food virtual water imports in this case the virtual water import volume is relatively high and the import volume increases as the gdp increases as local water resources are insufficient the third class included countries in which water resources are scarce and gdp is satisfactory in this case the virtual water import volume is relatively high and the import volume increases as gdp increases mainly because local water resources are insufficient countries have the purchasing power to import virtual water through trade in addition the third class generally has higher volume of virtual water imported than the first class which indicates that the purchasing power of virtual water importers is a strong driver of virtual water trade when their water resources condition is good a high abundance of local water resources does not inhibit the effect of purchasing power but economic strength restricts the positive effect of water shortages on virtual water imports the b r countries exporting virtual water to china can be divided into three classes according to different water resource conditions and gdp fig 10 there were no obvious differences in gdp between the three classes and differences were mainly reflected in the index of per capita water resources the first class included countries in which water resources are low and gdp is medium in this case the volume of virtual water exported is small which mainly stems from the fact that local water resources are insufficient and countries lack the resource advantage required to export grain indeed even countries with low gdp and high agricultural production do not have high virtual water export volume the second class includes countries in which water resources are sufficient but gdp is medium in this case the virtual water export volume is relatively large mainly because of the satisfactory water resource conditions and the comparative advantage of grain export the third class includes countries in which the water volume gdp and virtual water volume are high this can be explained by the effect of water resource endowment on virtual water exports in addition countries with a high economic level always have strong purchasing power the import and export trade of these countries was relatively balanced and they can export more agricultural products and receive imports to ensure that demand is met therefore the key factor for virtual water exports is the condition of natural resources the effect of social and economic conditions is relatively weak by comparison as water resources ultimately restrict grain production methods such as water transfer projects are often used to solve food inadequacy issues caused by water shortages however the importing of grain from countries with a comparative advantage is a more direct and rapid approach for meeting demand through trade the cost is relatively low and the efficiency of water use is improved 4 discussion virtual water trade can facilitate international relations among countries as virtual water importers rely on the water resources of exporters the dependence on foreign water resources by countries worldwide has become increasingly pronounced clark et al 2015 trade volume and mode promote increases in virtual water flow duarte et al 2014 our results indicate that there was an increase in the virtual water volume of agricultural products exported to china from b r countries thus china s dependence on the water resources of b r countries is increasing previous studies have shown that china has a surplus of virtual water in the international trade of agricultural products zhang et al 2016 this is consistent with our results indicating that china is a net importer of virtual water the relationship between the availability of water resources and virtual water trade volume is controversial our regression analysis shows that in the virtual water trade of agricultural products between china and b r countries the net import of virtual water was obviously affected by water resource endowment countries with better water resource conditions tend to export virtual water to china which is also consistent with the principle of comparative advantage in trade however the empirical results of many regional studies are not consistent with expectations of the effect of resource conditions on virtual water trade as well as the area of arable land some studies have shown that greater water discharges do not necessarily lead to increased virtual water exports el fadel and maroun 2003 kumar and singh 2005 hoekstra et al 2011 the reason for the differences in these studies might be differences in research objectives and modeling structure the methods used to calculate virtual water data are also diverse our results indicate that gdp is positively correlated with the virtual water quantity of agricultural products imported from china a positive effect of the gdp of importing countries compared with exporting countries on virtual water inflows has been consistently noted by many studies suweis et al 2011 tamea et al 2014a oki et al 2017 chouchane et al 2018 population had two effects on virtual water trade on the one hand population contributes to the demand for food and thus the demand for agricultural products bajželj et al 2014 on the other hand population contributes to the labor force of the country that can participate in agricultural production konar et al 2013 our results show that population negatively affects virtual water imports thus the increased labor associated with the increase in population has a greater effect than the strain caused by food demand on the agricultural trade between china and b r countries to reduce water scarcity and ensure food availability virtual water should be actively integrated into national water management strategies countries with a high dependence on foreign virtual water imports need to consider trade risks while implementing virtual water trade strategies improve domestic water use efficiency locate non traditional water resources and take measures to control domestic water demand china needs to modify its trade strategy based on the degree to which other countries depend on china to enhance trade relationships and receive higher returns according to the analysis results of this paper the net import of virtual water in china s grain trade has continued to increase from 2000 to 2019 and the demand for virtual water will further increase with population growth in the future therefore china needs to focus on strengthening the trade cooperation with belt and road countries which are capable of exporting grain especially for the main virtual water exporters like southeast asian countries vietnam laos thailand and south asian countries india pakistan ukraine kazakhstan moreover from the driving factors of virtual water for grain trade water resource endowment is the key driving factor china should expand grain import countries based on water endowment and import more grain from countries with abundant water resources because china s imports of wheat soybeans are highly dependent on a few countries for wheat china s imports are mainly from kazakhstan russia and other countries for wheat china s imports are mainly russia so in order to disperse risk of virtual water trade it s suggested that china should discover the export capacity of other countries further and expand the structure of china s importers so that large grain exporters tilt more towards the chinese market at the same time china needs to optimize the categories of grain imports such as moderately increasing the import of water intensive grains such as rice which is of significance to reduce market risks and ensure food security in addition economic distance is a cost factor affecting china s grain virtual water trade and the comparative advantage of transportation cost should be rationally utilized to increase trade cooperation with vietnam laos and other countries bordering china in terms of exports china should focus on reducing the proportion of exporting crops with high water consumption such as rice and increasing exports of crops with low water consumption such as maize it is necessary to adjust the structure of grain trade and reduce the loss of water resources in the belt and road region from the perspective of water conservation as for belt and road countries with the development of trade among countries due to economic globalization the export pattern of virtual water trade in many countries such as india pakistan and vietnam shows an expanding trend countries should consider the driving mechanism of virtual water flow comprehensively avoid excessive tree cutting and lake reclamation rationally control cultivated land area optimize crop planting structure improve irrigation water efficiency and crop yield and strive to reduce the consumption of its freshwater resources by net export of virtual water for crops several limitations of this paper require consideration in this paper the virtual water quantity of all b r countries was not calculated only the virtual water trade flows of grain crops were calculated in the future virtual water flow calculations of other b r countries and commodities in other industries are needed to obtain more comprehensive and accurate findings furthermore we only considered resource conditions that included water and land as natural factors however agriculture is greatly affected by climatic conditions and natural disasters e g drought and floods which inevitably affect the food trade and water use plans of importing and exporting countries there is thus a need to study the effect of natural disasters on virtual water trade patterns and their cascading effects through the trade network there are also often competing demands for water resources and food resources within a country given that water and food are necessities and water is a necessary condition for food production for example industrial water demand service water demand and ecological environment demand compete with agricultural water demand competing demands also characterize the grain trade between china and foreign countries the effect of water resources on resource trade in different industries also needs to be studied 5 conclusions in this paper the volume of virtual water imports and exports of grain crops between china and b r countries was calculated from 2000 to 2019 the characteristics of virtual water flow in b r countries during this period and changes of these characteristics over the twenty years were studied from 2000 2019 rice and maize were the major crops in china s food virtual water trade with b r countries the virtual water volumes imported from b r countries to china increased and total water exported from b r countries to china decreased in 2000 2019 in particular the virtual water net inflow increased annually from 2009 to 2015 which caused china to become a net importer in 2011 many b r countries have converted from imports to exports and the contributions of various crops to virtual water were more balanced countries in east asia and south asia were the main sources of virtual water flow followed by central and eastern europe and countries in the east asia and pacific region were the main sinks of virtual water flow a gravity panel data model was constructed and the effect of natural and socioeconomic driving factors on virtual water trade was explored the results show that per capita water resources arable land geographic distance and population were negatively correlated with virtual water inflow but these factors except geographic distance were positively correlated with virtual water outflow the gdp and exchange rate were positively correlated with virtual water inflow but gdp was negatively correlated with virtual water inflow therefore water resource endowment land resource endowment agricultural labor force and transportation costs will hinder countries from importing virtual water economic strength and the exchange rate will promote countries to import virtual water by comparing the contribution rate of each factor the key factor for virtual water trade is the water resources endowment in addition it s illustrated that the joint effect of gdp and water resources differed between virtual water imports and exports through the k means clustering method as for countries with more water and more gdp generally import more virtual water than countries with less water and less gdp it indicates that a high abundance of local water resources did not inhibit the effect of purchasing power but economic strength noticeably hindered the positive effect of water shortages on virtual water imports so countries with poor economic strength should be cautious to take virtual water trade strategy to alleviate domestic water stress in terms of virtual water export the key factor is the water resources condition water resources is the rigid restriction of grain production but the joint effect between gdp and water resources to virtual water export is not obvious therefore for exporters it is necessary to reasonably evaluate the supply and demand of local water resources and food take full account of local comparative advantages and export more crops with high water efficiency for importers it is essential to enrich the types of traded agricultural products and increase the number of trade partners so as to spread risks and improve the stability of trade structure declaration of competing interest the authors declare that

9704,the computation of the reference crop evapotranspiration eto using the fao56 penman monteith equation pm eto requires data on maximum and minimum air temperatures tmax tmin relative humidity rh solar radiation rs and wind speed u2 however the records of meteorological variables are often incomplete or of poor quality frequently in the mountain areas such as those of the andes environmental sensors are subject to harsh conditions due to the diurnal nocturnal climatic variability causing challenging conditions for meteorological monitoring which leads to data loss for high elevation landscapes like the andes the missing variables of vapor pressure deficit and solar radiation cause a high impact on pm eto calculation to assess these limitations several methods relying on maximum and minimum temperature to estimate the missing variables have been considered in the present investigation based on data from three automatic weather stations in the high tropical andes humid páramo 3298 3955 m a s l we found that the calibration and validation of methods were essential to estimate rs using the de jong and stewart 1993 rs ds method we retrieved the highest performance a rmse between 2 89 and 3 81 mj m 2 day 1 moreover in the absence of rh observations replacing the dew point temperature tdew by tmin was a reliable alternative when apply the method of allen et al 1998 vpd fao which showed the highest performance with rmse between 0 08 and 0 12 kpa these results yielded highly accurate pm eto estimates with rmse between 0 29 and 0 34 mm day 1 and rmse between 0 12 and 0 18 mm day 1 respectively as expected when both variables were missing the eto calculation increased its error with an rmse between 0 32 and 0 42 mm day 1 a proper estimation of eto in the andean páramo contributes to improved water productivity for domestic and industrial uses irrigated agriculture and hydropower keywords páramo pm eto solar radiation vapor pressure deficit calibration 1 introduction the páramo is the most important ecosystem in the high tropical andes for water resources supply hofstede et al 2014 the andean páramo covers over 30 000 km2 of northern south america wright et al 2018 it is the primary water source for communities located near this ecosystem which include major cities in colombia ecuador and perú buytaert et al 2006 its vegetation consists mainly of tussock grasses cushion plants and patches of woody species such as polylepis sp and gynoxys sp that occur only in sheltered locations and along water streams buytaert et al 2006 this ecosystem serves as a sponge that captures precipitation stores and releases the water gradually to the surrounding areas llambí et al 2012 producing a sustained streamflow during the year this water resource is intensively used for irrigated agriculture industry rural and urban drinking water systems hydro power production and for sustaining aquatic ecosystems célleri and feyen 2009 llambí et al 2012 particularly an important economic function of water in andean ecosystems is to irrigate agriculture in downstream areas at present irrigation represents 71 2 which becomes the activity that consumes the most flow in our country compromising almost all of the water sources located in high altitude areas for irrigation ministerio de agricultura y ganadería et al 2019 although evapotranspiration may not be a limiting factor for water use in cold and humid regions the increasing demand for water resources due to population growth urbanization and irrigated agriculture require a reliable estimate of evapotranspiration to improve the yield and water productivity a common approach for calculating evapotranspiration is the estimation of eto which is the most useful for countless scientific and management applications such as water balance studies at different scales evaluation of water resources and development of watershed management plans likewise eto plays a key role in crop water irrigation planning and management as well as in studies related to the analysis of climate change and water conservation paredes et al 2020 2017 todorovic et al 2013 according to the food and agriculture organization fao56 allen et al 1998 the penman monteith equation pm is the most recommended method to determine eto this method is a global standard based on meteorological data allen et al 1998 and their applications all over the world have been quite successful jabloun and sahli 2008 ochoa sánchez et al 2019 paredes et al 2020 2017 paredes and pereira 2019 todorovic et al 2013 the major limitation of the penman monteith equation reported in many studies is the requirement of meteorological variables air temperature relative humidity solar radiation and wind speed that are often incomplete or of poor quality córdova et al 2015 da silva et al 2018 karimi et al 2020 paredes and pereira 2019 santos et al 2020 sentelhas et al 2010 tomas burguera et al 2017 this usually happens when a sensor breaks or malfunctions e g due to weather conditions lack of maintenance or electronic failure frequently in the mountain areas like the andes sensors are subject to harsh environmental conditions due to the high climatic variability during the day causing challenging environmental conditions for meteorological monitoring which leads to data loss accordingly the application of pm faces the problem of data unavailability research has developed a variety of tools and procedures to overcome the unavailability of data by using empirical equations most of them relying on maximum and minimum temperature for instance the procedures by hargreaves and samani 1982 the equations proposed in fao56 allen et al 1998 the equations by castellví et al 1997 among others however these methods require local calibrations to obtain satisfactory performances as several studies have shown in various climate types ranging from hyper arid to humid karimi et al 2020 paredes et al 2017 raziei and pereira 2013 ren et al 2016 todorovic et al 2013 the approach of these studies was the calibration of the krs coefficient of the hargreaves and samani 1982 method to estimate solar radiation when the variable was missing and a correction in the minimum temperature to estimate actual vapor pressure in the absence of relative humidity data in all cases their results showed that the pm eto method had greater precision in both arid and humid climates when missing data was estimated however todorovic et al 2013 found that for good eto performance the correction applied in the minimum temperature was only necessary for hyper arid arid semi arid and dry subhumid climates and not for humid conditions moreover ren et al 2016 found that the calibrated coefficient of the method to estimate solar radiation varied with climatic aridity the errors of estimates were higher when the range of variation of eto was higher which occurred more often for hyper arid and arid climates contrarily to sub humid locations in addition karimi et al 2020 also found that the effect of using estimated values of solar radiation on pm eto calculation caused greater error than using estimated values of wind speed unlike the most common methods reviewed above in various studies a large number of empirical methods are compared to estimate the missing variables bandyopadhyay et al 2008 besharat et al 2013 jabloun and sahli 2008 li et al 2013 tabari et al 2016 however there is a shortage of information for high elevation landscapes like the andes contrary to the information available in low and arid areas using daily data recorded from eight weather stations in north africa tunisia jabloun and sahli 2008 evaluated the performance of the pm eto method with limited data and revealed that estimating solar radiation with allen 1995 method that takes into account the elevation effects on the volumetric heat capacity of the atmosphere it gave accurate estimates of eto in all the studied regions furthermore the use of minimum temperature was a good alternative when relative humidity measurements were lacking the use of the mean annual wind speed of the location led to acceptable eto estimates especially for high eto rates under cool arid and semi arid conditions in iran tabari et al 2016 estimated solar radiation using 12 models and then compared daily pm eto values derived from both measured and estimated solar radiation the results indicated that using estimated rs the pm eto method performed well for semi arid and arid climates in cold conditions the pm eto accuracy decreased despite the calibration of the models there are also others alternatives to estimate meteorological variables such us using satellite geostatistical interpolation or machine learning a complete review of this applications for eto estimation is beyond the scope of this paper thus some relevant studies will be reviewed here silva et al 2010 evaluated the use of mesoscale model results as proxy for weather variables in places where there are no meteorological stations and found that is the most effective method to generate estimates of eto feng et al 2019 in temperate continental regions of china compared different machine learning and empirical models for global solar radiation prediction only using air temperature as inputs the results indicated the hybrid mind evolutionary algorithm and artificial neural network model provided better estimations compared with the existing machine learning and empirical models qadeer et al 2021 applied the random forest rf approach to estimate the relative humidity as a function of dry and wet bulb temperatures the rf model has sufficient potential to estimate rh however the prediction performance of the rf model strongly depends on both the quantity and quality of the training data berndt and haberlandt 2018 investigated the performance of different interpolation techniques for various climate variables observed by weather stations in northern germany they found that the influences of temporal resolution and spatial variability appear to be higher than the influence of station density the best estimation accuracy is achieved for relative humidity and temperature due to the consideration of the dem and the low spatial variability jeong et al 2017 compared geostatistical interpolation and stochastic simulation approaches for the estimation of daily solar radiation located across southern canada the three geostatistical interpolation models yield better performances at stations located in a high density area of solar radiation measuring stations compared to the three stochastic simulation models there is only one previous study that examined the impact of missing meteorological variables on pm eto calculation in the high tropical andes córdova et al 2015 evaluated the pm eto equation with limited data using meteorological variables of two weather stations in the high tropical andes ecuador and found that the maximum error in eto calculations was observed when solar radiation and relative humidity were missing while wind speed had a much lower impact finally they concluded that there is an urgent need for the development of alternative methods in these sites to estimate accurate values for missing variables there is a knowledge gap to estimate the missing variables and this makes pm eto subject to high uncertainty thus the first step to achieving this is to develop or calibrate equations to estimate the missing variables and then evaluate its impact on pm eto therefore the main goal of this article is to accurately estimate eto when weather variables are lacking using pm method the specific objectives of this study are a to calibrate and validate methods to estimate rs from temperature data and to determine the method with the highest performance b to evaluate the performance of methods to estimate vapor pressure deficit vpd from temperature data and to determine the method with the highest efficiency and c to evaluate the impact on pm eto calculation when rs and or vpd are missing and these variables are estimated with the methods found in a and b in a páramo ecosystem 2 study area and data in the tropical andes of southern ecuador the headwater catchment of quinoas covers an area of about 94 1 km2 and an elevation range of 3150 4425

the climate is influenced by air masses of both the pacific and the amazon basin buytaert et al 2006 a bimodal precipitation seasonality is presented in connection with the meridional displacement of the intertropical convergence zone itcz and its double passage throughout the year over the deep tropics garreaud 2009 this corresponds to the months from march to may and october where the maximum values of precipitation are recorded carrillo rojas et al 2016 annual precipitation is between 946 and 1120 mm table 1 shows the daily values of different meteorological variables these values coincide with those reported by córdova et al 2015 and carrillo rojas et al 2016 in the same study site meteorological data were collected along an altitudinal gradient 3298 3955 m a s l during the six year period 2014 2019 from three automatic weather stations awss chirimachay virgen del cajas hereafter denoted as virgen and toreadora the climate is classified as cfc according to the köppen geiger categories kottek et al 2006 warm temperate climate fully humid with cool summer and cold winter in the three sites humid conditions were identified for the study area according to the aridity index the aridity index was calculated using the methodology of padilla et al 2011 which resulted from the ratios obtained by dividing rainfall by potential evapotranspiration these indices were subsequently reclassified using the aridity classes proposed by unep 1992 the values were 1 6 1 3 1 5 for chirimachay virgen and toreador respectively the sites approached a reference eto station an extensive surface of green well watered grass of uniform height actively growing and shading the ground all measurements were made at 2 m above ground level each station recorded data at a 5 minute frequency for average temperature tavg tmax tmin average relative humidity rhavg maximum relative humidity hrmax minimum relative humidity hrmin u2 and rs the values were aggregated on a daily scale due to the presence of gaps in the database preprocessing was performed excluding days with missing data the amount of missing data was 3 7 2 5 and 6 8 for chirimachay virgen and toreadora awss respectively in addition data integrity was evaluated using guidelines suggested by allen et al 1998 these criteria included comparing measured solar radiation to theoretical solar radiation during clear sky periods and comparing daily average dew point temperature or rhmax with minimum daily air temperature in our case we compared with rhmax data the sensors used in the study are described in table a1 appendix a 3 methods we followed the flowchart presented in fig 2 first to estimate rs section 3 1 we selected five different methods based on air temperature these methods have adjustment coefficients that were calibrated and validated in order to obtain satisfactory performances prior to calibration we performed a data preprocessing to capture all the temperature variability in the calibration and validation datasets then we evaluated the ability of each method to simulate rs in order to select the method with the best performance second to estimate the vpd section 3 2 we selected four different methods also based on air temperature then we evaluated the ability of each method to estimate vpd in order to select the method with the best performance finally with the methods selected previously we evaluated the impact of rs and vpd estimation on pm eto calculation section 3 3 the methodological details are explained in the following subsections 3 1 estimation of solar radiation 3 1 1 methods to estimate rs hargreaves and samani 1982 hereafter denoted as rs hs recommended a method to estimate solar radiation using the difference between the maximum and minimum temperature this is related to the degree of cloud cover in a given location 1 r s k rs t max t min r a where k rs is an adjustment coefficient the authors recommended k rs values from 0 16 to 0 19 0

precipitation and the range of daily temperature t 6 r s a r a t b 1 cp d p 2 where a b c and d are adjustment coefficients table a2 appendix a see details of coefficients used by the authors p is precipitation in mm and t can be calculated as 7 t t max t min j t min j 1 2 where t max in the daily maximum temperature c t min j and t min j 1 are the daily minimum temperature c of the corresponding and the next day respectively allen 1995 hereafter denoted as rs al modified eq 1 by estimating k rs as a function of the ratio of atmospheric pressure 8 k rs k ra p p o 0 5 where k ra is an adjustment coefficient having values in the 0 17 0 20 range with values of 0 17 for inland regions and 0 20 for coastal regions and p is the mean atmospheric pressure of the site kpa p o is the mean atmospheric pressure at sea level 101 3 kpa 9 p p 0 293 0 0065 z 293 5 26 where z is the elevation m a s l of the site vanderlinden et al 2004 hereafter denoted as rs va found a relationship

terrestrial solar radiation and the difference between the maximum and minimum daily air temperature 11 r s a ln t max t min b r a where a and b are adjustment coefficients table a2 appendix a see details of coefficients used by the authors 3 1 2 data preprocessing to avoid a bias in the selection of the samples for calibration and validation we performed a data preprocessing a duration curve was made for tmax tmin this variable serves as input for the aforementioned methods for each weather station fig 3 this analysis was made because in preliminary calculations random samples containing a disproportionately large percentage of high or low values caused a biased calibration of the methods not shown the curves showed inflection points around the 20th and the 90th percentiles in the three stations limits indicated by the solid vertical lines in fig 3 which were set as the limits for the different groups of data therefore the data was split into three sets high values 20 medium values 20 and 90 and low values 90 fig 3 this data classification was subsequently used for assembling the groups for the calibration and validation processes section 3 1 3 3 1 3 calibration and validation of rs estimation methods a model performs better when calibration is performed with a large dataset enough to contain a wide range of weather conditions motavita et al 2019 perrin et al 2007 xia et al 2004 motavita et al 2019 also mentioned that in the calibration and validation datasets must contain a wide range of the variability bennett et al 2013 suggested randomizing the division of data so that the model performance is not biased by the allocation of data following these recommendations we took the first 4 years of data for calibration and validation 2014 2017 and took 70 of the data for calibration while 30 was left for validation the calibration and validation samples were taken randomly but considering that each subset must fit the distribution criteria described in section 3 1 2 20 of high values 70 of medium values and 10 of low values in order to find a general method for the ecosystem calibration was performed for the entire altitudinal gradient by analyzing all data from the three weather stations combined as the methodology of de jong and stewart 1993 applied in their study the monte carlo method was used to select the optimal coefficients after performing 5000 simulations to calibrate each method as a reference we started using the standard ranges of variation table a2 appendix a after previous calculations we established our own ranges of variation because the ranges were widened or shortened table a3 appendix a moreover we validated each calibrated method with data independent of the calibration after running the calibration and validation for the altitudinal gradient we applied the calibrated equations to the data set of each station using only 30 of validation data as stated in section 3 1 3 3 2 methods to estimate vpd vapor pressure deficit is estimated as the difference between the saturation vapor pressure e s and the actual vapor pressure e a 12 vpd e s e a where e s is calculated as 13 e s e t max e t min 2 and when relative humidity data is available e a is calculated as 14 e a e t min rh max 100 e t min rh min 100 2 where e t is the saturation vapor pressure kpa and t max and t min are the maximum and minimum daily temperature c and rh max and rh min are the maximum and minimum daily relative humidity e t for air temperature t is 15 e t 0 6108 exp 17 27 t t 237 3 in the absence of humidity data we evaluated four different methods based on air temperature to estimate the daily vpd using four years of data 2014 2017 in fao56 allen et al 1998 hereafter denoted as vpd fao stated that e a may be obtained by assuming that the dewpoint temperature t dew is close to the t min the t dew is usually experienced at sunrise in reference weather stations in our study we do not have measures of t dew therefore we used t min to estimate e a due to the high humidity in our study area the rh reaches 100 most of the night time hours we found that using t min between 05h00 and 08h00 to calculate e a yielded better results than using absolute daily t min 16 e a e t dew 0 6108 exp 17 27 t dew t dew 237 3 doorenbos and pruitt 1977 hereafter denoted as vpd dp proposed the following method to estimate vpd 17 vpd e t avg e t dew where e t avg is the saturation vapor pressure at the mean daily temperature castellví et al 1997 hereafter denoted as vpd ca1 proposed the following method to estimate vpd 18 vpd e t a e t dew where t a defined as the temperature that leaves equal areas under the curve e t e t dew between t max and t min using the trapezoidal method for more detail review the research of castellví et al 1997 castellví et al 1997 hereafter denoted as vpd ca2 proposed the following method to estimate the mean relative humidity 19 rh avg 100 e t dew 1 2 e t a e t avg then we calculated e a as proposed fao56 allen et al 1998 20 e a rh avg 100 e t avg 3 3 impact of rs and vpd estimation on pm eto calculation we used two years of complete data 2018 2019 to calculate pm eto then we generated missing data scenarios by removing rs or and vpd values and evaluated the impact on pm eto calculation when these variables were estimated using the selected equations previously the pm eto method defined by allen et al 1998 for calculating reference evapotranspiration of a hypothetical crop having a height of 0 12 m a surface resistance of 70 s m 1 and an albedo of 0 23 is 21 pm

psychrometric constant kpa c 1 for daily computations g equals zero as the magnitude of daily soil heat flux beneath the grass reference surface is very small allen et al 1998 3 4 evaluation criteria the statistical indices used to evaluate the methods performance were i the nash sutcliffe efficiency ce which has been widely used to evaluate the performance of empirical models and it is sensitive to differences in the observed and simulated means and variances ii the coefficient of determination r 2 which describes how much of the observed dispersion is explained by the prediction iii the coefficient of determination multiplied by the slope b br 2 a model which systematically over or underpredicts all the time will still result in good r2 values close to 1 0 even if all predictions were wrong therefore is advisable to take into account additional information which can cope with that problem this information is provided by the slope b and as long as b is close to one is better and iv the root mean square error rmse which is a weighted measure of the error in which the largest deviations between the observed and modeled values contribute the most table a4 appendix a to evaluate the quality of the pm eto calculations when one or two variables were missing we used the same statistical indices 4 results and discussion 4 1 estimation of solar radiation to estimate solar radiation we used a period data 2014 2017 in the absence of rs observations this variable was estimated using methods based on air temperature with locally calibrated adjustment coefficients eqs 1 11 table 2 shows the coefficients and statistical indicators of the calibration of the methods to estimate rs when we combined the data from the three stations to calibrate the methods and to select the best method for the gradient it was found that the adjustment coefficients of each method varied from their original values in a global context the difference of the coefficients is related to the different climatic regions where the methods have been developed and tested these methods have been mostly applied in arid and semi arid regions and to a lesser degree in humid regions in the available literature in sub humid and humid regions it was found that to estimate rs the authors commonly use the recommendations of allen 1995 and hargreaves and samani 1982 with a local calibration of the krs coefficient jabloun and sahli 2008 paredes et al 2020 2017 paredes and pereira 2019 in such studies the values of krs coefficient were higher for both methods rs hs and rs al compared to the krs values in our study area the variability of the coefficients is influenced by the change in the diurnal temperature range dtr where the dtr decreases as altitude increases as confirmed by córdova et al 2015 for our study area liu et al 2009 found that a increases as altitude increases and the dtr decreases and the opposite was found for b it decreases as altitude increases and the dtr decreases this relation between the coefficients for this method and altitude was also found by li et al 2013 the rs ch method showed values in the range of 0 16 0 42 coefficient a and 0 45 0 12 coefficient b in the north china plain chen et al 2004 in our case the calibration had lower values but with similar behavior at higher altitudes the coefficient a increases and the coefficient b decreases the rs va method showed average values of 0 0030 and 0 0022 for the coefficients a and b respectively in southern spain vanderlinden et al 2004 while we found higher values in our study in the rs ds method the values of the coefficients a 0 127 b 0 599 c 0 028 and d 0 0003 reported in western canada de jong and stewart 1993 were similar to our values except by the coefficient a that was greater for a detailed comparison of coefficients see table 2 the table shows that the changes in the coefficients of the five methods are study area dependent due to the use of local data bases the methods that use dtr as input rs hs rs al rs va and rs ch had similar performance showing a rmse in the range from 3 58 to 3 73 mj m 2 day 1 a ce from 0 42 to 0 47 and r2 and br2 values from 0 47 to 51 and from 0 43 to 0 47 respectively whereas the rs ds method that used t and the effect of precipitation eqs 6 7 yielded better estimations than the other methods with higher values of ce r2 and br2 and a lower value of rmse table 2 especially in humid regions the use of precipitation has a considerable effect on solar radiation reducing the solar transmissivity due to the presence of cloud table 3 presents the results of the validation for the methods in the altitudinal gradient it was observed that the performance of the rs hs rs al rs va and rs ch methods was similar to the calibration performance and it was confirmed that rs ds method is the highest performing one once the methods were calibrated for the gradient we evaluated them using the data from each station individually the scatter plot for chirimachay fig 4a d g j m showed high dispersion and slight overestimation for rs below 15 mj m 2 day 1 this was reflected in a slight increase in rmse and a lower ce compared to the results obtained for the entire gradient moreover the rs ds and rs al methods showed the best results a lower rmse and a higher ce r2 and br2 however these results did not differ greatly from the performance of the rest of the methods at the site table 4 we found that virgen had the best adjustment to the observed values in all the methods in comparison to the other sites and the method with the best performance was rs ds table 4 fig 4b e h k n in toreadora the ce presented the lowest values compared to the other sites for all the methods except for rs ds this method showed the best performance to estimate rs at the site table 4 at the virgen site where the methods showed the best results we hypothesize that this could be because of two reasons firstly the methods for estimating eto were mainly developed in arid and semiarid regions thus the site with the lowest rh which is virgen might show the best results and secondly the more stable boundary layer in virgen related to the local relatively flatter topography of the site provides the conditions for air temperature to be more related to rs compared to the other sites which in the end will yield better results when rs is estimated from temperature measurements in addition we found that the ability of the methods to estimate rs is affected by elevation because there is a major incidence of solar radiation in high areas but such effect on the temperature is low this is due to the fact that only a small fraction of rs is absorbed by the thinner atmosphere of these high elevation sites llambí et al 2012 this means that the incoming rs does not heat up and this is reflected in the underestimation of high values of rs therefore at the highest site toreadora the highest values of rs resulted in the lowest accuracy br2 0 51 in all methods compared to the other sites at this location the methods that used dtr rs hs rs al rs va and rs ch estimated rs values up to 15 mj m 2 day 1 80 of data and the rs ds method which uses t and the effect of precipitation estimated rs values up to 19 mj m 2 day 1 90 of data while for the chirimachay and virgen sites the rs hs rs al rs va and rs ch methods presented difficulty in estimating rs 17 mj m 2 day 1 12 86 of data and the rs ds method estimated rs values up to 21 mj m 2 day 1 93 24 of data fig 4 the performance of the methods based on temperature increases as dtr increases allen 1997 li et al 2014 samani 2000 therefore this performance decreases with the altitude because dtr is reduced evidently our results agree with this elevation effect that causes dtr to decrease in the highest site this finding is also consistent with the results presented by paredes et al 2017 in sites with higher elevation the dtr was lower and the extreme values were not well estimated as well as li et al 2014 in china and bandyopadhyay et al 2008 in india who reported the failure of these methods for high elevation stations both studies estimated monthly solar radiation 4 2 estimation of vapor pressure deficit to estimate vapor pressure deficit we used a period data 2014 2017 table 5 summarizes the statistical indicators of the methods applied to estimate daily vpd it was found that in the gradient the rmse was in the range from 0 08 to 0 30 kpa the ce with values between 0 24 and 0 63 the r2 with values between 0 55 a 0 81 and br2 from 0 35 to 0 71 the vpd fao method had the highest performance in most of the statistical indicators but also showed a slight overestimation for low and medium values in addition an underestimation of low values was found using the vpd dp vpd ca1 and vpd ca2 methods in chirimachay and an overestimation of medium values by the vpd ca1 and vpd ca2 methods in virgen and toreadora fig 5 to find the best method for the gradient we analyzed the statistics site by site in chirimachay the vpd fao method had the best performance with the highest r2 and br2 and a low rmse 0 12 kpa in virgen and toreadora the vpd fao method had the lowest rmse with values of 0 08 and 0 09 kpa respectively the other statistical results confirmed that the vpd fao method had the highest performance table 5 therefore we conclude that the vpd fao method is the most suitable method to estimate vpd in the altitudinal gradient however the overestimation presented by this approach has also been found in other studies performed in humid climates landeras et al 2008 paredes et al 2017 todorovic et al 2013 tomas burguera et al 2017 this could be due to the fact that tdew tmin in sub humid and humid climates paredes et al 2017 todorovic et al 2013 hence by assuming tdew tmin ea is being underestimated and therefore vpd is overestimated in fact a previous analysis showed that when we took the daily minimum temperature the overestimation was 0 04 kpa per day greater than the current one to decrease this overestimation we took the minimum temperature at sunrise 05h00 08h00 to get closer to the actual value of tdew 4 3 estimation of daily eto when rs and or vpd are missing period 2018 2019 table 6 shows the statistical performance of the pm eto calculation when rs and or vpd were missing and were estimated with the best methods selected for the altitudinal gradient it was found that the pm eto calculation results were worse when the missing variable was rs while when vpd data were missing the pm eto estimates were closer to the pm eto values calculated with the complete data set this is evident in all statistical indicators with the lowest rmse and the highest ce r2 and br2 as expected the largest error occurred when data for two variables were missing and their values were estimated table 6 the site by site analysis showed that the high eto values were underestimated in chirimachay virgen and toreadora and only in chirimachay a slight overestimation of the lower values existed on pm eto calculation with estimated rs this behavior is well explained by the relationships between rs ds and observed rs above previously analyzed fig 4a o the estimated values of pm eto rs ds were better than rs ds estimates the good relationship between pm eto and pm eto rs ds is highlighted in fig 6a c and table 6 with r2 0 82 and br2 78 in the three sites moreover the rmse values were below 0 34 mm day 1 and the highest performance was found in toreadora table 6 fig 6c the novelty of our results lies in the fact that limited information is available on this topic for humid conditions and there is only one previous study which preliminary explored the topic in the high tropical andes córdova et al 2015 such investigation concluded that for the pm eto calculation the observations of rs are extremely important in this area because when this variable was missing and it was estimated without local calibration the eto yielded the maximum error rmse of 0 53 mm day 1 in contrast our results showed a decrease in the rmse to 0 27 mm day 1 after selecting the best method to estimate rs in this zone the research of souza et al 2016 had similar findings in humid conditions in the mato grosso state among the methods used to estimate rs the method proposed by de jong and stewart 1993 resulted in the lowest rmse on pm eto calculations previous studies developed under humid conditions have reported an underestimation of high values and a slight overestimation of low values on eto calculation when rs was estimated in this case using the method of hargreaves and samani 1982 with the locally calibrated krs coefficient paredes et al 2017 paredes and pereira 2019 paredes et al 2020 in their study computed krs using a trial and error procedure and krs as a function of tmax tmin rh and u2 in a global equation and equations focused on climatic conditions in humid conditions in all cases an rmse was found between 0 54 and 0 61 mm day 1 the analysis of the results between pm eto and pm eto vpd fao indicated that when ea data were estimated assuming tdew tmin to determine vpd the calculations had a very high performance in the altitudinal gradient the r2 values exceeded 0 96 and the br2 values exceeded 0 92 the lowest values of rmse 0 19 mm day 1 were supported by the high ce from 0 94 to 0 97 table 6 these outcomes corroborate the findings of the previous work of córdova et al 2015 who found that the eto calculation using vpd fao method had a rmse of 0 17 mm day 1 in toreadora despite the good performance the pm eto vpd fao calculation showed a slight tendency to overestimate low and medium values this finding broadly supports the work of other studies in humid conditions for example the work of sentelhas et al 2010 in canada and landeras et al 2008 in northern spain found the eto was overestimated when the vpd fao method was applied assuming tdew tmin to calculate ea when relative humidity data is missing also the study of garcia et al 2004 in the bolivian highlands showed the eto calculation with a rmse of 0 2 mm day 1 when rh data is missing and they used the vpd fao method to estimate the variable as reviewed before numerous studies assumed tdew tmin and reported good results of using eq 16 in humid conditions however it was also found in other studies carried out in a wide variety of climates that use a correction aridity index to improve the estimation of tdew such as tdew tmean ad for example todorovic et al 2013 and raziei and pereira 2013 in humid conditions the estimation of eto showed a rmse 0 36 and 0 19 mm day 1 higher than our results paredes et al 2017 in the humid conditions of azores islands also applied an adjustment in tdew estimations in this case the adjustment was for winter and summer season the results of eto showed a slight overestimation and a rmse between 0 48 and 0 15 mm day 1 paredes et al 2020 in their study showed that when they apply the correction in the estimation of tdew the eto calculation increases their performance with a rmse between 0 19 and 0 32 mm day 1 in all studies error increases for semi arid to hyper arid conditions as expected the largest error occurred when both rs ds and vpd fao were used to estimate pm eto instead of observations overall in the altitudinal gradient an increase in rmse 0 32 mm day 1 was observed and the over and under estimation of both variables was reflected in a ce between 0 66 and 0 79 the good correlation between observed and estimated values was reflected by r2 0 77 and br2 0 74 table 6 fig 6g h i these findings are consistent with those of landeras et al 2008 in northern spain and sentelhas et al 2010 in canada paredes et al 2020 in climate types humid sub humid semi arid and hyper arid and arid where the error increment on eto calculation when rs and rh data were missing in our study area the estimates of rs were less precise than vpd and these observations were also reflected on pm eto calculation the underestimation of high eto values that was found when estimating rs was also evident in the calculation of pm eto rs ds and vpd fao moreover the tendency to overestimate low and medium values shown on pm eto vpd fao calculation was also observed in the calculation of pm eto rs ds and vpd fao despite this over or under estimation the rmse was low 0 42 0 32 and 0 34 mm day 1 for chirimachay virgen and toreadora respectively compared to the results reported by córdova et al 2015 they found a rmse 0 71 mm day 1 in the toreadora site when rs and hr data were missing using the recommendations of hargreaves and samani 1982 and allen 1995 hence the calculation of eto with the pm method when rs and or vpd were missing and were estimated with the rs ds and vpd fao methods was reliable in our study area recent approaches have proposed an alternative solution to estimate eto when the weather data sets are not available using remotely sensed or reanalysis data for example paredes et al 2021 from a variety of climate conditions evaluated the usability of the lsa saf and era5 products provided by the meteosat second generation msg geostationary satellite for eto estimation the results of the comparison the rs lsa saf estimates with rs ground data showed a good correspondence between the two data sets for continental portugal but a tendency for rs lsa saf to underestimate the rs ground in the cloudy islands of the azores it was observed that eto calculated with data from rs lsa saf and observed t rh and u2 is strongly correlated with pm eto r2 0 97 for most places in continental portugal for most of the azores locations eto lsa saf overestimated pm eto the rs data from the era5 reanalysis showed a similar behavior to that of the lsa sa products ishak et al 2010 explored a potential application of reduced scale global reanalysis meteorological data using the mesoscale modeling system 5 mm5 the era 40 reanalysis data are downscaled to the brue catchment in southwest england when comparing with observed data the atmospheric pressure could be derived very precisely with an error less than 0 2 the error in u2 from 200 to 400 t 10 rh 5 21 and rs 4 23 the downscaling process improved data quality except u2 however eto values were significantly overestimated according to the fao penman monteith equation blanco et al 2015 developed a new approach that considers a modified version of the makkink equation and is based on a combination of remote sensing rs considering the msg satellite and a numerical weather forecast of near surface air temperature t2m the new approach provided accurate daily estimates of eto compared to lysimeter data rmse 0 50 mm d 1 in addition the approach allowed eto assessment on a regional scale it is especially useful for those areas with missing or meteorological in situ observations 5 conclusions the objective of this investigation was to assess the impact on pm eto calculation when solar radiation rs and or vapor pressure deficit vpd were missing in the high tropical andes humid páramo 3298 3955 m a s l here continuous high quality meteorological data are not available or time series are incomplete this study is the first in the region to evaluate nine methods to estimate rs and vpd based on daily maximum and minimum temperature and to evaluate their impact on pm eto calculation the first finding has shown that the calibration and validation of methods to calculate rs was essential to obtain more accurate rs estimations for this ecosystem thers ds method had the highest performance in our study area an rmse between 2 89 and 3 81 mj m 2 day 1 and r2 0 52 despite an underestimation of values above 19 mj m 2 day 1 the rs ds method seems to be a feasible approach to estimate the missing variable the second finding has shown that the vpd fao method had the highest performance out of the 4 methods evaluated to estimate vpd in all statistical indicators used rmse between 0 08 and 0 12 kpa and r2 0 76 therefore in the absence of rh observations the use of tdew tmin could be an excellent alternative to estimate ea in the páramo ecosystem with a slight overestimation for low and medium values finally the results of this investigation showed that because of the fact that we properly estimated rs and vpd the calculation of pm eto presented good statistical indicators when only rs is missing pm eto had an rmse between 0 29 and 0 34 mm day 1 and r2 0 82 when only vpd is missing pm eto had an rmse between 0 12 and 0 18 mm day 1 and r2 0 96 as expected when both variables were missing the eto calculation increased its error an rmse between 0 32 and 0 42 mm day 1 and r2 0 77 we conclude that the calculation of eto with the pm method when rs and or vpd were missing and were estimated with the rs ds and vpd fao methods was reliable in our area results obtained in the current study have shown that the calibration of equations to estimate missing variables rs and or rh provides a solution to calculate reliable pm eto in the páramo ecosystem when aiming at improved water productivity for domestic and industrial uses irrigated agriculture and hydropower moreover the procedures herein assessed can be used for other humid locations considering that the adjustment coefficients should be locally calibrated

9704,the computation of the reference crop evapotranspiration eto using the fao56 penman monteith equation pm eto requires data on maximum and minimum air temperatures tmax tmin relative humidity rh solar radiation rs and wind speed u2 however the records of meteorological variables are often incomplete or of poor quality frequently in the mountain areas such as those of the andes environmental sensors are subject to harsh conditions due to the diurnal nocturnal climatic variability causing challenging conditions for meteorological monitoring which leads to data loss for high elevation landscapes like the andes the missing variables of vapor pressure deficit and solar radiation cause a high impact on pm eto calculation to assess these limitations several methods relying on maximum and minimum temperature to estimate the missing variables have been considered in the present investigation based on data from three automatic weather stations in the high tropical andes humid páramo 3298 3955 m a s l we found that the calibration and validation of methods were essential to estimate rs using the de jong and stewart 1993 rs ds method we retrieved the highest performance a rmse between 2 89 and 3 81 mj m 2 day 1 moreover in the absence of rh observations replacing the dew point temperature tdew by tmin was a reliable alternative when apply the method of allen et al 1998 vpd fao which showed the highest performance with rmse between 0 08 and 0 12 kpa these results yielded highly accurate pm eto estimates with rmse between 0 29 and 0 34 mm day 1 and rmse between 0 12 and 0 18 mm day 1 respectively as expected when both variables were missing the eto calculation increased its error with an rmse between 0 32 and 0 42 mm day 1 a proper estimation of eto in the andean páramo contributes to improved water productivity for domestic and industrial uses irrigated agriculture and hydropower keywords páramo pm eto solar radiation vapor pressure deficit calibration 1 introduction the páramo is the most important ecosystem in the high tropical andes for water resources supply hofstede et al 2014 the andean páramo covers over 30 000 km2 of northern south america wright et al 2018 it is the primary water source for communities located near this ecosystem which include major cities in colombia ecuador and perú buytaert et al 2006 its vegetation consists mainly of tussock grasses cushion plants and patches of woody species such as polylepis sp and gynoxys sp that occur only in sheltered locations and along water streams buytaert et al 2006 this ecosystem serves as a sponge that captures precipitation stores and releases the water gradually to the surrounding areas llambí et al 2012 producing a sustained streamflow during the year this water resource is intensively used for irrigated agriculture industry rural and urban drinking water systems hydro power production and for sustaining aquatic ecosystems célleri and feyen 2009 llambí et al 2012 particularly an important economic function of water in andean ecosystems is to irrigate agriculture in downstream areas at present irrigation represents 71 2 which becomes the activity that consumes the most flow in our country compromising almost all of the water sources located in high altitude areas for irrigation ministerio de agricultura y ganadería et al 2019 although evapotranspiration may not be a limiting factor for water use in cold and humid regions the increasing demand for water resources due to population growth urbanization and irrigated agriculture require a reliable estimate of evapotranspiration to improve the yield and water productivity a common approach for calculating evapotranspiration is the estimation of eto which is the most useful for countless scientific and management applications such as water balance studies at different scales evaluation of water resources and development of watershed management plans likewise eto plays a key role in crop water irrigation planning and management as well as in studies related to the analysis of climate change and water conservation paredes et al 2020 2017 todorovic et al 2013 according to the food and agriculture organization fao56 allen et al 1998 the penman monteith equation pm is the most recommended method to determine eto this method is a global standard based on meteorological data allen et al 1998 and their applications all over the world have been quite successful jabloun and sahli 2008 ochoa sánchez et al 2019 paredes et al 2020 2017 paredes and pereira 2019 todorovic et al 2013 the major limitation of the penman monteith equation reported in many studies is the requirement of meteorological variables air temperature relative humidity solar radiation and wind speed that are often incomplete or of poor quality córdova et al 2015 da silva et al 2018 karimi et al 2020 paredes and pereira 2019 santos et al 2020 sentelhas et al 2010 tomas burguera et al 2017 this usually happens when a sensor breaks or malfunctions e g due to weather conditions lack of maintenance or electronic failure frequently in the mountain areas like the andes sensors are subject to harsh environmental conditions due to the high climatic variability during the day causing challenging environmental conditions for meteorological monitoring which leads to data loss accordingly the application of pm faces the problem of data unavailability research has developed a variety of tools and procedures to overcome the unavailability of data by using empirical equations most of them relying on maximum and minimum temperature for instance the procedures by hargreaves and samani 1982 the equations proposed in fao56 allen et al 1998 the equations by castellví et al 1997 among others however these methods require local calibrations to obtain satisfactory performances as several studies have shown in various climate types ranging from hyper arid to humid karimi et al 2020 paredes et al 2017 raziei and pereira 2013 ren et al 2016 todorovic et al 2013 the approach of these studies was the calibration of the krs coefficient of the hargreaves and samani 1982 method to estimate solar radiation when the variable was missing and a correction in the minimum temperature to estimate actual vapor pressure in the absence of relative humidity data in all cases their results showed that the pm eto method had greater precision in both arid and humid climates when missing data was estimated however todorovic et al 2013 found that for good eto performance the correction applied in the minimum temperature was only necessary for hyper arid arid semi arid and dry subhumid climates and not for humid conditions moreover ren et al 2016 found that the calibrated coefficient of the method to estimate solar radiation varied with climatic aridity the errors of estimates were higher when the range of variation of eto was higher which occurred more often for hyper arid and arid climates contrarily to sub humid locations in addition karimi et al 2020 also found that the effect of using estimated values of solar radiation on pm eto calculation caused greater error than using estimated values of wind speed unlike the most common methods reviewed above in various studies a large number of empirical methods are compared to estimate the missing variables bandyopadhyay et al 2008 besharat et al 2013 jabloun and sahli 2008 li et al 2013 tabari et al 2016 however there is a shortage of information for high elevation landscapes like the andes contrary to the information available in low and arid areas using daily data recorded from eight weather stations in north africa tunisia jabloun and sahli 2008 evaluated the performance of the pm eto method with limited data and revealed that estimating solar radiation with allen 1995 method that takes into account the elevation effects on the volumetric heat capacity of the atmosphere it gave accurate estimates of eto in all the studied regions furthermore the use of minimum temperature was a good alternative when relative humidity measurements were lacking the use of the mean annual wind speed of the location led to acceptable eto estimates especially for high eto rates under cool arid and semi arid conditions in iran tabari et al 2016 estimated solar radiation using 12 models and then compared daily pm eto values derived from both measured and estimated solar radiation the results indicated that using estimated rs the pm eto method performed well for semi arid and arid climates in cold conditions the pm eto accuracy decreased despite the calibration of the models there are also others alternatives to estimate meteorological variables such us using satellite geostatistical interpolation or machine learning a complete review of this applications for eto estimation is beyond the scope of this paper thus some relevant studies will be reviewed here silva et al 2010 evaluated the use of mesoscale model results as proxy for weather variables in places where there are no meteorological stations and found that is the most effective method to generate estimates of eto feng et al 2019 in temperate continental regions of china compared different machine learning and empirical models for global solar radiation prediction only using air temperature as inputs the results indicated the hybrid mind evolutionary algorithm and artificial neural network model provided better estimations compared with the existing machine learning and empirical models qadeer et al 2021 applied the random forest rf approach to estimate the relative humidity as a function of dry and wet bulb temperatures the rf model has sufficient potential to estimate rh however the prediction performance of the rf model strongly depends on both the quantity and quality of the training data berndt and haberlandt 2018 investigated the performance of different interpolation techniques for various climate variables observed by weather stations in northern germany they found that the influences of temporal resolution and spatial variability appear to be higher than the influence of station density the best estimation accuracy is achieved for relative humidity and temperature due to the consideration of the dem and the low spatial variability jeong et al 2017 compared geostatistical interpolation and stochastic simulation approaches for the estimation of daily solar radiation located across southern canada the three geostatistical interpolation models yield better performances at stations located in a high density area of solar radiation measuring stations compared to the three stochastic simulation models there is only one previous study that examined the impact of missing meteorological variables on pm eto calculation in the high tropical andes córdova et al 2015 evaluated the pm eto equation with limited data using meteorological variables of two weather stations in the high tropical andes ecuador and found that the maximum error in eto calculations was observed when solar radiation and relative humidity were missing while wind speed had a much lower impact finally they concluded that there is an urgent need for the development of alternative methods in these sites to estimate accurate values for missing variables there is a knowledge gap to estimate the missing variables and this makes pm eto subject to high uncertainty thus the first step to achieving this is to develop or calibrate equations to estimate the missing variables and then evaluate its impact on pm eto therefore the main goal of this article is to accurately estimate eto when weather variables are lacking using pm method the specific objectives of this study are a to calibrate and validate methods to estimate rs from temperature data and to determine the method with the highest performance b to evaluate the performance of methods to estimate vapor pressure deficit vpd from temperature data and to determine the method with the highest efficiency and c to evaluate the impact on pm eto calculation when rs and or vpd are missing and these variables are estimated with the methods found in a and b in a páramo ecosystem 2 study area and data in the tropical andes of southern ecuador the headwater catchment of quinoas covers an area of about 94 1 km2 and an elevation range of 3150 4425

coincide with those reported by córdova et al 2015 and carrillo rojas et al 2016 in the same study site meteorological data were collected along an altitudinal gradient 3298 3955 m a s l during the six year period 2014 2019 from three automatic weather stations awss chirimachay virgen del cajas hereafter denoted as virgen and toreadora the climate is classified as cfc according to the köppen geiger categories kottek et al 2006 warm temperate climate fully humid with cool summer and cold winter in the three sites humid conditions were identified for the study area according to the aridity index the aridity index was calculated using the methodology of padilla et al 2011 which resulted from the ratios obtained by dividing rainfall by potential evapotranspiration these indices were subsequently reclassified using the aridity classes proposed by unep 1992 the values were 1 6 1 3 1 5 for chirimachay virgen and toreador respectively the sites approached a reference eto station an extensive surface of green well watered grass of uniform height actively growing and shading the ground all measurements were made at 2 m above ground level each station recorded data at a 5 minute frequency for average temperature tavg tmax tmin average relative humidity rhavg maximum relative humidity hrmax minimum relative humidity hrmin u2 and rs the values were aggregated on a daily scale due to the presence of gaps in the database preprocessing was performed excluding days with missing data the amount of missing data was 3 7 2 5 and 6 8 for chirimachay virgen and toreadora awss respectively in addition data integrity was evaluated using guidelines suggested by allen et al 1998 these criteria included comparing measured solar radiation to theoretical solar radiation during clear sky periods and comparing daily average dew point temperature or rhmax with minimum daily air temperature in our case we compared with rhmax data the sensors used in the study are described in table a1 appendix a 3 methods we followed the flowchart presented in fig 2 first to estimate rs section 3 1 we selected five different methods based on air temperature these methods have adjustment coefficients that were calibrated and validated in order to obtain satisfactory performances prior to calibration we performed a data preprocessing to capture all the temperature variability in the calibration and validation datasets then we evaluated the ability of each method to simulate rs in order to select the method with the best performance second to estimate the vpd section 3 2 we selected four different methods also based on air temperature then we evaluated the ability of each method to estimate vpd in order to select the method with the best performance finally with the methods selected previously we evaluated the impact of rs and vpd estimation on pm eto calculation section 3 3 the methodological details are explained in the following subsections 3 1 estimation of solar radiation 3 1 1 methods to estimate rs hargreaves and samani 1982 hereafter denoted as rs hs recommended a method to estimate solar radiation using the difference between the maximum and minimum temperature this is related to the degree of cloud cover in a given location 1 r s k rs t max t min r a where k rs is an adjustment coefficient the authors recommended k rs values from 0 16 to 0 19 0

is an adjustment coefficient having values in the 0 17 0 20 range with values of 0 17 for inland regions and 0 20 for coastal regions and p is the mean atmospheric pressure of the site kpa p o is the mean atmospheric pressure at sea level 101 3 kpa 9 p p 0 293 0 0065 z 293 5 26 where z is the elevation m a s l of the site vanderlinden et al 2004 hereafter denoted as rs va found a relationship

details of coefficients used by the authors 3 1 2 data preprocessing to avoid a bias in the selection of the samples for calibration and validation we performed a data preprocessing a duration curve was made for tmax tmin this variable serves as input for the aforementioned methods for each weather station fig 3 this analysis was made because in preliminary calculations random samples containing a disproportionately large percentage of high or low values caused a biased calibration of the methods not shown the curves showed inflection points around the 20th and the 90th percentiles in the three stations limits indicated by the solid vertical lines in fig 3 which were set as the limits for the different groups of data therefore the data was split into three sets high values 20 medium values 20 and 90 and low values 90 fig 3 this data classification was subsequently used for assembling the groups for the calibration and validation processes section 3 1 3 3 1 3 calibration and validation of rs estimation methods a model performs better when calibration is performed with a large dataset enough to contain a wide range of weather conditions motavita et al 2019 perrin et al 2007 xia et al 2004 motavita et al 2019 also mentioned that in the calibration and validation datasets must contain a wide range of the variability bennett et al 2013 suggested randomizing the division of data so that the model performance is not biased by the allocation of data following these recommendations we took the first 4 years of data for calibration and validation 2014 2017 and took 70 of the data for calibration while 30 was left for validation the calibration and validation samples were taken randomly but considering that each subset must fit the distribution criteria described in section 3 1 2 20 of high values 70 of medium values and 10 of low values in order to find a general method for the ecosystem calibration was performed for the entire altitudinal gradient by analyzing all data from the three weather stations combined as the methodology of de jong and stewart 1993 applied in their study the monte carlo method was used to select the optimal coefficients after performing 5000 simulations to calibrate each method as a reference we started using the standard ranges of variation table a2 appendix a after previous calculations we established our own ranges of variation because the ranges were widened or shortened table a3 appendix a moreover we validated each calibrated method with data independent of the calibration after running the calibration and validation for the altitudinal gradient we applied the calibrated equations to the data set of each station using only 30 of validation data as stated in section 3 1 3 3 2 methods to estimate vpd vapor pressure deficit is estimated as the difference between the saturation vapor pressure e s and the actual vapor pressure e a 12 vpd e s e a where e s is calculated as 13 e s e t max e t min 2 and when relative humidity data is available e a is calculated as 14 e a e t min rh max 100 e t min rh min 100 2 where e t is the saturation vapor pressure kpa and t max and t min are the maximum and minimum daily temperature c and rh max and rh min are the maximum and minimum daily relative humidity e t for air temperature t is 15 e t 0 6108 exp 17 27 t t 237 3 in the absence of humidity data we evaluated four different methods based on air temperature to estimate the daily vpd using four years of data 2014 2017 in fao56 allen et al 1998 hereafter denoted as vpd fao stated that e a may be obtained by assuming that the dewpoint temperature t dew is close to the t min the t dew is usually experienced at sunrise in reference weather stations in our study we do not have measures of t dew therefore we used t min to estimate e a due to the high humidity in our study area the rh reaches 100 most of the night time hours we found that using t min between 05h00 and 08h00 to calculate e a yielded better results than using absolute daily t min 16 e a e t dew 0 6108 exp 17 27 t dew t dew 237 3 doorenbos and pruitt 1977 hereafter denoted as vpd dp proposed the following method to estimate vpd 17 vpd e t avg e t dew where e t avg is the saturation vapor pressure at the mean daily temperature castellví et al 1997 hereafter denoted as vpd ca1 proposed the following method to estimate vpd 18 vpd e t a e t dew where t a defined as the temperature that leaves equal areas under the curve e t e t dew between t max and t min using the trapezoidal method for more detail review the research of castellví et al 1997 castellví et al 1997 hereafter denoted as vpd ca2 proposed the following method to estimate the mean relative humidity 19 rh avg 100 e t dew 1 2 e t a e t avg then we calculated e a as proposed fao56 allen et al 1998 20 e a rh avg 100 e t avg 3 3 impact of rs and vpd estimation on pm eto calculation we used two years of complete data 2018 2019 to calculate pm eto then we generated missing data scenarios by removing rs or and vpd values and evaluated the impact on pm eto calculation when these variables were estimated using the selected equations previously the pm eto method defined by allen et al 1998 for calculating reference evapotranspiration of a hypothetical crop having a height of 0 12 m a surface resistance of 70 s m 1 and an albedo of 0 23 is 21 pm et o 0 408 r n g y 900 t avg 273 u 2 e s e a y 1 0 34 u 2 where r n is the net radiation at the crop surface mj m 2 day 1 g is the soil heat flux density mj m 2 day 1 t avg at 2 m c u 2 is the wind speed at 2 m m s 1 e s is the saturation vapor pressure kpa e a is the real vapor pressure kpa e s e a is the vapor pressure deficit kpa is the slope of the vapor pressure curve kpa c 1 and y is the psychrometric constant kpa c 1 for daily computations g equals zero as the magnitude of daily soil heat flux beneath the grass reference surface is very small allen et al 1998 3 4 evaluation criteria the statistical indices used to evaluate the methods performance were i the nash sutcliffe efficiency ce which has been widely used to evaluate the performance of empirical models and it is sensitive to differences in the observed and simulated means and variances ii the coefficient of determination r 2 which describes how much of the observed dispersion is explained by the prediction iii the coefficient of determination multiplied by the slope b br 2 a model which systematically over or underpredicts all the time will still result in good r2 values close to 1 0 even if all predictions were wrong therefore is advisable to take into account additional information which can cope with that problem this information is provided by the slope b and as long as b is close to one is better and iv the root mean square error rmse which is a weighted measure of the error in which the largest deviations between the observed and modeled values contribute the most table a4 appendix a to evaluate the quality of the pm eto calculations when one or two variables were missing we used the same statistical indices 4 results and discussion 4 1 estimation of solar radiation to estimate solar radiation we used a period data 2014 2017 in the absence of rs observations this variable was estimated using methods based on air temperature with locally calibrated adjustment coefficients eqs 1 11 table 2 shows the coefficients and statistical indicators of the calibration of the methods to estimate rs when we combined the data from the three stations to calibrate the methods and to select the best method for the gradient it was found that the adjustment coefficients of each method varied from their original values in a global context the difference of the coefficients is related to the different climatic regions where the methods have been developed and tested these methods have been mostly applied in arid and semi arid regions and to a lesser degree in humid regions in the available literature in sub humid and humid regions it was found that to estimate rs the authors commonly use the recommendations of allen 1995 and hargreaves and samani 1982 with a local calibration of the krs coefficient jabloun and sahli 2008 paredes et al 2020 2017 paredes and pereira 2019 in such studies the values of krs coefficient were higher for both methods rs hs and rs al compared to the krs values in our study area the variability of the coefficients is influenced by the change in the diurnal temperature range dtr where the dtr decreases as altitude increases as confirmed by córdova et al 2015 for our study area liu et al 2009 found that a increases as altitude increases and the dtr decreases and the opposite was found for b it decreases as altitude increases and the dtr decreases this relation between the coefficients for this method and altitude was also found by li et al 2013 the rs ch method showed values in the range of 0 16 0 42 coefficient a and 0 45 0 12 coefficient b in the north china plain chen et al 2004 in our case the calibration had lower values but with similar behavior at higher altitudes the coefficient a increases and the coefficient b decreases the rs va method showed average values of 0 0030 and 0 0022 for the coefficients a and b respectively in southern spain vanderlinden et al 2004 while we found higher values in our study in the rs ds method the values of the coefficients a 0 127 b 0 599 c 0 028 and d 0 0003 reported in western canada de jong and stewart 1993 were similar to our values except by the coefficient a that was greater for a detailed comparison of coefficients see table 2 the table shows that the changes in the coefficients of the five methods are study area dependent due to the use of local data bases the methods that use dtr as input rs hs rs al rs va and rs ch had similar performance showing a rmse in the range from 3 58 to 3 73 mj m 2 day 1 a ce from 0 42 to 0 47 and r2 and br2 values from 0 47 to 51 and from 0 43 to 0 47 respectively whereas the rs ds method that used t and the effect of precipitation eqs 6 7 yielded better estimations than the other methods with higher values of ce r2 and br2 and a lower value of rmse table 2 especially in humid regions the use of precipitation has a considerable effect on solar radiation reducing the solar transmissivity due to the presence of cloud table 3 presents the results of the validation for the methods in the altitudinal gradient it was observed that the performance of the rs hs rs al rs va and rs ch methods was similar to the calibration performance and it was confirmed that rs ds method is the highest performing one once the methods were calibrated for the gradient we evaluated them using the data from each station individually the scatter plot for chirimachay fig 4a d g j m showed high dispersion and slight overestimation for rs below 15 mj m 2 day 1 this was reflected in a slight increase in rmse and a lower ce compared to the results obtained for the entire gradient moreover the rs ds and rs al methods showed the best results a lower rmse and a higher ce r2 and br2 however these results did not differ greatly from the performance of the rest of the methods at the site table 4 we found that virgen had the best adjustment to the observed values in all the methods in comparison to the other sites and the method with the best performance was rs ds table 4 fig 4b e h k n in toreadora the ce presented the lowest values compared to the other sites for all the methods except for rs ds this method showed the best performance to estimate rs at the site table 4 at the virgen site where the methods showed the best results we hypothesize that this could be because of two reasons firstly the methods for estimating eto were mainly developed in arid and semiarid regions thus the site with the lowest rh which is virgen might show the best results and secondly the more stable boundary layer in virgen related to the local relatively flatter topography of the site provides the conditions for air temperature to be more related to rs compared to the other sites which in the end will yield better results when rs is estimated from temperature measurements in addition we found that the ability of the methods to estimate rs is affected by elevation because there is a major incidence of solar radiation in high areas but such effect on the temperature is low this is due to the fact that only a small fraction of rs is absorbed by the thinner atmosphere of these high elevation sites llambí et al 2012 this means that the incoming rs does not heat up and this is reflected in the underestimation of high values of rs therefore at the highest site toreadora the highest values of rs resulted in the lowest accuracy br2 0 51 in all methods compared to the other sites at this location the methods that used dtr rs hs rs al rs va and rs ch estimated rs values up to 15 mj m 2 day 1 80 of data and the rs ds method which uses t and the effect of precipitation estimated rs values up to 19 mj m 2 day 1 90 of data while for the chirimachay and virgen sites the rs hs rs al rs va and rs ch methods presented difficulty in estimating rs 17 mj m 2 day 1 12 86 of data and the rs ds method estimated rs values up to 21 mj m 2 day 1 93 24 of data fig 4 the performance of the methods based on temperature increases as dtr increases allen 1997 li et al 2014 samani 2000 therefore this performance decreases with the altitude because dtr is reduced evidently our results agree with this elevation effect that causes dtr to decrease in the highest site this finding is also consistent with the results presented by paredes et al 2017 in sites with higher elevation the dtr was lower and the extreme values were not well estimated as well as li et al 2014 in china and bandyopadhyay et al 2008 in india who reported the failure of these methods for high elevation stations both studies estimated monthly solar radiation 4 2 estimation of vapor pressure deficit to estimate vapor pressure deficit we used a period data 2014 2017 table 5 summarizes the statistical indicators of the methods applied to estimate daily vpd it was found that in the gradient the rmse was in the range from 0 08 to 0 30 kpa the ce with values between 0 24 and 0 63 the r2 with values between 0 55 a 0 81 and br2 from 0 35 to 0 71 the vpd fao method had the highest performance in most of the statistical indicators but also showed a slight overestimation for low and medium values in addition an underestimation of low values was found using the vpd dp vpd ca1 and vpd ca2 methods in chirimachay and an overestimation of medium values by the vpd ca1 and vpd ca2 methods in virgen and toreadora fig 5 to find the best method for the gradient we analyzed the statistics site by site in chirimachay the vpd fao method had the best performance with the highest r2 and br2 and a low rmse 0 12 kpa in virgen and toreadora the vpd fao method had the lowest rmse with values of 0 08 and 0 09 kpa respectively the other statistical results confirmed that the vpd fao method had the highest performance table 5 therefore we conclude that the vpd fao method is the most suitable method to estimate vpd in the altitudinal gradient however the overestimation presented by this approach has also been found in other studies performed in humid climates landeras et al 2008 paredes et al 2017 todorovic et al 2013 tomas burguera et al 2017 this could be due to the fact that tdew tmin in sub humid and humid climates paredes et al 2017 todorovic et al 2013 hence by assuming tdew tmin ea is being underestimated and therefore vpd is overestimated in fact a previous analysis showed that when we took the daily minimum temperature the overestimation was 0 04 kpa per day greater than the current one to decrease this overestimation we took the minimum temperature at sunrise 05h00 08h00 to get closer to the actual value of tdew 4 3 estimation of daily eto when rs and or vpd are missing period 2018 2019 table 6 shows the statistical performance of the pm eto calculation when rs and or vpd were missing and were estimated with the best methods selected for the altitudinal gradient it was found that the pm eto calculation results were worse when the missing variable was rs while when vpd data were missing the pm eto estimates were closer to the pm eto values calculated with the complete data set this is evident in all statistical indicators with the lowest rmse and the highest ce r2 and br2 as expected the largest error occurred when data for two variables were missing and their values were estimated table 6 the site by site analysis showed that the high eto values were underestimated in chirimachay virgen and toreadora and only in chirimachay a slight overestimation of the lower values existed on pm eto calculation with estimated rs this behavior is well explained by the relationships between rs ds and observed rs above previously analyzed fig 4a o the estimated values of pm eto rs ds were better than rs ds estimates the good relationship between pm eto and pm eto rs ds is highlighted in fig 6a c and table 6 with r2 0 82 and br2 78 in the three sites moreover the rmse values were below 0 34 mm day 1 and the highest performance was found in toreadora table 6 fig 6c the novelty of our results lies in the fact that limited information is available on this topic for humid conditions and there is only one previous study which preliminary explored the topic in the high tropical andes córdova et al 2015 such investigation concluded that for the pm eto calculation the observations of rs are extremely important in this area because when this variable was missing and it was estimated without local calibration the eto yielded the maximum error rmse of 0 53 mm day 1 in contrast our results showed a decrease in the rmse to 0 27 mm day 1 after selecting the best method to estimate rs in this zone the research of souza et al 2016 had similar findings in humid conditions in the mato grosso state among the methods used to estimate rs the method proposed by de jong and stewart 1993 resulted in the lowest rmse on pm eto calculations previous studies developed under humid conditions have reported an underestimation of high values and a slight overestimation of low values on eto calculation when rs was estimated in this case using the method of hargreaves and samani 1982 with the locally calibrated krs coefficient paredes et al 2017 paredes and pereira 2019 paredes et al 2020 in their study computed krs using a trial and error procedure and krs as a function of tmax tmin rh and u2 in a global equation and equations focused on climatic conditions in humid conditions in all cases an rmse was found between 0 54 and 0 61 mm day 1 the analysis of the results between pm eto and pm eto vpd fao indicated that when ea data were estimated assuming tdew tmin to determine vpd the calculations had a very high performance in the altitudinal gradient the r2 values exceeded 0 96 and the br2 values exceeded 0 92 the lowest values of rmse 0 19 mm day 1 were supported by the high ce from 0 94 to 0 97 table 6 these outcomes corroborate the findings of the previous work of córdova et al 2015 who found that the eto calculation using vpd fao method had a rmse of 0 17 mm day 1 in toreadora despite the good performance the pm eto vpd fao calculation showed a slight tendency to overestimate low and medium values this finding broadly supports the work of other studies in humid conditions for example the work of sentelhas et al 2010 in canada and landeras et al 2008 in northern spain found the eto was overestimated when the vpd fao method was applied assuming tdew tmin to calculate ea when relative humidity data is missing also the study of garcia et al 2004 in the bolivian highlands showed the eto calculation with a rmse of 0 2 mm day 1 when rh data is missing and they used the vpd fao method to estimate the variable as reviewed before numerous studies assumed tdew tmin and reported good results of using eq 16 in humid conditions however it was also found in other studies carried out in a wide variety of climates that use a correction aridity index to improve the estimation of tdew such as tdew tmean ad for example todorovic et al 2013 and raziei and pereira 2013 in humid conditions the estimation of eto showed a rmse 0 36 and 0 19 mm day 1 higher than our results paredes et al 2017 in the humid conditions of azores islands also applied an adjustment in tdew estimations in this case the adjustment was for winter and summer season the results of eto showed a slight overestimation and a rmse between 0 48 and 0 15 mm day 1 paredes et al 2020 in their study showed that when they apply the correction in the estimation of tdew the eto calculation increases their performance with a rmse between 0 19 and 0 32 mm day 1 in all studies error increases for semi arid to hyper arid conditions as expected the largest error occurred when both rs ds and vpd fao were used to estimate pm eto instead of observations overall in the altitudinal gradient an increase in rmse 0 32 mm day 1 was observed and the over and under estimation of both variables was reflected in a ce between 0 66 and 0 79 the good correlation between observed and estimated values was reflected by r2 0 77 and br2 0 74 table 6 fig 6g h i these findings are consistent with those of landeras et al 2008 in northern spain and sentelhas et al 2010 in canada paredes et al 2020 in climate types humid sub humid semi arid and hyper arid and arid where the error increment on eto calculation when rs and rh data were missing in our study area the estimates of rs were less precise than vpd and these observations were also reflected on pm eto calculation the underestimation of high eto values that was found when estimating rs was also evident in the calculation of pm eto rs ds and vpd fao moreover the tendency to overestimate low and medium values shown on pm eto vpd fao calculation was also observed in the calculation of pm eto rs ds and vpd fao despite this over or under estimation the rmse was low 0 42 0 32 and 0 34 mm day 1 for chirimachay virgen and toreadora respectively compared to the results reported by córdova et al 2015 they found a rmse 0 71 mm day 1 in the toreadora site when rs and hr data were missing using the recommendations of hargreaves and samani 1982 and allen 1995 hence the calculation of eto with the pm method when rs and or vpd were missing and were estimated with the rs ds and vpd fao methods was reliable in our study area recent approaches have proposed an alternative solution to estimate eto when the weather data sets are not available using remotely sensed or reanalysis data for example paredes et al 2021 from a variety of climate conditions evaluated the usability of the lsa saf and era5 products provided by the meteosat second generation msg geostationary satellite for eto estimation the results of the comparison the rs lsa saf estimates with rs ground data showed a good correspondence between the two data sets for continental portugal but a tendency for rs lsa saf to underestimate the rs ground in the cloudy islands of the azores it was observed that eto calculated with data from rs lsa saf and observed t rh and u2 is strongly correlated with pm eto r2 0 97 for most places in continental portugal for most of the azores locations eto lsa saf overestimated pm eto the rs data from the era5 reanalysis showed a similar behavior to that of the lsa sa products ishak et al 2010 explored a potential application of reduced scale global reanalysis meteorological data using the mesoscale modeling system 5 mm5 the era 40 reanalysis data are downscaled to the brue catchment in southwest england when comparing with observed data the atmospheric pressure could be derived very precisely with an error less than 0 2 the error in u2 from 200 to 400 t 10 rh 5 21 and rs 4 23 the downscaling process improved data quality except u2 however eto values were significantly overestimated according to the fao penman monteith equation blanco et al 2015 developed a new approach that considers a modified version of the makkink equation and is based on a combination of remote sensing rs considering the msg satellite and a numerical weather forecast of near surface air temperature t2m the new approach provided accurate daily estimates of eto compared to lysimeter data rmse 0 50 mm d 1 in addition the approach allowed eto assessment on a regional scale it is especially useful for those areas with missing or meteorological in situ observations 5 conclusions the objective of this investigation was to assess the impact on pm eto calculation when solar radiation rs and or vapor pressure deficit vpd were missing in the high tropical andes humid páramo 3298 3955 m a s l here continuous high quality meteorological data are not available or time series are incomplete this study is the first in the region to evaluate nine methods to estimate rs and vpd based on daily maximum and minimum temperature and to evaluate their impact on pm eto calculation the first finding has shown that the calibration and validation of methods to calculate rs was essential to obtain more accurate rs estimations for this ecosystem thers ds method had the highest performance in our study area an rmse between 2 89 and 3 81 mj m 2 day 1 and r2 0 52 despite an underestimation of values above 19 mj m 2 day 1 the rs ds method seems to be a feasible approach to estimate the missing variable the second finding has shown that the vpd fao method had the highest performance out of the 4 methods evaluated to estimate vpd in all statistical indicators used rmse between 0 08 and 0 12 kpa and r2 0 76 therefore in the absence of rh observations the use of tdew tmin could be an excellent alternative to estimate ea in the páramo ecosystem with a slight overestimation for low and medium values finally the results of this investigation showed that because of the fact that we properly estimated rs and vpd the calculation of pm eto presented good statistical indicators when only rs is missing pm eto had an rmse between 0 29 and 0 34 mm day 1 and r2 0 82 when only vpd is missing pm eto had an rmse between 0 12 and 0 18 mm day 1 and r2 0 96 as expected when both variables were missing the eto calculation increased its error an rmse between 0 32 and 0 42 mm day 1 and r2 0 77 we conclude that the calculation of eto with the pm method when rs and or vpd were missing and were estimated with the rs ds and vpd fao methods was reliable in our area results obtained in the current study have shown that the calibration of equations to estimate missing variables rs and or rh provides a solution to calculate reliable pm eto in the páramo ecosystem when aiming at improved water productivity for domestic and industrial uses irrigated agriculture and hydropower moreover the procedures herein assessed can be used for other humid locations considering that the adjustment coefficients should be locally calibrated
