24200,the endangered ganges river dolphin is a flagship species that inhabits the ganges brahmaputra meghna and karnaphuli sangu river systems exposed to a multitude of environmental stresses and anthropogenic perturbations the species has experienced severe population decline and shrinking of potential habitat in much of its distribution range a range wide mapping of its potential habitat and assessment of factors associated with species occurrence therefore bears immense relevance for conservation planning we used an ensemble of species distribution models sdm using occurrence data to investigate dolphin distribution in relation to hydrological climatic physiographic land cover and anthropogenic variables across the species entire range we followed a systematic prioritization approach to identify highly suitable habitat patches potential hotspots for dolphins that require immediate protection we identified nearly 7945 sq km of river area as highly suitable for dolphins as habitat refugia for the species more than 93 of which are outside the protected area regime thus demanding immediate conservation attention this study is a step towards delivering evidence required for spatial risk assessments and conservation planning wherein the habitat suitability maps will help in developing better management plans and strategies and the predicted three tier classification of suitable habitats will facilitate decision making and prioritization of river segments for inclusion in the protected area network we recommend that the inferences drawn from our study must be implemented on priority to ensure species conservation in the riverscape besides our study provides huge scope for fine scale assessment and validation of the predicted suitable areas for model improvement keywords conservation planning distribution ensemble modeling environmental variables ganges river dolphin hotspot areas data availability links to data shared 1 introduction freshwater cetaceans inhabiting some of the major human dominated river systems across asia and south america are among the world s most threatened groups of mammals kelkar et al 2022 mostly listed as endangered on the iucn red list these species have experienced drastic decline in numbers and shrinking of their distribution ranges kelkar et al 2022 their occurrence and distribution have been associated with a number of abiotic and biotic factors including flow regime prey fish abundance and other hydro physiographic parameters martin et al 2004 smith et al 2009 bashir et al 2010 2012 gómez salazar et al 2012 human activities in cetacean habitats have also been suggested to alter their behavior movement pattern and resource use eventually influencing the species distribution patterns bashir et al 2013 paudel and koprowski 2020 information on how different environmental and anthropogenic factors affect species distribution can therefore help in understanding their ecological affinities and spatial conservation planning guisan and thuiller 2005 passadore et al 2018 considering the prevailing threats and range contractions faced by these species identification and prioritization of critical habitats for species presence and those requiring immediate attention elith and leathwick 2009 guisan et al 2013 passadore et al 2018 seems prerequisite to benefit species conservation cetacean distributions have often been described as a composite outcome of evolutionary ecological demographic anthropogenic and habitat related factors kuit et al 2019 hydrological characteristics such as water depth direction and velocity of flow water quality temperature sediment load and hydro morphological features including channel width and availability of confluence areas have been reported to play a critical role in determining habitat preferences and the overall distribution of riverine cetaceans smith et al 1998 choudhary et al 2006 2008 bashir et al 2010 dares et al 2014 ferro et al 2015 seasonal fluctuations in the river flow particularly during low water conditions have markedly influenced the habitat use of cetaceans by directly affecting in stream attributes such as water depth as well as the distribution and abundance of their preferred prey fish species aggarwal et al 2020 paudel et al 2021 such effects are aggravated by human induced perturbations in the flow regime through water development projects such as dams barrages water abstractions and other embankments reeves and leatherwood 1994 the escalating human footprint on rivers mainly in the form of fisheries and the resultant cetacean fisheries interactions are known to further affect their use of optimal habitats thereby increasing the risks to species survival read 2008 kelkar et al 2010 paudel et al 2016 moreover climatic factors such as air temperature and precipitation by their fundamental associations with water temperature and other hydrological parameters e g volume of stream flows also influence species distributions in streams and riverine ecosystems coutant 1977 poff and allan 1995 poff et al 1997 pilgrim et al 1998 erickson and stefan 2000 although the information on in stream habitat variables such as water temperature is considered essential for predicting species distribution and habitat suitability such data is unavailable for most tropical river systems of the world dudgeon 2000 mcgarvey et al 2018 and generating the same for a range wide assessment seems cumbersome and logistically challenging recent studies in river ecosystems have however established the use of climatic variables as surrogate measures of in stream conditions e g air temperature for water temperature to generate reliable predictions on species distributions using sdms wenger et al 2011 logez et al 2012 mcgarvey et al 2018 such an approach can benefit the conservation of threatened riverine cetaceans for which the detailed habitat data remains limited the ganges river dolphin platanista gangetica is one of the two endangered south asian river dolphin species that inhabits the perennial floodplains of the ganges brahmaputra meghna river basin of india nepal and bangladesh and the karnaphuli sangu river basin of bangladesh together being referred henceforth as gbmks basins including several associated tributaries smith and reeves 2000 sinha and kannan 2014 braulik et al 2021 kelkar et al 2022 exposed to a multitude of environmental stresses and anthropogenic perturbations the species has witnessed a population decline of more than 50 coupled with 18 reduction in its distribution range over the past few decades kelkar et al 2022 paudel and koprowski 2020 braulik et al 2021 low flows and altered flow regimes due to barrages and impoundments have disrupted the availability of quality habitats for dolphins as well as their prey populations reeves and leatherwood 1994 aggarwal et al 2020 paudel et al 2021 industrial and irrigation projects alongwith several water development projects dot the species range and further restrict the movement of dolphin by affecting longitudinal and lateral habitat connectivity rendering them isolated into several sub populations smith et al 2000 kelkar et al 2022 the gbmks basins have one of the highest human footprint in the world mainly in the form of artisanal fisheries reeves et al 2000 kelkar et al 2010 sinha and kannan 2014 which makes it difficult to maintain the balance between local economic needs and dolphin conservation kelkar et al 2010 paudel et al 2016 dolphin fisheries interactions thereby pose significant conservation concerns in the gbmks basins through direct competition for certain fish size classes habitat and diel activity overlap prey fish depletion by catches intentional killing for oil and meat and boat traffic smith and smith 1998 sinha 2002 sinha 2006 read 2008 kelkar et al 2010 sinha et al 2010 paudel et al 2016 kelkar et al 2018 however ganges dolphins have for long persisted in human dominated river systems and have shown affinity to sites of frequent human use sinha and kannan 2014 so far many studies have described dolphin fisheries interactions along with their effects and associated risks read 2008 kelkar et al 2010 khanal et al 2016 paudel et al 2016 however the assessment of the limit of human presence footprint for dolphin occurrence has not been explored yet to the best of our knowledge in spite of efforts at conservation planning for dolphin by the range countries not much has been translated on the ground as the species continues to decline both in numbers and range given the endangered status of the species and the poor aquatic protected area pa network in the range countries there is a pressing need to identify areas of high habitat suitability as potential refuge to the dwindling population of this freshwater dolphin further considering the overall changing course of the river and its tributaries and the associated fisheries there is an urgent need to re examine and strengthen the coverage of the riverscape under protection to ensure dolphin conservation paudel et al 2020 the study aims to address the knowledge gap to understand the habitat suitability of the ganges river dolphin across its entire range for identifying potential hotspots priority zones for dolphin conservation using species distribution modeling sdm approach the specific objectives of the study are to a understand the biotic and abiotic factors influencing the species distribution patterns b assess the limit of human footprint to support dolphin occurrence and c develop habitat suitability maps for ganges dolphins and delineate riverscapes river segments with high habitat suitability as potential hotspots and priority zones for conservation since studying environmental variables across the geographic space provide important information about the suitable habitat for a given species this interplay of species distribution records with environmental variables forms the basis of correlative sdms guisan and thuiller 2005 elith et al 2006 guisan et al 2017 we hypothesised that varying water flow regime across the riverscape would result in the creation of discrete habitat patches feasible for dolphin occurrence affecting the overall distribution of dolphins also given the association of dolphins with human presence we assume certain level of tolerance by dolphins towards human footprint along the species distribution considering the poor protected area pa network of the range countries we also presume that the model would identify several new quality river segments demanding protection for ensuring dolphin conservation in the context of proposed water development projects ever expanding fisheries and their impacts on river regime this range wide study will bolster the knowledge base on dolphins for informing future spatial conservation planning and management decisions in the riverscape 2 materials and methods species distribution models provide a powerful analytical tool for predicting species distribution and for understanding the ecological factors that govern the same guisan and thuiller 2005 the information generated through sdms can assist in prioritizing critical areas for species presence and those requiring immediate conservation and management attention elith and leathwick 2009 guisan et al 2013 this requires generating information on response variables in the form of presence only presence absence or abundance and explanatory variables such as climatic physiographic or hydrological information 2 1 occurrence data we compiled dolphin occurrence records across its entire range consisting of gbmks basins and areas of ganges delta known as the sundarbans delta this range encompasses diverse physiographic regions of nepal india and bangladesh species occurrences were compiled from presence records reported by researchers in several studies see appendix a personal collection of one of the authors tb and online repositories gbif https www gbif org and obis seamap http seamap env duke edu the observations made after 1995 were retained in the gbif data which were obtained on march 21 2021 in effect we compiled occurrence datasets from 1995 to 2020 for riverine habitats from the species range which yielded 985 presence records of the species fig 1 out of these 985 data points 480 coordinates did not fall on the environmental variables layers used to model potential distribution of dolphin probably because surveys had been carried out from river banks due to hydro geomorphological changes such as shifts in the river course or coordinate imprecision see bhunia et al 2016 such coordinates were moved to the nearest raster cell using nearest land function from the package seeg oxford seegsdm golding 2021 out of the 480 points we discarded 169 points which did not fall on the environmental variable layers even after 1000 m pull the threshold of 1000 m corresponds to the resolution of the environmental variables used i e 30 arc seconds 1 km we grid sampled the remaining 816 coordinates so obtained to match the raster resolution such that one location per pixel was obtained such filtering further reduced the sampling bias and yielded 580 coordinates for use in modeling potential dolphin habitat we used the entire background of the study area to generate 10 000 pseudo absence points pseudo absence selection is advised when no true absences are available or when they are not numerous enough thuiller et al 2021 employing a large number e g 10 000 of pseudo absences has been recommended for achieving higher predictive accuracy amongst other reasons barbet massin et al 2012 phillips and dudík 2008 2 2 environmental variables we initially selected 52 environmental variable layers to model the potential distribution of ganges river dolphin these included 2 variables from hydrosheds https hydrosheds org 22 variables from riveratlas hydrosheds https www hydrosheds org page hydroatlas 7 variables from gloric hydrosheds https www hydrosheds org page gloric 19 bioclimatic variable layers from worldclim version 2 1 climate data for 1970 2000 https worldclim org dallaire et al 2019 linke et al 2019 fick and hijmans 2017 lehner 2013 and 2 other variables sinuosity and grid distance which were calculated from the river segments obtained from hydrosheds bioclimatic variables were readily available in raster form at 30 s spatial resolution while rest of the variables were rasterized with v to rast module details of the variables used are provided in supplemental materials see appendix b we used the boundaries of gbmks basins along with the areas of ganges delta to delimit the study area as the study species is exclusively aquatic we clipped all the environmental variable layers by river networks for use as input layers we obtained the basin boundary and the river networks from hydrosheds to minimize collinearity among predictors we discarded the variables with pearson correlation coefficient 0 75 and 0 75 finally we selected nine variables for modeling based on their ecological relevance and minimum correlation table 1 2 3 distribution modeling we employed ensemble modeling using five different algorithms implemented in biomod2 package in r program 3 4 13 using rstudio interface version 4 1 2 these included two regression methods generalized boosting model gbm generalized additive model gam one classification technique classification tree analysis cta and two machine learning algorithm random forest rf maxent phillips maxent table 2 we used the ensemble sdm approach because it is considered statistically robust and brings significant improvement in the accuracy of sdms by combining their predictions and reducing the predictive uncertainty of single models thuiller et al 2009 grenouillet et al 2011 we selected the models with true skill statistic tss evaluation metric with a threshold of 0 7 we used data partitioning of 80 20 the former for fitting the model and the latter for evaluating the same we repeated the entire procedure three times and evaluated each model by roc relative operating characteristic area under curve auc and tss metrics auc is a threshold independent measure of predictive accuracy whose score ranges from 0 to 1 a refined auc scale where auc 0 9 corresponds to excellent prediction 0 80 auc 0 90 indicates good prediction and the rest corresponding from fair poor to fail predictions cited in araújo et al 2005 the tss however is a threshold dependent measure of predictive accuracy with score ranging from 1 to 1 where 1 indicates perfect agreement and zero or smaller values indicate a performance no better than random besides we also performed sensitivity analysis for untangling drivers of the distribution model convertino et al 2014 for this we obtained variance estimate through function km from package dicekriging roustant et al 2015 then we used the fourier amplitude sensitivity test fast from fast package reusser 2015 fast enables identifying the relative variance contribution to the model 2 4 factors influencing the species distribution patterns variable importance was assessed statistically using the function variables importance from the biomod package thuiller et al 2021 which compares the prediction of the reference value versus the prediction with its values shuffled by subtracting 1 minus the correlation of both predictions we calculated the coefficients representing species environment relationships using glm algorithm and bootstrapped it 1000 times using boot package canty and ripley 2021 davison and hinkley 1997 positive values of these standardized coefficients denote a positive relationship between a given predictor variable and the likelihood of species presence whereas negative values indicate lower probability of occurrence we also created a density plot of presence only po data and human footprint environmental variable we used po data without grid sampling but with a 1 km placement using nearest land function of seegsdm package in case the points did not fall on the environmental layers but with deletion of duplicates such that 728 coordinates were used 2 5 identification of priority areas for conservation in order to identify the priority areas for dolphin conservation we first converted the habitat maps into binary maps using a threshold 0 8 for modelled habitat suitability we used such a high threshold to be stringent with habitat area selection for prioritization these high habitat suitability areas were then overlaid on a map of protected area network and the areas with high habitat suitability falling outside existing protected areas were classified into three tiers of conservation priority the boundaries of protected areas of nepal and bangladesh were obtained from world database on protected areas as india s protected areas were found to be under represented in the database boundaries of protected areas in india were obtained from wildlife institute of india database wii 2015 we excluded the proposed protected areas from the analysis to determine the extent of areas of high probability of dolphin occurrence that fall outside existing protected areas the output so obtained provided a pixelated selection of areas in the rivers with high probability of dolphin occurrence in order to identify fairly large patches of riverine habitat comprising of interconnected cells with high habitat suitability as priority river segments for dolphin conservation we performed clump detection for cells considering eight directions for cell adjacency in effect we detected clumps patches of more than 50 connected cells with high habitat suitability 0 8 to filter off habitat areas that are smaller than the threshold and or are disconnected or scattered clumping or clump detection is a type of aggregation method which joins proportion of like adjacencies with similar attributes for example the raster value 0 8 in the present case and discards any other value lower than that this method in effect helps in identifying large areas which are formed by at least 50 connected cells as in the present case considering as one unit we merged river polygons obtained from openstreetmap osm and shuttle radar topography mission srtm data sources to generate river shapes to propose priority conservation areas in the rivers holes from this combined polygon data which represent riverbanks were removed as riverbanks are desirable for inclusion in the protected areas we created comparable areas by subdividing river polygons with maximum vertices of 1000 clump values were then extracted from each polygon with mean cell value and filtered in with a cut off of 0 1 the output so generated was used in identifying priority areas for conservation including areas outside the boundaries of protected areas in dire need of conservation intervention the area so identified varies from the output generated from the ensemble model as it only considers highly suitable area 0 8 which are interconnected at least 50 connected cells as one unit and discernible as river polygons in osm and srtm in order to differentiate rivers with high suitability located inside and outside protected areas we used a spatial difference function to categorize rivers according to their protection level and the feasibility of future protection we created a buffer of 1000 m distance because the grid size used was 1 km 1 km around existing protected areas to identify the first tier priority areas using terra package in r hijmans et al 2022 the rationale being that expanding the territory of existing protected areas to include highly suitable river habitats adjacent to immediately outside those protected areas will be a more pragmatic first step for conservation authorities managers large segments of suitable river areas areas 100 sq km that then fell outside the first tier were considered as second tier priority areas that represent areas with equal importance as first tier but a more ambitious next step in conservation as prioritizing these areas would require expansion of existing protected areas by a significant degree and or delineation of new protected area s altogether finally the remaining suitable river segments were considered under the third tier of priority for dolphin conservation 3 results 3 1 distribution modeling and model performance our study predicted the current distribution of suitable habitat for dolphin to be patchy in its entire range fig 2 we found that the highly suitable habitats are largely concentrated in the southern and eastern ganges brahmaputra meghna basin majority of the highly suitable areas occur in india followed by bangladesh and nepal in india most of the suitable habitat is distributed in the northern part bordering nepal northeastern part and areas near the bay of bengal while in bangladesh it is distributed throughout but mostly concentrated in the south in nepal only the southern belt comprising of terai lowlands shows habitat suitability for dolphins the performance of single sdms varied from good to excellent in auc score auc median 0 946 range 0 852 0 980 fig 3 however the ensemble model showed better performance auc 0 985 than most individual sdms in terms of tss both single sdms as well as ensemble model resulted in high scores here too the ensemble model showed better performance tss 0 890 than most individual sdms tss median 0 768 range 0 666 0 882 likewise after running the variance estimate we used the model output for building a latin hypercube emulator which was then fed to the fourier amplitude sensitivity test through fast we found the highest fourier coefficients for degree of regulation and temperature annual range meaning these have the highest relative variance contribution to the model appendix c 3 2 factors influencing the species distribution patterns hydrologically conditioned dem was the most influential variable in the ensemble model and the only variable that was consistently ranked so by all the individual models followed by the annual average discharge table 3 in essence high probability 0 8 of dolphin occurrence was observed between hydrologically conditioned dem 2 to 188 55 m appendix d the negative value of dem is in reference to presence in sink or depressive areas calculation of effect size further enabled the quantification of the strength of relationship between variables and among the variables used for modeling flow regime variability irrigated area extent hydrologically conditioned dem and precipitation seasonality had negative effect size on the model output indicating that an increase in the value of these variables would result in a lower probability of dolphin occurrence fig 4 in contrast river area human footprint annual average discharge temperature annual range and degree of regulation showed positive effect size on the dolphin occurrence with human footprint variable values ranging from 0 to 500 in the entire study basin more than 83 of reported dolphin presences occurred in areas with human footprint values ranging between 100 and 300 and the highest density was observed for the range between 180 and 210 these results indicate higher presence of dolphins in areas with moderate human footprint fig 5 3 3 identification of priority areas for conservation we identified the potential habitat of dolphins in the entire range from model predictions and defined the conservation priority for highly suitable habitats into three tiers the first tier included delineation of highly suitable river segments habitat suitability 0 8 falling within 1 km buffer zonation around existing protected areas the second tier encompassed highly suitable river segments forming contiguous areas clumps of size greater than 100 sq km the third tier included the remaining portion of the predicted highly suitable habitat areas in total we identified 7945 42 sq km of river segments in the range as priority areas for dolphin conservation based on high habitat suitability table 4 and fig 6 less than 7 of this area is currently under conservation protection in terms of area coverage bulk of the highly suitable riverine habitat within existing protected areas as well as those outside protected areas occur in india however the proportion of the highly suitable areas identified for each country that fall inside existing protected areas is much greater for nepal 50 40 compared to that of india 6 74 and bangladesh 0 99 the first tier accounted for less than 3 of the predicted priority area for conservation in nepal river stretches adjoining bardia national park chitwan national park and koshi tappu wildlife reserve represented the first tier areas in india such segments include areas located adjacent to dibru saikhowa national park dudhwa national park hastinapur wildlife sanctuary katarniaghat wildlife sanctuary kaziranga national park manas national park nameri national park pobitora wildlife sanctuary sohagi barwa wildlife sanctuary d ering memorial wildlife sanctuary udaypur wildlife sanctuary valmiki national park vikramshila gangetic dolphin sanctuary amongst others similarly areas adjoining nagarbari mohanganj dolphin sanctuary and pablakhali wildlife sanctuary in bangladesh represent the first tier of conservation priority although dolphins have not been typically detected from manas national park nameri national park sohagi barwa wildlife sanctuary and valmiki national park in india and pablakhali wildlife sanctuary in bangladesh the rivers in these protected areas represent potential habitats for the species according to the predicted priority area map accounting to around 74 of the predicted priority area the second tier of conservation priority delineated 11 such segments in the entire range in the upper ganges ghaghara river gandak river and middle ganges koshi river brahmaputra river 4 segments subansiri river near brahmaputra confluence which are located in india padma river 2 segments the largest of these segments is located in the brahmaputra river right before it enters bangladesh the remaining portions of the predicted highly suitable area that were not large enough to be considered in the second tier were grouped in the third tier and included segments such as brahmaputra reaches in assam and portions of hoogly river in west bengal india brahmaputra reaches entering bangladesh karnali and mohana river system in nepal etc even though there is sub basin basin interdependency we have not considered their dependency in inferring protection areas as our prime interest was to highlight the priority areas for conservation solely based on the interconnectedness of highly suitable habitat however the model in addition has highlighted priority areas in different sub basins including near conservation areas such as hastinapur wildlife sanctuary in the upper ganges vikramshila gangetic dolphin sanctuary in the middle ganges kaziranga national park in the brahmaputra basin pablakhali wildlife sanctuary in the karnaphuli sangu river basin amongst many other sub basins 4 discussion we undertook this study to gain insights into the habitat suitability and patterns of distribution of the ganges river dolphin in its entire range and assess factors that influence the same we also made a genuine attempt to quantify the level of human footprint that is bearable for dolphin presence in the river stretch further the broader aim of this study was to evaluate the current protected area coverage in the riverscape and delineate potential areas for prioritizing protection and conservation action for the dolphin the ensemble distribution modeling and the hotspot analysis provided a comprehensive and robust estimation of the species distribution and helped to identify and prioritize river segments that require immediate conservation and management attention 4 1 dolphin distribution and habitat suitability the predicted distribution of ganges river dolphin was more or less continuous with vastly varying probability of occurrence across the species range however the highly suitable areas were patchy and sparse indicating discrete availability of optimal habitat conditions for the dolphins only at certain portions of the river this was further validated through the confined distribution of highly suitable areas in the southern and eastern basin northern parts bordering nepal northeastern stretches and areas near the bay of bengal south of bangladesh and in the southern belt of nepal indicating severe depletion of optimal habitats in the upstream of ganges such sparse and fragmented distribution of the suitable habitat highlights the importance and dire need for serious attention towards the conservation and protection of the remaining highly suitable areas in the riverscape the fact that the habitat of dolphin spans across three countries nepal india and bangladesh essentiates the need for transboundary co operative measures to promote restoration and conservation of the dolphin habitats in its range at present there is a lack of agreement to regulate river flow regimes at the transboundary national or inter province levels therefore transboundary co operation is necessary to promote habitat restoration and ensure species survival across the range particularly in the upstream reaches our attempt involving predictive modeling is a step towards delivering evidence required for spatial risk assessments and to facilitate conservation planning across the species range 4 2 habitat requirement of dolphin in relation to covariates used the suitable dolphin habitats identified through our model concur with the occurrence records of the species in the range which indicates that our model approximates the actual distribution of dolphins in its current range while overlying the presence records on the habitat suitability map it was found that almost 94 of the occurrence records fell in high 0 8 habitat suitability range probability of occurrence mostly in the habitat suitability class of 1 suitable areas where the species has not been recorded so far or those with reported extirpations were also identified as representative potential habitat for focussed conservation attention for example gandaki river in nepal upstream of the gandak barrage represents one such segments with reported extirpation paudel and koprowski 2020 however our model identified it as a highly suitable potential habitat as a validation to our model predictions dolphin has been recently sighted in the upstream of gandak barrage pers comm tek mahato in terms of variable importance elevation does not directly affect the distribution of dolphins but acts in synergy with other predictors such as temperature rainfall and solar radiation thereby influencing habitat features elevation thus acts as a surrogate for other non climate related factors such as food availability which may restrict a species distribution geographically remonti et al 2009 likewise when spatially explicit estimates of climate remain unavailable elevation serves as a reliable substitute hof et al 2012 as recommended by hof et al 2012 we ran our models with and without using elevation as a covariate and found that its exclusion did not result in any remarkable change in the importance of other variables elevation as a predictor is generally found to lead to more conservative estimates of habitat suitability which suits our study well as our aim was to have a robust estimate of habitat suitability species conservation degree of regulation showed a positive effect on dolphin occurrence which should not be misinterpreted to infer that higher degree of regulation would favour dolphins because the model does not account for the inability of the species to cross the dams and barrages dolphins have been widely reported to occur in pools downstream of dams and barrages probably due to high concentrations of rheophilic fish shoals as such barriers hinder their upstream movements baumgartner 2007 agostinho et al 2012 since on a local scale river dolphins have been reported to be opportunistic generalist smith and reeves 2012 this might even serve more beneficial to dolphins as evidences of population increase in certain river segments between dams has also been reported paudel and koprowski 2020 positive influence of human footprint on dolphin distribution was actually inclined to moderate human footprint as depicted through the distribution of presence only data along human footprint dolphins have for long persisted in human dominated river systems and shown close association with sites of frequent human use such as bathing and washing ghats ferry ghats and cremation ghats mainly to feed on the fishes that get attracted to the foods offered by people sinha and kannan 2014 dolphins preferentially congregate at locations river channels with muddy rocky substrates and deep mid channel waters that are favored by local fishermen and vice versa this is due to higher biomass of small fish in dolphin congregating areas that in effect provide cues to the fishermen bashir et al 2010 kelkar et al 2010 besides dolphin preference for moderately fished sites with 2 6 boats km over sites that are fished heavily with 8 55 boats km has also been observed kelkar et al 2010 bashir et al 2012 such signs of tolerance to human activities indicate that certain degree of human footprint serves well for dolphins sinha and kannan 2014 studies so far have only described dolphin fisheries interactions their effects and risks our study is the first attempt to assess the threshold of human presence footprint desirable for dolphin occurrence such an assessment can act as a beneficial step forward towards striking a balance between dolphins and fisheries management and help reconcile dolphin conservation in a sustainable way 4 3 hotspots for dolphin conservation our models were helpful in identifying and prioritizing important areas for dolphins as an important step for effective conservation of riverine cetaceans paudel et al 2021 categorization of the priority areas into three tiers would further facilitate designing an efficient road map towards achieving this goal however keeping in view the current scenario of the pa network of the riverscape which merely accounts for less than 7 of the delineated 7945 42 sq km of priority area indicates a matter of serious concern demanding immediate conservation attention to safeguard the remaining patches of suitable habitat for dolphins this would require taking strong conservation initiatives at multiple scales and domains within and between the range countries as a first step we propose expansion of the current pa network as predicted under the first tier of prioritization by including at least 1 km area around the existing protected areas which would need a country wide initiative that is implemented at local and state levels among the range countries india in spite of having the maximum representation of the predicted suitable area less than 7 of it is protected at present which therefore demands for a more rigorous and wide spread effort for dolphin conservation in this region on the contrary although over 50 of highly suitable habitats in nepal fall in protected areas barriers to connectivity have potentially constrained the distribution of the species in the protected areas similarly in bangladesh less than 1 of predicted suitable habitat falling under protection here too efforts for increasing the extent of riverine protected area needs to be considered on priority in view of the reports of continued local extirpation from several smaller rivers and tributaries across the riverscape sinha and kannan 2014 paudel and koprowski 2020 immediate conservation and management actions seem mandatory to identify and address other related issues that expedite extirpation for example in nepal the segments above the koshi tappu wildlife reserve were identified as priority areas for conservation but dolphin population in the koshi river upstream of koshi barrage is noted to have undergone extirpation paudel and koprowski 2020 even though the model showed high probability of habitat suitability in this region high anthropogenic pressure seems to have driven the local population to extirpation likewise geruwa s river segment is identified as priority areas for conservation but the decreasing discharge over the past several years in the geruwa channel of karnali river which flows through the bardia national park has also reportedly led to the decline in dolphins in the national park moreover a major flood in 2010 also caused the channel to shift to karnali suggesting the new habitat to become an ecological trap khanal et al 2016 which the model could not reflect thus giving ways to a variety of other factors which in combination drive the extirpation events across the riverscape our proposal for immediate implementation of the first tier priority areas under protection is further supported by kelkar et al 2015 reporting similar population densities for the species in adjacent river reaches of vikramshila gangetic dolphin sanctuary in india irrespective of their protection status this notion has been further supported by non consideration of sanctuary for effective dolphin conservation braulik et al 2020 because of its associated threats and better promising habitat in its adjacent vicinity our model prediction also showed similar results indicating that large areas of the river outside the vikramshila gangetic dolphin sanctuary had high suitability for the species while some areas inside the sanctuary had low probability of dolphin occurrence thereby validating the robustness of our predictions under the first tier protection of second tier would require a comprehensive planning involving an international trans boundary cooperative approach in order to preserve the remaining 74 26 of the predicted priority area here each of the 11 identified conservation priority segments would demand separate attention and cooperation among the domain range countries for effective conservation of the dolphin habitat segment since inter basin water transfer projects namely national river linking project nrlp india and other large scale hydropower projects are planned in different river segments of the ganges brahmaputra meghna and karnaphuli sangu river systems these projects threaten to modify the already depleted and degraded dolphin habitat into major dredged shipping lanes kelkar 2017 and fragmented habitats this makes the identification of priority areas even more relevant to ensure systematic conservation of the species habitat such classification will enable prioritization of areas that need to be conserved and provide aid in river basin planning high level policy and strategic river basin planning has also been identified as a measure to reduce the threats faced by the species braulik et al 2021 based on our study the upper ganges represented least protected for the ganges river dolphin in terms of number and distance between protected areas with the exception of hastinapur wls this section represents the north western extent of the distribution of ganges river dolphin and losing those areas would mean large shrinkage in the dolphin distribution which is a serious conservation concern in nepal as well dolphin occurrence has gradually been rare in the chitwan national park upstream of the gandak barrrage this calls for a greater conservation effort in the upper ganges protection of the third tier priority area would depend on the successful accomplishment of the first and the second tier and should be considered part of a long term conservation program 4 4 methodological considerations and the way forward a more robust and precise model could be generated by the inclusion of instream covariates such as stream temperature center of flow mass ph conductivity habitat types etc variables that directly represent instream conditions are preferable in aquatic sdms austin 2002 but these are constrained by the logistical burden of developing water temperature and hydrology models our approach therefore seems to be the best possible output that could be generated with the given constraints this is further supported by mcgarvey et al 2018 stating that sdm predictions do not fundamentally differ when climate versus instream covariates stream temperature are used biotic factors also limit the distribution but the lack of variable information limited our prediction reliable estimates of biological variables such as phytoplankton and zooplanktons which are closely linked to cetacean prey along with their direct prey such as fishes macro invertebrates etc could also help improve modeling of dolphin habitat and potential distribution further the investigation of important issues such as impacts of construction of dams at certain locations could also aid in designing a precise model we could not use annual mean temperature in modeling because it showed a very high correlation 0 99 with elevation we tried modeling without hydrologically conditioned dem and used annual mean temperature instead but it did not have much variable importance so we decided to use only the hydrologically conditioned dem likewise in the sundarbans the river networks were not finely presented and hence did not have environmental variables this left with using resulted in only 26 25 eventually used after grid sampling out of 53 coordinates having environmental variable even after the 1 km pull this might have affected the prediction of priority areas in the sundarbans region and hence should not be considered conclusive the distribution models also have temporal variability but in this study we have only considered spatial distribution of the species studying the effect of variable change over time and how it induces change in the species distribution would certainly be of great interest and importance however at this time we are constrained by the lack of temporal environmental variables the non linear variables used in the analysis could have easily brought in variable non linear interactions and may have exerted strong variability into the output as well given the present constraints of non availability of temporal data such issues need to be resolved in future studies using appropriate datasets 5 conclusion our study has predicted the potential distribution of ganges river dolphin across its entire range with more suitable habitat of the species mostly noted in southern and eastern ganges brahmaputra meghna basin hydrologically conditioned dem came out as the most important variable determining the distribution of the species and moderate human footprint as suitable for higher presence of the species while merely around 7 of the predicted high suitability area was found to be under currently protected which highlights the graveness of the issue warranting immediate conservation attention the study is a step towards delivering evidence required for spatial risk assessments and conservation planning habitat suitability maps will certainly help to develop better management plans and strategies for the conservation of threatened species such as dolphin whose precarious situation has been further marginalized by rampant human induced modifications of its habitat over the years the classification of suitable habitats into three tiers of conservation will aid in making decision regarding prioritization of river segments for the conservation of the species therefore we recommend that the inferences drawn from our model predictions on hotspot areas must be implemented on priority to ensure species conservation besides our study also provides huge scope for further research to validate the quality of the predicted suitable areas at a finer scale this can certainly help towards developing a more precise and robust model for dolphin conservation in this riverscape we acknowledge the limitations in the present study but considering the dearth of such data availability at present for the region this is the best possible methodologically robust

24200,the endangered ganges river dolphin is a flagship species that inhabits the ganges brahmaputra meghna and karnaphuli sangu river systems exposed to a multitude of environmental stresses and anthropogenic perturbations the species has experienced severe population decline and shrinking of potential habitat in much of its distribution range a range wide mapping of its potential habitat and assessment of factors associated with species occurrence therefore bears immense relevance for conservation planning we used an ensemble of species distribution models sdm using occurrence data to investigate dolphin distribution in relation to hydrological climatic physiographic land cover and anthropogenic variables across the species entire range we followed a systematic prioritization approach to identify highly suitable habitat patches potential hotspots for dolphins that require immediate protection we identified nearly 7945 sq km of river area as highly suitable for dolphins as habitat refugia for the species more than 93 of which are outside the protected area regime thus demanding immediate conservation attention this study is a step towards delivering evidence required for spatial risk assessments and conservation planning wherein the habitat suitability maps will help in developing better management plans and strategies and the predicted three tier classification of suitable habitats will facilitate decision making and prioritization of river segments for inclusion in the protected area network we recommend that the inferences drawn from our study must be implemented on priority to ensure species conservation in the riverscape besides our study provides huge scope for fine scale assessment and validation of the predicted suitable areas for model improvement keywords conservation planning distribution ensemble modeling environmental variables ganges river dolphin hotspot areas data availability links to data shared 1 introduction freshwater cetaceans inhabiting some of the major human dominated river systems across asia and south america are among the world s most threatened groups of mammals kelkar et al 2022 mostly listed as endangered on the iucn red list these species have experienced drastic decline in numbers and shrinking of their distribution ranges kelkar et al 2022 their occurrence and distribution have been associated with a number of abiotic and biotic factors including flow regime prey fish abundance and other hydro physiographic parameters martin et al 2004 smith et al 2009 bashir et al 2010 2012 gómez salazar et al 2012 human activities in cetacean habitats have also been suggested to alter their behavior movement pattern and resource use eventually influencing the species distribution patterns bashir et al 2013 paudel and koprowski 2020 information on how different environmental and anthropogenic factors affect species distribution can therefore help in understanding their ecological affinities and spatial conservation planning guisan and thuiller 2005 passadore et al 2018 considering the prevailing threats and range contractions faced by these species identification and prioritization of critical habitats for species presence and those requiring immediate attention elith and leathwick 2009 guisan et al 2013 passadore et al 2018 seems prerequisite to benefit species conservation cetacean distributions have often been described as a composite outcome of evolutionary ecological demographic anthropogenic and habitat related factors kuit et al 2019 hydrological characteristics such as water depth direction and velocity of flow water quality temperature sediment load and hydro morphological features including channel width and availability of confluence areas have been reported to play a critical role in determining habitat preferences and the overall distribution of riverine cetaceans smith et al 1998 choudhary et al 2006 2008 bashir et al 2010 dares et al 2014 ferro et al 2015 seasonal fluctuations in the river flow particularly during low water conditions have markedly influenced the habitat use of cetaceans by directly affecting in stream attributes such as water depth as well as the distribution and abundance of their preferred prey fish species aggarwal et al 2020 paudel et al 2021 such effects are aggravated by human induced perturbations in the flow regime through water development projects such as dams barrages water abstractions and other embankments reeves and leatherwood 1994 the escalating human footprint on rivers mainly in the form of fisheries and the resultant cetacean fisheries interactions are known to further affect their use of optimal habitats thereby increasing the risks to species survival read 2008 kelkar et al 2010 paudel et al 2016 moreover climatic factors such as air temperature and precipitation by their fundamental associations with water temperature and other hydrological parameters e g volume of stream flows also influence species distributions in streams and riverine ecosystems coutant 1977 poff and allan 1995 poff et al 1997 pilgrim et al 1998 erickson and stefan 2000 although the information on in stream habitat variables such as water temperature is considered essential for predicting species distribution and habitat suitability such data is unavailable for most tropical river systems of the world dudgeon 2000 mcgarvey et al 2018 and generating the same for a range wide assessment seems cumbersome and logistically challenging recent studies in river ecosystems have however established the use of climatic variables as surrogate measures of in stream conditions e g air temperature for water temperature to generate reliable predictions on species distributions using sdms wenger et al 2011 logez et al 2012 mcgarvey et al 2018 such an approach can benefit the conservation of threatened riverine cetaceans for which the detailed habitat data remains limited the ganges river dolphin platanista gangetica is one of the two endangered south asian river dolphin species that inhabits the perennial floodplains of the ganges brahmaputra meghna river basin of india nepal and bangladesh and the karnaphuli sangu river basin of bangladesh together being referred henceforth as gbmks basins including several associated tributaries smith and reeves 2000 sinha and kannan 2014 braulik et al 2021 kelkar et al 2022 exposed to a multitude of environmental stresses and anthropogenic perturbations the species has witnessed a population decline of more than 50 coupled with 18 reduction in its distribution range over the past few decades kelkar et al 2022 paudel and koprowski 2020 braulik et al 2021 low flows and altered flow regimes due to barrages and impoundments have disrupted the availability of quality habitats for dolphins as well as their prey populations reeves and leatherwood 1994 aggarwal et al 2020 paudel et al 2021 industrial and irrigation projects alongwith several water development projects dot the species range and further restrict the movement of dolphin by affecting longitudinal and lateral habitat connectivity rendering them isolated into several sub populations smith et al 2000 kelkar et al 2022 the gbmks basins have one of the highest human footprint in the world mainly in the form of artisanal fisheries reeves et al 2000 kelkar et al 2010 sinha and kannan 2014 which makes it difficult to maintain the balance between local economic needs and dolphin conservation kelkar et al 2010 paudel et al 2016 dolphin fisheries interactions thereby pose significant conservation concerns in the gbmks basins through direct competition for certain fish size classes habitat and diel activity overlap prey fish depletion by catches intentional killing for oil and meat and boat traffic smith and smith 1998 sinha 2002 sinha 2006 read 2008 kelkar et al 2010 sinha et al 2010 paudel et al 2016 kelkar et al 2018 however ganges dolphins have for long persisted in human dominated river systems and have shown affinity to sites of frequent human use sinha and kannan 2014 so far many studies have described dolphin fisheries interactions along with their effects and associated risks read 2008 kelkar et al 2010 khanal et al 2016 paudel et al 2016 however the assessment of the limit of human presence footprint for dolphin occurrence has not been explored yet to the best of our knowledge in spite of efforts at conservation planning for dolphin by the range countries not much has been translated on the ground as the species continues to decline both in numbers and range given the endangered status of the species and the poor aquatic protected area pa network in the range countries there is a pressing need to identify areas of high habitat suitability as potential refuge to the dwindling population of this freshwater dolphin further considering the overall changing course of the river and its tributaries and the associated fisheries there is an urgent need to re examine and strengthen the coverage of the riverscape under protection to ensure dolphin conservation paudel et al 2020 the study aims to address the knowledge gap to understand the habitat suitability of the ganges river dolphin across its entire range for identifying potential hotspots priority zones for dolphin conservation using species distribution modeling sdm approach the specific objectives of the study are to a understand the biotic and abiotic factors influencing the species distribution patterns b assess the limit of human footprint to support dolphin occurrence and c develop habitat suitability maps for ganges dolphins and delineate riverscapes river segments with high habitat suitability as potential hotspots and priority zones for conservation since studying environmental variables across the geographic space provide important information about the suitable habitat for a given species this interplay of species distribution records with environmental variables forms the basis of correlative sdms guisan and thuiller 2005 elith et al 2006 guisan et al 2017 we hypothesised that varying water flow regime across the riverscape would result in the creation of discrete habitat patches feasible for dolphin occurrence affecting the overall distribution of dolphins also given the association of dolphins with human presence we assume certain level of tolerance by dolphins towards human footprint along the species distribution considering the poor protected area pa network of the range countries we also presume that the model would identify several new quality river segments demanding protection for ensuring dolphin conservation in the context of proposed water development projects ever expanding fisheries and their impacts on river regime this range wide study will bolster the knowledge base on dolphins for informing future spatial conservation planning and management decisions in the riverscape 2 materials and methods species distribution models provide a powerful analytical tool for predicting species distribution and for understanding the ecological factors that govern the same guisan and thuiller 2005 the information generated through sdms can assist in prioritizing critical areas for species presence and those requiring immediate conservation and management attention elith and leathwick 2009 guisan et al 2013 this requires generating information on response variables in the form of presence only presence absence or abundance and explanatory variables such as climatic physiographic or hydrological information 2 1 occurrence data we compiled dolphin occurrence records across its entire range consisting of gbmks basins and areas of ganges delta known as the sundarbans delta this range encompasses diverse physiographic regions of nepal india and bangladesh species occurrences were compiled from presence records reported by researchers in several studies see appendix a personal collection of one of the authors tb and online repositories gbif https www gbif org and obis seamap http seamap env duke edu the observations made after 1995 were retained in the gbif data which were obtained on march 21 2021 in effect we compiled occurrence datasets from 1995 to 2020 for riverine habitats from the species range which yielded 985 presence records of the species fig 1 out of these 985 data points 480 coordinates did not fall on the environmental variables layers used to model potential distribution of dolphin probably because surveys had been carried out from river banks due to hydro geomorphological changes such as shifts in the river course or coordinate imprecision see bhunia et al 2016 such coordinates were moved to the nearest raster cell using nearest land function from the package seeg oxford seegsdm golding 2021 out of the 480 points we discarded 169 points which did not fall on the environmental variable layers even after 1000 m pull the threshold of 1000 m corresponds to the resolution of the environmental variables used i e 30 arc seconds 1 km we grid sampled the remaining 816 coordinates so obtained to match the raster resolution such that one location per pixel was obtained such filtering further reduced the sampling bias and yielded 580 coordinates for use in modeling potential dolphin habitat we used the entire background of the study area to generate 10 000 pseudo absence points pseudo absence selection is advised when no true absences are available or when they are not numerous enough thuiller et al 2021 employing a large number e g 10 000 of pseudo absences has been recommended for achieving higher predictive accuracy amongst other reasons barbet massin et al 2012 phillips and dudík 2008 2 2 environmental variables we initially selected 52 environmental variable layers to model the potential distribution of ganges river dolphin these included 2 variables from hydrosheds https hydrosheds org 22 variables from riveratlas hydrosheds https www hydrosheds org page hydroatlas 7 variables from gloric hydrosheds https www hydrosheds org page gloric 19 bioclimatic variable layers from worldclim version 2 1 climate data for 1970 2000 https worldclim org dallaire et al 2019 linke et al 2019 fick and hijmans 2017 lehner 2013 and 2 other variables sinuosity and grid distance which were calculated from the river segments obtained from hydrosheds bioclimatic variables were readily available in raster form at 30 s spatial resolution while rest of the variables were rasterized with v to rast module details of the variables used are provided in supplemental materials see appendix b we used the boundaries of gbmks basins along with the areas of ganges delta to delimit the study area as the study species is exclusively aquatic we clipped all the environmental variable layers by river networks for use as input layers we obtained the basin boundary and the river networks from hydrosheds to minimize collinearity among predictors we discarded the variables with pearson correlation coefficient 0 75 and 0 75 finally we selected nine variables for modeling based on their ecological relevance and minimum correlation table 1 2 3 distribution modeling we employed ensemble modeling using five different algorithms implemented in biomod2 package in r program 3 4 13 using rstudio interface version 4 1 2 these included two regression methods generalized boosting model gbm generalized additive model gam one classification technique classification tree analysis cta and two machine learning algorithm random forest rf maxent phillips maxent table 2 we used the ensemble sdm approach because it is considered statistically robust and brings significant improvement in the accuracy of sdms by combining their predictions and reducing the predictive uncertainty of single models thuiller et al 2009 grenouillet et al 2011 we selected the models with true skill statistic tss evaluation metric with a threshold of 0 7 we used data partitioning of 80 20 the former for fitting the model and the latter for evaluating the same we repeated the entire procedure three times and evaluated each model by roc relative operating characteristic area under curve auc and tss metrics auc is a threshold independent measure of predictive accuracy whose score ranges from 0 to 1 a refined auc scale where auc 0 9 corresponds to excellent prediction 0 80 auc 0 90 indicates good prediction and the rest corresponding from fair poor to fail predictions cited in araújo et al 2005 the tss however is a threshold dependent measure of predictive accuracy with score ranging from 1 to 1 where 1 indicates perfect agreement and zero or smaller values indicate a performance no better than random besides we also performed sensitivity analysis for untangling drivers of the distribution model convertino et al 2014 for this we obtained variance estimate through function km from package dicekriging roustant et al 2015 then we used the fourier amplitude sensitivity test fast from fast package reusser 2015 fast enables identifying the relative variance contribution to the model 2 4 factors influencing the species distribution patterns variable importance was assessed statistically using the function variables importance from the biomod package thuiller et al 2021 which compares the prediction of the reference value versus the prediction with its values shuffled by subtracting 1 minus the correlation of both predictions we calculated the coefficients representing species environment relationships using glm algorithm and bootstrapped it 1000 times using boot package canty and ripley 2021 davison and hinkley 1997 positive values of these standardized coefficients denote a positive relationship between a given predictor variable and the likelihood of species presence whereas negative values indicate lower probability of occurrence we also created a density plot of presence only po data and human footprint environmental variable we used po data without grid sampling but with a 1 km placement using nearest land function of seegsdm package in case the points did not fall on the environmental layers but with deletion of duplicates such that 728 coordinates were used 2 5 identification of priority areas for conservation in order to identify the priority areas for dolphin conservation we first converted the habitat maps into binary maps using a threshold 0 8 for modelled habitat suitability we used such a high threshold to be stringent with habitat area selection for prioritization these high habitat suitability areas were then overlaid on a map of protected area network and the areas with high habitat suitability falling outside existing protected areas were classified into three tiers of conservation priority the boundaries of protected areas of nepal and bangladesh were obtained from world database on protected areas as india s protected areas were found to be under represented in the database boundaries of protected areas in india were obtained from wildlife institute of india database wii 2015 we excluded the proposed protected areas from the analysis to determine the extent of areas of high probability of dolphin occurrence that fall outside existing protected areas the output so obtained provided a pixelated selection of areas in the rivers with high probability of dolphin occurrence in order to identify fairly large patches of riverine habitat comprising of interconnected cells with high habitat suitability as priority river segments for dolphin conservation we performed clump detection for cells considering eight directions for cell adjacency in effect we detected clumps patches of more than 50 connected cells with high habitat suitability 0 8 to filter off habitat areas that are smaller than the threshold and or are disconnected or scattered clumping or clump detection is a type of aggregation method which joins proportion of like adjacencies with similar attributes for example the raster value 0 8 in the present case and discards any other value lower than that this method in effect helps in identifying large areas which are formed by at least 50 connected cells as in the present case considering as one unit we merged river polygons obtained from openstreetmap osm and shuttle radar topography mission srtm data sources to generate river shapes to propose priority conservation areas in the rivers holes from this combined polygon data which represent riverbanks were removed as riverbanks are desirable for inclusion in the protected areas we created comparable areas by subdividing river polygons with maximum vertices of 1000 clump values were then extracted from each polygon with mean cell value and filtered in with a cut off of 0 1 the output so generated was used in identifying priority areas for conservation including areas outside the boundaries of protected areas in dire need of conservation intervention the area so identified varies from the output generated from the ensemble model as it only considers highly suitable area 0 8 which are interconnected at least 50 connected cells as one unit and discernible as river polygons in osm and srtm in order to differentiate rivers with high suitability located inside and outside protected areas we used a spatial difference function to categorize rivers according to their protection level and the feasibility of future protection we created a buffer of 1000 m distance because the grid size used was 1 km 1 km around existing protected areas to identify the first tier priority areas using terra package in r hijmans et al 2022 the rationale being that expanding the territory of existing protected areas to include highly suitable river habitats adjacent to immediately outside those protected areas will be a more pragmatic first step for conservation authorities managers large segments of suitable river areas areas 100 sq km that then fell outside the first tier were considered as second tier priority areas that represent areas with equal importance as first tier but a more ambitious next step in conservation as prioritizing these areas would require expansion of existing protected areas by a significant degree and or delineation of new protected area s altogether finally the remaining suitable river segments were considered under the third tier of priority for dolphin conservation 3 results 3 1 distribution modeling and model performance our study predicted the current distribution of suitable habitat for dolphin to be patchy in its entire range fig 2 we found that the highly suitable habitats are largely concentrated in the southern and eastern ganges brahmaputra meghna basin majority of the highly suitable areas occur in india followed by bangladesh and nepal in india most of the suitable habitat is distributed in the northern part bordering nepal northeastern part and areas near the bay of bengal while in bangladesh it is distributed throughout but mostly concentrated in the south in nepal only the southern belt comprising of terai lowlands shows habitat suitability for dolphins the performance of single sdms varied from good to excellent in auc score auc median 0 946 range 0 852 0 980 fig 3 however the ensemble model showed better performance auc 0 985 than most individual sdms in terms of tss both single sdms as well as ensemble model resulted in high scores here too the ensemble model showed better performance tss 0 890 than most individual sdms tss median 0 768 range 0 666 0 882 likewise after running the variance estimate we used the model output for building a latin hypercube emulator which was then fed to the fourier amplitude sensitivity test through fast we found the highest fourier coefficients for degree of regulation and temperature annual range meaning these have the highest relative variance contribution to the model appendix c 3 2 factors influencing the species distribution patterns hydrologically conditioned dem was the most influential variable in the ensemble model and the only variable that was consistently ranked so by all the individual models followed by the annual average discharge table 3 in essence high probability 0 8 of dolphin occurrence was observed between hydrologically conditioned dem 2 to 188 55 m appendix d the negative value of dem is in reference to presence in sink or depressive areas calculation of effect size further enabled the quantification of the strength of relationship between variables and among the variables used for modeling flow regime variability irrigated area extent hydrologically conditioned dem and precipitation seasonality had negative effect size on the model output indicating that an increase in the value of these variables would result in a lower probability of dolphin occurrence fig 4 in contrast river area human footprint annual average discharge temperature annual range and degree of regulation showed positive effect size on the dolphin occurrence with human footprint variable values ranging from 0 to 500 in the entire study basin more than 83 of reported dolphin presences occurred in areas with human footprint values ranging between 100 and 300 and the highest density was observed for the range between 180 and 210 these results indicate higher presence of dolphins in areas with moderate human footprint fig 5 3 3 identification of priority areas for conservation we identified the potential habitat of dolphins in the entire range from model predictions and defined the conservation priority for highly suitable habitats into three tiers the first tier included delineation of highly suitable river segments habitat suitability 0 8 falling within 1 km buffer zonation around existing protected areas the second tier encompassed highly suitable river segments forming contiguous areas clumps of size greater than 100 sq km the third tier included the remaining portion of the predicted highly suitable habitat areas in total we identified 7945 42 sq km of river segments in the range as priority areas for dolphin conservation based on high habitat suitability table 4 and fig 6 less than 7 of this area is currently under conservation protection in terms of area coverage bulk of the highly suitable riverine habitat within existing protected areas as well as those outside protected areas occur in india however the proportion of the highly suitable areas identified for each country that fall inside existing protected areas is much greater for nepal 50 40 compared to that of india 6 74 and bangladesh 0 99 the first tier accounted for less than 3 of the predicted priority area for conservation in nepal river stretches adjoining bardia national park chitwan national park and koshi tappu wildlife reserve represented the first tier areas in india such segments include areas located adjacent to dibru saikhowa national park dudhwa national park hastinapur wildlife sanctuary katarniaghat wildlife sanctuary kaziranga national park manas national park nameri national park pobitora wildlife sanctuary sohagi barwa wildlife sanctuary d ering memorial wildlife sanctuary udaypur wildlife sanctuary valmiki national park vikramshila gangetic dolphin sanctuary amongst others similarly areas adjoining nagarbari mohanganj dolphin sanctuary and pablakhali wildlife sanctuary in bangladesh represent the first tier of conservation priority although dolphins have not been typically detected from manas national park nameri national park sohagi barwa wildlife sanctuary and valmiki national park in india and pablakhali wildlife sanctuary in bangladesh the rivers in these protected areas represent potential habitats for the species according to the predicted priority area map accounting to around 74 of the predicted priority area the second tier of conservation priority delineated 11 such segments in the entire range in the upper ganges ghaghara river gandak river and middle ganges koshi river brahmaputra river 4 segments subansiri river near brahmaputra confluence which are located in india padma river 2 segments the largest of these segments is located in the brahmaputra river right before it enters bangladesh the remaining portions of the predicted highly suitable area that were not large enough to be considered in the second tier were grouped in the third tier and included segments such as brahmaputra reaches in assam and portions of hoogly river in west bengal india brahmaputra reaches entering bangladesh karnali and mohana river system in nepal etc even though there is sub basin basin interdependency we have not considered their dependency in inferring protection areas as our prime interest was to highlight the priority areas for conservation solely based on the interconnectedness of highly suitable habitat however the model in addition has highlighted priority areas in different sub basins including near conservation areas such as hastinapur wildlife sanctuary in the upper ganges vikramshila gangetic dolphin sanctuary in the middle ganges kaziranga national park in the brahmaputra basin pablakhali wildlife sanctuary in the karnaphuli sangu river basin amongst many other sub basins 4 discussion we undertook this study to gain insights into the habitat suitability and patterns of distribution of the ganges river dolphin in its entire range and assess factors that influence the same we also made a genuine attempt to quantify the level of human footprint that is bearable for dolphin presence in the river stretch further the broader aim of this study was to evaluate the current protected area coverage in the riverscape and delineate potential areas for prioritizing protection and conservation action for the dolphin the ensemble distribution modeling and the hotspot analysis provided a comprehensive and robust estimation of the species distribution and helped to identify and prioritize river segments that require immediate conservation and management attention 4 1 dolphin distribution and habitat suitability the predicted distribution of ganges river dolphin was more or less continuous with vastly varying probability of occurrence across the species range however the highly suitable areas were patchy and sparse indicating discrete availability of optimal habitat conditions for the dolphins only at certain portions of the river this was further validated through the confined distribution of highly suitable areas in the southern and eastern basin northern parts bordering nepal northeastern stretches and areas near the bay of bengal south of bangladesh and in the southern belt of nepal indicating severe depletion of optimal habitats in the upstream of ganges such sparse and fragmented distribution of the suitable habitat highlights the importance and dire need for serious attention towards the conservation and protection of the remaining highly suitable areas in the riverscape the fact that the habitat of dolphin spans across three countries nepal india and bangladesh essentiates the need for transboundary co operative measures to promote restoration and conservation of the dolphin habitats in its range at present there is a lack of agreement to regulate river flow regimes at the transboundary national or inter province levels therefore transboundary co operation is necessary to promote habitat restoration and ensure species survival across the range particularly in the upstream reaches our attempt involving predictive modeling is a step towards delivering evidence required for spatial risk assessments and to facilitate conservation planning across the species range 4 2 habitat requirement of dolphin in relation to covariates used the suitable dolphin habitats identified through our model concur with the occurrence records of the species in the range which indicates that our model approximates the actual distribution of dolphins in its current range while overlying the presence records on the habitat suitability map it was found that almost 94 of the occurrence records fell in high 0 8 habitat suitability range probability of occurrence mostly in the habitat suitability class of 1 suitable areas where the species has not been recorded so far or those with reported extirpations were also identified as representative potential habitat for focussed conservation attention for example gandaki river in nepal upstream of the gandak barrage represents one such segments with reported extirpation paudel and koprowski 2020 however our model identified it as a highly suitable potential habitat as a validation to our model predictions dolphin has been recently sighted in the upstream of gandak barrage pers comm tek mahato in terms of variable importance elevation does not directly affect the distribution of dolphins but acts in synergy with other predictors such as temperature rainfall and solar radiation thereby influencing habitat features elevation thus acts as a surrogate for other non climate related factors such as food availability which may restrict a species distribution geographically remonti et al 2009 likewise when spatially explicit estimates of climate remain unavailable elevation serves as a reliable substitute hof et al 2012 as recommended by hof et al 2012 we ran our models with and without using elevation as a covariate and found that its exclusion did not result in any remarkable change in the importance of other variables elevation as a predictor is generally found to lead to more conservative estimates of habitat suitability which suits our study well as our aim was to have a robust estimate of habitat suitability species conservation degree of regulation showed a positive effect on dolphin occurrence which should not be misinterpreted to infer that higher degree of regulation would favour dolphins because the model does not account for the inability of the species to cross the dams and barrages dolphins have been widely reported to occur in pools downstream of dams and barrages probably due to high concentrations of rheophilic fish shoals as such barriers hinder their upstream movements baumgartner 2007 agostinho et al 2012 since on a local scale river dolphins have been reported to be opportunistic generalist smith and reeves 2012 this might even serve more beneficial to dolphins as evidences of population increase in certain river segments between dams has also been reported paudel and koprowski 2020 positive influence of human footprint on dolphin distribution was actually inclined to moderate human footprint as depicted through the distribution of presence only data along human footprint dolphins have for long persisted in human dominated river systems and shown close association with sites of frequent human use such as bathing and washing ghats ferry ghats and cremation ghats mainly to feed on the fishes that get attracted to the foods offered by people sinha and kannan 2014 dolphins preferentially congregate at locations river channels with muddy rocky substrates and deep mid channel waters that are favored by local fishermen and vice versa this is due to higher biomass of small fish in dolphin congregating areas that in effect provide cues to the fishermen bashir et al 2010 kelkar et al 2010 besides dolphin preference for moderately fished sites with 2 6 boats km over sites that are fished heavily with 8 55 boats km has also been observed kelkar et al 2010 bashir et al 2012 such signs of tolerance to human activities indicate that certain degree of human footprint serves well for dolphins sinha and kannan 2014 studies so far have only described dolphin fisheries interactions their effects and risks our study is the first attempt to assess the threshold of human presence footprint desirable for dolphin occurrence such an assessment can act as a beneficial step forward towards striking a balance between dolphins and fisheries management and help reconcile dolphin conservation in a sustainable way 4 3 hotspots for dolphin conservation our models were helpful in identifying and prioritizing important areas for dolphins as an important step for effective conservation of riverine cetaceans paudel et al 2021 categorization of the priority areas into three tiers would further facilitate designing an efficient road map towards achieving this goal however keeping in view the current scenario of the pa network of the riverscape which merely accounts for less than 7 of the delineated 7945 42 sq km of priority area indicates a matter of serious concern demanding immediate conservation attention to safeguard the remaining patches of suitable habitat for dolphins this would require taking strong conservation initiatives at multiple scales and domains within and between the range countries as a first step we propose expansion of the current pa network as predicted under the first tier of prioritization by including at least 1 km area around the existing protected areas which would need a country wide initiative that is implemented at local and state levels among the range countries india in spite of having the maximum representation of the predicted suitable area less than 7 of it is protected at present which therefore demands for a more rigorous and wide spread effort for dolphin conservation in this region on the contrary although over 50 of highly suitable habitats in nepal fall in protected areas barriers to connectivity have potentially constrained the distribution of the species in the protected areas similarly in bangladesh less than 1 of predicted suitable habitat falling under protection here too efforts for increasing the extent of riverine protected area needs to be considered on priority in view of the reports of continued local extirpation from several smaller rivers and tributaries across the riverscape sinha and kannan 2014 paudel and koprowski 2020 immediate conservation and management actions seem mandatory to identify and address other related issues that expedite extirpation for example in nepal the segments above the koshi tappu wildlife reserve were identified as priority areas for conservation but dolphin population in the koshi river upstream of koshi barrage is noted to have undergone extirpation paudel and koprowski 2020 even though the model showed high probability of habitat suitability in this region high anthropogenic pressure seems to have driven the local population to extirpation likewise geruwa s river segment is identified as priority areas for conservation but the decreasing discharge over the past several years in the geruwa channel of karnali river which flows through the bardia national park has also reportedly led to the decline in dolphins in the national park moreover a major flood in 2010 also caused the channel to shift to karnali suggesting the new habitat to become an ecological trap khanal et al 2016 which the model could not reflect thus giving ways to a variety of other factors which in combination drive the extirpation events across the riverscape our proposal for immediate implementation of the first tier priority areas under protection is further supported by kelkar et al 2015 reporting similar population densities for the species in adjacent river reaches of vikramshila gangetic dolphin sanctuary in india irrespective of their protection status this notion has been further supported by non consideration of sanctuary for effective dolphin conservation braulik et al 2020 because of its associated threats and better promising habitat in its adjacent vicinity our model prediction also showed similar results indicating that large areas of the river outside the vikramshila gangetic dolphin sanctuary had high suitability for the species while some areas inside the sanctuary had low probability of dolphin occurrence thereby validating the robustness of our predictions under the first tier protection of second tier would require a comprehensive planning involving an international trans boundary cooperative approach in order to preserve the remaining 74 26 of the predicted priority area here each of the 11 identified conservation priority segments would demand separate attention and cooperation among the domain range countries for effective conservation of the dolphin habitat segment since inter basin water transfer projects namely national river linking project nrlp india and other large scale hydropower projects are planned in different river segments of the ganges brahmaputra meghna and karnaphuli sangu river systems these projects threaten to modify the already depleted and degraded dolphin habitat into major dredged shipping lanes kelkar 2017 and fragmented habitats this makes the identification of priority areas even more relevant to ensure systematic conservation of the species habitat such classification will enable prioritization of areas that need to be conserved and provide aid in river basin planning high level policy and strategic river basin planning has also been identified as a measure to reduce the threats faced by the species braulik et al 2021 based on our study the upper ganges represented least protected for the ganges river dolphin in terms of number and distance between protected areas with the exception of hastinapur wls this section represents the north western extent of the distribution of ganges river dolphin and losing those areas would mean large shrinkage in the dolphin distribution which is a serious conservation concern in nepal as well dolphin occurrence has gradually been rare in the chitwan national park upstream of the gandak barrrage this calls for a greater conservation effort in the upper ganges protection of the third tier priority area would depend on the successful accomplishment of the first and the second tier and should be considered part of a long term conservation program 4 4 methodological considerations and the way forward a more robust and precise model could be generated by the inclusion of instream covariates such as stream temperature center of flow mass ph conductivity habitat types etc variables that directly represent instream conditions are preferable in aquatic sdms austin 2002 but these are constrained by the logistical burden of developing water temperature and hydrology models our approach therefore seems to be the best possible output that could be generated with the given constraints this is further supported by mcgarvey et al 2018 stating that sdm predictions do not fundamentally differ when climate versus instream covariates stream temperature are used biotic factors also limit the distribution but the lack of variable information limited our prediction reliable estimates of biological variables such as phytoplankton and zooplanktons which are closely linked to cetacean prey along with their direct prey such as fishes macro invertebrates etc could also help improve modeling of dolphin habitat and potential distribution further the investigation of important issues such as impacts of construction of dams at certain locations could also aid in designing a precise model we could not use annual mean temperature in modeling because it showed a very high correlation 0 99 with elevation we tried modeling without hydrologically conditioned dem and used annual mean temperature instead but it did not have much variable importance so we decided to use only the hydrologically conditioned dem likewise in the sundarbans the river networks were not finely presented and hence did not have environmental variables this left with using resulted in only 26 25 eventually used after grid sampling out of 53 coordinates having environmental variable even after the 1 km pull this might have affected the prediction of priority areas in the sundarbans region and hence should not be considered conclusive the distribution models also have temporal variability but in this study we have only considered spatial distribution of the species studying the effect of variable change over time and how it induces change in the species distribution would certainly be of great interest and importance however at this time we are constrained by the lack of temporal environmental variables the non linear variables used in the analysis could have easily brought in variable non linear interactions and may have exerted strong variability into the output as well given the present constraints of non availability of temporal data such issues need to be resolved in future studies using appropriate datasets 5 conclusion our study has predicted the potential distribution of ganges river dolphin across its entire range with more suitable habitat of the species mostly noted in southern and eastern ganges brahmaputra meghna basin hydrologically conditioned dem came out as the most important variable determining the distribution of the species and moderate human footprint as suitable for higher presence of the species while merely around 7 of the predicted high suitability area was found to be under currently protected which highlights the graveness of the issue warranting immediate conservation attention the study is a step towards delivering evidence required for spatial risk assessments and conservation planning habitat suitability maps will certainly help to develop better management plans and strategies for the conservation of threatened species such as dolphin whose precarious situation has been further marginalized by rampant human induced modifications of its habitat over the years the classification of suitable habitats into three tiers of conservation will aid in making decision regarding prioritization of river segments for the conservation of the species therefore we recommend that the inferences drawn from our model predictions on hotspot areas must be implemented on priority to ensure species conservation besides our study also provides huge scope for further research to validate the quality of the predicted suitable areas at a finer scale this can certainly help towards developing a more precise and robust model for dolphin conservation in this riverscape we acknowledge the limitations in the present study but considering the dearth of such data availability at present for the region this is the best possible methodologically robust

24201,increasing reported outbreaks of african swine fever asf at wildlife livestock interfaces where wild pigs and or ticks interact with domestic pigs have led to an increased interest in understanding the transmission dynamics and effective control strategies of the disease in these places in such areas the transmission cycles of asf include a domestic pig cycle a tick domestic pig cycle and a wild pig tick domestic pig cycle a model that captures these cycles is used to explore the key parameters and control strategies vaccination isolation and or the use of an acaricide for disease transmission using latin hypercube sampling the tick mortality and recruitment rates are found to be the key parameters for the spread of asf numerical results show that early isolation of infected domestic pigs can be effective in controlling transmission only in the domestic pig cycle whereas the use of an acaricide applied as a single strategy is not effective for any cycle on the other hand a strategy that combines these two strategies is effective in controlling transmission for all cycles but its effectiveness is lower than that of the vaccination strategy thus at a wildlife livestock interface vaccination is the best strategy but where the vaccines are not yet available or affordable a strategy that combines isolation and the use of an acaricide can be applied to control asf transmission keywords african swine fever epidemiological drivers control strategies transmission cycles wildlife livestock interface data availability no data was used for the research described in the article 1 introduction pig production in africa involves herds mostly kept under traditional free range farming systems with rare tethering or housing penrith et al 2019 this type of farming facilitates the transmission of diseases which has negatively affected the growth of the african piggery sector the most devastating disease affecting the sector is african swine fever asf penrith et al 2013 it is a highly contagious disease of domestic and wild pigs caused by infection from the african swine fever virus asfv costard et al 2009 asf is classified by the world organisation for animal health oie as a notifiable disease due to its potential to spread and cause global economic impacts lee et al 2021 tulman et al 2009 currently asf is endemic in most parts of sub saharan africa where wild pigs warthogs and bushpigs and the soft tick vectors are present the ticks involved are of the genus ornithodoros and play an important role acting as biological reservoirs for asfv lee et al 2021 plowright et al 1969 outbreaks of asf are characterised by high mortality rates of up to 100 which can significantly reduce the household income of the farmers involved lee et al 2021 the disease can be transmitted by direct contact of naive and infected domestic pigs and by tick bites korennoy et al 2017 control strategies against the disease include confinement of pigs culling pigs on infected and neighbouring premises biosecurity measures movement restrictions costard et al 2009 barongo et al 2016 and recently vaccination global ag media 2022 in rural areas where the free range farming system is practised by smallholder farmers these control measures are rarely implemented barongo et al 2016 this has facilitated the spread and maintenance of asf in those areas at a wildlife livestock interface especially in east and southern africa where wild pigs and soft ticks are present this kind of farming system enhances the transmission of the disease between wild and domestic pigs controlling the disease at a wildlife livestock interface is very challenging due to the existence of different transmission cycles fig 1 which include a wild pig tick domestic pig cycle a tick domestic pig cycle and a domestic pig cycle without wild pigs and ticks jori and bastos 2009 designing targeted control strategies for these transmission cycles requires a careful analysis of their effectiveness thus in this study an ordinary differential equation mathematical model is used to analyse the effectiveness of the control strategies for the different transmission cycles of the disease mathematical models can be useful tools for stakeholders to evaluate the impacts of disease outbreaks and the effectiveness of control strategies i e vaccination culling movement restrictions

mugabi and duffy 2022 a deterministic model that accounts for all asf transmission cycles at a wildlife livestock interface was formulated the deterministic model was transformed into a stochastic

dynamics of the disease are determined using latin hypercube sampling 2 methods 2 1 model description in the model the total wild pig population n w t is divided into three epidemiological subpopulations susceptible s w t infected i w t and recovered immune r w t similarly the total domestic pig population n d t is divided into three subpopulations susceptible s d t infected i d t and recovered immune or isolated r d t the tick population n t t is divided into susceptible s t t and infected i t t sub populations a domestic pig can be infected either by direct contact with an infectious domestic pig at a rate of α d i d s d or by a bite from an infectious tick at a rate of β d i t s d n d a wild pig can only be infected by an infectious tick at a rate of β w i t s w n w a

equilibrium van den driessche and watmough 2002 mugabi et al 2019 the method requires determining the basic reproduction number r 0 if r 0 1 the disease free is stable and unstable if r 0 1 using the

van den driessche and watmough 2002 the following result is established result 1 the disease free equilibrium of the model 2 1 2 3 for the wild pig tick domestic pig cycle with α d 0 is locally asymptotically stable if r 0 w 1 and unstable if r 0 w 1 the threshold quantity r 0 w corresponds to the average number of new asf infections through the wild pig tick domestic pig transmission cycle without direct transmission between domestic pigs caused by a tick or a pig in its infectious period the term r t w measures the average number of new infections caused by transmissions between a wild pig and a tick whereas r t d measures those between a domestic pig and a tick similarly for the tick domestic pig transmission cycle obtained by setting the wild pig parameters to zero r 0 t r d r d 2 4 r t d 2 where r d α d λ d μ d t d again from theorem 2 of van den driessche and watmough 2002 result 2 the disease free equilibrium of the model 2 1 2 3 for the tick domestic pig cycle is locally asymptotically stable if r 0 t 1 and unstable if r 0 t 1 the term r d is the basic reproduction number corresponding to the domestic pig cycle epidemiologically results 1 and 2 imply that asf can be effectively controlled if r 0 w 1 or r 0 t 1 depending on the cycle this requirement of reducing the basic reproduction number to less than unity though necessary may not be enough for the control of the disease due to the existence of a backward bifurcation 3 1 3 backward bifurcation analysis backward bifurcation is a situation where stable disease free and endemic equilibria co exist for r 0 1 the possible existence of a backward bifurcation for the model 2 1 2 3 is explored using the centre manifold theorem theorem 3 in the appendix castillo chavez and song 2004 for simplicity a change in

with the largest impact on asf transmission for the different cycles this can help in determining the targeted control strategies for each transmission cycle for this analysis latin hypercube sampling lhs is used blower and dowlatabadi 1994 mckay et al 1979 saltelli et al 2004 the method requires generating multiple runs n for the model output r 0 for this study blower and dowlatabadi 1994 mckay et al 1979 the value of n is chosen such that n 4 3 m is satisfied where m is the number of uncertain parameters of the model blower and dowlatabadi 1994 mckay et al 1979 the parameters are assumed to follow a uniform distribution using the lhs method the partial rank correlation coefficient prcc values can be calculated a positive prcc value indicates that r 0 reduces when the associated parameter is decreased on the other hand a negative prcc implies that r 0 reduces when the corresponding parameter is increased r 0 is mostly sensitive to the parameters with prcc values less than 0 5 or greater than 0 5 taylor 1990 using the lhs method and the parameter ranges in table 1 the transmission cycle specific prcc values are calculated and summarised in table 2 the results in table 2 are depicted in fig 3 for the wild pig tick domestic pig cycle table 1 a and fig 3 a the parameters with the largest impact on r 0 are the mortality μ t and recruitment λ t rates of the tick of the remaining parameters the most influential are the infection rate of a tick by a wild pig λ w the infection rate of a wild pig by a tick β w the wild pig mortality rate μ w and the wild pig recruitment rate λ w the parameters λ t λ w β w and λ w have positive prcc values while μ t and μ w have negative prcc values for the tick domestic pig cycle table 1 b and fig 3 b the most influential parameters are the mortality μ t and recruitment λ t rates of the tick other parameters with influence include the infection rate of a domestic pig by a tick β d the domestic pig to domestic pig transmission rate α d the domestic pig recovery rate γ d and the infection rate of a tick by a domestic pig λ d apart from μ t and γ d the rest have positive prcc values 3 2 2 analysis of control strategies for asf at a wildlife livestock interface four control strategies are considered as follows i isolation strategy a the effects of isolating domestic pigs identified as infected on different days are studied the infected pigs are put in isolation centres where they remain until they have fully recovered since isolation shortens the infectious period the parameter γ d is used to study the effects of strategy a for instance 1 γ d 1 corresponds to a one day infectious period which is equivalent to isolation on day 1 the impacts of isolation on day 1 day 2 and day 7 on the cumulative number of infected domestic pigs d d for the different transmission cycles are given in fig 4 from fig 4 the isolation strategy has a large negative impact on the number of asf infections for the domestic pig cycle fig 4 a a small impact for the tick domestic pig cycle fig 4 b and a very small impact for the wild pig tick domestic pig cycle fig 4 c the impact is greatest when the control is implemented early enough on day 1 ii acaricide use strategy b this strategy involves increasing the mortality rate of ticks m u t from the baseline value of 0 4 to 10 or 50 through the use of an acaricide or other means the domestic pig cycle is not considered since it does not involve ticks from fig 5 a b increasing the mortality rate of ticks to 10 or 50 has a small effect on the cumulative number of infected domestic pigs for both cycles iii strategy c combines strategies a and c when there is a tick domestic pig cycle or a wild pig tick domestic pig cycle both strategies a and b have a small effect on d d their effects as a combined strategy acaricide use and isolating the infected domestic pigs in the presence of these cycles are explored for maximum benefits isolation is assumed to be done on day 1 from fig 6 a b when the use of an acaricide and the isolation of infected domestic pigs on day 1 are implemented concurrently the total number of infected domestic pigs significantly reduces with increasing tick mortality for both cycles iv vaccination of susceptible domestic pigs strategy d in this strategy the vaccine is assumed to give a maximum protection period of six months 1 η 180 days global ag media 2022 vaccination rates of ϕ 0 1 and ϕ 0 5 are used to study the effects of strategy d on the cumulative number of infected domestic pigs according to fig 7 a vaccination rate of 50 of susceptible domestic pigs significantly reduces the total number of infected domestic pigs regardless of the cycle 4 discussion in africa due to economic constraints domestic pigs are mostly raised in a free range traditional farming system penrith et al 2019 in areas where wild pigs bushpigs or warthogs and soft ticks argasidae are present this farming system leads to an increase in the spread of certain diseases such as african swine fever asf in east and southern africa where wild pigs and soft ticks are widely distributed three transmission cycles of asf exist a wild pig tick domestic pig cycle a tick domestic pig cycle and a domestic pig cycle without wild pigs and ticks jori and bastos 2009 these cycles limit the effectiveness of control measures for the disease in this article an ordinary differential equation model is used to assess the impacts of different control strategies vaccination isolation and or the use of an acaricide on the transmission cycles of asf at a wildlife livestock interface the model is also used to identify the key epidemiological parameters that drive the transmission dynamics of the disease using the centre manifold theorem it is shown that the model undergoes a backward bifurcation when the wild pig tick basic reproduction number r t w is less than unity this implies that control measures for asf depend on the initial numbers of infected wild pigs and ticks in affected areas thus for effective control of the disease mitigation measures should be applied during the early stages of an outbreak when the numbers of infected individuals are still small this is in agreement with studies on asf without wild pigs lee et al 2021 barongo et al 2016 o neill et al 2020 where it was shown that the control measures for the disease can be effective if they are implemented early enough using numerical simulations for the domestic pig cycle an isolation strategy has a significant negative impact on the number of infected domestic pigs fig 4 a the impact is greatest if isolation is implemented early especially on day 1 of an outbreak thus without ticks and wild pigs early isolation of infected domestic pigs is a good strategy for controlling asf outbreaks this is consistent with the result for backward bifurcation result 1 and the study by barongo et al 2016 which found that biosecurity measures implemented within 14 days of an outbreak can prevent a large number of pig deaths due to asf on the other hand if ticks and or wild pigs are present the strategy achieves very low results especially if both are present fig 4 b and c this implies that at a wildlife livestock interface or in areas where soft ticks are abundant isolation of infected domestic pigs is not a good strategy for controlling asf outbreaks for the tick domestic pig cycle when the use of an acaricide strategy b is considered only 10 of the infections are reduced fig 6 a this indicates that focusing control efforts on ticks alone cannot stop the spread of the disease transmission can continue by direct transmission domestic cycle however when isolation implemented on day 1 and the use of an acaracide are combined strategy c a significant number of infections are averted for both the tick domestic cycle fig 6 a and the wild pig tick domestic cycle fig 6 b this implies that a combination of isolation and the use of an acaricide can be a good strategy for controlling asf outbreaks at a wildlife livestock interface when vaccination of susceptible domestic pigs strategy d is considered all the cycles result in very small numbers of infections fig 7 a c this shows that vaccination can effectively control the spread of asf at a wildlife livestock interface regardless of the cycle for the domestic cycle the effectiveness of this strategy was also established by barongo et al 2016 who showed that vaccination can avert up to 65 of asf deaths in a free ranging domestic pig population from the results of global sensitivity analyses table 2 and fig 3 the parameters with the greatest influence on the magnitude of the basic reproduction number for both the wild pig tick domestic pig cycle fig 3 a and the tick domestic cycle fig 3 b are the mortality μ t and recruitment λ t rates of the tick these are important in the transmission of asf because soft ticks have a relatively high life expectancy 1 μ t which results in a viraemic period of at least 2 years endris and hess 1992 while recruitment λ t increases the tick population the positive prcc of λ t and the negative prcc of μ t indicate that interventions that decrease or increase these parameters respectively can minimise the spread of the disease a systemic ivermectin acaricide can be used to kill ticks that feed on pigs which also reduces the reproductive abilities of those that are not killed wild pigs can be fed on ivermectin treated corn which can be placed around their burrows in a related example to control an outbreak of human monocytic ehrlichiosis a tick borne disease that occurred in 1993 in cumberland county tennessee the lone star tick amblyomma americanum population was reduced by feeding the white tailed deer which are the reservoirs for the disease with acaricide laced corn gaff and gross 2007 other parameters with a significant influence on the wild pig tick domestic cycle are the infection rate of a tick by a wild pig λ w the infection rate of a wild pig by a tick β w the wild pig mortality rate μ w and the wild pig recruitment rate λ w table 2 a and fig 3 a transmission rates have also been shown in a study by hanley et al 2022 as critical in the outbreak of a wildlife disease the parameters λ w β w and λ w have positive prcc values that need to be decreased and μ w has a negative prcc that should be increased in order to control transmission reducing the population of ticks as suggested above automatically decreases λ w and β w while λ w and μ w can be decreased and increased respectively by culling the wild pigs culling of wild pigs was also shown in a study by o neill et al 2020 as an effective strategy for reducing asf transmission however as part of a biodiversity conservation programme killing wild pigs may not be a desirable strategy thus the other strategies suggested in this study can be considered for the tick domestic pig cycle table 2 b and fig 3 b other parameters with a large impact include the infection rate of a domestic pig by a tick β d the domestic pig to domestic pig transmission rate α d the domestic pig recovery removal rate γ d and the infection rate of a tick by a domestic pig λ d of these parameters only γ d has a negative prcc the parameters β d α d and λ d can all be decreased by vaccination of susceptible domestic pigs on the other hand γ d can be increased by considering isolation of infectious domestic pigs as early as possible on day 1 post infection based on these results in areas where wild pigs and or ticks can play a role in the transmission process of asf vaccination of susceptible domestic pigs is the most effective strategy but in a situation where commercial vaccines are not yet available as in many countries a combination of early isolation and the use of an acaricide ivermectin can be used to manage outbreaks in places where there are no wild pigs and soft ticks early isolation of infected domestic pigs can also be effective in curtailing the spread of the disease while the strategies considered in this article can be effective in controlling the disease their effectiveness may be limited by budgetary constraints thus by considering time dependent control parameters future studies could explore the cost effectiveness of these and other strategies to aid in designing sustainable control

24201,increasing reported outbreaks of african swine fever asf at wildlife livestock interfaces where wild pigs and or ticks interact with domestic pigs have led to an increased interest in understanding the transmission dynamics and effective control strategies of the disease in these places in such areas the transmission cycles of asf include a domestic pig cycle a tick domestic pig cycle and a wild pig tick domestic pig cycle a model that captures these cycles is used to explore the key parameters and control strategies vaccination isolation and or the use of an acaricide for disease transmission using latin hypercube sampling the tick mortality and recruitment rates are found to be the key parameters for the spread of asf numerical results show that early isolation of infected domestic pigs can be effective in controlling transmission only in the domestic pig cycle whereas the use of an acaricide applied as a single strategy is not effective for any cycle on the other hand a strategy that combines these two strategies is effective in controlling transmission for all cycles but its effectiveness is lower than that of the vaccination strategy thus at a wildlife livestock interface vaccination is the best strategy but where the vaccines are not yet available or affordable a strategy that combines isolation and the use of an acaricide can be applied to control asf transmission keywords african swine fever epidemiological drivers control strategies transmission cycles wildlife livestock interface data availability no data was used for the research described in the article 1 introduction pig production in africa involves herds mostly kept under traditional free range farming systems with rare tethering or housing penrith et al 2019 this type of farming facilitates the transmission of diseases which has negatively affected the growth of the african piggery sector the most devastating disease affecting the sector is african swine fever asf penrith et al 2013 it is a highly contagious disease of domestic and wild pigs caused by infection from the african swine fever virus asfv costard et al 2009 asf is classified by the world organisation for animal health oie as a notifiable disease due to its potential to spread and cause global economic impacts lee et al 2021 tulman et al 2009 currently asf is endemic in most parts of sub saharan africa where wild pigs warthogs and bushpigs and the soft tick vectors are present the ticks involved are of the genus ornithodoros and play an important role acting as biological reservoirs for asfv lee et al 2021 plowright et al 1969 outbreaks of asf are characterised by high mortality rates of up to 100 which can significantly reduce the household income of the farmers involved lee et al 2021 the disease can be transmitted by direct contact of naive and infected domestic pigs and by tick bites korennoy et al 2017 control strategies against the disease include confinement of pigs culling pigs on infected and neighbouring premises biosecurity measures movement restrictions costard et al 2009 barongo et al 2016 and recently vaccination global ag media 2022 in rural areas where the free range farming system is practised by smallholder farmers these control measures are rarely implemented barongo et al 2016 this has facilitated the spread and maintenance of asf in those areas at a wildlife livestock interface especially in east and southern africa where wild pigs and soft ticks are present this kind of farming system enhances the transmission of the disease between wild and domestic pigs controlling the disease at a wildlife livestock interface is very challenging due to the existence of different transmission cycles fig 1 which include a wild pig tick domestic pig cycle a tick domestic pig cycle and a domestic pig cycle without wild pigs and ticks jori and bastos 2009 designing targeted control strategies for these transmission cycles requires a careful analysis of their effectiveness thus in this study an ordinary differential equation mathematical model is used to analyse the effectiveness of the control strategies for the different transmission cycles of the

dynamics of the disease are determined using latin hypercube sampling 2 methods 2 1 model description in the model the total wild pig population n w t is divided into three epidemiological subpopulations susceptible s w t infected i w t and recovered immune r w t similarly the total domestic pig population n d t is divided into three subpopulations susceptible s d t infected i d t and recovered immune or isolated r d t the tick population n t t is divided into susceptible s t t and infected i t t sub populations a domestic pig can be infected either by direct contact with an infectious domestic pig at a rate of α d i d s d or by a bite from an infectious tick at a rate of β d i t s d n d a wild pig can only be infected by an infectious tick at a rate of β w i t s w n w a tick on the other hand can become infected by biting an infectious wild pig at a rate of λ w s t i w n w or a domestic pig at a rate of λ d s t i d n d the flow diagram for transmission dynamics of

equilibrium van den driessche and watmough 2002 mugabi et al 2019 the method requires determining the basic reproduction number r 0 if r 0 1 the disease free is stable and unstable if r 0 1 using the same notations as in mugabi et al 2020 2021b a the matrices f and v for the new infection and transfer terms are respectively given by f 0 0 β w 0 α d λ d μ d β d λ w λ t μ w λ w μ t λ d λ t μ d λ d μ

van den driessche and watmough 2002 the following result is established result 1 the disease free equilibrium of the model 2 1 2 3 for the wild pig tick domestic pig cycle with α d 0 is locally asymptotically stable if r 0 w 1 and unstable if r 0 w 1 the threshold quantity r 0 w corresponds to the average number of new asf infections through the wild pig tick domestic pig transmission cycle without direct transmission between domestic pigs caused by a tick or a pig in its infectious period the term r t w measures the average number of new infections caused by transmissions between a wild pig and a tick whereas r t d measures those between a domestic pig and a tick similarly for the tick domestic pig transmission cycle obtained by setting the wild pig parameters to zero r 0 t r d r d 2

asymptotically stable if r 0 t 1 and unstable if r 0 t 1 the term r d is the basic reproduction number corresponding to the domestic pig cycle epidemiologically results 1 and 2 imply that asf can be effectively controlled if r 0 w 1 or r 0 t 1 depending on the cycle this requirement of reducing the basic reproduction number to less than unity though necessary may not be enough for the control of the disease due to the existence of a backward bifurcation 3 1 3 backward bifurcation analysis backward bifurcation is a situation where stable disease free and endemic equilibria co exist for r 0 1 the possible existence of a backward bifurcation for the model 2 1 2 3 is explored using the centre manifold theorem theorem 3 in the appendix castillo chavez and song 2004 for simplicity a change in

with the largest impact on asf transmission for the different cycles this can help in determining the targeted control strategies for each transmission cycle for this analysis latin hypercube sampling lhs is used blower and dowlatabadi 1994 mckay et al 1979 saltelli et al 2004 the method requires generating multiple runs n for the model output r 0 for this study blower and dowlatabadi 1994 mckay et al 1979 the value of n is chosen such that n 4 3 m is satisfied where m is the number of uncertain parameters of the model blower and dowlatabadi 1994 mckay et al 1979 the parameters are assumed to follow a uniform distribution using the lhs method the partial rank correlation coefficient prcc values can be calculated a positive prcc value indicates that r 0 reduces when the associated parameter is decreased on the other hand a negative prcc implies that r 0 reduces when the corresponding parameter is increased r 0 is mostly sensitive to the parameters with prcc values less than 0 5 or greater than 0 5 taylor 1990 using the lhs method and the parameter ranges in table 1 the transmission cycle specific prcc values are calculated and summarised in table 2 the results in table 2 are depicted in fig 3 for the wild pig tick domestic pig cycle table 1 a and fig 3 a the parameters with the largest impact on r 0 are the mortality μ t and recruitment λ t rates of the tick of the remaining parameters the most influential are the infection rate of a tick by a wild pig λ w the infection rate of a wild pig by a tick β w the wild pig mortality rate μ w and the wild pig recruitment rate λ w the parameters λ t λ w β w and λ w have positive prcc values while μ t and μ w have negative prcc values for the tick domestic pig cycle table 1 b and fig 3 b the most influential parameters are the mortality μ t and recruitment λ t rates of the tick other parameters with influence include the infection rate of a domestic pig by a tick β d the domestic pig to domestic pig transmission rate α d the domestic pig recovery rate γ d and the infection rate of a tick by a domestic pig λ d apart from μ t and γ d the rest have positive prcc values 3 2 2 analysis of control strategies for asf at a wildlife livestock interface four control strategies are considered as follows i isolation strategy a the effects of isolating domestic pigs identified as infected on different days are studied the infected pigs are put in isolation centres where they remain until they have fully recovered since isolation shortens the infectious period the parameter γ d is used to study the effects of strategy a for instance 1 γ d 1 corresponds to a one day infectious period which is equivalent to isolation on day 1 the impacts of isolation on day 1 day 2 and day 7 on the cumulative number of infected domestic pigs d d for the different transmission cycles are given in fig 4 from fig 4 the isolation strategy has a large negative impact on the number of asf infections for the domestic pig cycle fig 4 a a small impact for the tick domestic pig cycle fig 4 b and a very small impact for the wild pig tick domestic pig cycle fig 4 c the impact is greatest when the control is implemented early enough on day 1 ii acaricide use strategy b this strategy involves increasing the mortality rate of ticks m u t from the baseline value of 0 4 to 10 or 50 through the use of an acaricide or other means the domestic pig cycle is not considered since it does not involve ticks from fig 5 a b increasing the mortality rate of ticks to 10 or 50 has a small effect on the cumulative number of infected domestic pigs for both cycles iii strategy c combines strategies a and c when there is a tick domestic pig cycle or a wild pig tick domestic pig cycle both strategies a and b have a small effect on d d their effects as a combined strategy acaricide use and isolating the infected domestic pigs in the presence of these cycles are explored for maximum benefits isolation is assumed to be done on day 1 from fig 6 a b when the use of an acaricide and the isolation of infected domestic pigs on day 1 are implemented concurrently the total number of infected domestic pigs significantly reduces with increasing tick mortality for both cycles iv vaccination of susceptible domestic pigs strategy d in this strategy the vaccine is assumed to give a maximum protection period of six months 1 η 180 days global ag media 2022 vaccination rates of ϕ 0 1 and ϕ 0 5 are used to study the effects of strategy d on the cumulative number of infected domestic pigs according to fig 7 a vaccination rate of 50 of susceptible domestic pigs significantly reduces the total number of infected domestic pigs regardless of the cycle 4 discussion in africa due to economic constraints domestic pigs are mostly raised in a free range traditional farming system penrith et al 2019 in areas where wild pigs bushpigs or warthogs and soft ticks argasidae are present this farming system leads to an increase in the spread of certain diseases such as african swine fever asf in east and southern africa where wild pigs and soft ticks are widely distributed three transmission cycles of asf exist a wild pig tick domestic pig cycle a tick domestic pig cycle and a domestic pig cycle without wild pigs and ticks jori and bastos 2009 these cycles limit the effectiveness of control measures for the disease in this article an ordinary differential equation model is used to assess the impacts of different control strategies vaccination isolation and or the use of an acaricide on the transmission cycles of asf at a wildlife livestock interface the model is also used to identify the key epidemiological parameters that drive the transmission dynamics of the disease using the centre manifold theorem it is shown that the model undergoes a backward bifurcation when the wild pig tick basic reproduction number r t w is less than unity this implies that control measures for asf depend on the initial numbers of infected wild pigs and ticks in affected areas thus for effective control of the disease mitigation measures should be applied during the early stages of an outbreak when the numbers of infected individuals are still small this is in agreement with studies on asf without wild pigs lee et al 2021 barongo et al 2016 o neill et al 2020 where it was shown that the control measures for the disease can be effective if they are implemented early enough using numerical simulations for the domestic pig cycle an isolation strategy has a significant negative impact on the number of infected domestic pigs fig 4 a the impact is greatest if isolation is implemented early especially on day 1 of an outbreak thus without ticks and wild pigs early isolation of infected domestic pigs is a good strategy for controlling asf outbreaks this is consistent with the result for backward bifurcation result 1 and the study by barongo et al 2016 which found that biosecurity measures implemented within 14 days of an outbreak can prevent a large number of pig deaths due to asf on the other hand if ticks and or wild pigs are present the strategy achieves very low results especially if both are present fig 4 b and c this implies that at a wildlife livestock interface or in areas where soft ticks are abundant isolation of infected domestic pigs is not a good strategy for controlling asf outbreaks for the tick domestic pig cycle when the use of an acaricide strategy b is considered only 10 of the infections are reduced fig 6 a this indicates that focusing control efforts on ticks alone cannot stop the spread of the disease transmission can continue by direct transmission domestic cycle however when isolation implemented on day 1 and the use of an acaracide are combined strategy c a significant number of infections are averted for both the tick domestic cycle fig 6 a and the wild pig tick domestic cycle fig 6 b this implies that a combination of isolation and the use of an acaricide can be a good strategy for controlling asf outbreaks at a wildlife livestock interface when vaccination of susceptible domestic pigs strategy d is considered all the cycles result in very small numbers of infections fig 7 a c this shows that vaccination can effectively control the spread of asf at a wildlife livestock interface regardless of the cycle for the domestic cycle the effectiveness of this strategy was also established by barongo et al 2016 who showed that vaccination can avert up to 65 of asf deaths in a free ranging domestic pig population from the results of global sensitivity analyses table 2 and fig 3 the parameters with the greatest influence on the magnitude of the basic reproduction number for both the wild pig tick domestic pig cycle fig 3 a and the tick domestic cycle fig 3 b are the mortality μ t and recruitment λ t rates of the tick these are important in the transmission of asf because soft ticks have a relatively high life expectancy 1 μ t which results in a viraemic period of at least 2 years endris and hess 1992 while recruitment λ t increases the tick population the positive prcc of λ t and the negative prcc of μ t indicate that interventions that decrease or increase these parameters respectively can minimise the spread of the disease a systemic ivermectin acaricide can be used to kill ticks that feed on pigs which also reduces the reproductive abilities of those that are not killed wild pigs can be fed on ivermectin treated corn which can be placed around their burrows in a related example to control an outbreak of human monocytic ehrlichiosis a tick borne disease that occurred in 1993 in cumberland county tennessee the lone star tick amblyomma americanum population was reduced by feeding the white tailed deer which are the reservoirs for the disease with acaricide laced corn gaff and gross 2007 other parameters with a significant influence on the wild pig tick domestic cycle are the infection rate of a tick by a wild pig λ w the infection rate of a wild pig by a tick β w the wild pig mortality rate μ w and the wild pig recruitment rate λ w table 2 a and fig 3 a transmission rates have also been shown in a study by hanley et al 2022 as critical in the outbreak of a wildlife disease the parameters λ w β w and λ w have positive prcc values that need to be decreased and μ w has a negative prcc that should be increased in order to control transmission reducing the population of ticks as suggested above automatically decreases λ w and β w while λ w and μ w can be decreased and increased respectively by culling the wild pigs culling of wild pigs was also shown in a study by o neill et al 2020 as an effective strategy for reducing asf transmission however as part of a biodiversity conservation programme killing wild pigs may not be a desirable strategy thus the other strategies suggested in this study can be considered for the tick domestic pig cycle table 2 b and fig 3 b other parameters with a large impact include the infection rate of a domestic pig by a tick β d the domestic pig to domestic pig transmission rate α d the domestic pig recovery removal rate γ d and the infection rate of a tick by a domestic pig λ d of these parameters only γ d has a negative prcc the parameters β d α d and λ d can all be decreased by vaccination of susceptible domestic pigs on the other hand γ d can be increased by considering isolation of infectious domestic pigs as early as possible on day 1 post infection based on these results in areas where wild pigs and or ticks can play a role in the transmission process of asf vaccination of susceptible domestic pigs is the most effective strategy but in a situation where commercial vaccines are not yet available as in many countries a combination of early isolation and the use of an acaricide ivermectin can be used to manage outbreaks in places where there are no wild pigs and soft ticks early isolation of infected domestic pigs can also be effective in curtailing the spread of the disease while the strategies considered in this article can be effective in controlling the disease their effectiveness may be limited by budgetary constraints thus by considering time dependent control parameters future studies could explore the cost effectiveness of these and other strategies to aid in designing sustainable control

24202,boreal ecosystems account for 29 of the world s total forested area and contain more carbon than any other terrestrial biome over the past 60 years alaska has warmed twice as rapidly as the contiguous u s and wildfire activity has increased including the number of fires area burned and frequency of large wildfire seasons these recent and rapid changes in climate and wildfire have implications for future vegetation composition structure and biomass in interior alaska given that the vegetation is highly dependent on active layer thickness soil moisture organic layer depth and plant available nutrients here we developed a new succession extension dgs of the landis ii forest landscape model which integrates a vegetation dynamics model necn with a soil carbon model damm mcnip a hydrologic model shaw and a deep soil profile permafrost model gipl in a spatially explicit framework dgs succession uses the algorithms in the necn succession extension of landis ii to simulate growth mortality and reproduction of vegetation but has three major improvements first the simple bucket model in necn was replaced with a physically based model shaw that simulates energy and water fluxes e g snow depth evapotranspiration soil moisture at multiple levels in the canopy and soil second the active slow and passive soil pools in necn were replaced by seven soil pools that are measurable in the field with carbon and nitrogen dynamics dictated by damm mcnip finally soil temperature and soil moisture are simulated only at one depth in necn but in dgs soil temperature and hence permafrost dynamics are simulated at as many as 50 user defined depths down to 4 m with shaw and 75 m with gipl during the initial calibration phase dgs was applied at three inventory sites at the bonanza creek long term ecological research area in interior alaska where climate forcings species biomass soil temperature and or soil moisture were available for the landscape scale simulations dgs was run with the scrpple fire extension of landis ii under two scenarios of climate using a 400 000 ha landscape that included the inventory sites across all three sites dgs generally captured the variation in soil moisture and temperature across depths seasons and years reasonably well though there were some discrepancies at each site dgs had better agreement with field measurements of soil moisture and temperature than its predecessor necn which produced unrealistically low soil moisture and unrealistically high seasonal fluctuations in soil temperature at the landscape scale ignitions area burned and soil temperature increased under climate change as expected while soil moisture was relatively unchanged across climate scenarios biomass tended to decline under climate change which differs from other modeling studies in this region but is consistent with the browning trends observed from remote sensing data simulating climate vegetation succession hydrology permafrost carbon and

now covers about 40 of boreal alaska van cleve et al 1983 interior alaska also supports prevalent deciduous broadleaf trees such as trembling aspen populus tremuloides michx alaskan paper birch betula neoalaskana sarg and balsam poplar populus balsamifera l wildfire is the primary disturbance in the boreal forests of alaska and around the world now payette 1992 and for the past thousands of years higuera et al 2009b hoecker et al 2020 kelly et al 2013 lynch et al 2003b climate warming has increased fire activity in the circumboreal forest m d flannigan et al 2009 lynch et al 2003 and in alaska calef et al 2015 duffy et al 2005 including a 50 increase in overwintering aka zombie fires scholten et al 2021 the average number of fires per year in alaska has expanded from 125 in the 1940 s to 461 in the 2000 s hinzman et al 2013 ignition density has increased by 4 8 each year since 1975 veraverbeke et al 2017 this is due in part to increases in the length of the fire season with significant increases in the number of days with lightning ignitions since the late 1950 s in boreal north america coogan et al 2020 area burned doubled from the 1960s 1970s to the 1980s 1990s in boreal north america kasischke and turetsky 2006 and increased by 4 6 fold in interior alaska since 1943 calef et al 2015 in some areas of alaska the fire return interval has decreased from 120 1100 years johnstone et al 2010a van cleve and viereck 1981 to less than 50 years brown and johnstone 2012 johnstone and chapin 2006 as wildfire activity increases in alaska it becomes more important than ever to use fire simulators that capture the temporal resolution spatial interactivity vegetation and climate integration necessary to capture future changes in the fire regime some fire models use monthly e g tem balshi et al 2009 rather than daily data to capture ignition rates do not simulate fire spread from one raster pixel to another e g uafme foster et al 2019 mc1 bachelet et al 2005 omit shrubs mosses and lichen as fuel types e g fvs ffe rebain 2010 or rely on user defined fire return interval e g uafme foster et al 2019 preventing climate driven changes in intervals models like scrpple scheller et al 2019 that use daily data simulate fire spread using cell automata recognize that understory species as important fuel types and have a tight coupling to climate without fixed fire return intervals can aid in predicting future changes in wildfire regimes under a changing climate changes in the wildfire regime in alaska have started to break the 6000 year legacy lock of spruce domination hoy et al 2016 johnstone et al 2010b increasingly favoring hardwood species with longer dispersal distances and shorter times to sexual maturity black spruce has seeding distances less than 1 km whereas aspen and birch can disperse several kilometers from the parent tree burns and honkala 1990 marquis et al 1969 mccaughey et al 1986 also as the prevalence of short interval fires increase in alaska buma et al 2022 sites can suffer from immaturity risk because the fire free periods are too short for conifer seed production keeley et al 1999 black spruce has low rates of seed production and cone serotiny until it reaches sexual maturity 30 years old buma et al 2013 burns and honkala 1990 and often requires at least 50 years to accumulate sufficient seed for stand self replacement after fire viglas et al 2013 in contrast alder quaking aspen and paper birch initiate seed production at 5 10 and 15 years old respectively germination success and recruitment rates also influence the effectiveness of conifer self replacement a long fire return interval allows sufficient time for the thick organic seedbeds to develop which present a barrier for small deciduous seeds but not larger seeded conifers to reach the stable moisture supply in the mineral soil hesketh et al 2009 however sites with short interval fires have thinner organic layers and more exposed mineral soil shabaga et al 2022 which favors deciduous species like aspen jasinski and payette 2005 johnstone and chapin 2006 many models represent vegetation as broad vegetation types afresco tem ecosys and do not simulate seed dispersal or vegetative reproduction e g tem which may not fully capture the species level traits and reproductive strategies that determine long term successional trends in the boreal forests of interior alaska forest type wildfire and soil moisture are the most important agents controlling the thickness of the organic horizon johnstone et al 2010a which is the primary determinant controlling the aggradation or degradation of permafrost viereck 1982 permafrost soil with a temperature at or below 0 c for at least two consecutive years underlies approximately 75 80 of the ground in interior alaska osterkamp and romanovsky 1999 cooler and wetter areas such as north facing and toe slope forests are more likely to contain permafrost than warmer and drier south facing slopes hinzman et al 2006 shallow permafrost and thick organic horizons are often associated with black spruce forests and lowlands where soils are moist because evapotranspiration rates are low due to low productivity bonan 1991 liu et al 2005 decomposition is low due to anoxia and cold temperatures hobbie et al 2000 schimel and clein 1996 and mosses are prevalent and have high water retention capacity turetsky et al 2010 broadleaf forests more prevalent on warm well drained soils often have thinner organic horizons and less moss understory natalia et al 2008 van cleve and viereck 1981 due to higher evapotranspiration and decomposition rates associated with higher productivity bonan 1991 liu et al 2005 thereby causing greater fluctuations in summer temperatures and lacking permafrost most permafrost models like gipl2 capture the effects of forest type on permafrost nicolsky et al 2009 but lack dynamic vegetation wildfire and hydrology modules that capture potential changes in species composition wildfire and soil moisture that drive long term changes in permafrost wildfire also influences permafrost through its effects on surface energy balance following wildfire the thickness of the organic horizon is reduced causing a significant increase in the thermal conductivity of soil and an increase in active layer thickness the portion of the soil above the permafrost that thaws and freezes seasonally jafarov et al 2013 permafrost tends to return 20 30 years after low severity fire as the forest floor begins to develop and mosses regain dominance bernhardt et al 2011 viereck et al 2008 in areas with high severity fire where larger amounts of the surface organic material are combusted permafrost may disappear from the upper few meters of soil yoshikawa et al 2003 across interior alaska permafrost soils are often right at the cusp of thawing with temperatures usually ranging from 0 1 to 3 5 c jorgenson et al 2010 osterkamp and romanovsky 1999 due in part to recent climate warming hinzman et al 2006 osterkamp and romanovsky 1999 rising temperatures in alaska are likely to cause longer fire seasons jolly et al 2015 kasischke et al 2010 and increases in the frequency and severity of fires h genet et al 2013 kasischke et al 2010 which can cause permafrost thaw nicolsky et al 2007 also as temperatures rise and fire frequency increases active layer thickness increases and the depth to permafrost increases enabling soil water to drain deeper into the soil profile recent warming has also caused earlier snowmelt and later freeze up which have lengthened the growing season in interior alaska sharratt 1992 and increased the potential for drought barber et al 2000 especially when coupled with the changes in depth to permafrost and hence altering wildfire dynamics recent efforts to quantify the effects of climate change and wildfire on boreal alaska have specifically highlighted the need to improve our understanding of the interactions between climate fire vegetation hydrology and soils alexander and mack 2016 a c foster et al 2019 rogers et al 2015 in the past ecosystem models such as alfresco tem ecosys uvafme and iland have been used to simulate climate vegetation fire interactions in alaska euskirchen et al 2009 h genet et al 2013 mekonnen et al 2019 rupp et al 2007 but they have several limitations for example afresco tem and ecosys classify vegetation into vegetation types and therefore do not capture species competitive dynamics individual based gap models like uvafme university of virginia forest model enhanced are able to capture species dynamics in interior alaska but they do not simulate spatially interactive processes like seed dispersal and wildfire spread foster et al 2022a a c 2019 the model iland simulates spatially interactive species growth tree dispersal and wildfire spread at the individual tree level hansen et al 2021 but it primarily focuses on aboveground processes with soil moisture simulated for a single layer using a simple bucket model seidl et al 2012 uvafme simulates soil moisture at two depths organic and mineral layers a c foster et al 2019 whereas tem alfresco tem and ecosys simulate soil moisture at multiple depths including the depth of the water table dimitrov et al 2010 yi et al 2009 permafrost dynamics are captured in all these models except iland uvafme a c foster et al 2019 dos tem genet et al 2013 and ecosys mekonnen et al 2019 simulate the effects of wildfire on the depth of burn though in ecosys it is a spatially homogenous user defined input in this paper we describe a new succession extension damm mcnip gipl shaw henceforth dgs of the landis ii forest landscape model scheller et al 2007 that greatly expands our ability to simulate climate species level succession hydrology permafrost carbon and nutrient cycling and wildfire in a spatially explicit framework dgs succession uses the algorithms in the necn net ecosystem carbon and nitrogen succession extension of landis ii to simulate growth mortality and reproduction of vegetation but the potential drivers of growth e g soil temperature available soil moisture and available nitrogen were updated the simple water bucket model in necn was replaced with a physically based model simultaneous heat and water balance model shaw flerchinger et al 2016a flerchinger and cooley

evapotranspiration soil moisture at multiple strata in the canopy and up to 49 user defined depths in the soil down to 4 m the active slow and passive soil pools in necn were replaced by seven soil pools that are measurable in the field soil organic c and n dissolved organic c and n microbial biomass c and n and extracellular enzymes with carbon and nitrogen dynamics dictated by the algorithms in the damm mcnip dual arrhenius michaelis menton carbon and nitrogen physiology model abramoff et al 2017a a deep soil profile permafrost model geophysical institute permafrost laboratory gipl version 2 0 nicolsky et al 2009 was integrated into dgs to simulate soil temperature at up to 50 user defined depths down to 75 m recoding these published models of soil c hydrology and permafrost from fortran shaw and gipl and r damm to the c framework of landis ii enabled us to simulate integrated dynamic responses and spatially explicit feedbacks using models that were already well established and fully vetted the dgs extension was calibrated using four sites in interior alaska and then used to simulate current and future vegetation hydrology and permafrost in a 397 860 hectare landscape in interior alaska at a 200 m 200 m grid resolution in this paper our objective was to assess how soil moisture soil temperature vegetation and soil c may be altered by climate change and illustrate how the future dynamics of alaskan ecosystems can be simulated using dgs a tightly coupled model of climate vegetation soil including organic layers and permafrost hydrology and wildfire 2 methods 2 1 model overview our new succession extension described below was integrated within landis ii an open source spatially explicit process based simulation framework that is optimized for large scale spatial dynamics scheller et al 2007 in landis ii the landscape consists of interconnected grid cells each cell contains species age cohorts of trees and is assigned to a climate region within which climate is assumed to be homogenous mladenoff 2004 tree growth and mortality are not spatially interactive i e competition between cohorts occurs within a cell but reproduction e g seed dispersal and disturbances are spatially interactive this robust framework allows multiple ecological processes e g growth mortality regeneration decomposition and disturbances to change in space and time allowing for potential overlap to capture interactions between processes scheller et al 2007 landis ii has been widely adopted for use in climate change research in the boreal forests of siberian russia gustafson et al 2011 2010 british columbia dymond et al 2016 and newfoundland labrador sturtevant et al 2009 dgs pronounced digs was created to improve the simulation of forest dynamics in the boreal region of western north america dgs integrates climate vegetation permafrost and hydrology within a spatially explicit framework that interfaces with an existing wildfire extension which simulates ignitions spread and severity fig 1 all model code is available at https github com landis ii foundation extension dgs succession and information about inputs and outputs are provided in the associated user guide model inputs used for this study are available at https github com landis ii foundation reburnsak 2 2 climate the landis ii climate library lucash and scheller 2021 which processes the climate input data for landis ii was modified to add specific humidity and shortwave radiation as input variables because they are required for shaw s energy and water balance algorithms lucash and scheller 2021 an algorithm to convert specific humidity to dewpoint temperature was also added american meteorological society 2020 2 3 aboveground vegetation dynamics dgs succession uses the algorithms in the necn succession extension of landis ii scheller et al 2012 2011 to simulate monthly forest above and belowground plant growth and associated carbon c and nitrogen n cycling dgs simulates aboveground leaves and wood and belowground fine and coarse roots productivity of each cohort on each raster cell to calculate cohort growth within a cell it uses species specific life history attributes e g longevity shade tolerance climate age competition i e the biomass of other cohorts relative to the amount of maximum potential biomass water availability n availability and soil temperature while dgs simulates growth mortality and reproduction of vegetation with the same algorithms as necn the computations for water availability nitrogen availability and soil temperature are different necn relies on the simple water bucket model of century parton et al 1994 1988 to compute soil moisture but dgs uses a physically based model shaw that simulates simultaneous energy and water fluxes including soil moisture dynamics at multiple depths in the soil see below nitrogen availability is also calculated differently in dgs the algorithms in necn century were replaced with damm mcnip see below century uses a simple algorithm to derive soil temperature from air temperature but dgs uses gipl which solves a nonlinear heat flow equation to calculate soil temperature at multiple depths in the soil see below as in necn dgs simulates tree mortality caused by senescence ongoing loss of trees and branches age to account for the increase in mortality as a species approaches its life expectancy and disturbances described below it also simulates regeneration via seeds serotiny or re sprouting using life history attributes regeneration in dgs is identical to necn scheller et al 2007 except that the water available for seedlings to regenerate is calculated by shaw see below 2 4 belowground soil dynamics soil carbon dynamics in necn were derived from century parton et al 1994 1988 in dgs century was replaced by damm mcnip abramoff et al 2017 a new hybrid model of damm dual arrenius michaelis menton davidson et al 2014 2012 and microbial carbon and nitrogen physiology model mcnip described in finzi et al 2015 in contrast to century which measures carbon and nitrogen cycling in theoretical active slow and passive soil pools damm mcnip explicitly simulates measurable c and n pools and fluxes in soil using physiological principles with relatively low parameter collinearity abramoff et al 2017 damm mcnip tracks seven pools soil organic c soc and n son dissolved organic c doc and n don microbial biomass c and n and extracellular enzymes abramoff et al 2017 litter inputs are partitioned evenly between soil organic matter som and dissolved organic matter dom pools each month for both c and n soil cn pools are responsive to changes in soil temperature soil moisture oxygen concentrations and substrate cn stoichiometry temperature affects the rate of som depolymerization to dom using arrhenius kinetics soil water content modifies the supply of oxygen and dom both of which affect depolymerization using a michaelis menten m m i e dual monod kinetic approximation oxygen concentration limits the depolymerization rate when soil water content is high while the litter inputs limit depolymerization when soil water content is low because the substrate cannot diffuse to the reaction site microbial uptake is limited by both doc and don substrate and oxygen concentration using m m kinetics with uptake partitioned in the microbial pool among maintenance growth and enzyme production enzyme production can be limited by stoichiometry of microbial c or n all model pools and fluxes are calculated internally within the model dgs outputs are soc and son doc and don inorganic n respiration and n mineralization 2 5 hydrology within the dgs extension shaw simulates energy and water fluxes through the vertical soil vegetation atmosphere continuum flerchinger et al 2016a flerchinger and cooley 2000 flerchinger and saxton 1989 accounting for the effects of snow surface vegetation and litter on subsurface water and energy dynamics at a daily time step shaw simulates 1 snow accumulation and ablation of a multi layer snowpack using a complete energy balance flerchinger et al 1994 2 surface runoff and infiltration using the richard s equation for unsaturated flow richardson 1922 3 evapotranspiration using gradient flow through a multi layer canopy flerchinger et al 2016b and 4 transpiration governed by user defined vegetation structural and water use characteristics including jarvis stewart type controls of stomatal resistance armatas et al 2018 jarvis 1976 stewart 1988 shaw has been used to simulate water and energy transfer through forest and shrub canopies for a wide range of climate and vegetation conditions in complex terrain chauvin et al 2011 flerchinger et al 2016c link et al 2004 marshall et al 2019 it has also been used to simulate the effects of fire on a seasonally frozen system in southwestern idaho flerchinger et al 2016c discontinuous permafrost at the wolf creek and scotty creek boreal research sites in canada zhang et al 2010 and soil moisture and temperature dynamics at multiple sites in interior boreal alaska marshall et al 2021b 2021a the strength of shaw lies in its physically based approach to simulating the coupled transfer of energy and water at a daily timestep including soil moisture and soil temperature dynamics at up to 65 soil depths however the one dimensional nature of shaw means that dgs is most appropriately applied in areas where net lateral flows are minimal 2 6 permafrost dynamics the gipl model within dgs solves a nonlinear heat flow equation with phase change and has been specifically developed to simulate spatially distributed permafrost dynamics marchenko et al 2008 nicolsky et al 2007 sergueev et al 2003 in a wide range of climatic conditions across alaska e g debolskiy et al 2020 jafarov et al 2012 nicolsky et al 2017 gipl is forced by daily air temperature and snowpack conditions to simulate phase changes with prescribed accuracy a special enthalpy based formulation of the energy conservation law allows simulation of phase change processes without loss of latent heat effects nicolsky et al 2009 soil properties including heat capacity and thermal conductivity were typically based on the water and ice content in the ground material in previous versions of gipl but in dgs water and ice content are inherited from shaw some water is assumed to remain liquid below 0 c its content is defined empirically according to the ground temperature romanovsky and osterkamp 2000 the modeling domain is discretized on a regular grid with ground thermal properties parameterized according to the dominant vegetation type of each cell nicolsky et al 2017 the soil properties for each vegetation type are prescribed either by the data assimilation techniques or set according to published literature and modeling results are typically vetted against soil temperature observations debolskiy et al 2020 nicolsky et al 2017 2 7 wildfire the scrpple extension v 2 3 for landis ii was used to simulate the current and future wildfire regime scheller et al 2019 scrpple social climate related pyrogenic processes and their landscape effects uses a data driven approach to simulating wildfire by using remotely sensed fire databases to parameterize fire ignitions and daily fire spread in the model this approach allows the user to capture landscape scale determinants of fire behavior which are most appropriate to the scale of the landis ii model fire regimes respond dynamically to changes in climate including temperature precipitation wind direction and wind speed ignitions use a supply and allocation model whereby the probability of ignition is determined by an ignition probability surface derived from historical fires observed within the study landscape scheller et al 2019 and model of historic daily ignitions by fire weather index fit to a zero inflated poisson distribution zuur et al 2009 fire spread to adjacent cells i e the four nearest neighbors is dependent on past spread occurrences of historic fires scheller et al 2019 specifically the model creates a probability function for daily fire spread success at the cell level based on daily fire perimeters fire weather index fwi fine fuels and downscaled wind speed wind speed is downscaled from the climate region to the raster scale by accounting for slope and azimuth relative to wind direction and the intensity of fire on neighboring cells fine fuels are calculated internally by dgs and are spatially and temporally variable a fire will spread until it has reached its maximum daily spread area based on the relationship fit between daily fire spread areas and associated fwi and effective wind speed fire intensity low medium high is calculated based on the mass of fine fuels mass of ladder fuels and fire intensity of neighboring cells mortality is dependent on fire intensity tree species and tree ages this data driven approach uses the historical relationships between fuel climate and fire behavior to capture the important drivers of fire in the specified region but it also allows future fire behavior to dynamically respond to projected climate and fuels 2 8 model integration of landis ii shaw gipl and wildfire shaw and gipl were recoded from fortran to c to allow for integration into the spatially explicit landis ii framework adding an additional 18 093 lines of code to dgs dgs assigns each raster cell to a temperature hydrology unit thu which can be delineated based on climate zone elevation slope vegetation type and time since fire or more generally time since disturbance each thu has a corresponding series of input parameters determined by user defined look up tables for both shaw and gipl in each year of the simulation dgs provides the climate slope aspect vegetation type and time since disturbance in each cell to the shaw and gipl submodules which is used to determine the annual assignment of thus across the entire landscape in the first month of the simulation dgs provides the climate data to gipl which uses it to compute daily soil temperatures from the surface to the bottom of the soil profile for each thu the gipl soil temperature at shaw s lower boundary depth e g 4 m is passed from gipl to shaw to specify shaw s lower boundary conditions then shaw computes soil moisture and soil temperature dynamics throughout its soil profile and passes the water content by depth to gipl in subsequent years shaw and gipl consecutively trade temperature and water content at each depth for each month of the simulation gipl and shaw provide soil temperature and available soil water respectively to the vegetation in dgs at two depths integrated across the top 10 cm and integrated from 10 cm to the species specific rooting depth which is an input in the model available water and soil temperature are used by dgs with temperature and moisture response curves to determine how much water and soil temperature limit aboveground productivity at a monthly timestep study area the study landscape contains 397 860 hectares in the greater fairbanks area nested within interior alaska fig 2 black spruce covers 29 of the landscape which often dominates on north facing slopes van cleve et al 1986 van cleve and viereck 1981 aspen populus tremuloides occupies the warmer drier south facing sites with a thin organic horizon locations with microclimates and soil characteristics that are intermediate between black spruce and aspen are dominated by white spruce picea glauca and birch betula neoalaskana which cover 31 and 32 of the landscape respectively the region was not glaciated during the pleistocene glaciation pewe et al 1976 and is characterized by gentle sloping uplands soils are primarily silt loams accrued from eolian deposition from the alaska range and fluvial plains during the holocene black 1951 the landscape is underlain by discontinuous permafrost the presence of which is determined by vegetation type disturbance history and topography monthly mean air temperatures range from 19 4 c in january to 15 9 c in july based on our analysis of gridded weather observations from 1981 to 2010 prism climate group oregon state university 2021 mean annual precipitation is 358 mm with about half of precipitation occurring during the growing season four previously established field sites were selected within the study landscape for site scale model evaluation fig 2 based on the availability of climate soil moisture and temperature data minimization of net lateral hydrologic fluxes i e focusing on upland sites and representation of post fire successional trajectories two of our sites were dominated by deciduous species without near surface permafrost including a site us rpf 65 1198 n 147 4290 w burned in 2004 now dominated by birch and quaking aspen populus tremuloides ueyama et al 2019 2018a and a site bonanza creek long term ecological research up1a 64 7355 n 148 3027 w burned in 1983 now dominated by paper birch betula papyrifera van cleve et al 2015a our coniferous site ameriflux smith lake 2 64 8661 n 147 8567 w is a mature black spruce site with permafrost ueyama et al 2018b 2014 details of these sites are found in marshall et al 2019 we also selected field sites within the study landscape for site scale model evaluation of heterotrophic respiration np 64 8 n 147 8667 w vogel et al 2005 these sites were dominated by mature black spruce ranging in age from 75 to 120 years details of these sites are found in vogel et al 2005 2 9 model inputs 2 9 1 meteorological and climate data meteorological data for our model calibration sites are described in detail in marshall et al 2021a 2021b at our recently burned site us rpf all meteorological variables including daily air temperature relative humidity wind speed downward shortwave radiation and precipitation were available online from on site meteorological towers ueyama et al 2019 2018a except for winter precipitation marshall et al 2021a to obtain winter precipitation we used snow depth data from the nearby us prr ameriflux site and estimated liquid water content of new snow accumulation based on the internal algorithm used in shaw anderson 1976 temperature relative humidity and wind speed data for our birch dominated site up1a were available from on site meteorological towers though some gap filling was necessary using nearby weather station data marshall et al 2021a downward shortwave radiation was obtained from the us uaf ameriflux site precipitation data were obtained from the lter1 site daily air temperature relative humidity wind speed and downward shortwave radiation were obtained from the geophysical institute permafrost laboratory for the coniferous site smith lake 2 minimal gap filling was required for air temperature and relative humidity data from the previous day was used when necessary marshall et al 2021a in contrast 27 of the wind data were missing we filled gaps using linear regressions against co located wind sensors at different heights at the same site for the rest of the missing periods daily precipitation data were obtained from the fairbanks airport weather station menne et al 2012 soil moisture i e liquid water content used for calibration was available at all sites though depths varied dgs requires a full suite of meteorological climate inputs including air temperature relative humidity wind speed downward shortwave radiation and precipitation at a daily resolution at the time of this study downscaled climate data with these characteristics were available for only two gcms global climate models and one rcp representative concentration pathway we used dynamically downscaled daily climate data from the ncar ccsm4 gcm leonawicz et al 2015 to create our historical and future rcp 8 5 climate inputs extending from 1970 to 2100 supplemental 1 data were downscaled by the scenarios network for alaska and arctic planning snap using the weather research and forecasting wrf model to a 20 km resolution bieniek et al 2016 lader et al 2017 because the climate data were not bias corrected we performed a bias correction step using a quantile mapping approach with the era interim reanalysis data downscaled and also provided via snap acting as our observed data leonawicz et al 2015 using the qmap package in r gudmundsson and gudmundsson 2012 for the sake of computational efficiency landis ii uses climate regions that are areas of relatively homogenous climate rather than gridded climate data scheller et al 2007 to determine the optimal number and spatial configuration for the climate regions in our landscape we performed a spatial k means cluster analysis using the climate change projections of precipitation and average temperature from 2000 to 2100 aggregated monthly data using the cluster package in r maechler et al 2022 we initially planned to delineate climate regions using monthly prism temp and precipitation to find clusters of similar climate areas on our landscape but we decided that delineating climate regions using the gcm projections would produce climate regions that were more reflective of the spatial configuration of the climate streams and account for future spatial shifts in climate variables we also found that it was necessary to bias correct temperatures in areas subject to elevational or winter temperature inversion effects at a finer scale than the downscaled gcm 20 km we did an additional cluster analysis of mean winter temperatures from prism 30 year 800 m normals for each climate region prism climate group oregon state university 2021 thereby creating subregions we then compared monthly prism temperatures within these subregions to the gcm data for corresponding years and used a delta approach to generate new daily temperature values for each climate region because the temperature variables were bias corrected individually daily specific humidity was also corrected to ensure that it was not greater than saturated specific humidity at the minimum daily temperature for climatic conditions representative of the recent historical period we calculated daily temperature and precipitation from 1970 to 1990 for each climate region climate data for the historical climate scenario were randomly selected one calendar year at a time from this 20 year dataset to generate a 50 year timeseries of climate that we could compare to a 50 y climate change projection figure s2 1 s2 2 to simulate climate change we used projected data for 1990 2100 which exhibited an average increase in temperature of 4 7 c and a change in precipitation of 264 mm 2 9 2 vegetation data we created four single cell simulations for our field sites for model evaluation our recently burned site us rpf was initialized with 6 year old birch and quaking aspen cohorts ueyama et al 2019 2018a our deciduous site up1a was initialized with 20 year old paper birch and 8 year old aspen van cleve et al 2015a our coniferous site ameriflux smith lake 2 was initialized with 78 year old black spruce ueyama et al 2018b 2014 and our mature coniferous site nps was initialized with 110 year old black spruce vogel et al 2005 we also created an initial landscape map of species composition species age and biomass at a resolution of 4 ha by imputing usda forest inventory and analysis fia data burrill et al 2018 onto maps of forest types and stand age with species ages estimated using site index curves full description of procedures outlined in supplemental 3 shrub percent cover by layer from fia was used to derive cohort biomass values for each plot this relationship between shrub percent cover and biomass was derived by analyzing data from bonanza creek lter species percent cover 1975 2009 and species count 1975 2004 which included stem densities by stem class allometric equations for boreal alder and willow berner et al 2015 were used to crosswalk stem classes bd within the bonanza creek dataset to biomasses and heights for alder and willow these heights were used to place species in a particular layer category as defined by fia then linear regressions were run between percent shrub cover and biomass for each species by layer and the resulting coefficients were used to assign shrub biomass to each fia plot in the database stand age was used to define shrub cohort ages biomass of moss functional types by plot are included in fia data for the tanana region so moss functional type cohorts with these biomasses were imputed along with trees and shrubs we included five tree species four shrub species and three moss functional groups in our map based on species present in the fia database table 1 the most abundant species in our landscape were the mosses which covered almost 90 of the landscape the most dominant tree species were white and black spruce which dominated 52 and 56 of the landscape respectively with overlapping distributions biomass was dominated by white and black spruce which together comprised 40 of the total landscape biomass paper birch contributed about 22 to total biomass at the landscape scale 2 9 3 hydrology and permafrost input files for the shaw and gipl submodules of dgs were identical for the single cell and landscape simulations each cell was automatically assigned to a thu which was delineated based on climate zone 1 5 vegetation type i e conifer or hardwood stand age i e 0 40 y was young 40 y was considered old slope i e 0 10 11 33 and aspect i e north and south aspects vegetation characteristics e g biomass leaf area and height for shaw were calculated using published values and allometric equations for the dominant vegetation as detailed in marshall et al 2021a leaf phenology was derived from snowmelt simulations based on observed relationships between snow disappearance date and the day of leaf on marshall et al 2021b soil parameters texture organic matter and bulk density were based on published values from soil pits yarie et al 1998 saturated volumetric water content at each soil depth was estimated based on the maximum observed water content at each site parameters associated with soil water retention curves and hydraulic conductivity were obtained from the national cooperative soil survey soil characterization database for sites throughout interior alaska beaudette et al 2021 burt 2009 ground temperature data at the field sites ueyama et al 2018b 2018a van cleve et al 2015b were used to

of soil organic matter soil texture soil depth soil drainage class field capacity and wilting point were created using the state soil geographic data available from usda nrcs for the state of alaska at a 1 1000 000 scale soil survey staff 2020 2 9 5 wildfire data given its inherent spatial nature wildfire was only simulated at the landscape scale data on ignitions came from the spatial wildfire occurrence data for the us 1992 2015 short 2021 ignitions were then related to fwi calculated in the climate library of landis ii lucash and scheller 2021 using the zeroinf function within the pscl package in r jackman et al 2015 to simulate ignitions to estimate probability of spread daily fire perimeters from the geomac database geomac 2019 2020 were used to identify successful or unsuccessful cell to cell spread occurrences from historical fires daily fwi daily effective wind speed calculated from modeled wind speed and derived direction of fire spread slope and aspect derived from a digital elevation model usgs 2020a and relative fine fuels usgs 2020b were then extracted from these cell locations and used as predictors to fit a logistic model of probability of spread maximum allowable daily spread was determined by parameters derived from fitting a generalized linear model of maximum daily spread areas derived from the geomac database geomac 2019 2020 to associated fwi and effective wind speed model calibration and validation to calibrate growth in dgs we conducted single cell simulations non spatial monocultures with each of our four functional groups e g hardwoods conifers shrubs mosses comparing the biomass trajectories over time in landis ii with fia data burrill et al 2018 that have estimates of biomass as a function of stand age more details in supplemental 3 we adjusted two parameters e g klai which determines the relationship between lai and biomass and the competition index which affects the competitive ability of different functional groups to mimic the initial maximum growth rates observed in fia and used the mortality shape parameter to mimic the longevity related declines in growth we also calibrated foliar to wood biomass ratios and above belowground biomass by comparing the output from these single cell simulations with fia data the proportion of fine and coarse roots was calibrated using literature values of the of root mass that is devoted to fine roots 36 noguchi et al 2012 input parameters that influenced growth were identical between the single cell and landscape simulations to validate landscape level biomass at the start of the simulation we compared our tree biomass map of the landscape at time 0 with a global biomass map from globbiomass santoro 2018 our simulated biomass tended to be underestimated within areas that had burned since the year 2000 while areas where biomass was overestimated primarily fell outside of these more recently burned areas there were fewer fia plots present within burn scars to use in our imputation of landscape tree composition and biomass and those data availability limits likely contributed to some of the disagreement within these fire scars overall discrepancies within and outside of the burn scars area also likely due to differences in the source years for the datasets globbiomass was created for the year 2010 while the landcover map and fia used data from 2017 to 2016 respectively to calibrate and validate soil moisture and temperature we compared simulated and observed patterns of soil moisture and soil temperature at our three of our field sites ueyama et al 2018b 2018a van cleve et al 2015a a bayesian parameter estimation and uncertainty analysis was used to identify appropriate model parameters from a range that was defined through literature review and analysis of available data this method is fully described in marshall et al 2021a parameters in gipl related to snowpack such as the viscous compaction coefficient were estimated by maximizing the fit between the observed snow depth to the modeling results across the three field sites to calibrate soil respiration we compared simulated and observed patterns of heterotrophic soil respiration at a field site near fairbanks alaska vogel et al 2005 all input parameters in damm mcnip were fit by minimizing the residuals of the model using a newton type method function modfit method newton package fme soetaert and petzoldt 2010 fully described in abramoff et al 2017 to calibrate wildfire ignitions we ran simulations at the landscape scale and adjusted the fire ignition intercept until it recreated the observed annual number of fires from 1970 to 1990 supplemental 4 fig s4 1 we also validated fire spread by comparing the fire size distribution and fire return interval to observations for the 1980 1990 period 2 10 experimental design single cell simulations of three field sites were initialized with current vegetation and run for 9 16 years depending on the available field data using dgs model performance was assessed in r version 1 4 1106 by computing rsme for the model predictions and the observed field measurements of soil temperature and moisture we also ran single cell simulations of three field sites with necn the predecessor of dgs and compared the output between the two model extensions and observed field measurements necn uses a one layer approach to simulating soil temperature and moisture so necn output was compared to the one layer output from dgs these simulated values were compared to mean soil temperature and moisture down to maximum soil depth at each of the field sites landscape scale simulations were run on a 4 ha grid over 50 years 1990 2060 both inclusive across 397 860 hectares in interior alaska we compared wildfire soil temperature soil moisture aboveground biomass forest type and species composition under two climate scenarios the historical climate scenario represented the climate from 1970 to 1990 while the climate change scenario used projections from 1990 to 2040 which exhibited an average increase in temperature of 4 7 c and precipitation of 264 mm over the historical conditions all scenarios were replicated five times at the landscape scale to account for stochasticity from successional dynamics seed dispersal regeneration and wildfire total of 10 model runs 2 climate 5 replicates differences in ignitions area burned soil temperature soil moisture and biomass between climate scenarios were compared using welch s t test with unequal variance significance was assessed at a 95 confidence level and p values less than 0 05 suggested that there was strong support for a difference between scenarios all data processing and statistical analyses were performed using r r core team 2022 to test the effects of soil moisture soil temperature and available soil nitrogen on aboveground biomass we ran four simulations with 5 replicates each where we modified the internal code to prevent each factor from affecting growth under climate change we also ran a simulation without wildfire we calculated the relative differences in aboveground biomass among these scenarios and our climate change scenario all data processing and statistical analyses were performed using r to test the effects of soil moisture and soil temperature on regeneration we ran two simulations with 5 replicates each where we modified the internal code to prevent each factor from affecting regeneration under climate change we calculated the relative differences in aboveground biomass among these scenarios and our climate change scenario 3 results 3 1 model performance at field sites modeled soil temperature generally reproduced the interannual variability and differences between depths in the empirical data at three field sites fig 3 model agreement between simulated and observed soil temperature based on rmse was higher at the coniferous site smith lake 2 0 3 1 7 c than the recently burned us rpf 1 9 2 9 c and deciduous sites up1a 1 1 2 5 c at the burned site model performance was good except for the winter of 2013 when it overestimated soil temperature at both 10 cm and 90 cm at the deciduous site the model captured the magnitude of soil temperature observed at the site though it tended to predict spring warming later than observed at the 0 5 m depth the model captured summer temperatures extremely well at the conifer site but it simulated lower temperatures than observed at the surface 10 cm depth modeled liquid soil water content generally reproduced the interannual variability and differences between depths in the empirical data at all three field sites fig 4 the rmse suggests some differences between performance at the sites with higher agreement at the recently burned us rpf 0 03 m3 m 3 and deciduous up1a 0 01 0 04 m3 m 3 sites than the coniferous site smith lake 2 with a rmse of 0 02 0 07 m3 m 3 the dgs extension captured spring wetting due to snowmelt and summer rainfall events quite well at all three sites however simulated soil moisture was overestimated in the winter at the burned site though it tracked the timing and magnitude of soil moisture in the summer at the deciduous site dgs underestimated soil moisture in the top 10 20 cm though it captured the timing and magnitude of spring snowmelt that was observed at the field site performance was better at lower depths there was higher agreement at 0 5 m rmse 0 01 m3 m 3 than 0 2 m rmse 0 04 m3 m 3 or 10 cm rmse 0 02 m3 m 3 at the coniferous site simulated soil moisture was similar to observed values at 10 and 40 cm but the simulated timing of spring thaw in the active layer was earlier than observed dgs did not capture the seasonal variation observed at 85 cm depth modeled soil respiration generally reproduced the seasonal variation in the empirical data at the field site fig 5 but greatly underestimated respiration in the summer months percent differences were much smaller in june 16 than july 39 and august 61 between modelled and empirical estimates the high rmse 18 g c m 2 reflects these differences and suggests that additional calibration may be necessary to confidently simulate soil respiration using dgs when compared to the original succession extension of landis ii dgs performed better than its predecessor necn the original succession extension of landis ii necn produced annual mean soil temperatures that were similar to observed values but necn consistently overestimated the seasonality of soil temperature at all three field sites necn simulated a 49 5 c difference in minimum and maximum monthly soil temperature influencing tree growth but the observed variation across the field sites was only 19 8 c fig 6 dgs simulated a 21 7 c difference in minimum and maximum monthly soil temperature only 10 higher than the observed range across all sites necn overestimated soil temperature in the summer months simulating a mean summer temperature of 15 5 c compared to the mean of 5 3 c by dgs and the observed value of 5 4 c necn underestimated soil temperature in the winter months suggesting it was 11 c colder than the observed monthly mean of 2 2 c dgs simulated winter temperatures that were within 1 c of the observations the improved simulation of soil temperature by dgs was particularly notable in the spruce site observed soil temperature ranged from 0 4 c to 2 6 c simulated soil temperature in necn ranged from an average of 16 2 c in the winter to 15 2 c in the summer whereas soil temperature in dgs ranged from an average of 2 6 c in the winter to 4 1 c in the summer dgs simulated soil moisture influencing tree growth better than its predecessor fig 6 necn simulated soil moisture that was 86 lower than the observed values across all field sites while dgs simulated values within 21 simulated annual mean soil moisture was only 0 03 m3 m 3 in necn whereas dgs simulated a mean of 0 16 m3 m 3 that was within 21 of the observed mean of 0 20 m3 m 3 across all field sites in the summer months when moisture is influencing tree growth dgs outperformed necn at the recently burned and coniferous sites but not at the deciduous site at the burned site dgs simulated soil moisture that was 26 lower than observations in the summer whereas necn simulated values that were 89 lower available soil moisture in dgs ranged from 0 17 in the winter to 0 2 m3 m 3 in the summer in the burned site while observed values ranged from 0 07 winter to 0 29 m3 m 3 summer soil moisture in necn ranged from 0 008 in the winter to 0 03 m3 m 3 in the summer at the birch site necn performed better than dgs in the summer necn simulated soil moisture that was only 12 lower than observations in the summer whereas dgs simulated values that were 65 higher simulated summer soil moisture in necn 0 09 m3 m 3 in dgs was similar to observed values in the summer 0 1 m3 m 3 but dgs simulated values much higher 0 17 m3 m 3 at the spruce site dgs outperformed necn in the summer simulating soil moisture that was higher in agreement with observed values at the spruce site soil moisture in necn ranged from 0 02 in the winter to 0 07 m3 m 3 in the summer dgs simulated 0 07 m3 m 3 in the winter and 0 23 m3 m 3 in the summer while observed values ranged only from 0 18 winter to 0 40 m3 m 3 summer overall model performance by dgs was not explicitly computed in these comparisons with necn because necn only simulates surficial soil temperature and available soil moisture instead of comparing soil temperature and moisture at similar depths as in the previous analysis we were forced to compare simulated average soil moisture average soil moisture down to rooting depth with observed soil moisture at one depth rooting depth which results in artificially low rsme values 3 2 model results at the landscape scale after model calibration with data from the field stations the dgs extension was run at the landscape scale with wildfire to explore how climate change i e ncar ccsm4 rcp 8 5 may affect wildfire soil moisture soil temperature and vegetation as expected climate change had a significant impact on wildfire the number of wildfire ignitions was significantly higher under climate change than historical climate across the entire simulation period p 0 01 but the differences between climate scenarios also became more pronounced over time fig 7 by mid century the number of mean annual ignitions across the landscape was 1 8 under historical climate and 2 8 under climate change the variability in ignition rates was also significantly different between climate scenarios levene s test p 0 004 with 37 higher variation under climate change variance 0 78 than historical climate 0 49 annual area burned increased over time and was significantly higher under climate change 3326 ha than historical climate 1687 ha p 0 001 the number of fire years with over 10 000 hectares burned was only two under historical climate but seven under climate change at the landscape scale there was significantly less subsurface permafrost quantified using soil temperature at 3 m under climate change p 0 0001 over the course of the simulation soil temperature increased slightly under historical climate by 0 16 c but increased dramatically under climate change by 1 1 c fig 8 across the 50 y simulation period soil temperature was significantly higher under climate change than historical climate for all forest types but the rate of change differed by forest type soil temperature increased at a much faster rate in the hardwoods than the conifers under climate change in the conifer sites soil temperature increased by 0 007 c per year under climate change in the young and mature hardwoods soil temperature increased by 0 03 c and 0 39 c per year respectively resulting in a 1 9 c and 1 5 c change by mid century variation in soil temperature was higher under climate change levene s test p 1 10 9 driven by the stochasticity of wildfires annual simulated tree available soil moisture at the landscape scale was highly variable but was relatively similar p 0 04 between the historical and projected climate change scenarios despite higher precipitation under climate change fig 9 during one period from 2015 to 2022 soil moisture was 14 higher under climate change but this was due at least in part to precipitation which was 29 higher during that period soil moisture declined over time with a 10 decline under historical climate and 27 under climate change by mid century variability was higher under historical climate levene s test p 0 000000001 but that was primarily because different climate streams were used in each replicate climate change had the strongest effect on soil moisture at sites dominated by young conifers welch s test f value 471 7 p 10 9 which was expected because soil moisture has a strong effect on post fire regeneration in the model available soil moisture was higher in the conifer dominated sites than in the sites with deciduous species under both of the climate scenarios simulated mean aboveground biomass density was significantly affected by climate change welch s t test with unequal variance p 0 00002 under historical climate aboveground biomass initially increased by 30 but then stabilized around 2010 fig 10 under climate change biomass also increased 27 until 2010 but later declined by 55 under climate change by 2050 annual variation at the landscape scale was relatively small with some fluctuations due to wildfire and successional dynamics most of the variation in aboveground biomass under climate change was due to soil moisture 53 until 2018 when fire became the dominant driver explaining 70 of the variation fig 11 soil moisture was the main limitation to regeneration under climate change soil moisture explained 80 of the variation in biomass of regenerating trees and shrubs under climate change and became more important over time explaining over 90 of the variation by 2040 the dominant forest type shifted during the simulation the percentage of the landscape dominated by conifers declined from 71 to 54 under historical climate but under climate change conifers only dominated 52 of the landscape by the year 2040 fig 12 under historical climate most species that were initially high in biomass and abundance remained so until the end of the simulation including black spruce white spruce and paper birch fig 13 alder shrub birch and willow increased their landscape level biomass over time though their extent remained constant under climate change however white and black spruce decreased dramatically in biomass by 69 and 50 respectively even while their extent remained constant paper birch also had lower biomass under climate change but the other hardwoods remained relatively unaffected by climate change soil c increased annually by only 0 26 with a slightly higher rate under climate change 0 28 than historical climate 0 24 fig 14 over the 50 year simulation period dgs simulated an average gain of 4 9 tg 0 13 tg sd of c under historical climate and 5 6 tg 0 05 tg sd of c under climate change across the entire landscape 4 discussion 4 1 model evaluation dgs captured the variation in soil temperature across depths seasons and water years reasonably well though the model tended to simulate surficial temperature 10 cm depth much warmer than observed at the spruce site this suggests that the model was unable to capture the ability of the surface litter layer to moderate surface temperatures in alignment with other studies that have highlighted the challenges of simulating frozen soil thermal conductivity he et al 2021 mosses and associated soil organic horizons have low thermal conductivity values relative to mineral soil farouki 1981 and therefore reduce vertical heat fluxes through the soil profile and insulate soil from warm air temperatures these errors may also originate from advective heat fluxes associated with lateral water transport not simulated by the model for that reason the model results particularly those pertaining to soil moisture and temperature are most reliable in upland areas that have less net lateral flows than lowland sites within the spatial domain despite the poor agreement at the surface layer at the spruce site dgs captured the temperature dynamics well at deeper depths and at other sites indicating that the model effectively simulates important controls on soil temperature and the thermal status of permafrost in high latitude ecosystems bonan and shugart 1989 dyrness 1982 nicolsky et al 2007 yoshikawa and hinzman 2003 across all field sites dgs generally captured the variation in soil moisture across depths seasons and water years reasonably well though there were some discrepancies at each site soil moisture was overestimated in the summer months at the birch site likely caused by underestimating evapotranspiration marshall et al 2021b transpiration comprises a large fraction of evapotranspiration jasechko et al 2013 but is not well understood in boreal regions despite its importance to vegetation dynamics and regional climate most landscape and earth system models do not simulate the lateral transfer of water that can influence evapotranspiration and therefore cannot capture increased lateral leaching with storm events nor the ability of laterally transported groundwater to sustain evapotranspiration during summer drought this is also the case in dgs but should be a target area for future model development to advance the understanding of lowland areas common in interior alaska and throughout boreal forests at the burned site simulated soil moisture tracked observed values in the summer but overestimated values in the winter when errors in simulated snow depth or density might cause disparities without snow data at this site or a nearby site with similar vegetation conditions and fire history it is difficult to identify the specific mechanisms that produce the discrepancy and emphasize the need for more intensively monitored stands in the boreal regions overall dgs led to a more realistic simulation of soil temperature and moisture than its predecessor necn at the three field sites necn consistently overestimated the seasonal fluctuations of soil temperature fig 6 leading to the conclusion that the mature spruce site lacked permafrost despite field observations that showed otherwise also necn simulated very low soil moisture at all field sites suggesting that water limitation was more severe at all the sites throughout the year than field observations suggest with the integration of a physically based energy and water budget model shaw and permafrost model gipl into the succession model dgs produced a much higher correlation with observed soil temperature and moisture across all sites and most importantly was able to reproduce the permafrost conditions at the spruce site 4 2 wildfire and soil dynamics under climate change over the last several decades alaska has witnessed an increase in area burned calef et al 2015 kasischke et al 2010 kasischke and turetsky 2006 and the number of years with large fires kasischke and turetsky 2006 which our landscape scale simulations suggest will continue to increase as the climate warms under climate change dgs simulated a 65 increase in area burned in comparison with historical climate which is more than double the 14 30 projected area based on previous studies bachelet et al 2005 m flannigan et al 2009 however the results agree well with flannigan et al 2009 who projected a 50 increase in area burned in canada under climate change as expected soil temperature at the landscape scale was affected by both climate and vegetation type interior alaska is located within the discontinuous zone of permafrost jorgenson et al 2010 and soil temperature is driven by complex feedbacks between climate jorgenson et al 2010 fire minsley et al 2016 and vegetation jorgenson et al 2001 as air temperature warms under climate change soil temperature and active layer thickness increases and the depth to permafrost increases however changes in vegetation type soil moisture and the insulative properties of snow also play an integral role in maintaining permafrost integrity by buffering changes in air temperature jorgenson et al 2010 coniferous forests with their dense canopies and thick organic horizons buffer the effects of warmer temperatures acting as a thermal insulator between the atmosphere and the ground walker et al 2003 our model captures these dynamics with soil temperature increasing by 0 02 c y in conifers and 0 07 c y in hardwoods under climate change overall our rates of near surface 3 m soil warming 0 019 c y under climate change are similar to observed estimates in interior alaska 0 01 0 037 c y clow 2008 romanovsky et al 2019 southern norway 0 015 0 095 c year isaksen et al 2011 siberia 0 01 0 08 c y malkova 2010 oberman 2008 vasiliev et al 2008 and mongolia 0 015 c year sharkhuu et al 2007 all earth system models project near surface permafrost degradation over large geographic areas of the boreal and arctic ecosystems though the extent and rate of change differs between models koven et al 2013 mcguire et al 2018 the simulation results here demonstrate that vegetation type had a greater effect on soil moisture than climate change at the landscape scale fig 9 given the large differences in soil moisture between hardwoods and conifers forest type influences soil moisture via depth to permafrost differential transpiration rates among species interception and throughfall of snow and liquid precipitation forest impacts on the surface energy balance and different organic matter accumulation patterns hardwoods often have lower interception rates and greater throughfall but higher stomatal conductance and transpiration than conifers e g cable et al 2014 which often collectively results in lower soil moisture under hardwood canopies as simulated in this study given these hardwood forest types are projected to become increasingly prevalent as wildfire frequency increases hansen et al 2021 johnstone et al 2010b mann et al 2012 this could have ramifications for streamflow and overall productivity across the landscape barichivich et al 2014 although precipitation increased under climate change bieniek et al 2014 lader et al 2017 there was high uncertainty associated with these trends meredith et al 2019 and it did not cause a net increase in soil moisture in our study the magnitude of projected changes in soil moisture in arctic regions varies widely with most studies showing a decline in soil moisture primarily due to deep drainage following permafrost thaw though a few studies project wetting trends andresen et al 2020 the ipcc denotes soil moisture as a major source of uncertainty in this region meredith et al 2019 given the complex interactions and feedbacks between increasing precipitation longer and warming growing seasons causing greater evapotranspiration shifts in vegetation type and increases in fire frequency given that dgs underestimated c lost as soil respiration soil c is likely overestimated with dgs though the projections of soil carbon over time generally agree with other studies showing relatively stable pools for the next 50 years interior alaska is not expected to show substantial declines in soil c until after 2050 mcguire et al 2018 when this region is projected to be a net source of soil c to the atmosphere koven et al 2011 losses in soil carbon associated with higher soil temperatures in boreal forests have been documented across numerous field studies eliasson et al 2005 melillo et al 2017 shabaga et al 2022 and some modeling studies h genet et al 2013 but these studies are focused primarily on organic horizons which are only a small fraction of the total soil c pool model projections of soil c under climate change remain highly uncertain with the full range of possibilities including models that predict gains in soil c orchb constant soil c tem6 gains and then losses starting in 2150 uvic and constant soil c followed by losses starting in 2100 clm 4 5 sibcasa mcguire et al 2018 the short duration of our modeling study and makes it challenging to project how climate change will affect soil c especially given the diverse physical chemical and biological factors that influence its stability 4 3 aboveground biomass dynamics under climate change the biomass declines we projected under climate change differ from most other modeling studies in this region most models project an increase in aboveground biomass under climate change due to co2 fertilization and or an increase in the length of the growing season euskirchen et al 2017 mcguire et al 2018 zha and zhuang 2021 the state and transition model alfresco tem predicted increases in vegetation biomass both when vegetation was constant or allowed to shift over time euskirchen et al 2016a also the mean increase in vegetation c stocks differed between their climate scenarios with the highest projected c accumulation occurring in response to the fertilization effect of rising atmospheric co2 euskirchen et al 2016a in a recent multi model approach with eight esms the sensitivities of model npp responses to climate change were between 1 9 and 15 4 consistent with the mean of 13 in free air exchange co2 enrichment face experiments at the time the models were parameterized piao et al 2013 however this global mean of 13 represents face experiments primarily conducted in young temperate forests with high nutrient availability and not boreal forests walker et al 2021 in the boreal forests of ontario canada the synergistic effects of rising co2 and temperatures increased water use efficiency of black spruce by 53 over the past century but this did not always translate into commensurate increases in growth silva et al 2010 in northern latitudes 51 n growth i e basal area increment increased between 1950 and 2007 but growth declined starting in 2000 at mid latitudes 47 49 n and 1980 at lower latitudes 45 n finally existing models which do simulate a co2 fertilization effect tend to overestimate biomass albani et al 2006 though recent integrations of observations and models have reduced this uncertainty considerably keenan et al 2021 therefore without convincing evidence for the potential co2 fertilization effect on tree growth in boreal forests we decided to omit this potential driver of vegetation dynamics though we note this could be an important area for future model development although the simulated biomass trends do not agree with most other modeling studies our results are consistent with the browning trends observed from remotely sensed data in the forests of interior alaska and results with uvafme between 1981 and 2012 gross photosynthesis declined in interior alaska while growing season length remained constant in interior alaska despite rising co2 and temperatures goetz et al 2005 ju and masek 2016 this mechanism for this apparent decoupling of growth co2 and warming in forest areas is unknown but was likely caused by drought stress barber et al 2004 dai et al 2004 nutrient limitation hobbie et al 2002 insect and disease damage ayres and lombardero 2000 and or changes in resource allocation gower et al 2001 our projected declines in total aboveground biomass were also aligned with the uvafme model projections foster et al 2022 simulations with uvafme showed a 24 decline in aboveground biomass under both rcp 4 5 and 8 5 climate emissions scenarios by the end of the century in interior alaska though the differences in biomass projections between climate change and historical climate scenarios was relatively small our simulations project a comparable 22 reduction in biomass under climate change by mid century our difference in biomass between historical climate and climate change scenarios 1 5 tc ha 1 was similar initially to foster et al 2022 fig 10 2 5 tc ha 1 but by mid century our difference was 21 tc ha 1 while foster was only 5 tc ha 1 biomass declines in our simulations resulted from reductions in spruce biomass with soil moisture and wildfire as the most important drivers declines in conifer biomass and shifts in forest type and under climate change agree with other modeling studies in this region for example both afresco tem and ecosys predicted similar declines in spruce forests under climate change with corresponding increases in hardwoods euskirchen et al 2016 mekonnen et al 2019 a shift from a spruce to deciduous dominated landscape like we projected could act as a negative feedback to increasing fire activity in boreal forests pastick et al 2017 but our projections did not suggest this would happen by mid century future work applying dgs in alaska will include simulations of larger landscapes longer durations and more climate change scenarios as they become available from cmip6 4 4 model limitations although wildfire is likely the most important disturbance in interior alaska other disturbances such as aspen leaf miner and browsing by moose and hare may affect forest dynamics and their effects may increase under climate change also exotic tree species like chokecherry may increase forest biomass while sequential droughts may reduce biomass neither of which were included in our simulations simulating the effects of climate change was limited to only one climate emissions scenario due to the lack of downscaled daily climate data necessary to simulate wildfire in the scrpple extension of landis ii and hydrologic dynamics in shaw other important sources of uncertainty in the dgs simulations include potential parameter equifinality uncertainty in vegetative and soil initial conditions lack of lateral water transport and uncertainty in the climate inputs originating from differences between gcms downscaling and bias correction method and aggregation to climate regions for dgs quantifying and constraining these uncertainty sources remains an important area for future research for process models like landis ii the new dgs extension also has considerable potential to be applied in temperate forested regions to better understand and predict disturbance and hydrology feedbacks and their consequences for ecosystem function across multiple biomes given the extensive data inputs required by dgs application may be limited in areas like the tropics where data availability is a concern 5 conclusions the large extent and high c storage capacity of boreal forests makes them important to global carbon budgets but their fragility in the face of rapid changes in climate and wildfire necessitate improved understanding of the vulnerability of this large c stock we developed dgs a new extension of landis ii to simulate climate vegetation succession hydrology permafrost carbon and nutrient cycling and wildfire in a spatially explicit framework that allows for feedbacks among processes the dgs model captures how rising temperatures can cause permafrost thaw which can increase active layer thickness and depth to permafrost allowing soil water to drain deeper into the soil profile the model also simulates changes in snow depth snowmelt and freeze up and tracks soil organic matter and water and nutrient availability at user specified depths down to 75 m simulating these processes in an integrated spatially explicit framework like landis ii will allow us to disentangle the drivers and ecosystem responses in this rapidly changing ecosystem supporting information supplemental 1 climate change projections supplemental 2

24202,boreal ecosystems account for 29 of the world s total forested area and contain more carbon than any other terrestrial biome over the past 60 years alaska has warmed twice as rapidly as the contiguous u s and wildfire activity has increased including the number of fires area burned and frequency of large wildfire seasons these recent and rapid changes in climate and wildfire have implications for future vegetation composition structure and biomass in interior alaska given that the vegetation is highly dependent on active layer thickness soil moisture organic layer depth and plant available nutrients here we developed a new succession extension dgs of the landis ii forest landscape model which integrates a vegetation dynamics model necn with a soil carbon model damm mcnip a hydrologic model shaw and a deep soil profile permafrost model gipl in a spatially explicit framework dgs succession uses the algorithms in the necn succession extension of landis ii to simulate growth mortality and reproduction of vegetation but has three major improvements first the simple bucket model in necn was replaced with a physically based model shaw that simulates energy and water fluxes e g snow depth evapotranspiration soil moisture at multiple levels in the canopy and soil second the active slow and passive soil pools in necn were replaced by seven soil pools that are measurable in the field with carbon and nitrogen dynamics dictated by damm mcnip finally soil temperature and soil moisture are simulated only at one depth in necn but in dgs soil temperature and hence permafrost dynamics are simulated at as many as 50 user defined depths down to 4 m with shaw and 75 m with gipl during the initial calibration phase dgs was applied at three inventory sites at the bonanza creek long term ecological research area in interior alaska where climate forcings species biomass soil temperature and or soil moisture were available for the landscape scale simulations dgs was run with the scrpple fire extension of landis ii under two scenarios of climate using a 400 000 ha landscape that included the inventory sites across all three sites dgs generally captured the variation in soil moisture and temperature across depths seasons and years reasonably well though there were some discrepancies at each site dgs had better agreement with field measurements of soil moisture and temperature than its predecessor necn which produced unrealistically low soil moisture and unrealistically high seasonal fluctuations in soil temperature at the landscape scale ignitions area burned and soil temperature increased under climate change as expected while soil moisture was relatively unchanged across climate scenarios biomass tended to decline under climate change which differs from other modeling studies in this region but is consistent with the browning trends observed from remote sensing data simulating climate vegetation succession hydrology permafrost carbon and nutrient cycling and wildfire in an integrated spatially explicit framework like landis ii will allow us to disentangle the drivers and ecosystem responses in this rapidly changing ecosystem as well

1 introduction boreal ecosystems stretch approximately 16 million km2 around the northern portion of the globe accounting for 29 of the world s total forested area un ece fao 1985 they contain 1041 pg of c median range of 367 1715 pg more carbon than any other terrestrial biome bradshaw and warkentin 2015 their sheer size and c storage capacity make them important but it is their recent rapid climatic changes and potential fragility that foster particular interest in these high latitude regions such as alaska over the past 60 years alaska has warmed twice as rapidly as the contiguous u s markon et al 2018 overland et al 2018 and current temperatures are unprecedented in the last 100 400 years barber et al 2004 overpeck et al 1997 temperatures have warmed most dramatically in the winter wolken et al 2011 resulting in a decline in the snow season length by about 2 5 days per decade euskirchen et al 2007 2006 temperatures have also warmed in the spring and fall an earlier spring start and a slightly later date of the first frost in the fall have resulted in a 45 increase in growing season length over the past 91 years wendler and shulski 2009 projections indicate that warming will continue to outpace lower latitudes and temperatures will increase by another 2 8 c by the end of the century leonawicz et al 2015 late century projections ccsm4 rcp8 5 suggest the snow season will decline by 28 days lader et al 2020 and the lengthening of the growing season will increase by almost 50 days in alaska as compared to only 30 40 days in the contiguous united states lader et al 2017 walsh 2014 precipitation has shown very little change bieniek et al 2014 and studies that do find an observed precipitation change disagree on the direction hinzman et al 2005 l heureux et al 2004 mcafee et al 2013 in alaska over the past century precipitation in alaska is projected to increase over the next century given that warmer air has a higher holding capacity for water vapor but the uncertainty is high ranging from 10 to 50 depending on the model and emissions scenario bieniek et al 2014 tebaldi et al 2004 maximum daily precipitation is expected to increase by 53 by 2100 which far exceeds the estimates for the contiguous united states which range from 10 to 40 lader et al 2017 the ratio of snow to total precipitation is projected to decrease from 44 to 21 under the ccsm3 and gfdl cm3 climate scenarios by the end of the late century lader et al 2020 interior alaska bounded by the alaska range 63 n to the south and the brooks range 67 n to the north is dominated by upland and lowland boreal forests white spruce picea glauca moench voss was the first conifer to expand in interior alaska 10 000 years bp and it dominated the region for much of the mid holocene

now covers about 40 of boreal alaska van cleve et al 1983 interior alaska also supports prevalent deciduous broadleaf trees such as trembling aspen populus tremuloides michx alaskan paper birch betula neoalaskana sarg and balsam poplar populus balsamifera l wildfire is the primary disturbance in the boreal forests of alaska and around the world now payette 1992 and for the past thousands of years higuera et al 2009b hoecker et al 2020 kelly et al 2013 lynch et al 2003b climate warming has increased fire activity in the circumboreal forest m d flannigan et al 2009 lynch et al 2003 and in alaska calef et al 2015 duffy et al 2005 including a 50 increase in overwintering aka zombie fires scholten et al 2021 the average number of fires per year in alaska has expanded from 125 in the 1940 s to 461 in the 2000 s hinzman et al 2013 ignition density has increased by 4 8 each year since 1975 veraverbeke et al 2017 this is due in part to increases in the length of the fire season with significant increases in the number of days with lightning ignitions since the late 1950 s in boreal north america coogan et al 2020 area burned doubled from the 1960s 1970s to the 1980s 1990s in boreal north america kasischke and turetsky 2006 and increased by 4 6 fold in interior alaska since 1943 calef et al 2015 in some areas of alaska the fire return interval has decreased from 120 1100 years johnstone et al 2010a van cleve and viereck 1981 to less than 50 years brown and johnstone 2012 johnstone and chapin 2006 as wildfire activity increases in alaska it becomes more important than ever to use fire simulators that capture the temporal resolution spatial interactivity vegetation and climate integration necessary to capture future changes in the fire regime some fire models use monthly e g tem balshi et al 2009 rather than daily data to capture ignition rates do not simulate fire spread from one raster pixel to another e g uafme foster et al 2019 mc1 bachelet et al 2005 omit shrubs mosses and lichen as fuel types e g fvs ffe rebain 2010 or rely on user defined fire return interval e g uafme foster et al 2019 preventing climate driven changes in intervals models like scrpple scheller et al 2019 that use daily data simulate fire spread using cell automata recognize that understory species as important fuel types and have a tight coupling to climate without fixed fire return intervals can aid in predicting future changes in wildfire regimes under a changing climate changes in the wildfire regime in alaska have started to break the 6000 year legacy lock of spruce domination hoy et al 2016 johnstone et al 2010b increasingly favoring hardwood species with longer dispersal distances and shorter times to sexual maturity black spruce has seeding distances less than 1 km whereas aspen and birch can disperse several kilometers from the parent tree burns and honkala 1990 marquis et al 1969 mccaughey et al 1986 also as the prevalence of short interval fires increase in alaska buma et al 2022 sites can suffer from immaturity risk because the fire free periods are too short for conifer seed production keeley et al 1999 black spruce has low rates of seed production and cone serotiny until it reaches sexual maturity 30 years old buma et al 2013 burns and honkala 1990 and often requires at least 50 years to accumulate sufficient seed for stand self replacement after fire viglas et al 2013 in contrast alder quaking aspen and paper birch initiate seed production at 5 10 and 15 years old respectively germination success and recruitment rates also influence the effectiveness of conifer self replacement a long fire return interval allows sufficient time for the thick organic seedbeds to develop which present a barrier for small deciduous seeds but not larger seeded conifers to reach the stable moisture supply in the mineral soil hesketh et al 2009 however sites with short interval fires have thinner organic layers and more exposed mineral soil shabaga et al 2022 which favors deciduous species like aspen jasinski and payette 2005 johnstone and chapin 2006 many models represent vegetation as broad vegetation types afresco tem ecosys and do not simulate seed dispersal or vegetative reproduction e g tem which may not fully capture the species level traits and reproductive strategies that determine long term successional trends in the boreal forests of interior alaska forest type wildfire and soil moisture are the most important agents controlling the thickness of the organic horizon johnstone et al 2010a which is the primary determinant controlling the aggradation or degradation of permafrost viereck 1982 permafrost soil with a temperature at or below 0 c for at least two consecutive years underlies approximately 75 80 of the ground in interior alaska osterkamp and romanovsky 1999 cooler and wetter areas such as north facing and toe slope forests are more likely to contain permafrost than warmer and drier south facing slopes hinzman et al 2006 shallow permafrost and thick organic horizons are often associated with black spruce forests and lowlands where soils are moist because evapotranspiration rates are low due to low productivity bonan 1991 liu et al 2005 decomposition is low due to anoxia and cold temperatures hobbie et al 2000 schimel and clein 1996 and mosses are prevalent and have high water retention capacity turetsky et al 2010 broadleaf forests more prevalent on warm well drained soils often have thinner organic horizons and less moss understory natalia et al 2008 van cleve and viereck 1981 due to higher evapotranspiration and decomposition rates associated with higher productivity bonan 1991 liu et al 2005 thereby causing greater fluctuations in summer temperatures and lacking permafrost most permafrost models like gipl2 capture the effects of forest type on permafrost nicolsky et al 2009 but lack dynamic vegetation wildfire and hydrology modules that capture potential changes in species composition wildfire and soil moisture that drive long term changes in permafrost wildfire also influences permafrost through its effects on surface energy balance following wildfire the thickness of the organic horizon is reduced causing a significant increase in the thermal conductivity of soil and an increase in active layer thickness the portion of the soil above the permafrost that thaws and freezes seasonally jafarov et al 2013 permafrost tends to return 20 30 years after low severity fire as the forest floor begins to develop and mosses regain dominance bernhardt et al 2011 viereck et al 2008 in areas with high severity fire where larger amounts of the surface organic material are combusted permafrost may disappear from the upper few meters of soil yoshikawa et al 2003 across interior alaska permafrost soils are often right at the cusp of thawing with temperatures usually ranging from 0 1 to 3 5 c jorgenson et al 2010 osterkamp and romanovsky 1999 due in part to recent climate warming hinzman et al 2006 osterkamp and romanovsky 1999 rising temperatures in alaska are likely to cause longer fire seasons jolly et al 2015 kasischke et al 2010 and increases in the frequency and severity of fires h genet et al 2013 kasischke et al 2010 which can cause permafrost thaw nicolsky et al 2007 also as temperatures rise and fire frequency increases active layer thickness increases and the depth to permafrost increases enabling soil water to drain deeper into the soil profile recent warming has also caused earlier snowmelt and later freeze up which have lengthened the growing season in interior alaska sharratt 1992 and increased the potential for drought barber et al 2000 especially when coupled with the changes in depth to permafrost and hence altering wildfire dynamics recent efforts to quantify the effects of climate change and wildfire on boreal alaska have specifically highlighted the need to improve our understanding of the interactions between climate fire vegetation hydrology and soils alexander and mack 2016 a c foster et al 2019 rogers et al 2015 in the past ecosystem models such as alfresco tem ecosys uvafme and iland have been used to simulate climate vegetation fire interactions in alaska euskirchen et al 2009 h genet et al 2013 mekonnen et al 2019 rupp et al 2007 but they have several limitations for example afresco tem and ecosys classify vegetation into vegetation types and therefore do not capture species competitive dynamics individual based gap models like uvafme university of virginia forest model enhanced are able to capture species dynamics in interior alaska but they do not simulate spatially interactive processes like seed dispersal and wildfire spread foster et al 2022a a c 2019 the model iland simulates spatially interactive species growth tree dispersal and wildfire spread at the individual tree level hansen et al 2021 but it primarily focuses on aboveground processes with soil moisture simulated for a single layer using a simple bucket model seidl et al 2012 uvafme simulates soil moisture at two depths organic and mineral layers a c foster et al 2019 whereas tem alfresco tem and ecosys simulate soil moisture at multiple depths including the depth of the water table dimitrov et al 2010 yi et al 2009 permafrost dynamics are captured in all these models except iland uvafme a c foster et al 2019 dos tem genet et al 2013 and ecosys mekonnen et al 2019 simulate the effects of wildfire on the depth of burn though in ecosys it is a spatially homogenous user defined input in this paper we describe a new succession extension damm mcnip gipl shaw henceforth dgs of the landis ii forest landscape model scheller et al 2007 that greatly expands our ability to simulate

nitrogen succession extension of landis ii to simulate growth mortality and reproduction of vegetation but the potential drivers of growth e g soil temperature available soil moisture and available nitrogen were updated the simple water bucket model in necn was replaced with a physically based model simultaneous heat and water balance model shaw flerchinger et al 2016a flerchinger and cooley

version 2 0 nicolsky et al 2009 was integrated into dgs to simulate soil temperature at up to 50 user defined depths down to 75 m recoding these published models of soil c hydrology and permafrost from fortran shaw and gipl and r damm to the c framework of landis ii enabled us to simulate integrated dynamic responses and spatially explicit feedbacks using models that were already well established and fully vetted the dgs extension was calibrated using four sites in interior alaska and then used to simulate current and future vegetation hydrology and permafrost in a 397 860 hectare landscape in interior alaska at a 200 m 200 m grid resolution in this paper our objective was to assess how soil moisture soil temperature vegetation and soil c may be altered by climate change and illustrate how the future dynamics of alaskan ecosystems can be simulated using dgs a tightly coupled model of climate vegetation soil including organic layers and permafrost hydrology and wildfire 2 methods 2 1 model overview our new succession extension described below was integrated within landis ii an open source spatially explicit process based simulation framework that is optimized for large scale spatial dynamics scheller et al 2007 in landis ii the landscape consists of interconnected grid cells each cell contains species age cohorts of trees and is assigned to a climate region within which climate is assumed to be homogenous mladenoff 2004 tree growth and mortality are not spatially interactive i e competition between cohorts occurs within a cell but reproduction e g seed dispersal and disturbances are spatially interactive this robust framework allows multiple ecological processes e g growth mortality regeneration decomposition and disturbances to change in space and time allowing for potential overlap to capture interactions between processes scheller et al 2007 landis ii has been widely adopted for use in climate change research in the boreal forests of siberian russia gustafson et al 2011 2010 british columbia dymond et al 2016 and newfoundland labrador sturtevant et al 2009 dgs pronounced digs was created to improve the simulation of forest dynamics in the boreal region of western north america dgs integrates climate vegetation permafrost and hydrology within a spatially explicit framework that interfaces with an existing wildfire extension which simulates ignitions spread and severity fig 1 all model code is available at https github com landis ii foundation extension dgs succession and information about inputs and outputs are provided in the associated user guide model inputs used for this study are available at https github com landis ii foundation reburnsak 2 2 climate the landis ii climate library lucash and scheller 2021 which processes the climate input data for landis ii was modified to add specific humidity and shortwave radiation as input variables because they are required for shaw s energy and water balance algorithms lucash and scheller 2021 an algorithm to convert specific humidity to dewpoint temperature was also added american meteorological society 2020 2 3 aboveground vegetation dynamics dgs succession uses the algorithms in the necn succession extension of landis ii scheller et al 2012 2011 to simulate monthly forest above and belowground plant growth and associated carbon c and nitrogen n cycling dgs simulates aboveground leaves and wood and belowground fine and coarse roots productivity of each cohort on each raster cell to calculate cohort growth within a cell it uses species specific life history attributes e g longevity shade tolerance climate age competition i e the biomass of other cohorts relative to the amount of maximum potential biomass water availability n availability and soil temperature while dgs simulates growth mortality and reproduction of vegetation with the same algorithms as necn the computations for water availability nitrogen availability and soil temperature are different necn relies on the simple water bucket model of century parton et al 1994 1988 to compute soil moisture but dgs uses a physically based model shaw that simulates simultaneous energy and water fluxes including soil moisture dynamics at multiple depths in the soil see below nitrogen availability is also calculated differently in dgs the algorithms in necn century were replaced with damm mcnip see below century uses a simple algorithm to derive soil temperature from air temperature but dgs uses gipl which solves a nonlinear heat flow equation to calculate soil temperature at multiple depths in the soil see below as in necn dgs simulates tree mortality caused by senescence ongoing loss of trees and branches age to account for the increase in mortality as a species approaches its life expectancy and disturbances described below it also simulates regeneration via seeds serotiny or re sprouting using life history attributes regeneration in dgs is identical to necn scheller et al 2007 except that the water available for seedlings to regenerate is calculated by shaw see below 2 4 belowground soil dynamics soil carbon dynamics in necn were derived from century parton et al 1994 1988 in dgs century was replaced by damm mcnip abramoff et al 2017 a new hybrid model of damm dual arrenius michaelis menton davidson et al 2014 2012 and microbial carbon and nitrogen physiology model mcnip described in finzi et al 2015 in contrast to century which measures carbon and nitrogen cycling in theoretical active slow and passive soil pools damm mcnip explicitly simulates measurable c and n pools and fluxes in soil using physiological principles with relatively low parameter collinearity abramoff et al 2017 damm mcnip tracks seven pools soil organic c soc and n son dissolved organic c doc and n don microbial biomass c and n and extracellular enzymes abramoff et al 2017 litter inputs are partitioned evenly between soil organic matter som and dissolved organic matter dom pools each month for both c and n soil cn pools are responsive to changes in soil temperature soil moisture oxygen concentrations and substrate cn stoichiometry temperature affects the rate of som depolymerization to dom using arrhenius kinetics soil water content modifies the supply of oxygen and dom both of which affect depolymerization using a michaelis menten m m i e dual monod kinetic approximation oxygen concentration limits the depolymerization rate when soil water content is high while the litter inputs limit depolymerization when soil water content is low because the substrate cannot diffuse to the reaction site microbial uptake is limited by both doc and don substrate and oxygen concentration using m m kinetics with uptake partitioned in the microbial pool among maintenance growth and enzyme production enzyme production can be limited by stoichiometry of microbial c or n all model pools and fluxes are calculated internally within the model dgs outputs are soc and son doc and don inorganic n respiration and n mineralization 2 5 hydrology within the dgs extension shaw simulates energy and water fluxes through the vertical soil vegetation atmosphere continuum flerchinger et al 2016a flerchinger and cooley 2000 flerchinger and saxton 1989 accounting for the effects of snow surface vegetation and litter on subsurface water and energy dynamics at a daily time step shaw simulates 1 snow accumulation and ablation of a multi layer snowpack using a complete energy balance flerchinger et al 1994 2 surface runoff and infiltration using the richard s equation for unsaturated flow richardson 1922 3 evapotranspiration using gradient flow through a multi layer canopy flerchinger et al 2016b and 4 transpiration governed by user defined vegetation structural and water use characteristics including jarvis stewart type controls of stomatal resistance armatas et al 2018 jarvis 1976 stewart 1988 shaw has been used to simulate water and energy transfer through forest and shrub canopies for a wide range of climate and vegetation conditions in complex terrain chauvin et al 2011 flerchinger et al 2016c link et al 2004 marshall et al 2019 it has also been used to simulate the effects of fire on a seasonally frozen system in southwestern idaho flerchinger et al 2016c discontinuous permafrost at the wolf creek and scotty creek boreal research sites in canada zhang et al 2010 and soil moisture and temperature dynamics at multiple sites in interior boreal alaska marshall et al 2021b 2021a the strength of shaw lies in its physically based approach to simulating the coupled transfer of energy and water at a daily timestep including soil moisture and soil temperature dynamics at up to 65 soil depths however the one dimensional nature of shaw means that dgs is most appropriately applied in areas where net lateral flows are minimal 2 6 permafrost dynamics the gipl model within dgs solves a nonlinear heat flow equation with phase change and has been specifically developed to simulate spatially distributed permafrost dynamics marchenko et al 2008 nicolsky et al 2007 sergueev et al 2003 in a wide range of climatic conditions across alaska e g debolskiy et al 2020 jafarov et al 2012 nicolsky et al 2017 gipl is forced by daily air temperature and snowpack conditions to simulate phase changes with prescribed accuracy a special enthalpy based formulation of the energy conservation law allows simulation of phase change processes without loss of latent heat effects nicolsky et al 2009 soil properties including heat capacity and thermal conductivity were typically based on the water and ice content in the ground material in previous versions of gipl but in dgs water and ice content are inherited from shaw some water is assumed to remain liquid below 0 c its content is defined empirically according to the ground temperature romanovsky and osterkamp 2000 the modeling domain is discretized on a regular grid with ground thermal properties parameterized according to the dominant vegetation type of each cell nicolsky et al 2017 the soil properties for each vegetation type are prescribed either by the data assimilation techniques or set according to published literature and modeling results are typically vetted against soil temperature observations debolskiy et al 2020 nicolsky et al 2017 2 7 wildfire the scrpple extension v 2 3 for landis ii was used to simulate the current and future wildfire regime scheller et al 2019 scrpple social climate related pyrogenic processes and their landscape effects uses a data driven approach to simulating wildfire by using remotely sensed fire databases to parameterize fire ignitions and daily fire spread in the model this approach allows the user to capture landscape scale determinants of fire behavior which are most appropriate to the scale of the landis ii model fire regimes respond dynamically to changes in climate including temperature precipitation wind direction and wind speed ignitions use a supply and allocation model whereby the probability of ignition is determined by an ignition probability surface derived from historical fires observed within the study landscape scheller et al 2019 and model of historic daily ignitions by fire weather index fit to a zero inflated poisson distribution zuur et al 2009 fire spread to adjacent cells i e the four nearest neighbors is dependent on past spread occurrences of historic fires scheller et al 2019 specifically the model creates a probability function for daily fire spread success at the cell level based on daily fire perimeters fire weather index fwi fine fuels and downscaled wind speed wind speed is downscaled from the climate region to the raster scale by accounting for slope and azimuth relative to wind direction and the intensity of fire on neighboring cells fine fuels are calculated internally by dgs and are spatially and temporally variable a fire will spread until it has reached its maximum daily spread area based on the relationship fit between daily fire spread areas and associated fwi and effective wind speed fire intensity low medium high is calculated based on the mass of fine fuels mass of ladder fuels and fire intensity of neighboring cells mortality is dependent on fire intensity tree species and tree ages this data driven approach uses the historical relationships between fuel climate and fire behavior to capture the important drivers of fire in the specified region but it also allows future fire behavior to dynamically respond to projected climate and fuels 2 8 model integration of landis ii shaw gipl and wildfire shaw and gipl were recoded from fortran to c to allow for integration into the spatially explicit landis ii framework adding an additional 18 093 lines of code to dgs dgs assigns each raster cell to a temperature hydrology unit thu which can be delineated based on climate zone elevation slope vegetation type and time since fire or more generally time since disturbance each thu has a corresponding series of input parameters determined by user defined look up tables for both shaw and gipl in each year of the simulation dgs provides the climate slope aspect vegetation type and time since disturbance in each cell to the shaw and gipl submodules which is used to determine the annual assignment of thus across the entire landscape in the first month of the simulation dgs provides the climate data to gipl which uses it to compute daily soil temperatures from the surface to the bottom of the soil profile for each thu the gipl soil temperature at shaw s lower boundary depth e g 4 m is passed from gipl to shaw to specify shaw s lower boundary conditions then shaw computes soil moisture and soil temperature dynamics throughout its soil profile and passes the water content by depth to gipl in subsequent years shaw and gipl consecutively trade temperature and water content at each depth for each month of the simulation gipl and shaw provide soil temperature and available soil water respectively to the vegetation in dgs at two depths integrated across the top 10 cm and integrated from 10 cm to the species specific rooting depth which is an input in the model available water and soil temperature are used by dgs with temperature and moisture response curves to determine how much water and soil temperature limit aboveground productivity at a monthly timestep study area the study landscape contains 397 860 hectares in the greater fairbanks area nested within interior alaska fig 2

primarily silt loams accrued from eolian deposition from the alaska range and fluvial plains during the holocene black 1951 the landscape is underlain by discontinuous permafrost the presence of which is determined by vegetation type disturbance history and topography monthly mean air temperatures range from 19 4 c in january to 15 9 c in july based on our analysis of gridded weather observations

field sites were selected within the study landscape for site scale model evaluation fig 2 based on the availability of climate soil moisture and temperature data minimization of net lateral

laboratory for the coniferous site smith lake 2 minimal gap filling was required for air temperature and relative humidity data from the previous day was used when necessary marshall et al 2021a in contrast 27 of the wind data were missing we filled gaps using linear regressions against co located wind sensors at different heights at the same site for the rest of the missing periods daily precipitation data were obtained from the fairbanks airport weather station menne et al 2012 soil moisture i e liquid water content used for calibration was available at all sites though depths varied dgs requires a full suite of meteorological climate inputs including air temperature relative humidity wind speed downward shortwave radiation and precipitation at a daily resolution at the time of this study downscaled climate data with these characteristics were available for only two gcms global climate models and one rcp representative concentration pathway we used dynamically downscaled daily climate data from the ncar ccsm4 gcm leonawicz et al 2015 to create our historical and future rcp 8 5 climate inputs extending from 1970 to 2100 supplemental 1 data were downscaled by the scenarios network for alaska and arctic planning snap using the weather research and forecasting wrf model to a 20 km resolution bieniek et al 2016 lader et al 2017 because the climate data were not bias corrected we performed a bias correction step using a quantile mapping approach with the era interim reanalysis data downscaled and also provided via snap acting as our observed data leonawicz et al 2015 using the qmap package in r gudmundsson and gudmundsson 2012 for the sake of computational efficiency landis ii uses climate regions that are areas of relatively homogenous climate rather than gridded climate data scheller et al 2007 to determine the optimal number and spatial configuration for the climate regions in our landscape we performed a spatial k means cluster analysis using the climate change projections of precipitation and average temperature from 2000 to 2100 aggregated monthly data using the cluster package in r maechler et al 2022 we initially planned to delineate climate regions using monthly prism temp and precipitation to find clusters of similar climate areas on our landscape but we decided that delineating climate regions using the gcm projections would produce climate regions that were more reflective of the spatial configuration of the climate streams and account for future spatial shifts in climate variables we also found that it was necessary to bias correct temperatures in areas subject to elevational or winter temperature inversion effects at a finer scale than the downscaled gcm 20 km we did an additional cluster analysis of mean winter temperatures from prism 30 year 800 m normals for each climate region prism climate group oregon state university 2021 thereby creating subregions we then compared monthly prism temperatures within these subregions to the gcm data for corresponding years and used a delta approach to generate new daily temperature values for each climate region because the temperature variables were bias corrected individually daily specific humidity was also corrected to ensure that it was not greater than saturated specific humidity at the minimum daily temperature for climatic conditions representative of the recent historical period we calculated daily temperature and precipitation from 1970 to 1990 for each climate region climate data for the historical climate scenario were randomly selected one calendar year at a time from this 20 year dataset to generate a 50 year timeseries of climate that we could compare to a 50 y climate change projection figure s2 1 s2 2 to simulate climate change we used projected data for 1990 2100 which exhibited an average increase in temperature of 4 7 c and a change in precipitation of 264 mm 2 9 2 vegetation data we created four single cell simulations for our field sites for model evaluation our recently burned site us rpf was initialized with 6 year old birch and quaking aspen cohorts ueyama et al 2019 2018a our deciduous site up1a was initialized with 20 year old paper birch and 8 year old aspen van cleve et al 2015a our coniferous site ameriflux smith lake 2 was initialized with 78 year old black spruce ueyama et al 2018b 2014 and our mature coniferous site nps was initialized with 110 year old black spruce vogel et al 2005 we also created an initial landscape map of species composition species age and biomass at a resolution of 4 ha by imputing usda forest inventory and analysis fia data burrill et al 2018 onto maps of forest types and stand age with species ages estimated using site index curves full description of procedures outlined in supplemental 3 shrub percent cover by layer from fia was used to derive cohort biomass values for each plot this relationship between shrub percent cover and biomass was derived by analyzing data from bonanza creek lter species percent cover 1975 2009 and species count 1975 2004 which included stem densities by stem class allometric equations for boreal alder and willow berner et al 2015 were used to crosswalk stem classes bd within the bonanza creek dataset to biomasses and heights for alder and willow these heights were used to place species in a particular layer category as defined by fia then linear regressions were run between percent shrub cover and biomass for each species by layer and the resulting coefficients were used to assign shrub biomass to each fia plot in the database stand age was used to define shrub cohort ages biomass of moss functional types by plot are included in fia data for the tanana region so moss functional type cohorts with these biomasses were imputed along with trees and shrubs we included five tree species four shrub species and three moss functional groups in our map based on species present in the fia database table 1 the most abundant species in our landscape were the mosses which covered almost 90 of the landscape the most dominant tree species were white and black spruce which dominated 52 and 56 of the landscape respectively with overlapping distributions biomass was dominated by white and black spruce which together comprised 40 of the total landscape biomass paper birch contributed about 22 to total biomass at the landscape scale 2 9 3 hydrology and permafrost input files for the shaw and gipl submodules of dgs were identical for the single cell and landscape simulations each cell was automatically assigned to a thu which was delineated based on climate zone 1 5 vegetation type i e conifer or hardwood stand age i e 0 40 y was young 40 y was considered old slope i e 0 10 11 33 and aspect i e north and south aspects vegetation characteristics e g biomass leaf area and height for shaw were calculated using published values and allometric equations for the dominant vegetation as detailed in marshall et al 2021a leaf phenology was derived from snowmelt simulations based on observed relationships between snow disappearance date and the day of leaf on marshall et al 2021b soil parameters texture organic matter and bulk density were based on published values from soil pits yarie et al 1998 saturated volumetric water content at each soil depth was estimated based on the maximum observed water content at each site parameters associated with soil water retention curves and hydraulic conductivity were obtained from the national cooperative soil survey soil characterization database for sites throughout interior alaska beaudette et al 2021 burt 2009 ground temperature data at the field sites ueyama et al 2018b 2018a van cleve et al 2015b were used to calculate thermal properties for live moss dead moss and mineral soil layers 2 9 4 soil carbon initial soil characteristics e g initial microbial cn initial enzyme concentrations for damm mcnip were derived from abramoff et al 2017 except for c n ratios of litter soil and microbes bulk density and particle density which were based on published values in interior alaska vogel et al 2005 input maps of soil organic matter soil texture soil depth soil drainage class field capacity and wilting point were created using the state soil geographic data available from usda nrcs for the state of alaska at a 1 1000 000 scale soil survey staff 2020 2 9 5 wildfire data given its inherent spatial nature wildfire was only simulated at the landscape scale data on ignitions came from the spatial wildfire occurrence data for the us 1992 2015 short 2021 ignitions were then related to fwi calculated in the climate library of landis ii lucash and scheller 2021 using the zeroinf function within the pscl package in r jackman et al 2015 to simulate ignitions to estimate probability of spread daily fire perimeters from the geomac database geomac 2019 2020 were used to identify successful or unsuccessful cell to cell spread occurrences from historical fires daily fwi daily effective wind speed calculated from modeled wind speed and derived direction of fire spread slope and aspect derived from a digital elevation model usgs 2020a and relative fine fuels usgs 2020b were then extracted from these cell locations and used as predictors to fit a logistic model of probability of spread maximum allowable daily spread was determined by parameters derived from fitting a generalized linear model of maximum daily spread areas derived from the geomac database geomac 2019 2020 to associated fwi and effective wind speed model calibration and validation to calibrate growth in dgs we conducted single cell simulations non spatial monocultures with each of our four functional groups e g hardwoods conifers shrubs mosses comparing the biomass trajectories over time in landis ii with fia data burrill et al 2018 that have estimates of biomass as a function of stand age more details in supplemental 3 we adjusted two parameters e g klai which determines the relationship between lai and biomass and the competition index which affects the competitive ability of different functional groups to mimic the initial maximum growth rates observed in fia and used the mortality shape parameter to mimic the longevity related declines in growth we also calibrated foliar to wood biomass ratios and above belowground biomass by comparing the output from these single cell simulations with fia data the proportion of fine and coarse roots was calibrated using literature values of the of root mass that is devoted to fine roots 36 noguchi et al 2012 input parameters that influenced growth were identical between the single cell and landscape simulations to validate landscape level biomass at the start of the simulation we compared our tree biomass map of the landscape at time 0 with a global biomass map from globbiomass santoro 2018 our simulated biomass tended to be underestimated within areas that had burned since the year 2000 while areas where biomass was overestimated primarily fell outside of these more recently burned areas there were fewer fia plots present within burn scars to use in our imputation of landscape tree composition and biomass and those data availability limits likely contributed to some of the disagreement within these fire scars overall discrepancies within and outside of the burn scars area also likely due to differences in the source years for the datasets globbiomass was created for the year 2010 while the landcover map and fia used data from 2017 to 2016 respectively to calibrate and validate soil moisture and temperature we compared simulated and observed patterns of soil moisture and soil temperature at our three of our field sites ueyama et al 2018b 2018a van cleve et al 2015a a bayesian parameter estimation and uncertainty analysis was used to identify appropriate model parameters from a range that was defined through literature review and analysis of available data this method is fully described in marshall et al 2021a parameters in gipl related to snowpack such as the viscous compaction coefficient were estimated by maximizing the fit between the observed snow depth to the modeling results across the three field sites to calibrate soil respiration we compared simulated and observed patterns of heterotrophic soil respiration at a field site near fairbanks alaska vogel et al 2005 all input parameters in damm mcnip were fit by minimizing the residuals of the model using a newton type method function modfit method newton package fme soetaert and petzoldt 2010 fully described in abramoff et al 2017 to calibrate wildfire ignitions we ran simulations at the landscape scale and adjusted the fire ignition intercept until it recreated the observed annual number of fires from 1970 to 1990 supplemental 4 fig s4 1 we also validated fire spread by comparing the fire size distribution and fire return interval to observations for the 1980 1990 period 2 10 experimental design single cell simulations of three field sites were initialized with current vegetation and run for 9 16 years depending on the available field data using dgs model performance was assessed in r version 1 4 1106 by computing rsme for the model predictions and the observed field measurements of soil temperature and moisture we also ran single cell simulations of three field sites with necn the predecessor of dgs and compared the output between the two model extensions and observed field measurements necn uses a one layer approach to simulating soil temperature and moisture so necn output was compared to the one layer output from dgs these simulated values were compared to mean soil temperature and moisture down to maximum soil depth at each of the field sites landscape scale simulations were run on a 4 ha grid over 50 years 1990 2060 both inclusive across 397 860 hectares in interior alaska we compared wildfire soil temperature soil moisture aboveground biomass forest type and species composition under two climate scenarios the historical climate scenario represented the climate from 1970 to 1990 while the climate change scenario used projections from 1990 to 2040 which exhibited an average increase in temperature of 4 7 c and precipitation of 264 mm over the historical conditions all scenarios were replicated five times at the landscape scale to account for stochasticity from successional dynamics seed dispersal regeneration and wildfire total of 10 model runs 2 climate 5 replicates differences in ignitions area burned soil temperature soil moisture and biomass between climate scenarios were compared using welch s t test with unequal variance significance was assessed at a 95 confidence level and p values less than 0 05 suggested that there was strong support for a difference between scenarios all data processing and statistical analyses were performed using r r core team 2022 to test the effects of soil moisture soil temperature and available soil nitrogen on aboveground biomass we ran four simulations with 5 replicates each where we modified the internal code to prevent each factor from affecting growth under climate change we also ran a simulation without wildfire we calculated the relative differences in aboveground biomass among these scenarios and our climate change scenario all data processing and statistical analyses were performed using r to test the effects of soil moisture and soil temperature on regeneration we ran two simulations with 5 replicates each where we modified the internal code to prevent each factor from affecting regeneration under climate change we calculated the relative differences in aboveground biomass among these scenarios and our climate change scenario 3 results 3 1 model performance at field sites modeled soil temperature generally reproduced the interannual variability and differences between depths in the empirical data at three field sites fig 3 model agreement between simulated and observed soil temperature based on rmse was higher at the coniferous site smith lake 2 0 3 1 7 c than the recently burned us rpf 1 9 2 9 c and deciduous sites up1a 1 1 2 5 c at the burned site model performance was good except for the winter of 2013 when it overestimated soil temperature at both 10 cm and 90 cm at the deciduous site the model captured the magnitude of soil temperature observed at the site though it tended to predict spring warming later than observed at the 0 5 m depth the model captured summer temperatures extremely well at the conifer site but it simulated lower temperatures than observed at the surface 10 cm depth modeled liquid soil water content generally reproduced the interannual variability and differences between depths in the empirical data at all three field sites fig 4 the rmse suggests some differences between performance at the sites with higher agreement at the recently burned us rpf 0 03 m3 m 3 and deciduous up1a 0 01 0 04 m3 m 3 sites than the coniferous site smith lake 2 with a rmse of 0 02 0 07 m3 m 3 the dgs extension captured spring wetting due to snowmelt and summer rainfall events quite well at all three sites however simulated soil moisture was overestimated in the winter at the burned site though it tracked the timing and magnitude of soil moisture in the summer at the deciduous site dgs underestimated soil moisture in the top 10 20 cm though it captured the timing and magnitude of spring snowmelt that was observed at the field site performance was better at lower depths there was higher agreement at 0 5 m rmse 0 01 m3 m 3 than 0 2 m rmse 0 04 m3 m 3 or 10 cm rmse 0 02 m3 m 3 at the coniferous site simulated soil moisture was similar to observed values at 10 and 40 cm but the simulated timing of spring thaw in the active layer was earlier than observed dgs did not capture the seasonal variation observed at 85 cm depth modeled soil respiration generally reproduced the seasonal variation in the empirical data at the field site fig 5 but greatly underestimated respiration in the summer months percent differences were much smaller in june 16 than july 39 and august 61 between modelled and empirical estimates the high rmse 18 g c m 2 reflects these differences and suggests that additional calibration may be necessary to confidently simulate soil respiration using dgs when compared to the original succession extension of landis ii dgs performed better than its predecessor necn the original succession extension of landis ii necn produced annual mean soil temperatures that were similar to observed values but necn consistently overestimated the seasonality of soil temperature at all three field sites necn simulated a 49 5 c difference in minimum and maximum monthly soil temperature influencing tree growth but the observed variation across the field sites was only 19 8 c fig 6 dgs simulated a 21 7 c difference in minimum and maximum monthly soil temperature only 10 higher than the observed range across all sites necn overestimated soil temperature in the summer months simulating a mean summer temperature of 15 5 c compared to the mean of 5 3 c by dgs and the observed value of 5 4 c necn underestimated soil temperature in the winter months suggesting it was 11 c colder than the observed monthly mean of 2 2 c dgs simulated winter temperatures that were within 1 c of the observations the improved simulation of soil temperature by dgs was particularly notable in the spruce site observed soil temperature ranged from 0 4 c to 2 6 c simulated soil temperature in necn ranged from an average of 16 2 c in the winter to 15 2 c in the summer whereas soil temperature in dgs ranged from an average of 2 6 c in the winter to 4 1 c in the summer dgs simulated soil moisture influencing tree growth better than its predecessor fig 6 necn simulated soil moisture that was 86 lower than the observed values across all field sites while dgs simulated values within 21 simulated annual mean soil moisture was only 0 03 m3 m 3 in necn whereas dgs simulated a mean of 0 16 m3 m 3 that was within 21 of the observed mean of 0 20 m3 m 3 across all field sites in the summer months when moisture is influencing tree growth dgs outperformed necn at the recently burned and coniferous sites but not at the deciduous site at the burned site dgs simulated soil moisture that was 26 lower than observations in the summer whereas necn simulated values that were 89 lower available soil moisture in dgs ranged from 0 17 in the winter to 0 2 m3 m 3 in the summer in the burned site while observed values ranged from 0 07 winter to 0 29 m3 m 3 summer soil moisture in necn ranged from 0 008 in the winter to 0 03 m3 m 3 in the summer at the birch site necn performed better than dgs in the summer necn simulated soil moisture that was only 12 lower than observations in the summer whereas dgs simulated values that were 65 higher simulated summer soil moisture in necn 0 09 m3 m 3 in dgs was similar to observed values in the summer 0 1 m3 m 3 but dgs simulated values much higher 0 17 m3 m 3 at the spruce site dgs outperformed necn in the summer simulating soil moisture that was higher in agreement with observed values at the spruce site soil moisture in necn ranged from 0 02 in the winter to 0 07 m3 m 3 in the summer dgs simulated 0 07 m3 m 3 in the winter and 0 23 m3 m 3 in the summer while observed values ranged only from 0 18 winter to 0 40 m3 m 3 summer overall model performance by dgs was not explicitly computed in these comparisons with necn because necn only simulates surficial soil temperature and available soil moisture instead of comparing soil temperature and moisture at similar depths as in the previous analysis we were forced to compare simulated average soil moisture average soil moisture down to rooting depth with observed soil moisture at one depth rooting depth which results in artificially low rsme values 3 2 model results at the landscape scale after model calibration with data from the field stations the dgs extension was run at the landscape scale with wildfire to explore how climate change i e ncar ccsm4 rcp 8 5 may affect wildfire soil moisture soil temperature and vegetation as expected climate change had a significant impact on wildfire the number of wildfire ignitions was significantly higher under climate change than historical climate across the entire simulation period p 0 01 but the differences between climate scenarios also became more pronounced over time fig 7 by mid century the number of mean annual ignitions across the landscape was 1 8 under historical climate and 2 8 under climate change the variability in ignition rates was also significantly different between climate scenarios levene s test p 0 004 with 37 higher variation under climate change variance 0 78 than historical climate 0 49 annual area burned increased over time and was significantly higher under climate change 3326 ha than historical climate 1687 ha p 0 001 the number of fire years with over 10 000 hectares burned was only two under historical climate but seven under climate change at the landscape scale there was significantly less subsurface permafrost quantified using soil temperature at 3 m under climate change p 0 0001 over the course of the simulation soil temperature increased slightly under historical climate by 0 16 c but increased dramatically under climate change by 1 1 c fig 8 across the 50 y simulation period soil temperature was significantly higher under climate change than historical climate for all forest types but the rate of change differed by forest type soil temperature increased at a much faster rate in the hardwoods than the conifers under climate change in the conifer sites soil temperature increased by 0 007 c per year under climate change in the young and mature hardwoods soil temperature increased by 0 03 c and 0 39 c per year respectively resulting in a 1 9 c and 1 5 c change by mid century variation in soil temperature was higher under climate change levene s test p 1 10 9 driven by the stochasticity of wildfires annual simulated tree available soil moisture at the landscape scale was highly variable but was relatively similar p 0 04 between the historical and projected climate change scenarios despite higher precipitation under climate change fig 9 during one period from 2015 to 2022 soil moisture was 14 higher under climate change but this was due at least in part to precipitation which was 29 higher during that period soil moisture declined over time with a 10 decline under historical climate and 27 under climate change by mid century variability was higher under historical climate levene s test p 0 000000001 but that was primarily because different climate streams were used in each replicate climate change had the strongest effect on soil moisture at sites dominated by young conifers welch s test f value 471 7 p 10 9 which was expected because soil moisture has a strong effect on post fire regeneration in the model available soil moisture was higher in the conifer dominated sites than in the sites with deciduous species under both of the climate scenarios simulated mean aboveground biomass density was significantly affected by climate change welch s t test with unequal variance p 0 00002 under historical climate aboveground biomass initially increased by 30 but then stabilized around 2010 fig 10 under climate change biomass also increased 27 until 2010 but later declined by 55 under climate change by 2050 annual variation at the landscape scale was relatively small with some fluctuations due to wildfire and successional dynamics most of the variation in aboveground biomass under climate change was due to soil moisture 53 until 2018 when fire became the dominant driver explaining 70 of the variation fig 11 soil moisture was the main limitation to regeneration under climate change soil moisture explained 80 of the variation in biomass of regenerating trees and shrubs under climate change and became more important over time explaining over 90 of the variation by 2040 the dominant forest type shifted during the simulation the percentage of the landscape dominated by conifers declined from 71 to 54 under historical climate but under climate change conifers only dominated 52 of the landscape by the year 2040 fig 12 under historical climate most species that were initially high in biomass and abundance remained so until the end of the simulation including black spruce white spruce and paper birch fig 13 alder shrub birch and willow increased their landscape level biomass over time though their extent remained constant under climate change however white and black spruce decreased dramatically in biomass by 69 and 50 respectively even while their extent remained constant paper birch also had lower biomass under climate change but the other hardwoods remained relatively unaffected by climate change soil c increased annually by only 0 26 with a slightly higher rate under climate change 0 28 than historical climate 0 24 fig 14 over the 50 year simulation period dgs simulated an average gain of 4 9 tg 0 13 tg sd of c under historical climate and 5 6 tg 0 05 tg sd of c under climate change across the entire landscape 4 discussion 4 1 model evaluation dgs captured the variation in soil temperature across depths seasons and water years reasonably well though the model tended to simulate surficial temperature 10 cm depth much warmer than observed at the spruce site this suggests that the model was unable to capture the ability of the surface litter layer to moderate surface temperatures in alignment with other studies that have highlighted the challenges of simulating frozen soil thermal conductivity he et al 2021 mosses and associated soil organic horizons have low thermal conductivity values relative to mineral soil farouki 1981 and therefore reduce vertical heat fluxes through the soil profile and insulate soil from warm air temperatures these errors may also originate from advective heat fluxes associated with lateral water transport not simulated by the model for that reason the model results particularly those pertaining to soil moisture and temperature are most reliable in upland areas that have less net lateral flows than lowland sites within the spatial domain despite the poor agreement at the surface layer at the spruce site dgs captured the temperature dynamics well at deeper depths and at other sites indicating that the model effectively simulates important controls on soil temperature and the thermal status of permafrost in high latitude ecosystems bonan and shugart 1989 dyrness 1982 nicolsky et al 2007 yoshikawa and hinzman 2003 across all field sites dgs generally captured the variation in soil moisture across depths seasons and water years reasonably well though there were some discrepancies at each site soil moisture was overestimated in the summer months at the birch site likely caused by underestimating evapotranspiration marshall et al 2021b transpiration comprises a large fraction of evapotranspiration jasechko et al 2013 but is not well understood in boreal regions despite its importance to vegetation dynamics and regional climate most landscape and earth system models do not simulate the lateral transfer of water that can influence evapotranspiration and therefore cannot capture increased lateral leaching with storm events nor the ability of laterally transported groundwater to sustain evapotranspiration during summer drought this is also the case in dgs but should be a target area for future model development to advance the understanding of lowland areas common in interior alaska and throughout boreal forests at the burned site simulated soil moisture tracked observed values in the summer but overestimated values in the winter when errors in simulated snow depth or density might cause disparities without snow data at this site or a nearby site with similar vegetation conditions and fire history it is difficult to identify the specific mechanisms that produce the discrepancy and emphasize the need for more intensively monitored stands in the boreal regions overall dgs led to a more realistic simulation of soil temperature and moisture than its predecessor necn at the three field sites necn consistently overestimated the seasonal fluctuations of soil temperature fig 6 leading to the conclusion that the mature spruce site lacked permafrost despite field observations that showed otherwise also necn simulated very low soil moisture at all field sites suggesting that water limitation was more severe at all the sites throughout the year than field observations suggest with the integration of a physically based energy and water budget model shaw and permafrost model gipl into the succession model dgs produced a much higher correlation with observed soil temperature and moisture across all sites and most importantly was able to reproduce the permafrost conditions at the spruce site 4 2 wildfire and soil dynamics under climate change over the last several decades alaska has witnessed an increase in area burned calef et al 2015 kasischke et al 2010 kasischke and turetsky 2006 and the number of years with large fires kasischke and turetsky 2006 which our landscape scale simulations suggest will continue to increase as the climate warms under climate change dgs simulated a 65 increase in area burned in comparison with historical climate which is more than double the 14 30 projected area based on previous studies bachelet et al 2005 m flannigan et al 2009 however the results agree well with flannigan et al 2009 who projected a 50 increase in area burned in canada under climate change as expected soil temperature at the landscape scale was affected by both climate and vegetation type interior alaska is located within the discontinuous zone of permafrost jorgenson et al 2010 and soil temperature is driven by complex feedbacks between climate jorgenson et al 2010 fire minsley et al 2016 and vegetation jorgenson et al 2001 as air temperature warms under climate change soil temperature and active layer thickness increases and the depth to permafrost increases however changes in vegetation type soil moisture and the insulative properties of snow also play an integral role in maintaining permafrost integrity by buffering changes in air temperature jorgenson et al 2010 coniferous forests with their dense canopies and thick organic horizons buffer the effects of warmer temperatures acting as a thermal insulator between the atmosphere and the ground walker et al 2003 our model captures these dynamics with soil temperature increasing by 0 02 c y in conifers and 0 07 c y in hardwoods under climate change overall our rates of near surface 3 m soil warming 0 019 c y under climate change are similar to observed estimates in interior alaska 0 01 0 037 c y clow 2008 romanovsky et al 2019 southern norway 0 015 0 095 c year isaksen et al 2011 siberia 0 01 0 08 c y malkova 2010 oberman 2008 vasiliev et al 2008 and mongolia 0 015 c year sharkhuu et al 2007 all earth system models project near surface permafrost degradation over large geographic areas of the boreal and arctic ecosystems though the extent and rate of change differs between models koven et al 2013 mcguire et al 2018 the simulation results here demonstrate that vegetation type had a greater effect on soil moisture than climate change at the landscape scale fig 9 given the large differences in soil moisture between hardwoods and conifers forest type influences soil moisture via depth to permafrost differential transpiration rates among species interception and throughfall of snow and liquid precipitation forest impacts on the surface energy balance and different organic matter accumulation patterns hardwoods often have lower interception rates and greater throughfall but higher stomatal conductance and transpiration than conifers e g cable et al 2014 which often collectively results in lower soil moisture under hardwood canopies as simulated in this study given these hardwood forest types are projected to become increasingly prevalent as wildfire frequency increases hansen et al 2021 johnstone et al 2010b mann et al 2012 this could have ramifications for streamflow and overall productivity across the landscape barichivich et al 2014 although precipitation increased under climate change bieniek et al 2014 lader et al 2017 there was high uncertainty associated with these trends meredith et al 2019 and it did not cause a net increase in soil moisture in our study the magnitude of projected changes in soil moisture in arctic regions varies widely with most studies showing a decline in soil moisture primarily due to deep drainage following permafrost thaw though a few studies project wetting trends andresen et al 2020 the ipcc denotes soil moisture as a major source of uncertainty in this region meredith et al 2019 given the complex interactions and feedbacks between increasing precipitation longer and warming growing seasons causing greater evapotranspiration shifts in vegetation type and increases in fire frequency given that dgs underestimated c lost as soil respiration soil c is likely overestimated with dgs though the projections of soil carbon over time generally agree with other studies showing relatively stable pools for the next 50 years interior alaska is not expected to show substantial declines in soil c until after 2050 mcguire et al 2018 when this region is projected to be a net source of soil c to the atmosphere koven et al 2011 losses in soil carbon associated with higher soil temperatures in boreal forests have been documented across numerous field studies eliasson et al 2005 melillo et al 2017 shabaga et al 2022 and some modeling studies h genet et al 2013 but these studies are focused primarily on organic horizons which are only a small fraction of the total soil c pool model projections of soil c under climate change remain highly uncertain with the full range of possibilities including models that predict gains in soil c orchb constant soil c tem6 gains and then losses starting in 2150 uvic and constant soil c followed by losses starting in 2100 clm 4 5 sibcasa mcguire et al 2018 the short duration of our modeling study and makes it challenging to project how climate change will affect soil c especially given the diverse physical chemical and biological factors that influence its stability 4 3 aboveground biomass dynamics under climate change the biomass declines we projected under climate change differ from most other modeling studies in this region most models project an increase in aboveground biomass under climate change due to co2 fertilization and or an increase in the length of the growing season euskirchen et al 2017 mcguire et al 2018 zha and zhuang 2021 the state and transition model alfresco tem predicted increases in vegetation biomass both when vegetation was constant or allowed to shift over time euskirchen et al 2016a also the mean increase in vegetation c stocks differed between their climate scenarios with the highest projected c accumulation occurring in response to the fertilization effect of rising atmospheric co2 euskirchen et al 2016a in a recent multi model approach with eight esms the sensitivities of model npp responses to climate change were between 1 9 and 15 4 consistent with the mean of 13 in free air exchange co2 enrichment face experiments at the time the models were parameterized piao et al 2013 however this global mean of 13 represents face experiments primarily conducted in young temperate forests with high nutrient availability and not boreal forests walker et al 2021 in the boreal forests of ontario canada the synergistic effects of rising co2 and temperatures increased water use efficiency of black spruce by 53 over the past century but this did not always translate into commensurate increases in growth silva et al 2010 in northern latitudes 51 n growth i e basal area increment increased between 1950 and 2007 but growth declined starting in 2000 at mid latitudes 47 49 n and 1980 at lower latitudes 45 n finally existing models which do simulate a co2 fertilization effect tend to overestimate biomass albani et al 2006 though recent integrations of observations and models have reduced this uncertainty considerably keenan et al 2021 therefore without convincing evidence for the potential co2 fertilization effect on tree growth in boreal forests we decided to omit this potential driver of vegetation dynamics though we note this could be an important area for future model development although the simulated biomass trends do not agree with most other modeling studies our results are consistent with the browning trends observed from remotely sensed data in the forests of interior alaska and results with uvafme between 1981 and 2012 gross photosynthesis declined in interior alaska while growing season length remained constant in interior alaska despite rising co2 and temperatures goetz et al 2005 ju and masek 2016 this mechanism for this apparent decoupling of growth co2 and warming in forest areas is unknown but was likely caused by drought stress barber et al 2004 dai et al 2004 nutrient limitation hobbie et al 2002 insect and disease damage ayres and lombardero 2000 and or changes in resource allocation gower et al 2001 our projected declines in total aboveground biomass were also aligned with the uvafme model projections foster et al 2022 simulations with uvafme showed a 24 decline in aboveground biomass under both rcp 4 5 and 8 5 climate emissions scenarios by the end of the century in interior alaska though the differences in biomass projections between climate change and historical climate scenarios was relatively small our simulations project a comparable 22 reduction in biomass under climate change by mid century our difference in biomass between historical climate and climate change scenarios 1 5 tc ha 1 was similar initially to foster et al 2022 fig 10 2 5 tc ha 1 but by mid century our difference was 21 tc ha 1 while foster was only 5 tc ha 1 biomass declines in our simulations resulted from reductions in spruce biomass with soil moisture and wildfire as the most important drivers declines in conifer biomass and shifts in forest type and under climate change agree with other modeling studies in this region for example both afresco tem and ecosys predicted similar declines in spruce forests under climate change with corresponding increases in hardwoods euskirchen et al 2016 mekonnen et al 2019 a shift from a spruce to deciduous dominated landscape like we projected could act as a negative feedback to increasing fire activity in boreal forests pastick et al 2017 but our projections did not suggest this would happen by mid century future work applying dgs in alaska will include simulations of larger landscapes longer durations and more climate change scenarios as they become available from cmip6 4 4 model limitations although wildfire is likely the most important disturbance in interior alaska other disturbances such as aspen leaf miner and browsing by moose and hare may affect forest dynamics and their effects may increase under climate change also exotic tree species like chokecherry may increase forest biomass while sequential droughts may reduce biomass neither of which were included in our simulations simulating the effects of climate change was limited to only one climate emissions scenario due to the lack of downscaled daily climate data necessary to simulate wildfire in the scrpple extension of landis ii and hydrologic dynamics in shaw other important sources of uncertainty in the dgs simulations include potential parameter equifinality uncertainty in vegetative and soil initial conditions lack of lateral water transport and uncertainty in the climate inputs originating from differences between gcms downscaling and bias correction method and aggregation to climate regions for dgs quantifying and constraining these uncertainty sources remains an important area for future research for process models like landis ii the new dgs extension also has considerable potential to be applied in temperate forested regions to better understand and predict disturbance and hydrology feedbacks and their consequences for ecosystem function across multiple biomes given the extensive data inputs required by dgs application may be limited in areas like the tropics where data availability is a concern 5 conclusions the large extent and high c storage capacity of boreal forests makes them important to global carbon budgets but their fragility in the face of rapid changes in climate and wildfire necessitate improved understanding of the vulnerability of this large c stock we developed dgs a new extension of landis ii to simulate climate vegetation succession hydrology permafrost carbon and nutrient cycling and wildfire in a spatially explicit framework that allows for feedbacks among processes the dgs model captures how rising temperatures can cause permafrost thaw which can increase active layer thickness and depth to permafrost allowing soil water to drain deeper into the soil profile the model also simulates changes in snow depth snowmelt and freeze up and tracks soil organic matter and water and nutrient availability at user specified depths down to 75 m simulating these processes in an integrated spatially explicit framework like landis ii will allow us to disentangle the drivers and ecosystem responses in this rapidly changing ecosystem supporting information supplemental 1 climate change projections supplemental 2

24203,this research was conducted with the aim of i evaluating the sustainability of three rice production systems dbs dry bed seeding tp transplanting and wbs wet bed seeding in khuzestan province iran ii introducing the most cost effective and sustainable system and iii providing solutions to increase the systems sustainability and efficiency in order to analyze the studied systems during the 2020 2021 growing season several emergy based and economic indicators were analyzed the total emergy inputs supporting the systems are estimated to be 2 69e 16 4 16e 16 and 3 17e 16 sej ha 1 yr 1 for dbs tp and wbs respectively the three studied farming systems were determined to be inefficient and unsustainable due to their reliance on purchased resources including labor fossil fuel and seed transplant according to the environmental loading ratio and modified environmental loading ratio indicators the wbs and tp systems exerted less pressure on ecosystems and were more sustainable than the dbs system due to the greater quantity of purchased renewable flows labor and seed transplant the results of the emergy renewability emergy sustainability index and modified emergy sustainability index indices indicated that the three investigated systems were not sustainable indicating that high energy consumption in rice farming systems resulted in a significant environmental burden the economic analysis of rice production systems revealed that the dbs system was economically superior due to its lower total production costs especially labor costs when compared with the other two systems in light of the water scarcity crisis in iran the dbs method is recommended due mainly because of its ability to save 30 60 of irrigation water in the studied areas compared with the other two systems that have high water consumption due to the lower sustainability and greater environmental pressure of the dbs method compared with the two studied farming systems it is also recommended to decrease the proportion of nonrenewable inputs fossil fuel chemical fertilizers and herbicides and increase the proportion of renewable inputs organic fertilizer graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords chemical fertilizers fossil fuel irrigation water renewable inputs rice seed yield soil erosion data availability the authors do not have permission to share data 1 introduction sustainability is defined as meeting current societal needs without compromising the ability of next generations to supply their own needs ghelichkhan et al 2018 accordingly more sustainable production systems can contribute significantly to ensuring the food security of present and future societies as well as having less detrimental effects on agroecosystems hole et al 2005 furthermore assessing sustainability holistically covers the environmental economic and social factors of the production systems and provides valuable information about the current conditions of interventions in agroecosystems perez 2007 an accurate assessment of the energy environment interaction can be considered a solution for agricultural development and sustainability emergy analysis is a relatively new approach that is based on qualitative and quantitative estimates for accessible energy or energy with the ability to do work odum 1996 2007 amaral et al 2016 emergy is the achievable exergy or energy that is used to produce products or services either indirectly or directly brown and ulgiati 2004a emergy analysis considers all energy modes energy and material flows in the ecosystem and transforms them into an equivalent unit sej solar emjoules cohen et al 2006 wu et al 2013 several researchers have evaluated the sustainability of cropping systems and their effects on agroecosystems using emergy indicators zhao et al 2019 assessed the efficiency and sustainability of wheat fields under three agro climatic zones across 15 chinese provinces and concluded that a temperate continental climate zone needs additional purchased resources to maintain common wheat fields practices due to limited access to natural resources additionally they stated that the middle lower yangtze river plain which lies between temperate monsoon and subtropical monsoon climate zones was identified as the most efficient area for wheat cultivation based on the ratio of total energy input to total energy output amiri et al 2019 compared the environmental sustainability of commercial and subsistence farming systems using emergy and economic indices concluding that the subsistence farming system had higher environmental sustainability and renewable energy consumption than the commercial system reflecting its higher ecological sustainability by contrast the commercial system exhibited a greater relative advantage over the subsistence system in terms of a higher emergy exchange ratio eer higher production factor efficiency and lower emergy required per unit of output uev su et al 2020 quantified the sustainability of three rice production systems traditional integrated farming and non grain production in china using an emergy analysis and indicated that although the production systems of traditional and integrated farming were being developed they lacked competitive economic advantages over non grain production systems additionally they concluded that the integrated farming system when compared with traditional farming could be considered a more promising pattern for sustainable agriculture owing to its greater economic benefits up to 2 32 2 35 times and a reduction in non point source pollution up to 10 21 59 01 the emergy analysis has also been used to evaluate the ecological sustainability of farming systems at various scales including wheat and corn production systems in china wang et al 2014 rainfed corn wheat rotation in india singh et al 2016 and bean production systems in khorram dasht iran asgharipour et al 2019 khuzestan province is one of the major poles producing agricultural products and has a vital role in the agricultural sector of iran so that it contributes approximately 10 1 2 million ha and 18 16 750 million tons of the total harvested area and production quantity of agricultural products in iran respectively ministry of agriculture iran 2021 rice oryza sativa l belongs to the cereal family and its cultivation has recently become more popular among farmers in khuzestan province due mainly to higher economic income than spring and summer crops furthermore farmers make up a considerable portion of the khuzestan population and the rice produced meets the province s needs the total rice production quantity in khuzestan province is approximately 0 9 million tons obtained from an area of 180 000 ha ministry of agriculture iran 2021 farmers cultivate rice in three methods in khuzestan province i transplanting tr ii wet bed seeding wbs iii and dry bed seeding dbs since it is among strategically important crops in iran and khuzestan province the investigation of this plant in terms of economic and ecological parameters can identify the strengths and weaknesses of different cropping systems and introduce an eco friendlier cropping system high water consumption extensive application of machinery application of chemical fertilizers npk and methane emission caused by an anaerobic condition in rice farming systems may have a variety of environmental consequences for ecosystems linquist et al 2012 saunois et al 2020 moreno garcía et al 2021 meanwhile the sustainability of the agroecosystems largely depends upon the level of mechanization input use efficiency seed fertilizers irrigation water etc and economic and social factors in each farming method used by farmers devkota et al 2020 assuring food security and producing strategic crops for human communities on the one hand and increasing the use of renewable and nonrenewable resources to maximize agricultural production on the other has increased the pressure on the agroecosystems in recent decades this is despite the fact that climate change has had significant negative effects on the agricultural sector over the past years mainly due to raising co2 and air temperature rehman et al 2022 and governments can achieve sustainable agricultural product productivity by employing the appropriate strategies chandio et al 2019 in addition to climate change related climatic factors agronomic operations can affect the yield and sustainability of agroecosystems chishti et al 2022 gul et al 2022 accordingly analyzing ecosystem sustainability has become more critical as previously stated the emergy analysis provides a comprehensive insight into the sustainability of farming systems by considering economic and ecological indices since no study has been conducted on investigating the sustainability of rice cultivation systems in the khuzestan province this study aimed to evaluate the economic and ecological sustainability of three rice farming methods in khuzestan province the findings of this study are expected to i specify the most cost effective and sustainable rice production system in khuzestan province and ii highlight the strengths and weaknesses of each system so that farmers can make decisions based on them to promote field sustainability 2 materials and methods 2 1 description of study locations the khuzestan province 29 58 33 04 n latitude and 47 41 50 39 e longitude is located in southwestern iran and has an arid and semi arid climate araghi et al 2018 with hot summers fig 1 in this study three cities in khuzestan province including ahvaz 31 31 n 48 67 e and an altitude of 16 masl izeh 31 82 n 49 87 e and an altitude of 847 masl and shushtar 32 05 n 48 84 e and an altitude of 65 masl were selected as representatives of transplanting wet bed seeding and dry bed seeding respectively these locations were chosen due to the higher rice cultivated area and the availability of climatic data they were classified into arid and hot ahvaz and shushtar and semi arid and temperate agro climatic zones karki et al 2016 kottek et al 2006 the long term average annual rainfall minimum temperature and maximum temperature are 610 mm 13 9 c and 28 6 c for izeh 302 mm 20 5 c and 33 1 c for shushtar and 228 mm 18 8 c and 33 23 c for ahvaz respectively fig 1 illustrates long term and study year 2020 climatic information shushtar s soil texture is silty clay loam while ahvaz and izeh s soil texture is clay loam the soil physicochemical characteristics of the three study locations are summarized in table 1 2 2 description of three rice farming systems rice is cultivated in three methods across the khuzestan province indirect transplanting wet bed seeding and direct dry bed seeding abbreviated as tp wbs and dbs respectively rice is cultivated in khuzestan province from early june to late october the tp method is used for rice establishment in the eastern regions of khuzestan province due to the small size of agricultural lands about 1 3 ha and the fact that farmers traditionally cultivate rice in these regions approximately 20 25 of the rice area in khuzestan province is covered by the tp method after field preparation plowing disking leveling and bordering the rice seedlings at 4 6 leaf stage or 30 days after sowing are manually transplanted from the nursery into paddy soil in the main field rice seedlings are transplanted in a padding condition with 4 5 plants per pit at intervals of 20 20 for indigenous cultivars red anboory and champa and 25 25 for high yielding cultivars danial in the tp farming system it should be noted that the nursery area is approximately 300 350 m2 for each hectare which is located within a portion of the main field the nursery is divided into plots with dimensions of 5 10 m and germinated seeds 170 200 g m2 are sown in plots with a water depth of 4 5 cm the nitrogen n phosphorus p and potassium k are supplied via urea potassium phosphate and potassium sulfate respectively p and k are consumed prior to transplanting and in paddy soil while n is applied in three splits i 40 of urea prior to transplanting ii 30 of urea 25 30 days after transplanting iii and 30 of urea at the early boot stage weeds are controlled chemically and manually a rice combine harvester is used to harvest the mature rice crop table 2 contains additional details about the tp farming method the wbs is a traditional method of cultivating rice in khuzestan province once covering up to 75 of the cultivated rice area but now covering only about 25 of the lands to begin the whole land is irrigated and plowed disked and leveled when the soil moisture reaches an acceptable level desirable seedbed preparation facilitates boundarying and leads to larger plots after plotting the rice field the water enters the field and the workers perform a secondary leveling using a shovel and water flow following that basic fertilizers npk are applied manually in the field similarly to those in the tp method finally the germinated rice seeds are manually sown by human labor in the field with a water depth of 4 5 cm a rice combine harvester is used to harvest the mature rice crop more information about the wbs is detailed in table 2 farmers began using the dbs method in 2005 in khuzestan province and due to its relative advantages over the other two methods tp and wbs it quickly gained popularity eventually covering nearly 50 of the province s cultivated rice area following field preparation plowing disking and leveling rice seeds are sown in soil with optimal moisture about field capacity using a cereal drill with 5 6 seeds per pit at intervals of 20 20 cm for indigenous cultivars red anboory and champa and 25 25 cm for high yielding cultivars danial the boundary of rice plots is made after sowing in the dbs method fertilization operations are carried out similarly to those in the tp and wbs farming systems due to the fact that weeds emerge earlier in the dbs method compared with the tp and wbs methods their control is critical especially during the early growth stages in the dbs method it is strongly recommended that the rice field be weed free from sowing to 40 50 days after sowing to accomplish this the whole field is irrigated following rice sowing and established weeds are controlled manually and chemically a rice combine harvester is used to harvest the mature rice crop more details about the dbs are given in table 2 2 3 data preparation in the current study free renewable and nonrenewable environmental inputs as well as non free inputs were estimated for three farming systems and then measured and estimated over the 2020 rice growing season the free renewable environmental inputs were divided into internal renewable environmental inputs r1 and external renewable environmental inputs r2 r1 included solar energy wind rain and evapotranspiration while r2 consisted of river water the free nonrenewable environmental inputs included soil erosion the non free inputs consisted of human labor machinery fossil fuel lubricant n p k land rent herbicide seed and transplant the outputs of the three farming systems were economic and biological yields water erosion in agricultural systems was estimated using the rusle 1 1 revised universal soil loss equation model 2 4 research methods emergy analysis converts various available energy values into the same unit called sej solar emjoules and is described in odum 1994 1996 2000 and odum et al 2000 this method allows for the evaluation of the interaction of economic social and environmental ingredients as well as the comparison and facilitation of various production systems su et al 2020 to ensure consistency with previous emergy assessments all uevs found in the literature have been converted to the most recent planetary emergy baseline 12 0e24 sej yr 1 brown et al 2016 for emergy analysis the following are the primary procedures the first step is to draw system diagrams an energy systems language esl diagram is a representation of the symbols used in odum s esl odum 1994 the esl diagrams indicate the spatial and temporal limits of each agricultural production system as well as the major energy resources and flows and their interrelationships the esl diagrams categorize the study system s inputs into renewable or nonrenewable resources as well as local and imported resources drawing esl diagrams is necessary in order to manage the interrelationships between major ingredients and system processes fig 2 indicates the esl diagrams for three rice farming systems tp wbd and dbs the second step is creating emergy evaluation tables campbell and ohrt 2009 based on the esl diagrams the main material and energy flows needed were identified and arranged in emergy evaluation tables tables 3 5 all identified inputs are categorized into three types lu et al 2010b i renewable environmental inputs r1 internal renewable environmental inputs and r2 external renewable environmental inputs ii nonrenewable environmental inputs and iii purchased inputs fr purchased renewable inputs and fn purchased nonrenewable inputs following calculating all inputs and outputs in different rice farming systems the raw data from the study systems were multiplied by their transformities joules grams and dollars and converted into emergy units sej full details as to emergy accounting for the three rice farming systems are presented in appendices a and b the third step is calculating emergy indices several emergy based indicators are used to evaluate the ecological and environmental conditions of three rice farming systems lu et al 2010b 2018 in the current study transformity for economic yield trey

esi and emergy exchange ratio eer were used to compare the three study systems detailed descriptions are given in table 3 2 5 economic analysis different economic indices were used to analyze data from three rice farming systems including 1 gross income 2 total cost of production 3 net income 4 income to cost ratio and 5 productivity asgharipour et al 2012 table 7 the inputs and outputs were calculated on the basis of domestic market values and the exchange rate of the iranian rial to the us dollar in 2021 250 000 ir to 1 usd 3 results 3 1 structure of using emergy table 4 summarizes the free and purchased environmental inputs and outputs of the three rice farming systems in terms of physical units afterward the inputs listed in table 4 were transformed into emergy flows by multiplying them by the respective transformities uevs obtained from prior studies after investigating their appropriateness to the current study table 5 the total emergy inputs supporting the systems are estimated to be 2 69e 16 4 16e 16 and 3 17e 16 sej ha 1 yr 1 for dbs tp and wbs respectively table 5 renewable natural resources are divided into internal inputs solar energy wind and rain and external inputs river water tables 4 and 5 due to the fact that these incoming flows originate directly from the sunlight the solar energy which is also used in photosynthesis was summed with the largest source of planetary co product flows wind to avoid duplication of calculations asgharipour et al 2019 in the current study the wind an internal source and river water an external source accounted for the largest amounts of free environmental resources the free internal natural energies used in the dbs tp and wbd systems equaled 2 82e 13 3 11e 13 and 2 65e 13 sej ha 1 yr 1 respectively the free external natural energies were 5 52e 15 8 91e 15 and 7 21e 15 sej ha 1 yr 1 for the dbs tp and wbd systems respectively table 5 fig 3 a shows the structure of the emergy inputs to three rice farming systems categorized as renewable and nonrenewable emergy from the environment and purchased renewable and nonrenewable emergy while fig 3b illustrates the structure of details emergy inputs the results revealed that the renewable natural flows accounted for 20 63 5 52e 15 sej ha 1 yr 1 21 49 8 91e 15 sej ha 1 yr 1 and 22 84 7 21e 15 sej ha 1 yr 1 of total emergy into the dbs tp and wbd systems respectively fig 3a in this study the nonrenewable input was soil erosion which had an emergy value of 3 97e 15 4 98e 15 and 4 66e 15 sej ha 1 yr 1 for the dbs tp and wbd systems respectively table 5 additionally soil erosion as a nonrenewable environmental resource accounted for 14 7 12 0 and 14 7 of total emergy input into dbs tp and wbd systems respectively fig 3a the results indicated that the values of purchased inputs in the dbs tp and wbd systems were 1 74e 16 2 77e 16 and 1 98e 16 sej ha 1 yr 1 respectively table 5 as can be seen in table 5 purchased flows account for a large portion of the inputs to the three studied systems the top three inputs into the dbs and wbd systems were n land and fuel accounting for 23 19 and 10 of the total emergy input into the dbs system respectively and 19 dbs 6 18e 15 sej ha 1 yr 1 and wbd 6 18e 15 sej ha 1 yr 1 16 dbs 5 00e 15 sej ha 1 yr 1 and wbd 5 00e 15 sej ha 1 yr 1 and 8 dbs 2 76e 15 sej ha 1 yr 1 and wbd 2 48e 15 sej ha 1 yr 1 of the total emergy input into the wbd system respectively in comparison land and n comprised the largest proportion of total emergy input into the tp system averaging 23 9 46e 15 sej ha 1 yr 1 and 15 6 18e 15 sej ha 1 yr 1 respectively followed by fuel and labor averaging 11 4 60e 15 sej ha 1 yr 1 and 11 4 55e 15 sej ha 1 yr 1 respectively fig 3b in general the major share of total emergy input was related to purchased inflows with a negligible share of renewable resources fr 1 2 and 2 for dbs tp and wbd systems respectively and a significant share of nonrenewable resources fn 64 65 and 60 for dbs tp and wbd systems respectively fig 3a the dbs tp and wbd systems received a total of 2 69e 16 4 16e 16 and 3 17e 16 sej ha 1 yr 1 of emergy respectively table 5 as illustrated in fig 3a fn r1 and r2 received the most significant share of the total inflows into the three studied systems 3 2 indices analysis numerous indices were used to compare the functional characteristics of three rice farming systems tables 6 and 7 the study s indices are classified into four categories 1 indices of efficiency 2 indices of environmental pressure 3 indices of sustainability and 4 indices of economic performance 3 2 1 indices of efficiency the uev is a useful indicator for evaluating and comparing the efficiency of similar production systems economic yield ey and biological yield by had uev values of 3 73e 05 and 3 51e 05 5 66e 05 and 5 33e 05 and 4 54e 05 and 4 27e 05 sej j 1 respectively for the dbs tp and wbd systems table 6 the spe indicator is used to quantify the amount of emergy produced in a system expressing the amount of emergy required to support each unit of produced biomass in mass g or kg the dbs system had the lowest spe for economic and biological yields averaging 5 48e 09 and 4 39e 09 sej g 1 respectively followed by the wbd system averaging 6 67e 09 and 5 34e 09 sej g 1 and the tp system averaging 8 32e 09 and 6 66e 09 sej g 1 respectively table 6 the uev index is only affected by the efficiency with which total emergy inputs are transformed it is not directly influenced by substitute resource types the eyr is a measure of a system s ability to use local inputs and can be used to compensate for the uev s weakness the findings indicated that the eyr trend was from small to large as indicated by the tp 1 503 dbs 1 548 and wbs systems 1 601 table 6 the eir and eir detail the investment in nonrenewable and renewable natural resources in each system the eir and eir values for the dbs system were 1 825 and 3 131 for the tp system were 1 990 and 3 097 and for the wbs system were 1 663 and 2 734 respectively table 6 3 2 2 environmental pressure indices elr and its modified version elr define the pressure exerted on the environment by systems during a specific production process the elr values for the dbs tp and wbs systems were 3 847 4 654 and 4 378 respectively the elr values were significantly different from the elr values and for the dbs tp and wbs systems respectively elr values of 83 897 46 420 and 40 896 were calculated table 6 3 2 3 indices of sustainability the r is calculated as the amount of renewable emergy entering the system divided by the total amount of emergy input the wbs system had the highest r values averaging 22 95 followed by the tp 21 26 and dbs 20 36 systems the compound indices of esi and esi are calculated by dividing the eyr by the elr and or elr reflecting the system s sustainability the esi and esi values in the current study were 0 402 and 0 018 for the dbs system 0 323 and 0 032 for the tp system and 0 366 and 0 039 for the wbs system respectively table 6 3 2 4 indices of economic performance the three study systems were evaluated using a variety of economic indices dbs tp and wbs economic and emergy assessments of systems can be made using the eer which serves as a bridge between them the eer values of 2 332 3 539 and 2 839 were obtained for dbs tp and wbs systems respectively table 6 additionally gross income total cost of production net income income to cost ratio and productivity were calculated for the dbs system as 6037 6 ha 1 1292 7 ha 1 4744 9 ha 1 4 67 and 3 79 kg 1 respectively for the tp system as 5814 0 ha 1 2875 7 ha 1 2938 3 ha 1 1 02 and 1 65 kg 1 and for the wbs system as 6120 0 1494 1 ha 1 4625 9 ha 1 3 09 and 3 34 kg 1 respectively table 7 4 discussion 4 1 the quantity and kind of incoming flows influence the emergy structure of systems as previously stated the total emergy inputs of the three rice production systems were varied the dbs system had the lowest total emergy inputs while the tp and wbs systems had 55 and 18 higher total emergy inputs respectively than the dbs system generally greater emergy flow into agricultural systems can be directly attributed to those mechanization and industrialization levels lu et al 2010b but other inputs into a system can sometimes influence the total emergy flow asgharipour et al 2020 su et al 2020 the higher total emergy flow incoming the tp system was primarily attributable to the quantity of irrigation water fossil fuel required for irrigating fields land rent and human labor which was significantly greater than the other two systems dbs and wbs an 18 difference in total emergy flow between the dbs and wbs systems can also be attributed to the greater amount of irrigation water and human labor in the wbd system when compared with the dbs system these findings concur with those of chen et al 2021 who evaluated the environmental consequences and sustainability of three rice based rotation systems rice crayfish rice fallow and rice wheat in quanjiao china and concluded that the rice crayfish system had a higher total emergy flow than the other two systems due to the higher consumption of incoming inputs such as forage medicine water and electricity in a study moonilall et al 2020 assessed five maize farming systems control chemical fertilizer poultry manure biochar rice hull biochar and sugarcane filter press using emergy based approach and reported that the poultry manure biochar had the highest total emergy flow 3 33 e 17 sej ha 1 yr 1 compared with four other farming systems classifying input flows into aggregate categories r n0 fr and fn provides comprehensive data for investigating each system in greater depth the share of solar energy wind and rain r1 was negligible whereas river water r2 comprised 21 21 and 23 of the total emergy flow for dbs tp and wbs systems respectively fig 3b the contribution of soil erosion as a nonrenewable environmental resource n0 was 15 12 and 15 of the total emergy for dbs tp and wbd systems respectively fig 3b although the least amount of irrigation water and soil erosion was detected in the dbs system the amount of irrigation water consumption and soil erosion in all types of rice farming systems in khuzestan province is high in comparison with other rice farming systems in this regard the analysis of a study conducted by amini et al 2020 reveals that the emergy of irrigation water and soil erosion in our study is 4 6 7 5 and 2 2 5 times higher respectively than rice production systems in the province of mazandaran iran s principal rice producing region it appears that higher evapotranspiration in response to high temperatures could explain why rice farming systems in khuzestan province use more irrigation water than in other parts of the country moreover the high rate of soil erosion demonstrates the fragility of the agricultural systems in khuzestan a higher rate of soil erosion in khuzestan province rice fields compared with other iranian rice fields can be attributed to the continuous inflow and outflow of water resulting from high water consumption and low soil organic matter as previously explained the largest portion of the total emergy input into the study systems was comprised of purchased flows the greater proportion of purchased resources reflects the substantial dependence of the examined systems on human economic resources asgharipour et al 2019 the examined systems had a dependency on purchased inputs in the following order from lowest to highest wbs 62 dbs 65 and tp 67 fig 3a it was observed that the total amount of purchased input flows and the structure of three sets of inputs in terms of human labor machinery fossil fuel land herbicide and seed significantly varied in the dbs tp and wbd systems respectively 1 74e 16 2 77e 16 and 1 98e 16 sej ha 1 yr 1 of the total input emergy were supplied by purchased input flows indicating a greater contribution and quantity of purchased flows in the tp system for carrying out the rice production processes than in the other two systems the input flows to the three investigated systems are classified as either fr or fn in the tp system human labor emergy comprised the largest proportion of fr human labor is used to perform agronomic operations such as preparing whole farms and plots seedling production and transplanting rice seedlings from the nursery to the main field and field management irrigation fertilization weeding etc however in the wbs system seed emergy comprised a larger share of fr because seeds are spread manually in the field and seed losses are typically greater than in the other two systems in the dbs system the contribution of labor and seed to fr was nearly identical and lower than in the other two systems su et al 2020 evaluated the sustainability of three agricultural production systems traditional rice monoculture integrated farming and non grain production in china they stated that human labor plays a larger role in rice monoculture and integrated systems because mechanization is generally still low across china s relatively fragmented farmland moonilall et al 2020 analyzed maize fields at five amendment application treatments control chemical fertilizer poultry manure biochar rice hull biochar and sugarcane filter press and reported that the labor human had the largest share compared with the other input flows in the control chemical fertilizer and sugarcane filter press treatments similarly there were differences in the nonrenewable inputs purchased by the examined systems since the area of agricultural land where rice is grown using the tp method izeh city is frequently between 1 and 2 hectares and the total agricultural land in this region is less than in other regions of khuzestan province the land rental cost is higher and the largest proportion of purchased nonrenewable inputs fn was land followed by n and fuel due to the larger fields the cost of renting land for the dbs and wbs systems was lower than for the tp system and n emergy accounted for the largest proportion of nonrenewable inputs purchased fn chemical fertilizers are always a substantial portion of the fn zhao et al 2019 asgharipour et al 2020 shang et al 2021 meanwhile the proportion of n is typically greater than that of other fertilizers k and p asgharipour et al 2019 amiri et al 2021 in this regard amiri et al 2019 analyzed the sustainability of two subsistence and commercial rapeseed cultivation systems in khorramabad iran and found that n and p comprised approximately 20 and 15 of the total emergy entering both systems respectively 4 2 efficiency of rice farming systems is affected by type and amount of inputs and outputs evaluating the efficiency of systems enables the identification of factors that contribute to the decrease or increase of efficiency the uev index can be used to examine the emergy efficiency of agricultural systems brown and ulgiati 2004a a lower uev indicates that fewer emergy inputs are necessary to produce a given output wang et al 2015 the uev values of the rice farming systems indicated lower uev of inputs in the dbs system than those of the two studied systems tp and wbs such that the uev value in the dbs system was 52 and 22 less than those of the tp and wbs systems respectively this means that the tp and wbs systems have lower environmental and economic efficiency of emergy consumption compared with the dbs system odum 1996 lu et al 2010b in the current study increased irrigation water consumption soil erosion labor force and fossil fuel were among the inputs that contributed to the tp system s lower efficiency compared with the other two systems similarly the lower efficiency of the wbs system in comparison with the dbs system can be attributed to the greater amount of irrigation water soil erosion labor force and seed rate utilized moreover the spe index which measures the amount of emergy required per unit of biomass produced in the process confirms that the dbs system is more efficient than the wbs and tp systems up to 22 and 52 respectively lyu et al 2020 amiri et al 2021 evaluated the efficiency of four shallot production systems i e mechanized traditional conservation and natural habitat using some indicators such as uev and spe they found that shallot production in natural habitats had a higher economic environmental efficiency than the other three production systems due to lower total emergy inputs in addition comparing the spe values revealed that natural habitat and conservation systems had a lower intensity and density of emergy flow than mechanized and conventional systems and that their efficiency was higher wang et al 2018 concluded that the application of biochar in a rice wheat farming system in china boosted the emergy efficiency by 11 47 when compared to a control system although the uev indicator is useful for comparing the efficiency of systems with identical outputs it only responds to the conversion efficiency of total emergy inputs and is unaffected by alternative input types zhang et al 2011 the eyr measures the capacity of systems to utilize local resources and is able to compensate for the weakness of the uev index therefore it can be introduced as an input source based efficiency indicator wang et al 2015 a higher eyr value indicates that a system is more dependent on environmental resources than purchased resources chen et al 2006 eyr values of 15 4 to 15 and 4 indicate high moderate and low system sustainability respectively zhan et al 2020 consequently the sustainability of the three studied rice systems was determined to be low primarily due to their reliance on purchased resources despite the fact that the tp system consumed more irrigation water as a free environmental resource than the other two systems dbs and wbs the purchased resources such as human labor soil erosion and fossil fuel caused the tp system to be less sustainable than the other two although the eyrs for rice production systems in khuzestan iran are within the range of values reported for agricultural production systems worldwide lu et al 2010b zhang et al 2012 su et al 2020 amiri et al 2021 a significant difference is observed between rice production agroecosystems in the northern regions of iran eyr 5 13 and three study systems eyr 1 548 1 503 and 1 601 for dbs tp and wbs respectively in the khuzestan province amini et al 2020 comparing our findings with those of amini et al 2020 reveals that the main reason for the greater sustainability of rice fields in the northern regions of iran as compared with the southern regions province of khuzestan is the lower consumption of fuel and nitrogen the eir index indicates the magnitude of the investment made with purchased resources the greater the eir the greater the amount of purchased emergy required to match the amount produced by the local system liu et al 2020 additionally a system with a lower value can enter the market more competitively while a system with a higher value indicates a higher level of economic development zhang and long 2010 the tp system had the highest eir value indicating a higher production cost in this agroecosystem than the other two systems dbs and wbs in the tp system despite the high quantity of free inputs especially irrigation water and soil erosion the cost of rice production was higher than in the dbs and wbs systems due to higher labor costs fuel required to irrigate fields and high land rent moreover a comparison of the dbs and wbs systems revealed that the amount of inputs purchased in the dbs system is approximately 14 less however a difference of approximately 25 between the two study systems in free environmental inputs primarily irrigation water and soil erosion resulted in a lower eir index value for the wbs system than for the dbs system in examining the sustainability of rice production in mazandaran province iran amini et al 2020 obtained an eir value of 0 24 indicating that the system is less dependent on purchased resources than on free environmental resources cheng et al 2017 investigated three systems of crops poultry and fish production and reported eir values of 3 98 4 63 and 5 87 for these three systems respectively they suggested a lower eir in crop systems compared with livestock and fisheries systems this study employed a modified eir eir to evaluate the compatibility of free nonrenewable resources in rice production systems with free renewable environmental resources it is an index comparing purchased resources with renewable environmental resources when the amount of nonrenewable environmental inputs in the production systems is significant and accounts for a large portion of the total emergy input of the system the eir index demonstrates the differences in the sustainability of the systems more effectively than the eir index and is more appropriate for comparing two or more production systems after removing nonrenewable environmental inputs soil erosion in this study our findings indicated that the eir value for the dbs system was slightly higher than that of the tp system however the wbd system had the lowest values for both indicators eir and eir 4 3 environmental pressure on rice farming systems would be mitigated by increasing the proportion of renewable resources and decreasing the proportion of nonrenewable resources the elr and elr indices are utilized to determine the potential environmental stress resulting from human activities garcia et al 2014 they evaluate the production procedure quantify the consumption of environmental services and evaluate the potential ecological strain the difference in environmental pressure is more clearly expressed than with the elr index as a result of the formula s separation of renewable and nonrenewable inputs amiri et al 2021 when the elrs value exceeds 10 a system is deemed unsustainable whereas elrs values between 2 and 10 and less than 2 indicate semi sustainable and sustainable systems respectively zhan et al 2020 the elr value of the dbs system was 14 and 21 less than that of the wbd and tp systems respectively according to our findings despite the fact that the elr value of the dbs system was 2 05 and 1 8 times that of the wbs and tp systems respectively the lower elr values for the dbs system are primarily attributable to the lower input flows of fr fn and n0 likewise comparing the wbd and tp systems revealed that the lower input flows of fr fn and n0 in the wbs system led to a lower elr value than the tp system according to the classification of zhan et al 2020 all three studied systems were categorized as semi sustainable since the emergy amount of purchased renewable flows fr human labor and seed was significantly lower in the dbs system than in the wbd and tp systems the elr value for the dbs system was roughly twice that of the wbd and tp systems consequently the wbs and tp systems exerted less pressure on the rice ecosystems in the province of khuzestan and were more sustainable than the dbs system amiri et al 2021 examined four shallot production systems in the province of lorestan iran and determined that the mechanized elr 23 705 traditional elr 26 306 and conservation elr 41 695 systems were not sustainable while the natural habitat system elr 7 430 was sustainable using the modified elr elr amiri et al 2021 also indicated that four of the aforementioned systems were semi sustainable 4 4 sustainability of rice farming systems is improved by using more renewable resources if a system s production based processes use a greater proportion of renewable resources its r value will be greater and this system will likely be more sustainable la rosa et al 2008 a system that uses less nonrenewable resources and focuses more on the use of renewable resources is more economically successful over the long term brown and ulgiati 2004a the lower r value in the dbs system compared with the other two systems is due to the rice s lower reliance on renewable emergy input whereas the higher r value in the wbs system compared with the tp system can be attributed to the rice s lower reliance on nonrenewable emergy input in this regard amiri et al 2019 examined two rapeseed commercial and subsistence systems in the province of lorestan iran and determined that their respective r values were 19 90 and 5 30 they stated that the greater use of nonrenewable resources in the commercial system compared with the subsistence system is the primary reason for the lower r value in a study in china a r value of 52 66 was estimated for the production of traditional rice culture su et al 2020 monilall et al 2020 in evaluating five maize farming systems found that systems that use more renewable resources and less purchased resources are more sustainable using the esi and esi indices and taking into account the system s sustainability the production process of a system s efficiency can be measured ulgiati and brown 1998 the esi characterizes the availability of a process that can perform satisfactorily while exerting less pressure on the environment and its calculations are based on the compatibility of the environmental and economic sectors amini et al 2020 at low esi values system sustainability is low zhang and long 2010 whereas the esi index illustrates the relative sustainability benefits of the system according to the esi and esi indices the three investigated systems were not sustainable which is indicative of the fact that high energy consumption in rice farming systems exerted significant environmental pressure although the esi and esi values were less than 1 for all three study systems and there was no significant difference between the systems in the esi index the dbs system had a lower esi value than the tp and wbs systems due to the type of emergy inputs and a greater proportion of nonrenewable inputs amini et al 2020 reported esi and esi values of 0 12 and 0 46 in the rice fields of mazandaran province iran in a study lu et al 2010a examined the rice production system in japan and reported an esi index of 1 83 4 5 economic superiority of a system would be attained by lowering production costs and boosting final output in addition to the product s market value the eer index also takes into account price and monetary value differences between markets in other words the exchange of the system can be evaluated using the eer index based on the equilibrium between the profit obtained from selling the product and the input emergy required for its production lu and campbell 2009 this index is considered a measure to demonstrate the business advantage of a product produced in one system versus another system producing the same product odum 1996 brown and ulgiati 2004b eer index can be used to determine the relative advantage of the seller producer or the buyer consumer in a product exchange the lower eer value for the dbs system compared with the tp and wbs systems reflects the superior performance of the dbs system in commodity trading on the market compared with the tp and wbs systems in comparison with the dbs and wbd systems the tp system was less economically efficient at converting input energy into a marketable product approximately half of the emergy used in the dbs system was converted into money emergy that was traded on the market whereas this proportion was approximately one third in the wbs system and less than one tenth in the tp system the eer value reaches 1 if the values of u in the dbs tp and wbs systems are reduced from 2 69e 16 4 16e 16 and 3 17e 16 to 1 15e 16 1 18e 16 and 1 12e 16 respectively to achieve this objective the cultivation of high yielding genotypes and the optimal use of resources such as chemical and organic fertilizers water seed transplant machinery etc will result in a reduction of the eer index in this regard asgharipour et al 2020 examined four greenhouse production systems including cucumber tomato bell pepper and eggplant and determined that 77 60 50 and 37 of the emergy inputs to the systems were converted into the emergy received by the producers from the market exchange rate for the crops respectively in addition to the eer several other indices gross income total cost of production net income income to cost ratio and productivity were used to evaluate the economic efficiency of the three study systems and they all indicated that the dbs system was economically superior to the other two tp and wbd since the grain yield produced by all three systems is comparable the main reason for this system s superiority can be attributed to its lower total production costs particularly labor 5 conclusion and recommendations the dbs tp and wbd systems respectively received 2 69e 16 4 16e 16 and 3 17e 16 sej ha 1 yr 1 clearly the difference in irrigation water soil erosion fossil fuel and human labor accounts for the majority of the difference in total emergy input between the three studied systems the purchased flows into the study systems comprised the largest proportion of the total emergy input indicating a strong dependence of the studied systems on human economic resources with the wbs 62 dbs 65 and tp 67 systems exhibiting decreasing dependence on purchased resources among renewable environmental inputs river water accounted for 21 21 and 23 of the total emergy flow for dbs tp and wbs systems respectively whereas soil erosion accounted for 15 12 and 15 of the total emergy flow for dbs tp and wbd systems respectively despite the fact that the tp system had lower efficiency and sustainability than the dbs and wbs systems the efficiency and sustainability of all three were determined to be low primarily due to their reliance on purchased resources the wbd system entered the market more competitively due to its lower eir and eir values all three studied systems were classified as semi sustainable by the elr index but were deemed unsustainable when this index was modified elr due to the greater amount of purchased renewable flows the wbs and tp systems exerted less pressure on rice ecosystems and were more sustainable than the dbs system fr human labor and seed the results of the r esi and esi indices indicated that the three investigated systems fell into the category of non sustainability which is indicative of the fact that high energy consumption in rice farming systems resulted in a significant environmental burden in contrast the sustainability of the dbs system was inferior to those of the tp and wbs systems due to the type of emergy inputs and the greater proportion of nonrenewable inputs surprisingly the economic analysis of rice production systems produced different outcomes than the analyses of efficiency sustainability and environmental stress approximately half of the emergy used in the dbs system was converted into money emergy that was traded on the market compared with approximately one third in the wbs system and less than one third in the tp system this demonstrates the superior performance of the dbs system in trading commodities on the market in addition other indices gross income total cost of production net income income to cost ratio and productivity suggested that the dbs system was economically superior due to its lower total cost of production particularly human labor when compared with the other two systems in this study the more environmentally friendly system wbs did not necessarily have a higher output conversely lower total emergy inputs dbs did not result in greater sustainability and less environmental pressure consequently it is necessary to adopt suitable agronomic and management strategies so that in addition to increasing the sustainability of rice production systems farmers obtain acceptable economic benefits and most importantly the water resources of the study area are optimally utilized in this regard the following recommendations are made based on our research findings and the agricultural situation of the study area 1 the water shortage crisis in arid and semi arid regions such as iran and khuzestan province necessitates the adoption of crop cultivation techniques that minimize water consumption in addition to having a lower total production cost the dbs farming method saves between 30 and 60 percent of irrigation water compared with the other two cultivation systems this method s lack of sustainability and increased environmental pressure can be remedied by decreasing the proportion of nonrenewable inputs fossil fuel chemical fertilizers and herbicides and increasing the proportion of renewable inputs organic fertilizer 2 the erosion rate in all three rice farming ecosystems was notably high which can be attributed to the high consumption of irrigation water and the lack of organic matter in the soil which led to water erosion to increase soil organic matter it would be prudent to consider agronomic solutions such as applying organic fertilizers and preventing the burning of plant residues water erosion can also be reduced by managing irrigation according to the crop s actual needs 6 limitations and future research directions this study collected data on inputs and outputs using a questionnaire so some participants may have refused to provide truthful responses or provided inaccurate information this study was cross sectional which makes causal inferences difficult the lengthy questionnaires slowed down data collection and diminished participant accuracy the present research can be used to produce rice in settings like khuzestan iran with caution and enough expertise to generalize to other agricultural systems our findings specified that the dbs method significantly saves water consumption hence it would suggest researchers focus on increasing the sustainability of this rice farming system as well as investigate alternative crops with equal economic value and less

24203,this research was conducted with the aim of i evaluating the sustainability of three rice production systems dbs dry bed seeding tp transplanting and wbs wet bed seeding in khuzestan province iran ii introducing the most cost effective and sustainable system and iii providing solutions to increase the systems sustainability and efficiency in order to analyze the studied systems during the 2020 2021 growing season several emergy based and economic indicators were analyzed the total emergy inputs supporting the systems are estimated to be 2 69e 16 4 16e 16 and 3 17e 16 sej ha 1 yr 1 for dbs tp and wbs respectively the three studied farming systems were determined to be inefficient and unsustainable due to their reliance on purchased resources including labor fossil fuel and seed transplant according to the environmental loading ratio and modified environmental loading ratio indicators the wbs and tp systems exerted less pressure on ecosystems and were more sustainable than the dbs system due to the greater quantity of purchased renewable flows labor and seed transplant the results of the emergy renewability emergy sustainability index and modified emergy sustainability index indices indicated that the three investigated systems were not sustainable indicating that high energy consumption in rice farming systems resulted in a significant environmental burden the economic analysis of rice production systems revealed that the dbs system was economically superior due to its lower total production costs especially labor costs when compared with the other two systems in light of the water scarcity crisis in iran the dbs method is recommended due mainly because of its ability to save 30 60 of irrigation water in the studied areas compared with the other two systems that have high water consumption due to the lower sustainability and greater environmental pressure of the dbs method compared with the two studied farming systems it is also recommended to decrease the proportion of nonrenewable inputs fossil fuel chemical fertilizers and herbicides and increase the proportion of renewable inputs organic fertilizer graphical abstract image graphical

sustainability is defined as meeting current societal needs without compromising the ability of next generations to supply their own needs ghelichkhan et al 2018 accordingly more sustainable production systems can contribute significantly to ensuring the food security of present and future societies as well as having less detrimental effects on agroecosystems hole et al 2005 furthermore assessing sustainability holistically covers the environmental economic and social factors of the production systems and provides valuable information about the current conditions of interventions in agroecosystems perez 2007 an accurate assessment of the energy environment interaction can be considered a solution for agricultural development and sustainability emergy analysis is a relatively new approach that is based on qualitative and quantitative estimates for accessible energy or energy with the ability to do work odum 1996 2007 amaral et al 2016 emergy is the achievable exergy or energy that is used to produce products or services either indirectly or directly brown and ulgiati 2004a emergy analysis considers all energy modes energy and material flows in the ecosystem and transforms them into an equivalent unit sej solar emjoules cohen et al 2006 wu et al 2013 several researchers have evaluated the sustainability of cropping systems and their effects on agroecosystems using emergy indicators zhao et al 2019 assessed the efficiency and sustainability of wheat fields under three agro climatic zones across 15 chinese provinces and concluded that a temperate continental climate zone needs additional purchased resources to maintain common wheat fields practices due to limited access to natural resources additionally they stated that the middle lower yangtze river plain which lies between temperate monsoon and subtropical monsoon climate zones was identified as the most efficient area for wheat cultivation based on the ratio of total energy input to total energy output amiri et al 2019 compared the environmental sustainability of commercial and subsistence farming systems using emergy and economic indices concluding that the subsistence farming system had higher environmental sustainability and renewable energy consumption than the commercial system reflecting its higher ecological sustainability by contrast the commercial system exhibited a greater relative advantage over the subsistence system in terms of a higher emergy exchange ratio eer higher production factor efficiency and lower emergy required per unit of output uev su et al 2020 quantified the sustainability of three rice production systems traditional integrated farming and non grain production in china using an emergy analysis and indicated that although the production systems of traditional and integrated farming were being developed they lacked competitive economic advantages over non grain production systems additionally they concluded that the integrated farming system when compared with traditional farming could be considered a more promising pattern for sustainable agriculture owing to its greater economic benefits up to 2 32 2 35 times and a reduction in non point source pollution up to 10 21 59 01 the emergy analysis has also been used to evaluate the ecological sustainability of farming systems at various scales including wheat and corn production systems in china wang et al 2014 rainfed corn wheat rotation in india singh et al 2016 and bean production systems in khorram dasht iran asgharipour et al 2019 khuzestan province is one of the major poles producing agricultural products and has a vital role in the agricultural sector of iran so that it contributes approximately 10 1 2 million ha and 18 16 750 million tons of the total harvested area and production quantity of agricultural products in iran respectively ministry of agriculture iran 2021 rice oryza sativa l belongs to the cereal family and its cultivation has recently become more popular among farmers in khuzestan province due mainly to higher economic income than spring and summer crops furthermore farmers make up a considerable portion of the khuzestan population and the rice produced meets the province s needs the total rice production quantity in khuzestan province is approximately 0 9 million tons obtained from an area of 180 000 ha ministry of agriculture iran 2021 farmers cultivate rice in three methods in khuzestan province i transplanting tr ii wet bed seeding wbs iii and dry bed seeding dbs since it is among strategically important crops in iran and khuzestan province the investigation of this plant in terms of economic and ecological parameters can identify the strengths and weaknesses of different cropping systems and introduce an eco friendlier cropping system high water consumption extensive application of machinery application of chemical fertilizers npk and methane emission caused by an anaerobic condition in rice farming systems may have a variety of environmental consequences for ecosystems linquist et al 2012 saunois et al 2020 moreno garcía et al 2021 meanwhile the sustainability of the agroecosystems largely depends upon the level of mechanization input use efficiency seed fertilizers irrigation water etc and economic and social factors in each farming method used by farmers devkota et al 2020 assuring food security and producing strategic crops for human communities on the one hand and increasing the use of renewable and nonrenewable resources to maximize agricultural production on the other has increased the pressure on the agroecosystems in recent decades this is despite the fact that climate change has had significant negative effects on the agricultural sector over the past years mainly due to raising co2 and air temperature rehman et al 2022 and governments can achieve sustainable agricultural product productivity by employing the appropriate strategies chandio et al 2019 in addition to climate change related climatic factors agronomic operations can affect the yield and sustainability of agroecosystems chishti et al 2022 gul et al 2022 accordingly analyzing ecosystem sustainability has become more critical as previously stated the emergy analysis provides a comprehensive insight into the sustainability of farming systems by considering economic and ecological indices since no study has been conducted on investigating the sustainability of rice cultivation systems in the khuzestan province this study aimed to evaluate the economic and ecological sustainability of three rice farming methods in khuzestan province the findings of this study are expected to i specify the most cost effective and sustainable rice production system in khuzestan province and ii highlight the strengths and weaknesses of each system so that farmers can make decisions based on them to promote field sustainability 2 materials and methods 2 1 description of study locations the khuzestan province 29 58 33 04 n latitude and 47 41 50 39 e longitude is located in southwestern iran and has an arid and semi arid climate araghi et al 2018 with hot summers fig 1 in this study three cities in khuzestan province including ahvaz 31 31 n 48 67 e and an altitude of 16 masl izeh 31 82 n 49 87 e and an altitude of 847 masl and shushtar 32 05 n 48 84 e and an altitude of 65 masl were selected as representatives of transplanting wet bed seeding and dry bed seeding respectively these locations were chosen due to the higher rice cultivated area and the availability of climatic data they were classified into arid and hot ahvaz and shushtar and semi arid and temperate agro climatic zones karki et al 2016 kottek et al 2006 the long term average annual rainfall minimum temperature and maximum temperature are 610 mm 13 9 c and 28 6 c for izeh 302 mm 20 5 c and 33 1 c for shushtar and 228 mm 18 8 c and 33 23 c for ahvaz respectively fig 1 illustrates long term and study year 2020 climatic information shushtar s soil texture is silty clay loam while ahvaz and izeh s soil texture is clay loam the soil physicochemical characteristics of the three study locations are summarized in table 1 2 2 description of three rice farming systems rice is cultivated in three methods across the khuzestan province indirect transplanting wet bed seeding and direct dry bed seeding abbreviated as tp wbs and dbs respectively rice is cultivated in khuzestan province from early june to late october the tp method is used for rice establishment in the eastern regions of khuzestan province due to the small size of agricultural lands about 1 3 ha and the fact that farmers traditionally cultivate rice in these regions approximately 20 25 of the rice area in khuzestan province is covered by the tp method after field preparation plowing disking leveling and bordering the rice seedlings at 4 6 leaf stage or 30 days after sowing are manually transplanted from the nursery into paddy soil in the main field rice seedlings are transplanted in a padding condition with 4 5 plants per pit at intervals of 20 20 for indigenous cultivars red anboory and champa and 25 25 for high yielding cultivars danial in the tp farming system it should be noted that the nursery area is approximately 300 350 m2 for each hectare which is located within a portion of the main field the nursery is divided into plots with dimensions of 5 10 m and germinated seeds 170 200 g m2 are sown in plots with a water depth of 4 5 cm the nitrogen n phosphorus p and potassium k are supplied via urea potassium phosphate and potassium sulfate respectively p and k are consumed prior to transplanting and in paddy soil while n is applied in three splits i 40 of urea prior to transplanting ii 30 of urea 25 30 days after transplanting iii and 30 of urea at the early boot stage weeds are controlled chemically and manually a rice combine harvester is used to harvest the mature rice crop table 2 contains additional details about the tp farming method the wbs is a traditional method of cultivating rice in khuzestan province once covering up to 75 of the cultivated rice area but now covering only about 25 of the lands to begin the whole land is irrigated and plowed disked and leveled when the soil moisture reaches an acceptable level desirable seedbed preparation facilitates boundarying and leads to larger plots after plotting the rice field the water enters the field and the workers perform a secondary leveling using a shovel and water flow following that basic fertilizers npk are applied manually in the field similarly to those in the tp method finally the germinated rice seeds are manually sown by human labor in the field with a water depth of 4 5 cm a rice combine harvester is used to harvest the mature rice crop more information about the wbs is detailed in table 2 farmers began using the dbs method in 2005 in khuzestan province and due to its relative advantages over the other two methods tp and wbs it quickly gained popularity eventually covering nearly 50 of the province s cultivated rice area following field preparation plowing disking and leveling rice seeds are sown in soil with optimal moisture about field capacity using a cereal drill with 5 6 seeds per pit at intervals of 20 20 cm for indigenous cultivars red anboory and champa and 25 25 cm for high yielding cultivars danial the boundary of rice plots is made after sowing in the dbs method fertilization operations are carried out similarly to those in the tp and wbs farming systems due to the fact that weeds emerge earlier in the dbs method compared with the tp and wbs methods their control is critical especially during the early growth stages in the dbs method it is strongly recommended that the rice field be weed free from sowing to 40 50 days after sowing to accomplish this the whole field is irrigated following rice sowing and established weeds are controlled manually and chemically a rice combine harvester is used to harvest the mature rice crop more details about the dbs are given in table 2 2 3 data preparation in the current study free renewable and nonrenewable environmental inputs as well as non free inputs were estimated for three farming systems and then measured and estimated over the 2020 rice growing season the free renewable environmental inputs were divided into internal renewable environmental inputs r1 and external renewable environmental inputs r2 r1 included solar energy wind rain and evapotranspiration while r2 consisted of river water the free nonrenewable environmental inputs included soil erosion the non free inputs consisted of human labor machinery fossil fuel lubricant n p k land rent herbicide seed and transplant the outputs of the three farming systems were economic and biological yields water erosion in agricultural systems was estimated using the rusle 1 1 revised universal soil loss equation model 2 4 research methods emergy analysis converts various available energy values into the same unit called sej solar emjoules and is described in odum 1994 1996 2000 and odum et al 2000 this method allows for the evaluation of the interaction of economic social and environmental ingredients as well as the comparison and facilitation of various production systems su et al 2020 to ensure consistency with previous emergy assessments all uevs found in the literature have been converted to the most recent planetary emergy baseline 12 0e24 sej yr 1 brown et al 2016 for emergy analysis the following are the primary procedures the first step is to draw system diagrams an energy systems language esl diagram is a representation of the symbols used in odum s esl odum 1994 the esl diagrams indicate the spatial and temporal limits of each agricultural production system as well as the major energy resources and flows and their interrelationships the esl diagrams categorize the study system s inputs into renewable or nonrenewable resources as well as local and imported resources drawing esl diagrams is necessary in order to manage the interrelationships between major ingredients and system processes fig 2 indicates the esl diagrams for three rice farming systems tp wbd and dbs the second step is creating emergy evaluation tables campbell and ohrt 2009 based on the esl diagrams the main material and energy flows needed were identified and arranged in emergy evaluation tables tables 3 5 all identified inputs are categorized into three types lu et al 2010b i renewable environmental inputs r1 internal renewable environmental inputs and r2 external renewable environmental inputs ii nonrenewable environmental inputs and iii purchased inputs fr purchased renewable inputs and fn purchased nonrenewable inputs following calculating all inputs and outputs in different rice farming systems the raw data from the study systems were multiplied by their transformities joules grams and dollars and converted into emergy units sej full details as to emergy accounting for the three rice farming systems are presented in appendices a and b the third step is calculating emergy indices several emergy based indicators are used to evaluate the ecological and environmental conditions of three rice farming systems lu et al 2010b 2018 in the current study transformity for economic yield trey transformity for biological yield trby specific emergy for economic yield speey specific emergy for biological yield speby emergy renewability r emergy yield ratio eyr standard emergy investment ratio

esi and emergy exchange ratio eer were used to compare the three study systems detailed descriptions are given in table 3 2 5 economic analysis different economic indices were used to analyze data from three rice farming systems including 1 gross income 2 total cost of production 3 net income 4 income to cost ratio and 5 productivity asgharipour et al 2012 table 7 the inputs and outputs were calculated on the basis of domestic market values and the exchange rate of the iranian rial to the us dollar in 2021 250 000 ir to 1 usd 3 results 3 1 structure of using emergy table 4 summarizes the free and purchased environmental inputs and outputs of the three rice farming systems in terms of physical units afterward the inputs listed in table 4 were transformed into emergy flows by multiplying them by the respective transformities uevs obtained from prior studies after investigating their appropriateness to the current study table 5 the total emergy inputs supporting the systems are estimated to be 2 69e 16 4 16e 16 and 3 17e 16 sej ha 1 yr 1 for dbs tp and wbs respectively table 5 renewable natural resources are divided into internal inputs solar energy wind and rain and external inputs river water tables 4 and 5 due to the fact that these incoming flows originate directly from the sunlight the solar energy which is also used in photosynthesis was summed with the largest source of planetary co product flows wind to avoid duplication of calculations asgharipour et al 2019 in the current study the wind an internal source and river water an external source accounted for the largest amounts of free environmental resources the free internal natural energies used in the dbs tp and wbd systems equaled 2 82e 13 3 11e 13 and 2 65e 13 sej ha 1 yr 1 respectively the free external natural energies were 5 52e 15 8 91e 15 and 7 21e 15 sej ha 1 yr 1 for the dbs tp and wbd systems respectively table 5 fig 3 a shows the structure of the emergy inputs to three rice farming systems categorized as renewable and nonrenewable emergy from the environment and purchased renewable and nonrenewable emergy while fig 3b illustrates the structure of details emergy inputs the results revealed that the renewable natural flows accounted for 20 63 5 52e 15 sej ha 1 yr 1 21 49 8 91e 15 sej ha 1 yr 1 and 22 84 7 21e 15 sej ha 1 yr 1 of total emergy into the dbs tp and wbd systems respectively fig 3a in this study the nonrenewable input was soil erosion which had an emergy value of 3 97e 15 4 98e 15 and 4 66e 15 sej ha 1 yr 1 for the dbs tp and wbd systems respectively table 5 additionally soil erosion as a nonrenewable environmental resource accounted for 14 7 12 0 and 14 7 of total emergy input into dbs tp and wbd systems respectively fig 3a the results indicated that the values of purchased inputs in the dbs tp and wbd systems were 1 74e 16 2 77e 16 and 1 98e 16 sej ha 1 yr 1 respectively table 5 as can be seen in table 5 purchased flows account for a large portion of the inputs to the three studied systems the top three inputs into the dbs and wbd systems were n land and fuel accounting for 23 19 and 10 of the total emergy input into the dbs system respectively and 19 dbs 6 18e 15 sej ha 1 yr 1 and wbd 6 18e 15 sej ha 1 yr 1 16 dbs 5 00e 15 sej ha 1 yr 1 and wbd 5 00e 15 sej ha 1 yr 1 and 8 dbs 2 76e 15 sej ha 1 yr 1 and wbd 2 48e 15 sej ha 1 yr 1 of the total emergy input into the wbd system respectively in comparison land and n comprised the largest proportion of total emergy input into the tp system averaging 23 9 46e 15 sej ha 1 yr 1 and 15 6 18e 15 sej ha 1 yr 1 respectively followed by fuel and labor averaging 11 4 60e 15 sej ha 1 yr 1 and 11 4 55e 15 sej ha 1 yr 1 respectively fig 3b in general the major share of total emergy input was related to purchased inflows with a negligible share of renewable resources fr 1 2 and 2 for dbs tp and wbd systems respectively and a significant share of nonrenewable resources fn 64 65 and 60 for dbs tp and wbd systems respectively fig 3a the dbs tp and wbd systems received a total of 2 69e 16 4 16e 16 and 3 17e 16 sej ha 1 yr 1 of emergy respectively table 5 as illustrated in fig 3a fn r1 and r2 received the most significant share of the total inflows into the three studied systems 3 2 indices analysis numerous indices were used to compare the functional characteristics of three rice farming systems tables 6 and 7 the study s indices are classified into four categories 1 indices of efficiency 2 indices of environmental pressure 3 indices of sustainability and 4 indices of economic performance 3 2 1 indices of efficiency the uev is a useful indicator for evaluating and comparing the efficiency of similar production systems economic yield ey and biological yield by had uev values of 3 73e 05 and 3 51e 05 5 66e 05 and 5 33e 05 and 4 54e 05 and 4 27e 05 sej j 1 respectively for the dbs tp and wbd systems table 6 the spe indicator is used to quantify the amount of emergy produced in a system expressing the amount of emergy required to support each unit of produced biomass in mass g or kg the dbs system had the lowest spe for economic and biological yields averaging 5 48e 09 and 4 39e 09 sej g 1 respectively followed by the wbd system averaging 6 67e 09 and 5 34e 09 sej g 1 and the tp system averaging 8 32e 09 and 6 66e 09 sej g 1 respectively table 6 the uev index is only affected by the efficiency with which total emergy inputs are transformed it is not directly influenced by substitute resource types the eyr is a measure of a system s ability to use local inputs and can be used to compensate for the uev s weakness the findings indicated that the eyr trend was from small to large as indicated by the tp 1 503 dbs 1 548 and wbs systems 1 601 table 6 the eir and eir detail the investment in nonrenewable and renewable natural resources in each system the eir and eir values for the dbs system were 1 825 and 3 131 for the tp system were 1 990 and 3 097 and for the wbs system were 1 663 and 2 734 respectively table 6 3 2 2 environmental pressure indices elr and its modified version elr define the pressure exerted on the environment by systems during a specific production process the elr values for the dbs tp and wbs systems were 3 847 4 654 and 4 378 respectively the elr values were significantly different from the elr values and for the dbs tp and wbs systems respectively elr values of 83 897 46 420 and 40 896 were calculated table 6 3 2 3 indices of sustainability the r is calculated as the amount of renewable emergy entering the system divided by the total amount of emergy input the wbs system had the highest r values averaging 22 95 followed by the tp 21 26 and dbs 20 36 systems the compound indices of esi and esi are calculated by dividing the eyr by the elr and or elr reflecting the system s sustainability the esi and esi values in the current study were 0 402 and 0 018 for the dbs system 0 323 and 0 032 for the tp system and 0 366 and 0 039 for the wbs system respectively table 6 3 2 4 indices of economic performance the three study systems were evaluated using a variety of economic indices dbs tp and wbs economic and emergy assessments of systems can be made using the eer which serves as a bridge between them the eer values of 2 332 3 539 and 2 839 were obtained for dbs tp and wbs systems respectively table 6 additionally gross income total cost of production net income income to cost ratio and productivity were calculated for the dbs system as 6037 6 ha 1 1292 7 ha 1 4744 9 ha 1 4 67 and 3 79 kg 1 respectively for the tp system as 5814 0 ha 1 2875 7 ha 1 2938 3 ha 1 1 02 and 1 65 kg 1 and for the wbs system as 6120 0 1494 1 ha 1 4625 9 ha 1 3 09 and 3 34 kg 1 respectively table 7 4 discussion 4 1 the quantity and kind of incoming flows influence the emergy structure of systems as previously stated the total emergy inputs of the three rice production systems were varied the dbs system had the lowest total emergy inputs while the tp and wbs systems had 55 and 18 higher total emergy inputs respectively than the dbs system generally greater emergy flow into agricultural systems can be directly attributed to those mechanization and industrialization levels lu et al 2010b but other inputs into a system can sometimes influence the total emergy flow asgharipour et al 2020 su et al 2020 the higher total emergy flow incoming the tp system was primarily attributable to the quantity of irrigation water fossil fuel required for irrigating fields land rent and human labor which was significantly greater than the other two systems dbs and wbs an 18 difference in total emergy flow between the dbs and wbs systems can also be attributed to the greater amount of irrigation water and human labor in the wbd system when compared with the dbs system these findings concur with those of chen et al 2021 who evaluated the environmental consequences and sustainability of three rice based rotation systems rice crayfish rice fallow and rice wheat in quanjiao china and concluded that the rice crayfish system had a higher total emergy flow than the other two systems due to the higher consumption of incoming inputs such as forage medicine water and electricity in a study moonilall et al 2020 assessed five maize farming systems control chemical fertilizer poultry manure biochar rice hull biochar and sugarcane filter press using emergy based approach and reported that the poultry manure biochar had the highest total emergy flow 3 33 e 17 sej ha 1 yr 1 compared with four other farming systems classifying input flows into aggregate categories r n0 fr and fn provides comprehensive data for investigating each system in greater depth the share of solar energy wind and rain r1 was negligible whereas river water r2 comprised 21 21 and 23 of the total emergy flow for dbs tp and wbs systems respectively fig 3b the contribution of soil erosion as a nonrenewable environmental resource n0 was 15 12 and 15 of the total emergy for dbs tp and wbd systems respectively fig 3b although the least amount of irrigation water and soil erosion was detected in the dbs system the amount of irrigation water consumption and soil erosion in all types of rice farming systems in khuzestan province is high in comparison with other rice farming systems in this regard the analysis of a study conducted by amini et al 2020 reveals that the emergy of irrigation water and soil erosion in our study is 4 6 7 5 and 2 2 5 times higher respectively than rice production systems in the province of mazandaran iran s principal rice producing region it appears that higher evapotranspiration in response to high temperatures could explain why rice farming systems in khuzestan province use more irrigation water than in other parts of the country moreover the high rate of soil erosion demonstrates the fragility of the agricultural systems in khuzestan a higher rate of soil erosion in khuzestan province rice fields compared with other iranian rice fields can be attributed to the continuous inflow and outflow of water resulting from high water consumption and low soil organic matter as previously explained the largest portion of the total emergy input into the study systems was comprised of purchased flows the greater proportion of purchased resources reflects the substantial dependence of the examined systems on human economic resources asgharipour et al 2019 the examined systems had a dependency on purchased inputs in the following order from lowest to highest wbs 62 dbs 65 and tp 67 fig 3a it was observed that the total amount of purchased input flows and the structure of three sets of inputs in terms of human labor machinery fossil fuel land herbicide and seed significantly varied in the dbs tp and wbd systems respectively 1 74e 16 2 77e 16 and 1 98e 16 sej ha 1 yr 1 of the total input emergy were supplied by purchased input flows indicating a greater contribution and quantity of purchased flows in the tp system for carrying out the rice production processes than in the other two systems the input flows to the three investigated systems are classified as either fr or fn in the tp system human labor emergy comprised the largest proportion of fr human labor is used to perform agronomic operations such as preparing whole farms and plots seedling production and transplanting rice seedlings from the nursery to the main field and field management irrigation fertilization weeding etc however in the wbs system seed emergy comprised a larger share of fr because seeds are spread manually in the field and seed losses are typically greater than in the other two systems in the dbs system the contribution of labor and seed to fr was nearly identical and lower than in the other two systems su et al 2020 evaluated the sustainability of three agricultural production systems traditional rice monoculture integrated farming and non grain production in china they stated that human labor plays a larger role in rice monoculture and integrated systems because mechanization is generally still low across china s relatively fragmented farmland moonilall et al 2020 analyzed maize fields at five amendment application treatments control chemical fertilizer poultry manure biochar rice hull biochar and sugarcane filter press and reported that the labor human had the largest share compared with the other input flows in the control chemical fertilizer and sugarcane filter press treatments similarly there were differences in the nonrenewable inputs purchased by the examined systems since the area of agricultural land where rice is grown using the tp method izeh city is frequently between 1 and 2 hectares and the total agricultural land in this region is less than in other regions of khuzestan province the land rental cost is higher and the largest proportion of purchased nonrenewable inputs fn was land followed by n and fuel due to the larger fields the cost of renting land for the dbs and wbs systems was lower than for the tp system and n emergy accounted for the largest proportion of nonrenewable inputs purchased fn chemical fertilizers are always a substantial portion of the fn zhao et al 2019 asgharipour et al 2020 shang et al 2021 meanwhile the proportion of n is typically greater than that of other fertilizers k and p asgharipour et al 2019 amiri et al 2021 in this regard amiri et al 2019 analyzed the sustainability of two subsistence and commercial rapeseed cultivation systems in khorramabad iran and found that n and p comprised approximately 20 and 15 of the total emergy entering both systems respectively 4 2 efficiency of rice farming systems is affected by type and amount of inputs and outputs evaluating the efficiency of systems enables the identification of factors that contribute to the decrease or increase of efficiency the uev index can be used to examine the emergy efficiency of agricultural systems brown and ulgiati 2004a a lower uev indicates that fewer emergy inputs are necessary to produce a given output wang et al 2015 the uev values of the rice farming systems indicated lower uev of inputs in the dbs system than those of the two studied systems tp and wbs such that the uev value in the dbs system was 52 and 22 less than those of the tp and wbs systems respectively this means that the tp and wbs systems have lower environmental and economic efficiency of emergy consumption compared with the dbs system odum 1996 lu et al 2010b in the current study increased irrigation water consumption soil erosion labor force and fossil fuel were among the inputs that contributed to the tp system s lower efficiency compared with the other two systems similarly the lower efficiency of the wbs system in comparison with the dbs system can be attributed to the greater amount of irrigation water soil erosion labor force and seed rate utilized moreover the spe index which measures the amount of emergy required per unit of biomass produced in the process confirms that the dbs system is more efficient than the wbs and tp systems up to 22 and 52 respectively lyu et al 2020 amiri et al 2021 evaluated the efficiency of four shallot production systems i e mechanized traditional conservation and natural habitat using some indicators such as uev and spe they found that shallot production in natural habitats had a higher economic environmental efficiency than the other three production systems due to lower total emergy inputs in addition comparing the spe values revealed that natural habitat and conservation systems had a lower intensity and density of emergy flow than mechanized and conventional systems and that their efficiency was higher wang et al 2018 concluded that the application of biochar in a rice wheat farming system in china boosted the emergy efficiency by 11 47 when compared to a control system although the uev indicator is useful for comparing the efficiency of systems with identical outputs it only responds to the conversion efficiency of total emergy inputs and is unaffected by alternative input types zhang et al 2011 the eyr measures the capacity of systems to utilize local resources and is able to compensate for the weakness of the uev index therefore it can be introduced as an input source based efficiency indicator wang et al 2015 a higher eyr value indicates that a system is more dependent on environmental resources than purchased resources chen et al 2006 eyr values of 15 4 to 15 and 4 indicate high moderate and low system sustainability respectively zhan et al 2020 consequently the sustainability of the three studied rice systems was determined to be low primarily due to their reliance on purchased resources despite the fact that the tp system consumed more irrigation water as a free environmental resource than the other two systems dbs and wbs the purchased resources such as human labor soil erosion and fossil fuel caused the tp system to be less sustainable than the other two although the eyrs for rice production systems in khuzestan iran are within the range of values reported for agricultural production systems worldwide lu et al 2010b zhang et al 2012 su et al 2020 amiri et al 2021 a significant difference is observed between rice production agroecosystems in the northern regions of iran eyr 5 13 and three study systems eyr 1 548 1 503 and 1 601 for dbs tp and wbs respectively in the khuzestan province amini et al 2020 comparing our findings with those of amini et al 2020 reveals that the main reason for the greater sustainability of rice fields in the northern regions of iran as compared with the southern regions province of khuzestan is the lower consumption of fuel and nitrogen the eir index indicates the magnitude of the investment made with purchased resources the greater the eir the greater the amount of purchased emergy required to match the amount produced by the local system liu et al 2020 additionally a system with a lower value can enter the market more competitively while a system with a higher value indicates a higher level of economic development zhang and long 2010 the tp system had the highest eir value indicating a higher production cost in this agroecosystem than the other two systems dbs and wbs in the tp system despite the high quantity of free inputs especially irrigation water and soil erosion the cost of rice production was higher than in the dbs and wbs systems due to higher labor costs fuel required to irrigate fields and high land rent moreover a comparison of the dbs and wbs systems revealed that the amount of inputs purchased in the dbs system is approximately 14 less however a difference of approximately 25 between the two study systems in free environmental inputs primarily irrigation water and soil erosion resulted in a lower eir index value for the wbs system than for the dbs system in examining the sustainability of rice production in mazandaran province iran amini et al 2020 obtained an eir value of 0 24 indicating that the system is less dependent on purchased resources than on free environmental resources cheng et al 2017 investigated three systems of crops poultry and fish production and reported eir values of 3 98 4 63 and 5 87 for these three systems respectively they suggested a lower eir in crop systems compared with livestock and fisheries systems this study employed a modified eir eir to evaluate the compatibility of free nonrenewable resources in rice production systems with free renewable environmental resources it is an index comparing purchased resources with renewable environmental resources when the amount of nonrenewable environmental inputs in the production systems is significant and accounts for a large portion of the total emergy input of the system the eir index demonstrates the differences in the sustainability of the systems more effectively than the eir index and is more appropriate for comparing two or more production systems after removing nonrenewable environmental inputs soil erosion in this study our findings indicated that the eir value for the dbs system was slightly higher than that of the tp system however the wbd system had the lowest values for both indicators eir and eir 4 3 environmental pressure on rice farming systems would be mitigated by increasing the proportion of renewable resources and decreasing the proportion of nonrenewable resources the elr and elr indices are utilized to determine the potential environmental stress resulting from human activities garcia et al 2014 they evaluate the production procedure quantify the consumption of environmental services and evaluate the potential ecological strain the difference in environmental pressure is more clearly expressed than with the elr index as a result of the formula s separation of renewable and nonrenewable inputs amiri et al 2021 when the elrs value exceeds 10 a system is deemed unsustainable whereas elrs values between 2 and 10 and less than 2 indicate semi sustainable and sustainable systems respectively zhan et al 2020 the elr value of the dbs system was 14 and 21 less than that of the wbd and tp systems respectively according to our findings despite the fact that the elr value of the dbs system was 2 05 and 1 8 times that of the wbs and tp systems respectively the lower elr values for the dbs system are primarily attributable to the lower input flows of fr fn and n0 likewise comparing the wbd and tp systems revealed that the lower input flows of fr fn and n0 in the wbs system led to a lower elr value than the tp system according to the classification of zhan et al 2020 all three studied systems were categorized as semi sustainable since the emergy amount of purchased renewable flows fr human labor and seed was significantly lower in the dbs system than in the wbd and tp systems the elr value for the dbs system was roughly twice that of the wbd and tp systems consequently the wbs and tp systems exerted less pressure on the rice ecosystems in the province of khuzestan and were more sustainable than the dbs system amiri et al 2021 examined four shallot production systems in the province of lorestan iran and determined that the mechanized elr 23 705 traditional elr 26 306 and conservation elr 41 695 systems were not sustainable while the natural habitat system elr 7 430 was sustainable using the modified elr elr amiri et al 2021 also indicated that four of the aforementioned systems were semi sustainable 4 4 sustainability of rice farming systems is improved by using more renewable resources if a system s production based processes use a greater proportion of renewable resources its r value will be greater and this system will likely be more sustainable la rosa et al 2008 a system that uses less nonrenewable resources and focuses more on the use of renewable resources is more economically successful over the long term brown and ulgiati 2004a the lower r value in the dbs system compared with the other two systems is due to the rice s lower reliance on renewable emergy input whereas the higher r value in the wbs system compared with the tp system can be attributed to the rice s lower reliance on nonrenewable emergy input in this regard amiri et al 2019 examined two rapeseed commercial and subsistence systems in the province of lorestan iran and determined that their respective r values were 19 90 and 5 30 they stated that the greater use of nonrenewable resources in the commercial system compared with the subsistence system is the primary reason for the lower r value in a study in china a r value of 52 66 was estimated for the production of traditional rice culture su et al 2020 monilall et al 2020 in evaluating five maize farming systems found that systems that use more renewable resources and less purchased resources are more sustainable using the esi and esi indices and taking into account the system s sustainability the production process of a system s efficiency can be measured ulgiati and brown 1998 the esi characterizes the availability of a process that can perform satisfactorily while exerting less pressure on the environment and its calculations are based on the compatibility of the environmental and economic sectors amini et al 2020 at low esi values system sustainability is low zhang and long 2010 whereas the esi index illustrates the relative sustainability benefits of the system according to the esi and esi indices the three investigated systems were not sustainable which is indicative of the fact that high energy consumption in rice farming systems exerted significant environmental pressure although the esi and esi values were less than 1 for all three study systems and there was no significant difference between the systems in the esi index the dbs system had a lower esi value than the tp and wbs systems due to the type of emergy inputs and a greater proportion of nonrenewable inputs amini et al 2020 reported esi and esi values of 0 12 and 0 46 in the rice fields of mazandaran province iran in a study lu et al 2010a examined the rice production system in japan and reported an esi index of 1 83 4 5 economic superiority of a system would be attained by lowering production costs and boosting final output in addition to the product s market value the eer index also takes into account price and monetary value differences between markets in other words the exchange of the system can be evaluated using the eer index based on the equilibrium between the profit obtained from selling the product and the input emergy required for its production lu and campbell 2009 this index is considered a measure to demonstrate the business advantage of a product produced in one system versus another system producing the same product odum 1996 brown and ulgiati 2004b eer index can be used to determine the relative advantage of the seller producer or the buyer consumer in a product exchange the lower eer value for the dbs system compared with the tp and wbs systems reflects the superior performance of the dbs system in commodity trading on the market compared with the tp and wbs systems in comparison with the dbs and wbd systems the tp system was less economically efficient at converting input energy into a marketable product approximately half of the emergy used in the dbs system was converted into money emergy that was traded on the market whereas this proportion was approximately one third in the wbs system and less than one tenth in the tp system the eer value reaches 1 if the values of u in the dbs tp and wbs systems are reduced from 2 69e 16 4 16e 16 and 3 17e 16 to 1 15e 16 1 18e 16 and 1 12e 16 respectively to achieve this objective the cultivation of high yielding genotypes and the optimal use of resources such as chemical and organic fertilizers water seed transplant machinery etc will result in a reduction of the eer index in this regard asgharipour et al 2020 examined four greenhouse production systems including cucumber tomato bell pepper and eggplant and determined that 77 60 50 and 37 of the emergy inputs to the systems were converted into the emergy received by the producers from the market exchange rate for the crops respectively in addition to the eer several other indices gross income total cost of production net income income to cost ratio and productivity were used to evaluate the economic efficiency of the three study systems and they all indicated that the dbs system was economically superior to the other two tp and wbd since the grain yield produced by all three systems is comparable the main reason for this system s superiority can be attributed to its lower total production costs particularly labor 5 conclusion and recommendations the dbs tp and wbd systems respectively received 2 69e 16 4 16e 16 and 3 17e 16 sej ha 1 yr 1 clearly the difference in irrigation water soil erosion fossil fuel and human labor accounts for the majority of the difference in total emergy input between the three studied systems the purchased flows into the study systems comprised the largest proportion of the total emergy input indicating a strong dependence of the studied systems on human economic resources with the wbs 62 dbs 65 and tp 67 systems exhibiting decreasing dependence on purchased resources among renewable environmental inputs river water accounted for 21 21 and 23 of the total emergy flow for dbs tp and wbs systems respectively whereas soil erosion accounted for 15 12 and 15 of the total emergy flow for dbs tp and wbd systems respectively despite the fact that the tp system had lower efficiency and sustainability than the dbs and wbs systems the efficiency and sustainability of all three were determined to be low primarily due to their reliance on purchased resources the wbd system entered the market more competitively due to its lower eir and eir values all three studied systems were classified as semi sustainable by the elr index but were deemed unsustainable when this index was modified elr due to the greater amount of purchased renewable flows the wbs and tp systems exerted less pressure on rice ecosystems and were more sustainable than the dbs system fr human labor and seed the results of the r esi and esi indices indicated that the three investigated systems fell into the category of non sustainability which is indicative of the fact that high energy consumption in rice farming systems resulted in a significant environmental burden in contrast the sustainability of the dbs system was inferior to those of the tp and wbs systems due to the type of emergy inputs and the greater proportion of nonrenewable inputs surprisingly the economic analysis of rice production systems produced different outcomes than the analyses of efficiency sustainability and environmental stress approximately half of the emergy used in the dbs system was converted into money emergy that was traded on the market compared with approximately one third in the wbs system and less than one third in the tp system this demonstrates the superior performance of the dbs system in trading commodities on the market in addition other indices gross income total cost of production net income income to cost ratio and productivity suggested that the dbs system was economically superior due to its lower total cost of production particularly human labor when compared with the other two systems in this study the more environmentally friendly system wbs did not necessarily have a higher output conversely lower total emergy inputs dbs did not result in greater sustainability and less environmental pressure consequently it is necessary to adopt suitable agronomic and management strategies so that in addition to increasing the sustainability of rice production systems farmers obtain acceptable economic benefits and most importantly the water resources of the study area are optimally utilized in this regard the following recommendations are made based on our research findings and the agricultural situation of the study area 1 the water shortage crisis in arid and semi arid regions such as iran and khuzestan province necessitates the adoption of crop cultivation techniques that minimize water consumption in addition to having a lower total production cost the dbs farming method saves between 30 and 60 percent of irrigation water compared with the other two cultivation systems this method s lack of sustainability and increased environmental pressure can be remedied by decreasing the proportion of nonrenewable inputs fossil fuel chemical fertilizers and herbicides and increasing the proportion of renewable inputs organic fertilizer 2 the erosion rate in all three rice farming ecosystems was notably high which can be attributed to the high consumption of irrigation water and the lack of organic matter in the soil which led to water erosion to increase soil organic matter it would be prudent to consider agronomic solutions such as applying organic fertilizers and preventing the burning of plant residues water erosion can also be reduced by managing irrigation according to the crop s actual needs 6 limitations and future research directions this study collected data on inputs and outputs using a questionnaire so some participants may have refused to provide truthful responses or provided inaccurate information this study was cross sectional which makes causal inferences difficult the lengthy questionnaires slowed down data collection and diminished participant accuracy the present research can be used to produce rice in settings like khuzestan iran with caution and enough expertise to generalize to other agricultural systems our findings specified that the dbs method significantly saves water consumption hence it would suggest researchers focus on increasing the sustainability of this rice farming system as well as investigate alternative crops with equal economic value and less

24204,the continuity and depth of litter fuelbeds are major drivers of fire spread and fuel consumption however no established approach is available for the spatially explicit prediction of litter loads over large areas local fuel heterogeneity introduces large uncertainties on estimates derived from field based models based on the extrapolation of sparse data samples in fire maintained pine forests of the southeastern us litter accumulation and its distribution over the forest floor are mainly driven by vegetation productivity and by the number of years since the last fire ysf some ecological models that simulate fire effects allow for a time dependent estimation of litter by accounting for the opposing rates of litter deposition and decomposition as a function of ysf at the landscape level but they do not account for spatial heterogeneity we developed a conceptually simple approach for wall to wall estimation of tree leaf litter loads at high spatial resolution 5 m the approach involved first estimating spatial patterns of tree annual litterfall we mapped individual tree crowns through segmentation of airborne laser scanning als data and we estimated crown foliage biomass using tree inventory data and als derived tree crown attributes tree annual litterfall was calculated as a fraction of the crown foliage biomass based on leaf turnover rates we then quantified tree leaf litter accumulation through a spatially explicit implementation of the established olson 1963 accumulation and negative decay model we tested and validated our model in several management and research units at eglin air force base florida pebble hill plantation georgia and osceola national forest florida where managers maintain predominantly longleaf pine forests using frequent fire pixel level rmsd and bias between tree leaf litter biomass estimated by the proposed model and reference field measurements were 0 21 and 0 01 kg m 2 and area level rmsd and bias were 0 09 and 0 01 kg m 2 we concluded that linking patterns of litterfall and tree leaf litter accumulation to tree crown objects provides a means to characterizing the discontinuity of the litter layer accounting for spatial heterogeneity largely traceable to tree crown foliage inputs keywords litter production litter accumulation surface fuels time since fire tree crown airborne laser scanning als data availability there are several datasets used on the manuscript some data is already publicly available and the authors will make available under request the datasets they have permission on 1 introduction the continuity and depth of the surface vegetation and fuel layers are major drivers of fire spread and fuel consumption in frequently burned ecosystems and are linked to fire risk and severity agee and skinner 2005 hiers et al 2009 loudermilk et al 2012 high resolution maps of these fuels are particularly relevant for predicting fire intensity and burn patterns in fire maintained longleaf pine pinus palustris forests of the north american coastal plain in the southeastern us noss et al 2015 these systems are dependent on frequent 1 3 year interval surface fires of low severity to maintain their high levels of plant diversity bond et al 2005 kirkman et al 2001 mitchell et al 2009 walker and peet 1984 because of frequent fire vegetation communities are characterized by widely spaced pine trees resprouting hardwoods and a continuous herbaceous layer mostly composed of perennials the spatial arrangement of these communities defines the distribution and composition of the fine surface fuels which are often dominated by tree leaf litter and particularly pine needle cast these are the major contributors to fine surface fuel loading often representing more than half of the available fine fuel jevon et al 2022 mitchell et al 1999 platt et al 2016 robertson et al 2014 thaxton and platt 2006 consequently tree litter is unevenly distributed over the forest floor depending on tree density and distribution grace and platt 1995 for instance unburned patches are often observed to correspond to tree gaps and areas of low canopy cover even when there is continuous herbaceous cover on the ground mugnani et al 2019 robertson et al 2019 various methods including analytical modeling classifications and or statistical analysis using both field and remote sensing datasets have been proposed to quantify litter loads bright et al 2022 hudak et al 2016 keane 2012 keane et al 2001 loudermilk et al 2011 lydersen et al 2015 olson 1963 for instance loudermilk et al 2011 utilized field data and linear models to estimate pine and hardwood leaf litter loads as a function of time since fire and simulated tree size and spatial distribution hudak et al 2016 used als and landsat optical data to map forest structure and composition through imputation and reported functional relationships between overstory structure and surface fuel attributes bright et al 2022 predicted surface fuels using remotely sensed data and several ancillary datasets including topographic and fire history variables on a study area across the kaibab plateau in northern arizona nevertheless the spatially explicit characterization of litter loads is still a challenge over areas larger than field sample plots local fuel heterogeneity introduces large uncertainties in estimates and interpolations derived from field data and its systematic monitoring is time consuming and expensive requiring intensive sampling protocols and frequently repeated measurements keane 2015 keane et al 2001 additionally the usefulness of remote sensing for direct modeling and mapping of such fine fuels is limited due to the low sensitivity to litter depth of both active and passive sensors which is further limited under the forest canopy leaf litter generally accumulates over time until litter production is balanced by decomposition in a quasi equilibrium mccaw et al 2002 olson 1963 zazali et al 2020 litter production or litterfall results from senescent biomass irregularly falling to the forest floor from all layers of the vegetation canopy a process mainly driven by aboveground biomass species characteristics and climate costa et al 2020 keane 2008 neumann et al 2018 decomposition which drives the rate of nutrient recycling in the forest ecosystem is controlled by heterotrophic consumption of organic composites and in turn depends on litter quality soil properties and climatic factors bezkorovaynaya 2005 keane 2008 krishna and mohan 2017 prescott 2002 a widely used litter accumulation model that combines two simple analytical models for litter deposition and decomposition was introduced by olson 1963 the model assumes that litter falls at a constant rate and that at each point in time decomposition is proportional to the total litter accumulation the combination of these two terms results in a negative exponential model where total litter accumulation is a function of the time since the litter deposition was initiated such as following planting or a fire that fully or mostly consumed the litter while the olson model ignores factors such as tree size and distribution stand age productivity and annual and seasonal variations in precipitation and temperature to describe the spatial intra stand heterogeneity of the litter loads it has been widely used by fire ecologists as it provides realistic litter accumulation estimates zazali et al 2020 assuming relatively similar soil and climate conditions spatial variability in litter accumulation would be primarily driven by canopy characteristics canopy structure and aboveground biomass affects the spatial variation of surface litter by both influencing the organic layer environment e g soil temperature water content of microbes that drive decomposition and by governing the litterfall hopkins et al 2020 neumann et al 2018 penne et al 2010 platt et al 2016 therefore characterizing the spatial variability of foliage biomass driven by heterogeneity in the forest canopy provides a means to describe patterns of litterfall and surface fuel dynamics at the scale of tree crowns ferrari and sugita 1996 yarie 2000 remote sensing currently provides the most practical means to characterize patterns of aboveground biomass across forested landscapes and associated ecosystem processes airborne laser scanning als shows particular promise because of its ability to record a dense 3d point cloud that can be used to characterize the forest canopy structure als has been successfully used for tree detection stem mapping and segmentation of tree crowns jakubowski et al 2013 li et al 2012 roussel et al 2020 silva et al 2016 als tree crown derived metrics have been used to quantify tree attributes such as height volume and or woody and foliar biomass using different modeling approaches including parametric and non parametric methods chen et al 2007 rocha et al 2023 silva et al 2016 wan mohd jaafar et al 2018 the overarching objective of this study is to develop a conceptually simple and physically based model of tree leaf litter accumulation after fire the proposed model is informed by remote sensing data that capture the spatial heterogeneity of litter loads in temporally dynamic fire maintained longleaf pine forests the methodology is demonstrated primarily at three study sites located in pine forests in the southeastern us where field data prescribed fire records and als data were available for testing and validating the methodology section 2 the model estimates litter accumulated at the 5 m resolution in three main steps fig 1 first tree leaf litter production i e tree annual leaf litterfall is estimated at the scale of projected tree crowns section 3 1 this model is driven by tree crown attributes calculated from als data and it is informed by tree inventory data allometric equations and species traits e g leaf lifespan second tree leaf litter accumulation since the last fire is estimated through a spatially explicit implementation of the olson 1963 model that incorporates the outputs of the production model a decomposition rate estimated as a function of the annual actual evapotranspiration aet that accounts for temperature and moisture and fire history maps section 3 2 finally we evaluate the accuracy of the tree leaf litter accumulation model at a pixel and a multi pixel level i e area level accuracy assessment by leveraging independent litter biomass field measurements collected at the study sites section 3 3 2 materials 2 1 study sites the three study sites were eglin air force base afb in the florida panhandle pebble hill plantation php in southern georgia and the olustee experimental forest within the osceola national forest onf in northeastern florida fig 2 the sites undergo frequent prescribed burning often a 1 3 year fire return interval that serves to maintain the native wildlife and health of the predominant longleaf pine ecosystem as well as facilitating military training at eglin afb the three sites share the same subtropical climate with relatively mild winters and warm and humid summers but they span the edaphic gradient characteristic of the region described below eglin afb covers 186 350 ha and it is divided into management units where activities such as prescribed fires or silviculture practices are performed the eglin afb portion of our study focuses on sandhill and flatwoods longleaf pine communities fnai 2010 where als data were most recently collected in 2018 92 699 ha fig 2 the sandhill pine communities are located on soils in the entisol order composed of deep sand soil survey staff 2021 the vegetation is characterized by a discontinuous overstory of longleaf pine and some slash pine p elliotti with a discontinuous midstory of fire tolerant broadleaf species mostly turkey oak quercus laevis and bluejack oak q incana as well as less fire hardy broadleaf species such as persimmon diospyros virginiana the surface vegetation is species rich with forbs perennial grasses dominated by wiregrass aristida stricta var beyrichiana and broadleaf woody plants that are topkilled by fire and resprout the flatwoods communities are located on soils in the spodosol order where the deep sand soil is saturated for part of the year and contains some organic material soil survey staff 2021 flatwoods also have a discontinuous canopy of mostly longleaf pine and some slash pine but with a midstory and understory of evergreen woody plants mostly saw palmetto serenoa repens dwarf live oak q minima and gallberry ilex glabra hudak et al 2016 that resprout after being topkilled and forbs and perennial grasses dominated by wiregrass at php the study site covers 824 ha within upland longleaf pine communities fnai 2010 located on soils in the ultisol order with sandy topsoil and a clay rich subhorizon soil survey staff 2021 the overstory vegetation is dominated by a mix of longleaf pine and shortleaf pine p echinata while the understory is dominated by a particularly species rich community of perennial grasses including wiregrass forbs and resprouting broadleaf woody plants ostertag and robertson 2007 robertson and hmielowski 2014 finally the study site at onf consists of winter experimental burn units within flatwoods pine communities as described above the onf site is part of a long term fire experiment that was first established in 1958 in a randomized block design to evaluate different fire return intervals on fuel accumulation it is comprised of six replicates of four treatments 0 85 ha each that consist of burns performed regularly every 1 2 or 4 years with an additional no burn treatment control mckee 1982 overstory and understory vegetation are dominated by longleaf pine and saw palmetto respectively all three sites represent native vegetation types where the soil has not been previously disturbed by agriculture or other management and all three have been burned frequently for decades leading up to this study because of frequent fire surface organic matter is dominated by litter in various stages of decomposition but with very little organic soil duff except in the onf unburned control units the three community types studied represent the three dominant soil orders and respective ecosystem types in the north american coastal plain carr et al 2010 and thus provide broad representation of the region 2 2 data 2 2 1 airborne laser scanning data als data were used to segment individual tree crown maps within the study sites and to compute crown attributes that were used as predictors of foliage biomass in a random forest rf model section 3 1 als data were acquired in 2018 at both eglin afb and php and between 2018 and 2020 at onf the average return density was variable among sites and campaigns but always exceeded 8 points m 2 the point cloud provided in a laz or las binary format was normalized converting points to height above ground using lastools software isenburg 2021 a canopy height model chm 1 m spatial resolution was created using the grid canopy function and the pit free algorithm khosravipour et al 2014 implemented in the lidr r package roussel et al 2020 2 2 2 tree inventory data tree inventory data provided the foliage biomass dataset used as the response variable to train the rf model section 3 1 2 because of the limited number of inventory plots on the three study sites the dataset was augmented with additional plots located in longleaf pine dominated forests with similar environmental conditions where contemporaneous als data were also available appendix a figure a1 within each inventory plot tree species health status healthy unhealthy and dead and dbh diameter at breast height 1 37 m were recorded tree attributes such as stem geolocations tree height and crown diameter calculated as the average of two measurements in orthogonal directions of the projection of the edges of the crown were available for a subset of plots 19 plots encompassing a total of 615 trees the data used for training the foliage biomass model were located at two of the primary study sites eglin afb php and at three similar southern pine forest sites tall timbers research station ttrs florida ft stewart georgia and ft jackson south carolina appendix a table a1 supplementary tree inventory plot data missing the geolocation of the individual stems tree height or the crown diameter were used for assessing the accuracy of the mapped foliage biomass estimates these plots were located at eglin afb onf php ttrs ft jackson ft stewart and the joseph jones ecological research center jerc appendix a table a2 a detailed description of the tree inventory datasets tallied species and collection protocols is provided in appendix a section 1 2 only live trees with 10 cm dbh were considered tree foliage biomass was estimated by applying published species based allometric equations gonzalez benecke et al 2014 2018 loomis et al 1966 mitchell et al 1999 zhao et al 2015 2016 2019a b appendix a section 2 1 2 2 3 forest type group map the 30 m resolution forest type groups of the continental united states dataset usda fia 2021 was used to parametrize wall to wall the leaf turnover rate ltr in the spatially explicit annual tree leaf litter production model section 3 1 3 the map is generated through the imputation of forest inventory and analysis fia field data collected from 2014 to 2018 to phenological variables derived from landsat oli operational land imager satellite data together with auxiliary climatic and topographic data wilson et al 2012 2013 2018 the map defines a forest type group for every 30 m forested pixel adopting the same legend 33 forest type groups of the forest atlas of the united states usda usfs 2022 the longleaf slash pine group is predominant in all three study sites with a significant presence of the loblolly shortleaf pine group at php fig 3 2 2 4 average annual evapotranspiration actual evapotranspiration aet was used to estimate the litter decomposition rate which is one of the parameters required by the litter accumulation model section 3 2 annual aet from 2003 to 2019 was obtained from the moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer modis product 1 km available at https earlywarning usgs gov accessed on 9th of september 2021 this product uses the operational simplified surface energy balance ssebop model to retrieve annual aet senay and kagone 2019 senay et al 2013 for the three sites the annual average was computed fig 4 average annual aet was higher at onf 1292 mm and php 1055 mm than at eglin afb 653 mm as expected based on temperature and precipitation trends thornton et al 2020 2 2 5 fire history the fire history of the study sites was used to assess the time since fire and therefore the time of the litter accumulation process section 3 2 it was reconstructed by integrating management records and remotely sensed derived products fig 5 at eglin afb recurrent fire is used as a management tool to ensure appropriate conditions for military training and maintain the longleaf pine forest communities fire records at eglin afb consisted of geographic information system gis datasets of fire boundaries which included the date of burn from 1972 up to 2015 at php fires are typically applied to pine communities at 1 2 year intervals as part of the regional tradition for game management robertson and hmielowski 2014 rother et al 2020 the southeast firemap pilot product of ttrs and usda natural resources conservation services nrcs produced from landsat satellite data was used as fire history at php southeast se firemap 2021 this product maps detectable fires happening since 1994 both managed prescribed burns and wildfires across nine states in the southeastern us within the boundaries of the study site at php reported fires span from 1996 to 2019 at onf burns are regularly performed every 1 2 or 4 years on the three burn treatment blocks or are excluded on the no burn treatment control blocks fig 5 shows the fire history records available within the three study sites up to 2015 for eglin afb 2019 for php and january 2022 for onf 2 2 6 litter biomass field measurements previously collected litter biomass field measurements were collated and used for the accuracy assessment of the results of the proposed litter accumulation model at eglin afb and php whereas new data were collected at onf these measurements consisted of destructive biomass sampling on square or circular plots known as clip plots in which biomass of different surface fuels e g litter shrubs downed woody debris grasses was collected bagged and oven dried at eglin afb three management units were sampled i e 703c 608a and l2f and surface fuel data were collected over 166 square clip plots in 2011 1 m2 and 2012 0 25 m2 in the framework of the rxcadre prescribed fire combustion and atmospheric dynamics research experiment project fig 6 ottmar et al 2015 ottmar and restaino 2014 in 2011 100 clip plots were established in five locations within the 703c and 608a units in 2012 66 samples were collected in the l2f unit 36 were on three highly instrumented plots hips west east and south hips whereas the other 30 clip plots were systematically located along three parallel transects figs 6 and 7 hudak et al 2015 hudak and bright 2014 all litter was collected but it was not sorted so the samples included pine needles oak and broad leaves and other tissue loads ranged from 0 05 to 1 27 kg m 2 table 1 another field campaign to characterize fuels was conducted at eglin afb in 2015 within the framework of a past serdp strategic environmental research and development program funded project the sampling was stratified based on canopy height and percent canopy cover to represent the flatwoods and sandhills for open single tree and tree clump conditions twenty four plots were established in five management units that burned 2 years before data collection fig 6 each plot center was geolocated and surface fuels were collected in four clip plots 0 25 0 50 m2 located 5 m from the plot center in azimuthal directions 60 120 240 and 300 totaling 96 clip plot measurements different fuel categories were sorted including pine needles and fine litter and oak and other broad leaves grass was not separated from pine litter during data collection but an ocular estimation of the percentage of each component was noted when possible litter loads including pine and broad leaves ranged from 0 00 to 0 75 kg m 2 table 1 at php litter of pine needles was collected at 24 replicated research units 0 12 ha burned in may june at 1 6 year intervals between 2006 and 2020 these units were in three localized sites a b c across the larger php property under study figs 6 and 8 there were 4 6 collections per fire totaling 759 samples over the collection period clip plot geolocations were not recorded and the number of measurements per years since fire ysf was lower for longer fire return intervals pine needle biomass ranged from 0 00 to 0 90 kg m 2 and was variable among sites table 1 at onf litter was sampled in the 24 research units between january and february 2022 fig 6 the sampling protocol was designed to address the non random distribution of surface fuels expected on the forest floor based on canopy cover i e considering the trees as the main source of litter inputs three focal trees per unit were randomly selected and geolocated using a trimble geo7x gps fig 6 litter was collected within square clip plots 0 09 m2 along transects leading away in the cardinal directions n s e w from the base of the focal tree at 1 2 and 4 m the data were collected in all the units in the days immediately preceding the prescribed fires ysf ranged from 1 to 4 years except for the unburned units that were 64 ysf as the last burn was in 1958 table 1 3 methods the workflow of the proposed model is presented in the conceptual diagram of fig 1 it involves three main steps first we map annual litter production using als data tree inventory data and ancillary data to estimate foliage biomass at the tree crown level and to inform litterfall patterns section 3 1 in the second step we quantify tree leaf litter accumulation through a spatially explicit implementation of the olson 1963 accumulation model section 3 2 we finally assess the accuracy of the model by comparing our estimates to independent litter biomass measurements from the field section 3 3 3 1 tree leaf litter production model the spatially explicit estimation of litter production involves 1 generation of an individual tree crown map through segmentation of als data and computation of tree crown attributes from the als point clouds 2 estimation of the total foliage biomass of each tree crown through rf modeling and 3 estimation of annual litterfall at the crown level from leaf turnover rates and litter dispersal over the forest floor using a convolution filter 3 1 1 individual tree crown segmentation the individual tree crown itc segmentation was generated from the als data using the r lidr and lidrplugins packages roussel et al 2020 first the locations of treetops were identified by applying the multichm algorithm based on iterative chm generation from the point cloud and a sequential detection of potential tree tops step using a local maximum filtering approach within a moving window over various chms eysn et al 2015 the treetop locations and the chm raster were subsequently used in the silva2016 segmentation algorithm silva et al 2016 to generate the itc segments the parameters of both processing steps were set by the interpreter assessing visually the accuracy of the segmentation appendix a section 2 3 the segmentation was performed on the full als extent of the three study sites fig 2 and at additional sites at ttrs ft stewart ft jackson and jerc where the tree inventory data were used for the accuracy assessment of the foliage biomass estimates appendix a figure a2 for each itc segment 28 crown attributes were calculated from the als point cloud table 2 to be used as predictors in the rf foliage biomass model none of the inventoried trees on the training plots appendix a table a1 and only four trees 0 04 trees on the assessment plots had an estimated crown projected area smaller than 1 m2 besides that all trees were at least 10 cm of dbh therefore segments with a crown area smaller than 1 m2 or with crown height lower than 1 37 m were removed from the segmentation crown height was defined by the 99th percentile of return height table 2 3 1 2 crown level foliage biomass estimation tree crown foliage biomass kg was estimated for each itc segment through rf modeling using the randomforest package in r breiman 2001 liaw and wiener 2002 r core team 2021 the methodology was adapted from rocha et al 2023 and the processing steps are summarized as follows the detailed description is reported in appendix a the rf was trained using as the response variable foliage biomass estimated through allometric equations for each measured tree included in the inventory dataset and using as predictor variables the crown attributes derived from the als data appendix a section 2 2 itc segmentation was first performed on the als data covering each tree inventory plot appendix a section 2 2 1 the individual tree records from the inventory dataset were then matched to itc segments by minimizing a distance metric computed in a multi dimensional space appendix a section 2 2 2 as a result a total of 404 itc segments were successfully linked to individual tree records and were used for training the rf model following rocha et al 2023 the most important predictors for the rf model were selected based on the correlation between the variables and the model improvement ratio mir a standardized measure of variable importance evans and murphy 2018 silva et al 2017 the rf model was run in regression mode and the number of random trees was set to 1000 the number of predictors considered at each node split was set at the default p 3 in the randomforest package where p is the number of variables included in the model appendix a section 2 2 3 once the rf model was trained foliage biomass was predicted for each crown delineated within the three study sites 3 1 3 annual tree leaf litter production annual tree crown leaf litterfall i e the amount of foliage biomass annually shed by the tree kg m 2 yr 1 was estimated as a fraction of the crown foliage biomass determined by the expected leaf turnover rate he et al 2012 reinhardt 2003 tupek et al 2015 white et al 2000 1 l i f b i l t r i c p a i where l i kg m 2 yr 1 is the annual tree leaf litterfall for tree crown i f b i kg is the estimated foliage biomass for the tree crown i l t r i yr 1 is the leaf turnover rate associated with crown i and c p a i is the crown projected area m2 leaf turnover rate ltr is the expected proportion of the foliage biomass that annually falls from a tree it depends on tree species and environmental factors with deciduous trees shedding the full foliage every year whereas evergreen species retain a fraction of the foliage based on species light temperature water and nutrient availability holder 2000 jonasson 1989 kudo 1992 miyaji et al 1997 thomas and stoddart 1980 since als data do not identify tree species l t r i was assigned to each crown based on the forest type map fig 3 as the inverse of the expected leaf longevity of the dominant species holder 2000 schoettle et al 1994 white et al 2000 in particular the longleaf slash pine group was the dominant forest type fig 3 holder 2000 reported large variability in needle lifespan of slash pine 1 28 1 95 years and longleaf pine 0 58 2 49 years gholz et al 1985 reported increases in needlefall with stand age up to 15 years coinciding with the maximum of foliage biomass gholz and fisher 1982 and a decline of litterfall in old stands that parallels litter production based on these studies we attributed higher ltr lower lifespan to slash and longleaf pine at eglin afb ltr 0 58 yr 1 i e leaf life span 1 7 yr than onf and php l t r i 0 45 yr 1 i e leaf life span 2 2 yr where stands were structurally more mature appendix a table a1 and a2 l t r i for each tree crown i was assigned based on the raster cell i e pixel of the forest type map intersecting their centroid if a tree crown was delineated on a pixel classified as non forest l t r i was set to the predominant longleaf slash pine forest type table 3 finally the tree crown leaf litterfall estimates were rasterized at 5 m spatial resolution which approximates the size of the dominant tree crown in this ecosystem loudermilk et al 2011 to account for the dispersion of litterfall from the tree due to wind a convolution filter with a 3 3 kernel size was applied to the 5 m rasterized map higher litter accumulation is observed under or near tree crowns and litter mass tends to decrease significantly 4 m from gap edges brockway and w outcalt 1998 therefore making the conservative assumption that litter will mostly remain near each tree we assigned a higher weight 2 3 to the focal pixel center cell of the matrix and distributed the remaining 1 3 uniformly among the remaining eight pixels resulting in the following kernel matrix 2 k 1 24 1 24 1 24 1 24 2 3 1 24 1 24 1 24 1 24 in the final map litterfall was estimated at each pixel location as 3 l x f j 1 9 k j l j where l x f is the final value of the tree leaf litter production in pixel x k j is the value of the kernel at location j in the 3 3 window and l j is the tree leaf litterfall estimated from the rasterization of eq 1 at location j in the 3 3 window centered on pixel x 3 2 tree leaf litter accumulation model in this second step we quantify tree leaf litter accumulation through a spatially explicit implementation of the olson 1963 litter accumulation model using as model parameters the raster annual tree litterfall map section 3 1 decomposition rates estimated from modis actual

the annual litter production rate is obtained from eq 3 as the output of the annual litter production model section 3 1 k x the decomposition rate was estimated as a function of aet through the regression model by gholz et al 2000 developed as part of the long term intersite decomposition experiment lidet lidet was a litter bag experiment that studied decomposition trends in several species across different sites in north and central america representing a wide variety of natural and managed ecosystems and climates and provided species specific equations for the decomposition rate our sites are dominated by pine species where needles are the dominant leaf tissue this litter has a larger lignin content and a smaller leaf specific area so the decomposition rate is expected to be slower compared to deciduous dominated areas the decomposition equation used was the linear model for pine leaves gholz et al 2000 7 k x 0 0139 0 0003 a e t x where a e t x is the average annual

of the rxcadre project ottmar et al 2015 a constant value b 0 0 04 kg m 2 was used in all cases 3 3 accuracy assessment the accuracy of the model was evaluated at two different levels pixel and area each comparing model estimates of tree leaf litter biomass with field measurements of litter biomass collected over the past two decades in the three study sites section 2 2 6 the year of the last fire was known at the time of the data collection so the litter accumulation model eq 6 was re run for each required ysf 3 3 1 pixel level assessment we assessed the accuracy of the model at the pixel level by comparing litter biomass estimated on individual 5 m x 5 m pixels to field measurements with known clip plot geolocations table 1 pixel level assessment was performed at eglin afb and onf where the gps coordinates of the clip plots were known at eglin afb each validation point consisted of a clip plot measurement and the estimated litter biomass of the intersecting pixel of the accumulation map totaling 262 observations 166 from the rxcadre project and 96 from the serdp project at onf the field sampling protocol was designed at a sub pixel level 5 m since twelve clip plots were located within 4 m from a focal tree section 2 2 6 the average of these twelve samples was used as the observed field litter biomass at the location of each focal tree fig 6 and the intersecting pixel as the estimated litter biomass value resulting in 72 pixel level observations the precision of the predictions was evaluated by computing the root mean square difference rmsd 8 r m s d i 1 n y i y i 2 n where n is the number of pixel level measurements y i is the field litter biomass kg m 2 measured for pixel i and y i is the litter biomass kg m 2 predicted in pixel i the accuracy of the predictions was evaluated by computing the bias 9 b i a s 1 n i 1 n y i y i note that litter samples collected at onf only included litter from pine needles while our predictions accounted for all trees detected in the als data the percentage of foliage biomass expected from deciduous trees was calculated from the tree inventory data using allometric equations appendix a table a3 resulting in a residual 1 1 that was considered negligible 3 3 2 area level assessment we also assessed the accuracy of the model at a raster multi pixel level hereinafter area level assessment in this case litter areas enclosing several field litter clip plots were defined and the average of the litter biomass measurements collected from the clip plots was compared to the average predicted litter biomass computed from all the pixels intersecting the perimeter of the litter area area level assessment was performed at php and eglin afb using the litter biomass field measurements collected during the rxcadre project note that the field sampling protocols at eglin afb in 2015 and at onf in 2022 were designed at pixel and sub pixel levels 5 m and hence were excluded from the area level assessment at eglin afb 9 litter areas enclosing the 262 field litter clip plots were manually delineated around the clusters of the clip plots collected for the rxcadre project hudak et al 2015 hudak and bright 2014 these litter clip plots were systematically placed within sub units or along parallel transects at regular intervals defining a specific sampling extent section 2 2 6 the delineated extent ranged from 0 09 to 2 4 ha except for a larger defined litter area in the l2f unit 72 4 ha that was delineated over the three parallel transects distributed at 100 m intervals over half of the management unit fig 7 at php the litter areas consisted of the 24 research units 0 12 ha in which litter was collected between 2006 and 2020 fig 8 these areas were variously sampled at 1 6 ysf therefore a total of 68 replicates research unit per ysf were used for model assessment the precision and accuracy of the predictions at the area level were again evaluated by computing rmsd and bias using eqs 8 and 9 with y i being the average litter biomass collected from the clip plots for each defined litter area i and y i being the average predicted litter biomass from all the pixels of the litter accumulation map intersecting the perimeter of litter area i litter samples used for model assessment at php only included litter from pine needles around 12 of biomass within the a units would correspond to deciduous trees 1 on the b units and 9 on the c units for model assessment on a and c units we subtracted this percentage from the predicted litter average y i the accuracy of the model was assessed in additional longleaf pine dominated forests of the north american coastal plain where field litter biomass measurements with known ysf and collocated with als data were available these additional sites were jerc georgia ttrs florida ft stewart georgia and ft jackson south carolina appendix b figure b1 for a full description of the extended model assessment including the field sampling

and the resulting litter production maps for the three locations a b and c at php the average annual tree leaf litter production estimated with our crown based model was 0 18 kg m 2 yr 1 at eglin afb

there was a large spatial variability in decomposition rates within eglin afb reflecting a e t x ranging by an order of magnitude from 0 05 to 0 46 yr 1 across this largest study site fig 4 accordingly the time necessary to reach 95 of the steady state of litter accumulation based on the olson model at eglin afb averaged 16 years while at php it was 9 years and at onf it was 7 years average predicted surface tree leaf litter in 2015 at eglin afb was 0 39 kg m 2 in 2019 at php was 0 27 kg m 2 and in 2022 at onf was 0 44 kgm 2 fig 11 higher values result from the larger proportion of the area that is not frequently burned fig 12 shows the estimated litter accumulation per time since fire for each of the study sites 4 3 model assessment 4 3 1 pixel level assessment rmsd and bias were 0 21 and 0 01 kg m 2 and the r pearson correlation between predicted y i and observed y i values was 0 51 fig 13 table 4 at eglin afb rmsd of estimated litter loads was relatively similar compared to the two validation datasets table 4 litter loads were underestimated compared to the rxcadre measurements bias 0 06 kg m 2 and to a lesser degree overestimated compared to the serdp measurements bias 0 02 kg m 2 fig 13 table 4 this pattern was expected since tree leaf litter was not separated from other tissue such as bark during the rxcadre field data collection table 1 at onf the rmsd was only slightly worse than at eglin afb but litter loads were more positively biased rmsd 0 21 kg m 2 bias 0 14 kg m 2 due mostly to the large overestimation at the unburned control units tables 4 and 5 summarized by ysf the contribution of the unburned units at onf to the overall overestimation of litter loads is more apparent table 5 4 3 2 area level assessment at the area based level rmsd and bias were 0 09 and 0 01 kg m 2 and the r pearson correlation between predicted y i and observed y i values was 0 73 fig 14 table 6 by site rmsd and bias were 0 09 and 0 05 kg m 2 at eglin afb and 0 09 and 0 02 kg m 2 at php at php precision rmsd was better at the c unit than at the a or b units while accuracy bias was better at the b and c units than at the a unit table 6 predicted litter loads were in good agreement with field measured loads when stratified by ysf as shown by the low observed bias up to the 6 years since fire table 7 the r pearson correlation between predicted y i and observed y i values was high r 0 75 at 2 and 3 ysf and moderate in all the other cases r 0 40 note that the number of clip plots and litter areas available for evaluation decreases with ysf 5 discussion our newly developed modeling approach was successful for estimating spatially and temporally explicitly leaf litter accumulation and distribution mainly driven by tree foliage biomass and time since the last fire previous studies already showed a relationship between litter loads and overlying tree foliage and or time since last disturbance bright et al 2022 dunn and bailey 2015 eskelson and monleon 2018 hudak et al 2016 lydersen et al 2015 stevens rumann et al 2020 for instance hudak et al 2016 reported high correlation between surface fuel loads als canopy related variables and ysf at eglin afb also bright et al 2022 predicted surface fuels with als data showing a non linear accumulation pattern as is described by the olson model the bright et al 2022 study was conducted on the kaibab plateau of arizona and another study by boisramé et al 2022 spanned the entire western u s where fire return intervals are slower decadal yet the functional form of the relationship to ysf is the same we demonstrated in this study that canopy litter inputs and ysf are two major drivers of accumulation in fire maintained longleaf pine forests of the southeastern us especially during the first few years following fire we also demonstrated that the proposed model based on tree crown objects derived from als data provides a means to characterize spatially explicit litterfall patterns and the discontinuity of the litter layer conditioned on the overstory such that the resulting heterogeneity matches field observations fairly well our leaf litter accumulation estimates showed a significantly low bias up to 4 ysf which suggest that the litterfall inputs included on the spatially explicit implementation of the olson model were within the expected range our annual litter production averages 0 11 0 26 kg m 2 yr 1 were lower than published measurements obtained with field traps in similar forest regions which generally ranged from 0 3 to 0 6 kg m 2 yr 1 depending on species maturity and site index e g gholz et al 1985 gresham 1982 haywood et al 1995 wiegert and monk 1972 however it should be noted that our estimates are averaged over large areas including gaps and low tree canopy cover so they are not directly comparable with measurements collected through field traps which are typically placed in points with high tree canopy cover our explicit consideration of discontinuity in surface fuelbed development is a central contribution of our study furthermore the moderate to high correlation between predicted and observed litter biomass loads tables 4 7 is notable considering the high local heterogeneity on the forest floor table 1 and the difference in size between the litter clip plots 0 09 1 m2 and the raster pixel size of the leaf litter accumulation map 25 m2 our results also indicate that the lack of individual tree species maps for the entire extent of the study sites was a significant source of uncertainty the 30 m resolution forest group map was too coarse to fully characterize the variability of the forest composition at the study sites especially given the localized extents of our assembled calibration datasets for instance the larger discrepancies between observed and predicted values in the a research units compared to the b and c units at php could be explained by the higher proportion of shortleaf pines in unit a whereas the forest type group map fig 3 indicates that the longleaf slash group is the prevalent type the availability of individual tree species maps would also facilitate further development of the proposed model allowing for the characterization of litter structure for instance longleaf pine trees tend to create an aerated fuel bed of needles some suspended in the herbaceous and shrub understory vegetation whereas shortleaf pine needles are much more likely to accumulate densely on the forest floor reid and robertson 2012 data fusion between als and high resolution optical data are promising avenues for the generation of wall to wall tree species maps ferreira et al 2020 hartling et al 2019 mäyrä et al 2021 shi et al 2018 and it will be investigated in the context of future improvements to the proposed model furthermore year to year studies of needlefall and leaf lifespan in pine forests show that litter production is not a steady process in time or space e g gholz et al 1985 holder 2000 liu et al 2004 wiegert and monk 1972 holder 2000 studied the leaf lifespan of longleaf and slash pines in five locations in the southeastern us and reported large plasticity especially in longleaf pine 0 58 2 49 years compared to slash pine s range of 1 28 1 95 years wiegert and monk 1972 studied litterfall dynamics in three forest stands of longleaf pine of different ages 7 11 and 13 years they observed that approximately 50 of the needles were recovered as litterfall each year but there was variability among sites ranging from 29 in the 7 year to 86 in the 11 year stands climate and weather variability could induce periods of stress in which foliage production slows down and or litterfall is promoted due to nutrient deficits and sudden events e g hurricanes windstorms insect infestations or crown scorch from previous fire besides this our litter distribution approach based on the convolution filter assumes that litter mostly remains under the tree canopy and evenly disperses to neighboring cells however both prevailing winds and topographic slope could cause anisotropic patterns of accumulation fire regimes induce changes in decomposer activity by affecting fungal and microbial communities brennan et al 2009 butler et al 2019 dao et al 2022 fox et al 2022 hopkins et al 2020 semenova nelsen et al 2019 but the pathways linking these processes are still poorly understood impacts could differ under the presence of fire adapted organisms or under different fire intensities hopkins et al 2020 butler et al 2019 reported faster microbial decomposition on unburned treatments compared to sites burnt every 2 and 4 years however they also indicated that invertebrate activity compensated for the microbial depletion to inhibit decomposition in these frequently burnt areas semenova nelsen et al 2019 reported a 6 5 11 and 13 difference in litter mass loss after 3 6 and 9 months following fire on litter samples collected in recently burned and less recently burned longleaf pine forest previous measurements at the stoddard fire plots at ttrs in the organic matter turnover was more than twice as high in unburned than in the frequently burned 1 3 year interval plots godwin et al 2017 we speculate that changes in decomposition might also explain some of the patterns observed in our results for instance field data collected at php shows a decrease in litter accumulation after 3 ysf table 1 the field samples were not geolocated within the research units and the number of samples with ysf 3 was low such that this trend could be attributed to undersampling however this result and the overestimation of litter loads in the 4 ysf and unburnt units at onf do suggest an increase in decomposition rate after a few years since fire the development of deeper litter and eventually duff layers could absorb more moisture and promote more microbial activity and microbial communities presumably become increasingly established in the litter and duff layer with time since fire semenova nelsen et al 2019 therefore a two or multi phase litter decomposition model as opposed to the one phase used in our implementation of the olson model might improve the estimates of litter loads with increasing time since fire harmon et al 2009 zazali et al 2020 given the short return interval of prescribed fires in the ecosystems studied information on the complete fuel life cycle including consumption during fires decomposition between fires and resulting fuel loads at time of fire is important to better predict fuel load dynamics over multiple fire intervals the olson model as originally proposed assumed that litter was not initially present on the forest floor in contrast empirical studies report that a significant proportion of litter as much as half remains unburned especially after prescribed fires hudak et al 2020 ottmar et al 2015 reid et al 2012 while we accounted for unburned biomass we used a constant b 0 value based on post fire litter samples collected at eglin afb during the rxcadre project ottmar et al 2015 ottmar and restaino 2014 this constant value might explain the lower correlation between predicted and observed values in the first year after fire compared to the second and third year even though the average values were similar table 7 future research will investigate whether the fraction of unburned litter could also be mapped either through monitoring the fire behavior and assessing fuel consumption using tools such as thermal remote sensing data or investigating whether local fuel consumption may be driven by the same tree clustering patterns that determine the heterogeneity imposed by our spatially explicit model the above limitations notwithstanding the results demonstrate that the proposed model is able to generate spatially and temporally explicit estimates of tree litter fuel load accumulation in environments subject to frequent surface fires at 5 m resolution and annual time steps such information is currently missing for most forested sites previously proposed methods including ecological based models and data driven techniques do not account for the spatial and temporal variability of the litter bed collating input litterfall information through traditional field sampling methods is time consuming and expensive and it does not provide wall to wall information the use of als data and new techniques of image segmentation to estimate expected litterfall rates at the tree crown level largely overcomes this limitation our model also outperforms empirical data driven approaches that use surface fuel data for training models e g bright et al 2022 lydersen et al 2015 the transferability of those models is limited by the amount of data required to represent the tremendous heterogeneity of fuels keane 2015 2008 keane et al 2013 2012 2001 keane and gray 2013 in contrast our model did not require litter biomass measurements rather we estimated foliage biomass using tree inventory data which is more widely available and easier to collect it is less prone to undersampling and it is more consistent between sites as a result our model is transferable among coastal plain longleaf pine forests as demonstrated by the consistency of the results at all evaluated sites including other sites in the extended model assessment appendix b the workflow can also be adjusted to sites dominated by different tree species and environmental conditions our approach can provide annually updated maps of litter loads to forest managers many available products providing information on surface fuels are static maps based on fuelbed or vegetation types e g those derived from the fuel characteristics classification system fccs by incorporating fire history maps we assert that litter loads can be dynamically updated on an annual basis 6 conclusions this model illustrates a novel yet simple methodology to quantify the spatially explicit litter loads in longleaf pine forests in the southeastern us that are managed using frequent prescribed fires our goal and achievement were twofold first we leveraged our understanding of the litter accumulation process combining traditional ecological based modeling with up to date machine learning and remote sensing techniques for wall to wall mapping of litter fuels over relatively large areas second we demonstrated that aboveground biomass and ysf are the two major drivers of tree leaf litter accumulation in these fire maintained longleaf pine forests especially during the first years following fire therefore spatially explicit information on these two parameters could be sufficient for a generalized characterization of the accumulation process in a heterogeneous manner that reflects overstory canopy controls on surface fuel accumulation this methodology provides realistic estimates of litter fuels and where als is available partially resolves the challenge of wall to wall mapping of the highly heterogeneous distribution of litter over the forest floor therefore the model overcomes many of the spatial limitations of traditional ecological landscape models and current data driven modeling approaches this integrated modeling approach is a step toward meeting the greater challenge of characterizing spatial patterns of multiple fuel components including duff woody debris herbs and shrubs at high spatial resolution that better matches the fine scales at which wildland fuel beds vary where other modeling approaches may fail to provide the resolution and accuracy managers need models such as presented in this study can fill the information gap these maps will improve decision making involving

24204,the continuity and depth of litter fuelbeds are major drivers of fire spread and fuel consumption however no established approach is available for the spatially explicit prediction of litter loads over large areas local fuel heterogeneity introduces large uncertainties on estimates derived from field based models based on the extrapolation of sparse data samples in fire maintained pine forests of the southeastern us litter accumulation and its distribution over the forest floor are mainly driven by vegetation productivity and by the number of years since the last fire ysf some ecological models that simulate fire effects allow for a time dependent estimation of litter by accounting for the opposing rates of litter deposition and decomposition as a function of ysf at the landscape level but they do not account for spatial heterogeneity we developed a conceptually simple approach for wall to wall estimation of tree leaf litter loads at high spatial resolution 5 m the approach involved first estimating spatial patterns of tree annual litterfall we mapped individual tree crowns through segmentation of airborne laser scanning als data and we estimated crown foliage biomass using tree inventory data and als derived tree crown attributes tree annual litterfall was calculated as a fraction of the crown foliage biomass based on leaf turnover rates we then quantified tree leaf litter accumulation through a spatially explicit implementation of the established olson 1963 accumulation and negative decay model we tested and validated our model in several management and research units at eglin air force base florida pebble hill plantation georgia and osceola national forest florida where managers maintain predominantly longleaf pine forests using frequent fire pixel level rmsd and bias between tree leaf litter biomass estimated by the proposed model and reference field measurements were 0 21 and 0 01 kg m 2 and area level rmsd and bias were 0 09 and 0 01 kg m 2 we concluded that linking patterns of litterfall and tree leaf litter accumulation to tree crown objects provides a means to characterizing the discontinuity of the litter layer accounting for spatial heterogeneity largely traceable to tree crown foliage inputs keywords litter production litter accumulation surface fuels time since fire tree crown airborne laser scanning als data availability there are several datasets used on the manuscript some data is already publicly available and the authors will make available under request the datasets they have permission on 1 introduction the continuity and depth of the surface vegetation and fuel layers are major drivers of fire spread and fuel consumption in frequently burned ecosystems and are linked to fire risk and severity agee and skinner 2005 hiers et al 2009 loudermilk et al 2012 high resolution maps of these fuels are particularly relevant for predicting fire intensity and burn patterns in fire maintained longleaf pine pinus palustris forests of the north american coastal plain in the southeastern us noss et al 2015 these systems are dependent on frequent 1 3 year interval surface fires of low severity to maintain their high levels of plant diversity bond et al 2005 kirkman et al 2001 mitchell et al 2009 walker and peet 1984 because of frequent fire vegetation communities are characterized by widely spaced pine trees resprouting hardwoods and a continuous herbaceous layer mostly composed of perennials the spatial arrangement of these communities defines the distribution and composition of the fine surface fuels which are often dominated by tree leaf litter and particularly pine needle cast these are the major contributors to fine surface fuel loading often representing more than half of the available fine fuel jevon et al 2022 mitchell et al 1999 platt et al 2016 robertson et al 2014 thaxton and platt 2006 consequently tree litter is unevenly distributed over the forest floor depending on tree density and distribution grace and platt 1995 for instance unburned patches are often observed to correspond to tree gaps and areas of low canopy cover even when there is continuous herbaceous cover on the ground mugnani et al 2019 robertson et al 2019 various methods including analytical modeling classifications and or statistical analysis using both field and remote sensing datasets have been proposed to quantify litter loads bright et al 2022 hudak et al 2016 keane 2012 keane et al 2001 loudermilk et al 2011 lydersen et al 2015 olson 1963 for instance loudermilk et al 2011 utilized field data and linear models to estimate pine and hardwood leaf litter loads as a function of time since fire and simulated tree size and spatial distribution hudak et al 2016 used als and landsat optical data to map forest structure and composition through imputation and reported functional relationships between overstory structure and surface fuel attributes bright et al 2022 predicted surface fuels using remotely sensed data and several ancillary datasets including topographic and fire history variables on a study area across the kaibab plateau in northern arizona nevertheless the spatially explicit characterization of litter loads is still a challenge over areas larger than field sample plots local fuel heterogeneity introduces large uncertainties in estimates and interpolations derived from field data and its systematic monitoring is time consuming and expensive requiring intensive sampling protocols and frequently repeated measurements keane 2015 keane et al 2001 additionally the usefulness of remote sensing for direct modeling and mapping of such fine fuels is limited due to the low sensitivity to litter depth of both active and passive sensors which is further limited under the forest canopy leaf litter generally accumulates over time until litter production is balanced by decomposition in a quasi equilibrium mccaw et al 2002 olson 1963 zazali et al 2020 litter production or litterfall results from senescent biomass irregularly falling to the forest floor from all layers of the vegetation canopy a process mainly driven by aboveground biomass species characteristics and climate costa et al 2020 keane 2008 neumann et al 2018 decomposition which drives the rate of nutrient recycling in the forest ecosystem is controlled by heterotrophic consumption of organic composites and in turn depends on litter quality soil properties and climatic factors bezkorovaynaya 2005 keane 2008 krishna and mohan 2017 prescott 2002 a widely used litter accumulation model that combines two simple analytical models for litter deposition and decomposition was introduced by olson 1963 the model assumes that litter falls at a constant rate and that at each point in time decomposition is proportional to the total litter accumulation the combination of these two terms results in a negative exponential model where total litter accumulation is a function of the time since the litter deposition was initiated such as following planting or a fire that fully or mostly consumed the litter while the olson model ignores factors such as tree size and distribution stand age productivity and annual and seasonal variations in precipitation and temperature to describe the spatial intra stand heterogeneity of the litter loads it has been widely used by fire ecologists as it provides realistic litter accumulation estimates zazali et al 2020 assuming relatively similar soil and climate conditions spatial variability in litter accumulation would be primarily driven by canopy characteristics canopy structure and aboveground biomass affects the spatial variation of surface litter by both influencing the organic layer environment e g soil temperature water content of microbes that drive decomposition and by governing the litterfall hopkins et al 2020 neumann et al 2018 penne et al 2010 platt et al 2016 therefore characterizing the spatial variability of foliage biomass driven by heterogeneity in the forest canopy provides a means to describe patterns of litterfall and surface fuel dynamics at the scale of tree crowns ferrari and sugita 1996 yarie 2000 remote sensing currently provides the most practical means to characterize patterns of aboveground biomass across forested landscapes and associated ecosystem processes airborne laser scanning als shows particular promise because of its ability to record a dense 3d point cloud that can be used to characterize the forest canopy structure als has been successfully used for tree detection stem mapping and segmentation of tree crowns jakubowski et al 2013 li et al 2012 roussel et al 2020 silva et al 2016 als tree crown derived metrics have been used to quantify tree attributes such as height volume and or woody and foliar biomass using different modeling approaches including parametric and non parametric methods chen et al 2007 rocha et al 2023 silva et al 2016 wan mohd jaafar et al 2018 the overarching objective of this study is to develop a conceptually simple and physically based model of tree leaf litter accumulation after fire the proposed model is informed by remote sensing data that capture the spatial heterogeneity of litter loads in temporally dynamic fire maintained longleaf pine forests the methodology is demonstrated primarily at three

materials 2 1 study sites the three study sites were eglin air force base afb in the florida panhandle pebble hill plantation php in southern georgia and the olustee experimental forest within the osceola national forest onf in northeastern florida fig 2 the sites undergo frequent prescribed burning often a 1 3 year fire return interval that serves to maintain the native wildlife and health of the predominant longleaf pine ecosystem as well as facilitating military training at eglin afb the three sites share the same subtropical climate with relatively mild winters and warm and humid summers but they span the edaphic gradient characteristic of the region described below eglin afb covers 186 350 ha and it is divided into management units where activities such as prescribed fires or silviculture practices are performed the eglin afb portion of our study focuses on sandhill and flatwoods longleaf pine communities fnai 2010 where als data were most recently collected in 2018 92 699

pine and some slash pine p elliotti with a discontinuous midstory of fire tolerant broadleaf species mostly turkey oak quercus laevis and bluejack oak q incana as well as less fire hardy broadleaf species such as persimmon diospyros virginiana the surface vegetation is species rich with forbs perennial grasses dominated by wiregrass aristida stricta var beyrichiana and broadleaf woody plants that are topkilled by fire and resprout the flatwoods communities are located on soils in the spodosol order where the deep sand soil is saturated for part of the year and contains some organic material soil survey staff 2021 flatwoods also have a discontinuous canopy of mostly longleaf pine and some slash pine but with a midstory and understory of evergreen woody plants mostly saw palmetto serenoa repens dwarf live oak q minima and gallberry ilex glabra hudak et al 2016 that resprout after being topkilled and forbs and perennial grasses dominated by wiregrass at php the study site covers 824 ha within upland longleaf pine communities fnai 2010 located on soils in the ultisol order with sandy topsoil and a clay rich subhorizon soil survey staff 2021 the overstory vegetation is dominated by a mix of longleaf pine and shortleaf pine p echinata while the understory is dominated by a particularly species rich community of perennial grasses including wiregrass forbs and resprouting broadleaf woody plants ostertag and robertson 2007 robertson and hmielowski 2014 finally the study site at onf consists of winter experimental burn units within flatwoods pine communities as described above the onf site is part of a long term fire experiment that was first established in 1958 in a randomized block design to evaluate different fire return intervals on fuel accumulation it is comprised of six replicates of four treatments 0 85 ha each that consist of burns performed regularly every 1 2 or 4 years with an additional no burn treatment control mckee 1982 overstory and understory vegetation are dominated by longleaf pine and saw palmetto respectively all three sites represent native vegetation types where the soil has not been previously disturbed by agriculture or other management and all three have been burned frequently for decades leading up to this study because of frequent fire surface organic matter is dominated by litter in various stages of decomposition but with very little organic soil duff except in the onf unburned control units the three community types studied represent the three dominant soil orders and respective ecosystem types in the north american coastal plain carr et al 2010 and thus provide broad representation of the region 2 2 data 2 2 1 airborne laser scanning data als data were used to segment individual tree crown maps within the study sites and to compute crown attributes that were used as predictors of foliage biomass in a random forest rf model section 3 1 als data were acquired in 2018 at both eglin afb and php and between 2018 and 2020 at onf the average return density was variable among sites and campaigns but always exceeded 8 points m 2 the point cloud provided in a laz or las binary format was normalized converting points to height above ground using lastools software isenburg 2021 a canopy height model chm 1 m spatial resolution was created using the grid canopy function and the pit free algorithm khosravipour et al 2014 implemented in the lidr r package roussel et al 2020 2 2 2 tree inventory data tree inventory data provided the foliage biomass dataset used as the response variable to train the rf model section 3 1 2 because of the limited number of inventory plots on the three study sites the dataset was augmented with additional plots located in longleaf pine dominated forests with similar environmental conditions where contemporaneous als data were also available appendix a figure a1 within each inventory plot tree species health status healthy unhealthy and dead and dbh diameter at breast height 1 37 m were recorded tree attributes such as stem geolocations tree height and crown diameter calculated as the average of two measurements in orthogonal directions of the projection of the edges of the crown were available for a subset of plots 19 plots encompassing a total of 615 trees the data used for training the foliage biomass model were located at two of the primary study sites eglin afb php and at three similar southern pine forest sites tall timbers research station ttrs florida ft stewart georgia and ft jackson south carolina appendix a table a1 supplementary tree inventory plot data missing the geolocation of the individual stems tree height or the crown diameter were used for assessing the accuracy of the mapped foliage biomass estimates these plots were located at eglin afb onf php ttrs ft jackson ft stewart and the joseph jones ecological research center jerc appendix a table a2 a detailed description of the tree inventory datasets tallied species and collection protocols is provided in appendix a section 1 2 only live trees with 10 cm dbh were considered tree foliage biomass was estimated by applying published species based allometric equations gonzalez benecke et al 2014 2018 loomis et al 1966 mitchell et al 1999 zhao et al 2015 2016 2019a b appendix a section 2 1 2 2 3 forest type group map the 30 m resolution forest type groups of the continental united states dataset usda fia 2021 was used to parametrize wall to wall the leaf turnover rate ltr in the spatially explicit annual tree leaf litter production model section 3 1 3 the map is generated through the imputation of forest inventory and analysis fia field data collected from 2014 to 2018 to phenological variables derived from landsat oli operational land imager satellite data together with auxiliary climatic and topographic data wilson et al 2012 2013 2018 the map defines a forest type group for every 30 m forested pixel adopting the same legend 33 forest type groups of the forest atlas of the united states usda usfs 2022 the longleaf slash pine group is predominant in all three study sites with a significant presence of the loblolly shortleaf pine group at php fig 3 2 2 4 average annual evapotranspiration actual evapotranspiration aet was used to estimate the litter decomposition rate which is one of the parameters required by the litter accumulation model section 3 2 annual aet from 2003 to 2019 was obtained from the moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer modis product 1 km available at https earlywarning usgs gov accessed on 9th of september 2021 this product uses the operational simplified surface energy balance ssebop model to retrieve annual aet senay and kagone 2019 senay et al 2013 for the three sites the annual average was computed fig 4 average annual aet was higher at onf 1292 mm and php 1055 mm than at eglin afb 653 mm as expected based on temperature and precipitation trends thornton et al 2020 2 2 5 fire history the fire history of the study sites was used to assess the time since fire and therefore the time of the litter accumulation process section 3 2 it was reconstructed by integrating management records and remotely sensed derived products fig 5 at eglin afb recurrent fire is used as a management tool to ensure appropriate conditions for military training and maintain the longleaf pine forest communities fire records at eglin afb consisted of geographic information system gis datasets of fire boundaries which included the date of burn from 1972 up to 2015 at php fires are typically applied to pine communities at 1 2 year intervals as part of the regional tradition for game management robertson and hmielowski 2014 rother et al 2020 the southeast firemap pilot product of ttrs and usda natural resources conservation services nrcs produced from landsat satellite data was used as fire history at php southeast se firemap 2021 this product maps detectable fires happening since 1994 both managed prescribed burns and wildfires across nine states in the southeastern us within the boundaries of the study site at php reported fires span from 1996 to 2019 at onf burns are regularly performed every 1 2 or 4 years on the three burn treatment blocks or are excluded on the no burn treatment control blocks fig 5 shows the fire history records available within the three study sites up to 2015 for eglin afb 2019 for php and january 2022 for onf 2 2 6 litter biomass field measurements previously collected litter biomass field measurements were collated and used for the accuracy assessment of the results of the proposed litter accumulation model at eglin afb and php whereas new data were collected at onf these measurements consisted of destructive biomass sampling on square or circular plots known as clip plots in which biomass of different surface fuels e g litter shrubs downed woody debris grasses was collected bagged and oven dried at eglin afb three management units were sampled i e 703c 608a and l2f and surface fuel data were collected over 166 square clip plots in 2011 1 m2 and 2012 0 25 m2 in the framework of the rxcadre prescribed fire combustion and atmospheric dynamics research experiment project fig 6 ottmar et al 2015 ottmar and restaino 2014 in 2011 100 clip plots were established in five locations within the 703c and 608a units in 2012 66 samples were collected in the l2f unit 36 were on three highly instrumented plots hips west east and south hips whereas the other 30 clip plots were systematically located along three parallel transects figs 6 and 7 hudak et al 2015 hudak and bright 2014 all litter was collected but it was not sorted so the samples included pine needles oak and broad leaves and other tissue loads ranged from 0 05 to 1 27 kg m 2 table 1 another field campaign to characterize fuels was conducted at eglin afb in 2015 within the framework of a past serdp strategic environmental research and development program funded project the sampling was stratified based on canopy height and percent canopy cover to represent the flatwoods and sandhills for open single tree and tree clump conditions twenty four plots were established in five management units that burned 2 years before data collection fig 6 each plot center was geolocated and surface fuels were collected in four clip plots 0 25 0 50 m2 located 5 m from the plot center in azimuthal directions 60 120 240 and 300 totaling 96 clip plot measurements different fuel categories were sorted including pine needles and fine litter and oak and other broad leaves grass was not separated from pine litter during data collection but an ocular estimation of the percentage of each component was noted when possible litter loads including pine and broad leaves ranged from 0 00 to 0 75 kg m 2 table 1 at php litter of pine needles was collected at 24 replicated research units 0 12 ha burned in may june at 1 6 year intervals between 2006 and 2020 these units were in three localized sites a b c across the larger php property under study figs 6 and 8 there were 4 6 collections per fire totaling 759 samples over the collection period clip plot geolocations were not recorded and the number of measurements per years since fire ysf was lower for longer fire return intervals pine needle biomass ranged from 0 00 to 0 90 kg m 2 and was variable among sites table 1 at onf litter was sampled in the 24 research units between january and february 2022 fig 6 the sampling protocol was designed to address the non random distribution of surface fuels expected on the forest floor based on canopy cover i e considering the trees as the main source of litter inputs three focal trees per unit were randomly selected and geolocated using a trimble geo7x gps fig 6 litter was collected within square clip plots 0 09 m2 along transects leading away in the cardinal directions n s e w from the base of the focal tree at 1 2 and 4 m the data were collected in all the units in the days immediately preceding the prescribed fires ysf ranged from 1 to 4 years except for the unburned units that were 64 ysf as the last burn was in 1958 table 1 3 methods the workflow of the proposed model is presented in the conceptual diagram of fig 1 it involves three main steps first we map annual litter production using als data tree inventory data and ancillary data to estimate foliage biomass at the tree crown level and to inform litterfall patterns section 3 1 in the second step we quantify tree leaf litter accumulation through a spatially explicit implementation of the olson 1963 accumulation model section 3 2 we finally assess the accuracy of the model by comparing our estimates to independent litter biomass measurements from the field section 3 3 3 1 tree leaf litter production model the spatially explicit estimation of litter production involves 1 generation of an individual tree crown map through segmentation of als data and computation of tree crown attributes from the als point clouds 2 estimation of the total foliage biomass of each tree crown through rf modeling and 3 estimation of annual litterfall at the crown level from leaf turnover rates and litter dispersal over the forest floor using a convolution filter 3 1 1 individual tree crown segmentation the individual tree crown itc segmentation was generated from the als data using the r lidr and lidrplugins packages roussel et al 2020 first the locations of treetops were identified by applying the multichm algorithm based on iterative chm generation from the point cloud and a sequential detection of potential tree tops step using a local maximum filtering approach within a moving window over various chms eysn et al 2015 the treetop locations and the chm raster were subsequently used in the silva2016 segmentation algorithm silva et al 2016 to generate the itc segments the parameters of both processing steps were set by the interpreter assessing visually the accuracy of the segmentation appendix a section 2 3 the segmentation was performed on the full als extent of the three study sites fig 2 and at additional sites at ttrs ft stewart ft jackson and jerc where the tree inventory data were used for the accuracy assessment of the foliage biomass estimates appendix a figure a2 for each itc segment 28 crown attributes were calculated from the als point cloud table 2 to be used as predictors in the rf foliage biomass model none of the inventoried trees on the training plots appendix a table a1 and only four trees 0 04 trees on the assessment plots had an estimated crown projected area smaller than 1 m2 besides that all trees were at least 10 cm of dbh therefore segments with a crown area smaller than 1 m2 or with crown height lower than 1 37 m were removed from the segmentation crown height was defined by the 99th percentile of return height table 2 3 1 2 crown level foliage biomass estimation tree crown foliage biomass kg was estimated for each itc segment through rf modeling using the randomforest package in r breiman 2001 liaw and wiener 2002 r core team 2021 the methodology was adapted from rocha et al 2023 and the processing steps are summarized as follows the detailed description is reported in appendix a the rf was trained using as the response variable foliage biomass estimated through allometric equations for each measured tree included in the inventory dataset and using as predictor variables the crown attributes derived from the als data appendix a section 2 2 itc segmentation was first performed on the als data covering each tree inventory plot appendix a section 2 2 1 the individual tree records from the inventory dataset were then matched to itc segments by minimizing a distance metric computed in a multi dimensional space appendix a section 2 2 2 as a result a total of 404 itc segments were successfully linked to individual tree records and were used for training the rf model following rocha et al 2023 the most important predictors for the rf model were selected based on the correlation between the variables and the model improvement ratio mir a standardized measure of variable importance evans and murphy 2018 silva et al 2017 the rf model was run in regression mode and the number of random trees was set to 1000 the number of predictors considered at each node split was set at the default p 3 in the randomforest package where p is the number of variables included in the model appendix a section 2 2 3 once the rf model was trained foliage biomass was predicted for each crown delineated within the three study sites 3 1 3 annual tree leaf litter production annual tree crown leaf litterfall i e the amount of foliage biomass annually shed by the tree kg m 2 yr 1 was estimated as a fraction of the crown foliage biomass determined by the expected leaf turnover rate he et al 2012 reinhardt 2003 tupek et al 2015 white et al 2000 1 l i f b i l t r i c p a i where l i kg m 2 yr 1 is the annual tree leaf litterfall for tree crown i f b i kg is the estimated foliage biomass for the tree crown i l t r i yr 1 is the leaf turnover rate associated with crown i and c p a i is the crown projected area m2 leaf turnover rate ltr is the expected proportion of the foliage biomass that annually falls from a tree it depends on tree species and environmental factors with deciduous trees shedding the full foliage every year whereas evergreen species retain a fraction of the foliage based on species light temperature water and nutrient availability holder 2000 jonasson 1989 kudo 1992 miyaji et al 1997 thomas and stoddart 1980 since als data do not identify tree species l t r i was assigned to each crown based on the forest type map fig 3 as the inverse of the expected leaf longevity of the dominant species holder 2000 schoettle et al 1994 white et al 2000 in particular the longleaf slash pine group was the dominant forest type fig 3 holder 2000 reported large variability in needle lifespan of slash pine 1 28 1 95 years and longleaf pine 0 58 2 49 years gholz et al 1985 reported increases in needlefall with stand age up to 15 years coinciding with the maximum of foliage biomass gholz and fisher 1982 and a decline of litterfall in old stands that parallels litter production based on these studies we attributed higher ltr lower lifespan to slash and longleaf pine at eglin afb ltr 0 58 yr 1 i e leaf life span 1 7 yr than onf and php l t r i 0 45 yr 1 i e leaf life span 2 2 yr where stands were structurally more mature appendix a table a1 and a2 l t r i for each tree crown i was assigned based on the raster cell i e pixel of the forest type map intersecting their centroid if a tree crown was delineated on a pixel classified as non forest l t r i was set to the predominant longleaf slash pine forest type table 3 finally the tree crown leaf litterfall estimates were rasterized at 5 m spatial resolution which approximates the size of the dominant tree crown in this ecosystem loudermilk et al 2011 to account for the dispersion of litterfall from the tree due to wind a convolution filter with a 3 3 kernel size was applied to the 5 m rasterized map higher litter accumulation is observed under or near tree crowns and litter mass tends to decrease significantly 4 m from gap edges brockway and w outcalt 1998 therefore making the conservative assumption that litter will mostly remain near each tree we assigned a higher weight 2 3 to the focal pixel center cell of the matrix and distributed the remaining 1 3 uniformly among the remaining eight pixels resulting in the following kernel matrix 2 k 1 24 1 24 1 24 1 24 2 3 1 24 1 24 1 24 1 24 in the final map litterfall was estimated at each pixel location as 3 l x f j 1 9 k j l j where l x f is the final value of the tree leaf litter production in pixel x k j is the value of the kernel at location j in the 3 3 window and l j is the tree leaf litterfall estimated from the rasterization of eq 1 at location j in the 3 3 window centered on pixel x 3 2 tree leaf litter accumulation model in this second step we quantify tree leaf litter accumulation through a spatially explicit implementation of the olson 1963 litter accumulation model using as model parameters the raster annual tree litterfall map section 3 1 decomposition rates estimated from modis actual evapotranspiration data aet fig 4 gholz et al 2000 senay and kagone 2019 and the number of years since the last fire ysf compiled from fire history records fig 5 the olson model is defined by two main parameters the annual litter production l and the decomposition rate k and can be easily modified to consider litter that might remain unburnt after fire birk and simpson 1980 zazali et al 2020 4 b t

expressed as 5 b s s l k the olson equation is an accumulation model well suited for stand level and landscape analysis but in the original formulation eq 4 it does not account for spatial

location x and t x 0 is the time of the last known fire at each location eq 6 was used to estimate the biomass accumulation over the three study sites with the relevant parameters set as follows l x the annual litter production rate is obtained from eq 3 as the output of the annual litter production model section 3 1 k x the decomposition rate was estimated as a function of aet through the regression model by gholz et al 2000 developed as part of the long term intersite decomposition experiment lidet lidet was a litter bag experiment that studied decomposition trends in several species across different sites in north and central america representing a wide variety of natural and managed ecosystems and climates and provided species specific equations for the decomposition rate our sites are dominated by pine species where needles are the dominant leaf tissue this litter has a larger lignin content and a smaller leaf specific area so the decomposition rate is expected to be slower compared to deciduous dominated areas the decomposition equation used was the linear model for pine leaves gholz et al 2000 7 k x 0 0139 0 0003 a e t x where a e t x is the average annual evapotranspiration at the location x calculated from the modis aet product section 2 2 4 resampled to 5 m resolution t x 0 the time of last fire was provided by the fire history records being t x 0 the year of last fire at locations where no fires were recorded within the timeframe covered by the fire records i e no fire since 1972 at eglin afb nor since 1996 at php we assumed that the steady state accumulation was reached b x o litter at time t x o i e litter remaining unburnt after last fire in this case it is based on the post fire litter samples collected at eglin afb within the frame of the rxcadre project ottmar et al 2015 a constant value b 0 0 04 kg m 2 was used in all cases 3 3 accuracy assessment the accuracy of the model was evaluated at two different levels pixel and area each comparing model estimates of tree leaf litter biomass with field measurements of litter biomass collected over the past two decades in the three study sites section 2 2 6 the year of the last fire was known at the time of the data collection so the litter accumulation model eq 6 was re run for each required ysf 3 3 1 pixel level assessment we assessed the accuracy of the model at the pixel level by comparing litter biomass estimated on individual 5 m x 5 m pixels to field measurements with known clip plot geolocations table 1 pixel level assessment was performed at eglin afb and onf where the gps coordinates of the clip plots were known at eglin afb each validation point consisted of a clip plot measurement and the estimated litter biomass of the intersecting pixel of the accumulation map totaling 262 observations 166 from the rxcadre project and 96 from the serdp project at onf the field sampling protocol was designed at a sub pixel level 5 m since twelve clip plots were located within 4 m from a focal tree section 2 2 6 the average of these twelve samples was used as the observed field litter biomass at the location of each focal tree fig 6 and the intersecting pixel as the estimated litter biomass value resulting in 72 pixel level observations the precision of the predictions was evaluated by computing the root mean square difference rmsd 8 r m s d i 1 n y i y i 2 n where n is the number of pixel level measurements y i is the field litter biomass kg m 2 measured for pixel i and y i is the litter biomass kg m 2 predicted in pixel i the accuracy of the predictions was evaluated by computing the bias 9 b i a s 1 n i 1 n y i y i note that litter samples collected at onf only included litter from pine needles while our predictions accounted for all trees detected in the als data the percentage of foliage biomass expected from deciduous trees was calculated from the tree inventory data using allometric equations appendix a table a3 resulting in a residual 1 1 that was considered negligible 3 3 2 area level assessment we also assessed the accuracy of the model at a raster multi pixel level hereinafter area level assessment in this case litter areas enclosing several field litter clip plots were defined and the average of the litter biomass measurements collected from the clip plots was compared to the average predicted litter biomass computed from all the pixels intersecting the perimeter of the litter area area level assessment was performed at php and eglin afb using the litter biomass field measurements collected during the rxcadre project note that the field sampling protocols at eglin afb in 2015 and at onf in 2022 were designed at pixel and sub pixel levels 5 m and hence were excluded from the area level assessment at eglin afb 9 litter areas enclosing the 262 field litter clip plots were manually delineated around the clusters of the clip plots collected for the rxcadre project hudak et al 2015 hudak and bright 2014 these litter clip plots were systematically placed within sub units or along parallel transects at regular intervals defining a specific sampling extent section 2 2 6 the delineated extent ranged from 0 09 to 2 4 ha except for a larger defined litter area in the l2f unit 72 4 ha that was delineated over the three parallel transects distributed at 100 m intervals over half of the management unit fig 7 at php the litter areas consisted of the 24 research units 0 12 ha in which litter was collected between 2006 and 2020 fig 8 these areas were variously sampled at 1 6 ysf therefore a total of 68 replicates research unit per ysf were used for model assessment the precision and accuracy of the predictions at the area level were again evaluated by computing rmsd and bias using eqs 8 and 9 with y i being the average litter biomass collected from the clip plots for each defined litter area i and y i being the average predicted litter biomass from all the pixels of the litter accumulation map intersecting the perimeter of litter area i litter samples used for model assessment at php only included litter from pine needles around 12 of biomass within the a units would correspond to deciduous trees 1 on the b units and 9 on the c units for model assessment on a and c units we subtracted this percentage from the predicted litter average y i the accuracy of the model was assessed in additional longleaf pine dominated forests of the north american coastal plain where field litter biomass measurements with known ysf and collocated with als data were available these additional sites were jerc georgia ttrs florida ft stewart georgia and ft jackson south carolina appendix b figure b1 for a full description of the extended model assessment including the field sampling protocols model parametrization for each site and accuracy assessment refer to appendix b 4 results 4 1 tree leaf litter production the percentage of variance explained by the rf model trained to predict tree crown foliage biomass was 57 7 the crown attributes selected as predictors in order of importance based on the mean decrease in accuracy were crad 39 0 cbh 28 8 h25th 28 0 hvar 27 5 cds 17 6 and cl 15 6 in bold in table 2 estimated average foliage biomass was 0 31 kg m 2 at eglin afb 0 26 kg m 2 at php and 0 57 kg m 2 at onf fig 9 exemplifies the foliage biomass estimated per crown and the resulting litter production maps for the three locations a b and c at php the average annual tree leaf litter production estimated with our crown based model was 0 18 kg m 2 yr 1 at eglin afb 0 11 kg m 2 yr 1 at php and 0 26 kg m 2 yr 1 at onf fig 10 4 2 tree leaf litter accumulation predicted average decomposition k at eglin afb was 0 21 yr 1 at php was 0 33 yr 1 and at onf was 0 40 yr 1 there was a large spatial variability in decomposition rates within eglin afb reflecting a e t x ranging by an order of magnitude from 0 05 to 0 46 yr 1 across this largest study site fig 4 accordingly the time necessary to reach 95 of the steady state of litter accumulation based on the olson model at eglin afb averaged 16 years while at php it was 9 years and at onf it was 7 years average predicted surface tree leaf litter in 2015 at eglin afb was 0 39 kg m 2 in 2019 at php was 0 27 kg m 2 and in 2022 at onf was 0 44 kgm 2 fig 11 higher values result from the larger proportion of the area that is not frequently burned fig 12 shows the estimated litter accumulation per time since fire for each of the study sites 4 3 model assessment 4 3 1 pixel level assessment rmsd and bias were 0 21 and 0 01 kg m 2 and the r pearson correlation between predicted y i and observed y i values was 0 51 fig 13 table 4 at eglin afb rmsd of estimated litter loads was relatively similar compared to the two validation datasets table 4 litter loads were underestimated compared to the rxcadre measurements bias 0 06 kg m 2 and to a lesser degree overestimated compared to the serdp measurements bias 0 02 kg m 2 fig 13 table 4 this pattern was expected since tree leaf litter was not separated from other tissue such as bark during the rxcadre field data collection table 1 at onf the rmsd was only slightly worse than at eglin afb but litter loads were more positively biased rmsd 0 21 kg m 2 bias 0 14 kg m 2 due mostly to the large overestimation at the unburned control units tables 4 and 5 summarized by ysf the contribution of the unburned units at onf to the overall overestimation of litter loads is more apparent table 5 4 3 2 area level assessment at the area based level rmsd and bias were 0 09 and 0 01 kg m 2 and the r pearson correlation between predicted y i and observed y i values was 0 73 fig 14 table 6 by site rmsd and bias were 0 09 and 0 05 kg m 2 at eglin afb and 0 09 and 0 02 kg m 2 at php at php precision rmsd was better at the c unit than at the a or b units while accuracy bias was better at the b and c units than at the a unit table 6 predicted litter loads were in good agreement with field measured loads when stratified by ysf as shown by the low observed bias up to the 6 years since fire table 7 the r pearson correlation between predicted y i and observed y i values was high r 0 75 at 2 and 3 ysf and moderate in all the other cases r 0 40 note that the number of clip plots and litter areas available for evaluation decreases with ysf 5 discussion our newly developed modeling approach was successful for estimating spatially and temporally explicitly leaf litter accumulation and distribution mainly driven by tree foliage biomass and time since the last fire previous studies already showed a relationship between litter loads and overlying tree foliage and or time since last disturbance bright et al 2022 dunn and bailey 2015 eskelson and monleon 2018 hudak et al 2016 lydersen et al 2015 stevens rumann et al 2020 for instance hudak et al 2016 reported high correlation between surface fuel loads als canopy related variables and ysf at eglin afb also bright et al 2022 predicted surface fuels with als data showing a non linear accumulation pattern as is described by the olson model the bright et al 2022 study was conducted on the kaibab plateau of arizona and another study by boisramé et al 2022 spanned the entire western u s where fire return intervals are slower decadal yet the functional form of the relationship to ysf is the same we demonstrated in this study that canopy litter inputs and ysf are two major drivers of accumulation in fire maintained longleaf pine forests of the southeastern us especially during the first few years following fire we also demonstrated that the proposed model based on tree crown objects derived from als data provides a means to characterize spatially explicit litterfall patterns and the discontinuity of the litter layer conditioned on the overstory such that the resulting heterogeneity matches field observations fairly well our leaf litter accumulation estimates showed a significantly low bias up to 4 ysf which suggest that the litterfall inputs included on the spatially explicit implementation of the olson model were within the expected range our annual litter production averages 0 11 0 26 kg m 2 yr 1 were lower than published measurements obtained with field traps in similar forest regions which generally ranged from 0 3 to 0 6 kg m 2 yr 1 depending on species maturity and site index e g gholz et al 1985 gresham 1982 haywood et al 1995 wiegert and monk 1972 however it should be noted that our estimates are averaged over large areas including gaps and low tree canopy cover so they are not directly comparable with measurements collected through field traps which are typically placed in points with high tree canopy cover our explicit consideration of discontinuity in surface fuelbed development is a central contribution of our study furthermore the moderate to high correlation between predicted and observed litter biomass loads tables 4 7 is notable considering the high local heterogeneity on the forest floor table 1 and the difference in size between the litter clip plots 0 09 1 m2 and the raster pixel size of the leaf litter accumulation map 25 m2 our results also indicate that the lack of individual tree species maps for the entire extent of the study sites was a significant source of uncertainty the 30 m resolution forest group map was too coarse to fully characterize the variability of the forest composition at the study sites especially given the localized extents of our assembled calibration datasets for instance the larger discrepancies between observed and predicted values in the a research units compared to the b and c units at php could be explained by the higher proportion of shortleaf pines in unit a whereas the forest type group map fig 3 indicates that the longleaf slash group is the prevalent type the availability of individual tree species maps would also facilitate further development of the proposed model allowing for the characterization of litter structure for instance longleaf pine trees tend to create an aerated fuel bed of needles some suspended in the herbaceous and shrub understory vegetation whereas shortleaf pine needles are much more likely to accumulate densely on the forest floor reid and robertson 2012 data fusion between als and high resolution optical data are promising avenues for the generation of wall to wall tree species maps ferreira et al 2020 hartling et al 2019 mäyrä et al 2021 shi et al 2018 and it will be investigated in the context of future improvements to the proposed model furthermore year to year studies of needlefall and leaf lifespan in pine forests show that litter production is not a steady process in time or space e g gholz et al 1985 holder 2000 liu et al 2004 wiegert and monk 1972 holder 2000 studied the leaf lifespan of longleaf and slash pines in five locations in the southeastern us and reported large plasticity especially in longleaf pine 0 58 2 49 years compared to slash pine s range of 1 28 1 95 years wiegert and monk 1972 studied litterfall dynamics in three forest stands of longleaf pine of different ages 7 11 and 13 years they observed that approximately 50 of the needles were recovered as litterfall each year but there was variability among sites ranging from 29 in the 7 year to 86 in the 11 year stands climate and weather variability could induce periods of stress in which foliage production slows down and or litterfall is promoted due to nutrient deficits and sudden events e g hurricanes windstorms insect infestations or crown scorch from previous fire besides this our litter distribution approach based on the convolution filter assumes that litter mostly remains under the tree canopy and evenly disperses to neighboring cells however both prevailing winds and topographic slope could cause anisotropic patterns of accumulation fire regimes induce changes in decomposer activity by affecting fungal and microbial communities brennan et al 2009 butler et al 2019 dao et al 2022 fox et al 2022 hopkins et al 2020 semenova nelsen et al 2019 but the pathways linking these processes are still poorly understood impacts could differ under the presence of fire adapted organisms or under different fire intensities hopkins et al 2020 butler et al 2019 reported faster microbial decomposition on unburned treatments compared to sites burnt every 2 and 4 years however they also indicated that invertebrate activity compensated for the microbial depletion to inhibit decomposition in these frequently burnt areas semenova nelsen et al 2019 reported a 6 5 11 and 13 difference in litter mass loss after 3 6 and 9 months following fire on litter samples collected in recently burned and less recently burned longleaf pine forest previous measurements at the stoddard fire plots at ttrs in the organic matter turnover was more than twice as high in unburned than in the frequently burned 1 3 year interval plots godwin et al 2017 we speculate that changes in decomposition might also explain some of the patterns observed in our results for instance field data collected at php shows a decrease in litter accumulation after 3 ysf table 1 the field samples were not geolocated within the research units and the number of samples with ysf 3 was low such that this trend could be attributed to undersampling however this result and the overestimation of litter loads in the 4 ysf and unburnt units at onf do suggest an increase in decomposition rate after a few years since fire the development of deeper litter and eventually duff layers could absorb more moisture and promote more microbial activity and microbial communities presumably become increasingly established in the litter and duff layer with time since fire semenova nelsen et al 2019 therefore a two or multi phase litter decomposition model as opposed to the one phase used in our implementation of the olson model might improve the estimates of litter loads with increasing time since fire harmon et al 2009 zazali et al 2020 given the short return interval of prescribed fires in the ecosystems studied information on the complete fuel life cycle including consumption during fires decomposition between fires and resulting fuel loads at time of fire is important to better predict fuel load dynamics over multiple fire intervals the olson model as originally proposed assumed that litter was not initially present on the forest floor in contrast empirical studies report that a significant proportion of litter as much as half remains unburned especially after prescribed fires hudak et al 2020 ottmar et al 2015 reid et al 2012 while we accounted for unburned biomass we used a constant b 0 value based on post fire litter samples collected at eglin afb during the rxcadre project ottmar et al 2015 ottmar and restaino 2014 this constant value might explain the lower correlation between predicted and observed values in the first year after fire compared to the second and third year even though the average values were similar table 7 future research will investigate whether the fraction of unburned litter could also be mapped either through monitoring the fire behavior and assessing fuel consumption using tools such as thermal remote sensing data or investigating whether local fuel consumption may be driven by the same tree clustering patterns that determine the heterogeneity imposed by our spatially explicit model the above limitations notwithstanding the results demonstrate that the proposed model is able to generate spatially and temporally explicit estimates of tree litter fuel load accumulation in environments subject to frequent surface fires at 5 m resolution and annual time steps such information is currently missing for most forested sites previously proposed methods including ecological based models and data driven techniques do not account for the spatial and temporal variability of the litter bed collating input litterfall information through traditional field sampling methods is time consuming and expensive and it does not provide wall to wall information the use of als data and new techniques of image segmentation to estimate expected litterfall rates at the tree crown level largely overcomes this limitation our model also outperforms empirical data driven approaches that use surface fuel data for training models e g bright et al 2022 lydersen et al 2015 the transferability of those models is limited by the amount of data required to represent the tremendous heterogeneity of fuels keane 2015 2008 keane et al 2013 2012 2001 keane and gray 2013 in contrast our model did not require litter biomass measurements rather we estimated foliage biomass using tree inventory data which is more widely available and easier to collect it is less prone to undersampling and it is more consistent between sites as a result our model is transferable among coastal plain longleaf pine forests as demonstrated by the consistency of the results at all evaluated sites including other sites in the extended model assessment appendix b the workflow can also be adjusted to sites dominated by different tree species and environmental conditions our approach can provide annually updated maps of litter loads to forest managers many available products providing information on surface fuels are static maps based on fuelbed or vegetation types e g those derived from the fuel characteristics classification system fccs by incorporating fire history maps we assert that litter loads can be dynamically updated on an annual basis 6 conclusions this model illustrates a novel yet simple methodology to quantify the spatially explicit litter loads in longleaf pine forests in the southeastern us that are managed using frequent prescribed fires our goal and achievement were twofold first we leveraged our understanding of the litter accumulation process combining traditional ecological based modeling with up to date machine learning and remote sensing techniques for wall to wall mapping of litter fuels over relatively large areas second we demonstrated that aboveground biomass and ysf are the two major drivers of tree leaf litter accumulation in these fire maintained longleaf pine forests especially during the first years following fire therefore spatially explicit information on these two parameters could be sufficient for a generalized characterization of the accumulation process in a heterogeneous manner that reflects overstory canopy controls on surface fuel accumulation this methodology provides realistic estimates of litter fuels and where als is available partially resolves the challenge of wall to wall mapping of the highly heterogeneous distribution of litter over the forest floor therefore the model overcomes many of the spatial limitations of traditional ecological landscape models and current data driven modeling approaches this integrated modeling approach is a step toward meeting the greater challenge of characterizing spatial patterns of multiple fuel components including duff woody debris herbs and shrubs at high spatial resolution that better matches the fine scales at which wildland fuel beds vary where other modeling approaches may fail to provide the resolution and accuracy managers need models such as presented in this study can fill the information gap these maps will improve decision making involving
