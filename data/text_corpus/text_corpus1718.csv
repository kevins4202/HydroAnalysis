8590,increased urbanization and increased observed precipitation intensity and frequency due to climate change call for urban hydrological models capable of describing urban flow dynamics in data scarce areas a parameter parsimonious rainfall runoff model dddurban forced by precipitation and temperature in which most model parameters are estimated from a detailed digital elevation model using gis or taken from the literature is presented snowmelt and evapotranspiration are calculated using an energy balance approach with proxy models for the energy balance elements driven by temperature and precipitation the model focusses on subsurface and surface flow processes using an analysis of travel time distributions which indicates that the shape of the urban hydrograph is largely independent of the comparatively very rapid process of water transport in conduits the model uses an estimate of the distribution of subsurface velocities as a function of saturation the study shows that the calibrated mean of this distribution agrees with the saturated hydraulic conductivity estimated from infiltration measurements the model has been calibrated and validated on observed runoff data at a 10 min temporal resolution for two norwegian catchments in oslo and trondheim with acceptable validation results measured by the kling gupta efficiency criterion kge 0 56 0 69 simulations show that precipitation infiltrated on permeable areas contributes on average to the total flow at a fraction corresponding to the areal fraction of permeable areas in addition simulations show that for saturated conditions a significant part 30 60 of the flood peak is derived from saturation excess overland flow simulation of snowmelt indicates that a more detailed model for the spatial distribution of snow accounting for snow removal is needed the catchment scale effects of low impact developments in the form of 10 m2 raingardens are simulated in a residential area with 500 houses 60 raingardens can reduce the flood peaks about 10 a higher number of raingardens further reduce the flood peaks but raingardens of too low capacity may increase secondary flood peaks for episodes of multiple heavy precipitation events keywords parsimonious urban rainfall runoff models saturation excess overland flow subsurface flow in urban environments low impact development raingardens 1 introduction understanding the hydrological response to intense rainfall in urban areas is of paramount importance as both increased levels of urbanisation fletcher et al 2013 salvadore et al 2015 and higher observed short term rainfall intensities in recent years hanssen bauer et al 2017 exert increased pressure on urban runoff systems quantifying urban hydrological response is a significant challenge however due to the highly dynamic nature of the urban infrastructure and to a relative lack of long term monitoring of runoff processes in built up areas the locations of roads and buildings and the drainage networks serving them can change rapidly in time leading to non stationarity in data series used for quantifying the hydrological response bayazit 2015 in addition in many urban areas the only available runoff data are discharge series from combined css sewer systems in which both wastewater and stormwater flows are combined leading to a high degree of uncertainty when these data are used for hydrological analyses simultaneously many green solutions for coping with increased stormflow by implementing low impact developments lids such as green roofs and rain gardens represent strategies that are of an explicitly hydrological character their effectiveness and cost benefit can only be assessed to a reasonable degree of certainty if their potential role in mitigating the urban response to intense rainfall can be reliably quantified there is therefore a clear need for robust tools for modelling the urban hydrological regime that can be applied under conditions of limited data availability current approaches used in practise for urban hydrological analyses include a spectrum of strategies ranging from simple methods that transform a rainfall intensity or hyetograph into a stormflow response such as a peak flow rate to complex urban hydrological models that invoke more physically based processes and storages with the goal of creating a simulated runoff timeseries an example of the first of these two approaches is the rational method grimaldi and petroselli 2014 while both swmm rossmann and huber 2016 and mouse dhi 2017 mike 2020 are examples of urban hydrological models whereas the simple methods have the clear advantage of having minimal data requirements important processes linked to subsurface flow are not physically represented nor is the overall water balance before and after events fully characterised in the analysis the contribution of subsurface flow to urban runoff has been debated in the literature and is an important knowledge gap elliott and trowsdale 2007 fletcher et al 2013 salvadore et al 2015 several authors however have reported significant contributions from subsurface flow to both runoff volumes and dynamics belhadj et al 1995 berthier et al 2004 hailegeorgis and alfredsen 2018 broekhuizen et al 2019 in addition to subsurface flow evapotranspiration in urban areas is considered important for mitigating the effect of anthropogenic heat and knowledge regarding its efficacy is imperative for closing the urban water balance fletcher et al 2013 in order to simulate a realistic partitioning of overland and subsurface flow losses due to evapotranspiration between rainfall events are also required therefore for assessing the potential benefits of many lid strategies in attenuating or reducing urban stormflow models that account for subsurface flows and evapotranspiration including their overall role in the water balance are needed urban hydrological models such as mouse and swmm usually include schemes for characterising subsurface processes and losses due to evapotranspiration simultaneously the models have a large number of parameters in the equations characterising these processes and these parameters must be either calibrated or fixed using for example previously reported values found in the literature in mouse applications for example a classic conceptual model nam gustafsson 1992 is used for runoff generation and routing from permeable areas in urban catchments nam is a hydrological model with linear reservoirs describing both rapid and delayed runoff processes as well as a scheme for accounting for evapotranspiration the nam model has however 15 parameters in the equations describing these processes these parameters are of a conceptual nature and are difficult to associate with measurable physical properties and therefore must be determined via model calibration in swmm subsurface processes are modelled using a two zone saturated and unsaturated zones groundwater model and 13 parameters must be determined to implement the groundwater model in addition several different infiltration schemes are available within swmm each of which introduces a set of parameters similarly the urban hydrological model presented by hailegeorgis and alfredsen 2018 requires values for 43 parameters most of which must be determined from calibration against observed runoff although the need for model parameter calibration is not unique to urban hydrological modelling the relative paucity of reliable long term series for urban catchments leads to a high degree of uncertainty in the calibrated models in addition a problem that can plague all models with a large number of conceptual parameters is the issue of equifinality in that a range of possible combinations of parameters can produce the same runoff results beven and binley 1992 kirchner 2006 model overparameterization can make it difficult to identify the dominant physical processes controlling the runoff response and to diagnose model errors and is especially problematic when data for model calibration are scarce kirchner 2006 over the years various approaches and strategies for modelling hydrological processes in data sparse catchments have been developed primarily for natural non urban catchments e g blöschl et al 2013 a principal goal of such approaches is to reduce the number of parameters that require calibration by simplifying or refining process descriptions and by incorporating other data sources that can be used to either set or eliminate model parameters one can reduce model complexity and associated data requirements by first identifying processes and pathways that dominate the runoff response for the problem of interest e g in this case the urban hydrological response to intense rainfall based on characteristic length and timescales for a relevant model application see salvadore et al 2015 and references therein processes that vary over much shorter or longer length or timescales relative to those that dominate the problem of interest can often be either entirely neglected or set to fixed values using other data the distance distribution dynamics model ddd skaugen and onof 2014 skaugen and mengistu 2016 is an example of a parameter parsimonious rainfall runoff model developed for natural catchments that has also been previously extended to ungauged natural catchments skaugen et al 2015 including at high temporal 1 hour resolution tsegaw et al 2019 the ddd model has been developed following the principle of replacing process descriptions requiring long timeseries for calibration with alternative descriptions with parameters that can be estimated from other types of data in the ungauged applications mentioned above the model has 7 process parameters that are regionalised based on catchment properties in the current version of the model 5 of these process parameters have been replaced by process descriptions without parameters in need of calibration given the successful application of the ddd model to predicting runoff at high temporal resolution its further extension to runoff in urban areas which requires an even higher temporal resolution e g 10 min is potentially feasible given the need for reliable models for both assessing urban stormflow response and evaluating hydrologically based mitigation strategies the main objectives of this study are 1 to investigate if the physically based parameter parsimonious ddd model can be further developed for urban hydrological applications 2 to assess the relative importance of the subsurface processes and evapotranspiration in the urban landscape using the developed model 3 to apply the model to evaluate the catchment scale mitigating effects of distributed rain gardens e g elliott and trowsdale 2007 eckart et al 2017 in reducing peak flows 2 study area and data in order to demonstrate and validate the water balance approach used in this study we use urban catchments where high temporal resolution measurements of water in and water out of the catchment are available thereby giving a reasonable level of control on the water balance in addition detailed digital elevation models dem and information of land use are needed two catchments in norway were accordingly chosen for this study fig 1 a catchment in trondheim at risvollan ris and a catchment in oslo at grefsen kjelsås gk all simulations are carried out at a 10 min temporal resolution the ris catchment is situated 4 km southeast of the city centre of trondheim and is a research catchment of the norwegian university of science and technology ntnu the catchment has a separate system for stormwater and sewage and the catchment size is 0 18 km2 with an elevation range of 82 129 masl the area is mostly residential and fractions of impermeable roads and roofs and permeable areas are 0 49 and 0 51 respectively the fractional area of roofs is 0 13 and 1500 residents are registered in this catchment matheussen 2004 the catchment has been the subject of many research projects in urban hydrology see dalen et al 2016 and references therein and hailegeorgis and alfredsen h a 2018 used this catchment for assessing their urban hydrological model the results from h a 2018 will herein be compared with results from our work the grefsen kjelsås gk catchment is situated about 5 km northeast of the city centre of oslo the catchment has a combined stormwater sewage system a catchment size of 0 3 km2 and an elevation range of 170 188 masl the area is mostly residential with impermeable permeable fractions of 0 27 and 0 73 respectively about 500 houses and 1080 residents are registered in this catchment pers com bjørn christoffersen oslo municipality according to sivertsen and bomo 2016 freshwater consumption in norway per person is on average 140 l day in addition we include a 30 leakage from the water supply ssb 2017 total wastewater per person including leakage is hence 182 l day note however that these numbers represent national averages and may not be representative for this specific catchment runoff i e stormflow in ris and css flux in gk from the two catchments are measured by the norwegian water resources and energy directorate nve ris and by oslo municipality gk the records lengths vary significantly nve has measured flow at ris since 1986 though not continuously and the installation of the station was motivated by a need for continuous measurements of urban runoff including winter periods we use four time series from ris ris1 1993 1 1 00 00 1994 10 4 15 20 ris2 1994 10 12 15 50 1997 7 25 18 50 ris3 1997 7 28 11 00 1997 9 23 07 20 and ris4 1997 11 18 16 00 1998 8 31 23 20 ris3 is used for model calibration and the other time series for validation measurements at gk were carried out as a campaign over a short period and only data for june november 2010 are available this time series is split into two gk1 2010 9 1 00 00 2010 8 31 23 50 and gk2 2010 9 1 00 00 2010 11 15 12 20 gk2 is used for calibration and gk1 for validation at ris runoff precipitation and temperature are measured at the runoff gauging station precipitation data for gk measured about 100 m from the outlet are provided by measurements from oslo municipality and temperature data are from the norwegian meteorological institute located about 3 km north west at an elevation of 94 masl i e somewhat lower than the gk catchment and at lower temporal resolution 1 hr than the runoff and precipitation data in this study we use two datasets from the national common database fkb with roads and buildings and the national areal resources database ar5 landcover dataset from nibio nibio 2019 for gk we use a hybrid dem with 0 5 m resolution containing buildings and roads provided by the municipality of oslo blom 2014 pbe 2014 for ris we use a dem with 2 m resolution downloaded from the norwegian dem data repository https www kartverket no data hoydedata og terrengmodeller the 2 m resolution dem required pre processing to remove spurious data we use the fkb datasets to generate a data layer representing the impermeable surfaces and ar5 class landcover data to generate the data layer representing the permeable surfaces using a toolkit for drainage networks available in grass gis jasiewicz and metz 2011 we generate gis layers containing flow direction and flow accumulation distance to outlet and the urban catchment boundaries based on the analysis of the upslope contributing area suggested by di leo and di stefano 2013 we estimate the optimal contributing area ca for the extraction of the river networks 3 methods 3 1 distance distributions in the urban landscape in this study we consider two possible urban landscape classes permeable p and impermeable ip surfaces see fig 1 impermeable areas ip are areas classified as roofs and roads and all other areas are classified as permeable p using gis analysis we derive the distribution of distances dds between points in the landscape and the closest reach of the river network this dd is derived for each landscape class i e permeable and impermeable fig 2 illustrates how the dd s are computed the dds hence describes the configurations of the landscape classes with respect to the river network the dd is an important model component as it partitions travel times between the slower rates of flow in the landscape and the relatively rapid flow rates in the river network in the absence of a natural river network in the urban landscape the network of conduits for stormwater and sewage which are sometimes combined css represent the river i e rapid flow network in the case of insufficient information as to the structure of this network we apply a gis tool such as the multiple flow algorithm to create a surrogate flow network holmgren 1994 ehlschlaeger 1989 we hereafter refer to the network of conduits or the river network as the river network from previous work skaugen and onof 2014 the shape of the different dds has been shown to be exponential for distances between points in the catchment and the river network and normal for distances measured in the river network to the downstream outlet the gis analysis provides parameters a mean distance for exponential distributions and the mean and standard deviation for normal distributions of the dds the dd of a generic raingarden area 10 m2 2 2 4 4 m is approximated by a normal distribution and is similarly to the dds for the landscape classes the distribution of distances from points in the raingarden to the river network fig 3 shows boxplots of the dds for the landscape classes river network and raingarden for the two catchments 3 2 water velocities in the urban landscape for natural catchments velocities of subsurface and overland flow can be determined from a recession analysis see skaugen and mengistu 2016 in which high and low runoff are assumed to reflect high and low subsurface saturation states and velocities respectively however experience indicates that observed runoff from csss is not suitable for such analysis since amongst other issues the presence of wastewater disturbs the recession signal as an alternative we have a used overland flow velocities for p and ip from the literature b used observed velocities from conduits and c calibrated the subsurface velocities observed saturated hydraulic conductivities from infiltration measurements by solheim 2017 at gk and muthanna et al 2018 at ris serve as a validation for the calibrated subsurface velocities the distribution of subsurface velocities corresponding to different levels of subsurface saturation is assumed to follow a two parameter gamma distribution following skaugen and mengistu 2016 they define a recession characteristic λ from observed runoff series i e 1 λ log q t log q t δ t where q is the observed runoff and δ t is the temporal resolution of the observed series a gamma distribution is then fitted to the empirical distribution of λ the recession characteristic is related to the velocity v by skaugen and onof 2014 2 v λ d δ t where d is the mean of the dd input to dddurban is the shape gsh and scale gsc parameter of the gamma distributed recession characteristic λ eq 1 subsurface velocities are estimated from these parameters according to a procedure described in skaugen and onof 2014 table 1 lists the various velocities and the characteristic distance and time scales associated with the different flows for the study catchments gk and ris we observe that the transport of water in the conduits is not resolved using a 10 min temporal resolution and that the temporal resolution of infiltration is highly uncertain the velocity of infiltration is low but the distances are short whereas the velocity of flow through conduits is high but the transport distance is long in fig 4 we have illustrated this point by plotting travel time distributions for the processes that have a distribution of distances we can measure infiltration is not such a process and its inclusion in table 1 above is for illustrative purposes the travel time distributions are derived from randomly drawn distances from their respective distance distributions divided by the characteristic velocity of the process certainly the processes also have a temporal distribution of velocities but in the figure as in the proposed model velocity is a constant for each process fig 4 illustrates the temporal scale of the processes compared to that of the model resolution and we see that travel times in the river network are resolved within one timestep whereas the other processes are resolved in many timesteps 3 3 dddurban the model structure dddurban models runoff dynamics snow and evapotranspiration separately for the landscape classes p and ip see fig 1 the simulated runoff generation of the landscape classes is coupled together with the river network through the dds the dds form the basis for the runoff dynamics and with estimated water velocities provide the shape and scale of the unit hydrographs uhs used to distribute the water in time to the river network the subsurface and overland flows in dddurban use five uhs in parallel they all have the same shape derived from the same dd but have different temporal scales that are determined by differences in water velocity as a function of subsurface saturation the five uhs one for overland flow and four for the subsurface constitute the subsurface saturation layers with a given specific capacity and velocity the specific capacity is derived according to skaugen and mengistu 2016 and considers the capacity of subsurface storage at steady state conditions the routing of water in the river network itself is carried out in the same manner as above i e the dd of distances between points in the river network to the outlet together with the water velocity in the conduits constitute a uh that distributes the water entering the river network to the outlet as a function of time the main difference between dddurban and the original ddd model is that infiltration capacity is explicitly modelled for the different landscape classes for p areas the infiltration capacity is equal to the mean subsurface water velocity 5 3 10 5 m s corresponds to 3 2 mm minute which is an extremely high precipitation intensity and close to the idf estimate for the 50 year return period at oslo https klimaservicesenter no faces desktop idf xhtml overland flow occurs for these landscape classes if the capacity of the subsurface is exceeded i e saturation overland flow dunne and black 1970 and presumably more seldom if the infiltration capacity is exceeded for ip on the other hand the infiltration capacity is set very low although it is not set to zero as streets covered with asphalt may have some infiltration ramier et al 2011 fletcher et al 2013 the subsurface contribution to flow from ip areas is nevertheless negligible and runoff from ip areas consists mainly of overland flow when water infiltrates i e the rainfall intensity is less than the infiltration capacity the subsurface is filled up from the base layer upward so that the slower i e lower layers of the subsurface are the first to get saturated the velocity of the subsurface flow and level of saturation is therefore a monotonically increasing function the function is however non linear due to the superposition of the uhs having different time scales skaugen and mengistu 2016 introduced a procedure for estimating the capacity of the subsurface based on the mean annual runoff mad and a uh derived from the dd and the estimated mean velocity an estimate of the mean subsurface storage can be obtained the capacity of the subsurface is estimated as the 99 quantile of the temporal distribution of the subsurface storage in addition one can estimate the capacity of the different subsurface layers through the temporal distribution of saturation see skaugen and mengistu 2016 for a more detailed description table 2 provides an overview of the dddurban model parameters their description and method of estimation although there are many model parameters most of them can be determined independently of model calibration calibrated parameters are shown in bold face in table 2 3 4 raingardens low impact developments lids such as raingardens for stormwater retention represent important strategies for urban flood mitigation the city of oslo as well as other norwegian cities have adopted the so called stormwater 3 step approach s3sa lindholm et al 2008 as the main instrument for developing sustainable urban drainage systems that incorporate lids the three steps in this approach are 1 to handle low intensity precipitation locally at site through infiltration becker et al 2016 solheim 2017 2 to delay rainfall with higher intensities as long as possible through infiltration and attenuation using for example raingardens wet or dry ponds or constructed wetlands and 3 to transport overflow and excess surface runoff after heavy rainfall using dedicated secure flow pathways an algorithm for a generic raingarden has been developed for the dddurban so that the potential effect and benefit of this type of lid can be evaluated the design of the raingarden is derived from the studies of raingardens in norway undertaken by paus and braskerud 2013 and dalen et al 2012 the geometric shape of the raingarden is a rectangle with the length being twice the width i e 2 2 4 4 m the filter medium s depth is 1 m its porosity is 50 and its saturated hydraulic conductivity is 3 10 5 m s see table 1 paus and braskerud 2013 dalen et al 2012 from experience and empirical formulations paus and braskerud 2013 recommend a ratio between the size of a raingarden and the ip area to be 0 07 7 which implies that given the size of the raingarden proposed above 10 m2 every 140 m2 of ip area needs a raingarden if this measure is to be effective hence if we specify the fraction of the total ip area to be managed by a raingarden we obtain the number of raingardens with specifications as above the raingarden is located on p areas which is reduced accordingly and flow generated from the specified fraction of ip areas is routed to the raingardens the raingarden is drained at a bottom corner and the drained water is further transported by the river network the dd for such a raingarden is estimated simply by calculating the possible distance from a grid over the raingarden to the corner see fig 3 for the dd of a raingarden the size of 10 m2 we see from fig 4 that the raingarden has a significant distribution of the input in time and has hence the capacity to delay water compared to runoff from impermeable surfaces 3 5 snow snowmelt and evapotranspiration dddurban uses procedures for the spatial distribution of snow and for snowmelt from skaugen and weltzien 2016 and skaugen et al 2018 respectively the model for snow accumulation and melt is an energy balance approach and is forced by precipitation and temperature proxy modelling simulates the different energy balance elements a new model development in this study is to use the simulated energy balance elements to simulate potential evapotranspiration using the priestly taylor relation priestly and taylor 1972 weiβ

v and λ v is the latent heat pf vaporization and r n is the net radiation and calculated as r n sw net l a l t where sw net is the net shortwave radiation and l a and l t are the atmospheric and terrestrial longwave radiation respectively the parameter α is a lumped representation of the turbulent fluxes and is equal to α 1 26 for humid areas weiβ and mentzel 2008 actual evapotranspiration e a is the evaporation potential scaled non linearly by the amount of water in the subsurface 4 e a m i n e p e p 1 exp 4 m d z g m where m is the capacity of the subsurface d is the deficit z is the soil moisture and g is the precipitation snowmelt the non linearity of actual evapotranspiration as a function of the degree of soil saturation has previously been proposed by chanzy and bruckler 1993 and arnell 2002 p50 4 results dddurban was calibrated using the timeseries gk2 and ris3 and validated on the remaining time series only two parameters gsh and gsc were calibrated and all other model parameters were either determined from gis or the literature see table 2 dddurban is coded in julia https julialang org and the kling gupta efficiency criterion kge gupta et al 2009 kling et al 2012 was optimized using the global optimization package blackboxoptim https github com jbrea blackboxoptim jl the kge ranges from 1 for a perfect simulation to minus infinity and assesses the errors in the mean bias and the bias in the variance in addition to the correlation between observed and simulated values the widely used nash sutcliffe efficiency criterion nash and sutcliffe 1970 only assesses the correlation and other factors such as the bias must be assessed using separate criteria during the calibration in addition due to the differing definitions of these two criteria their scores are not directly comparable knoben et al 2019 fig 5 shows examples of simulated and observed time series for gk a and ris b to achieve a suitable calibration at gk we had to increase the wastewater contribution significantly since the reported number of residents 1080 and their estimated daily water use of 180 l day only gives a total wastewater runoff of 0 002 m3 s this amount does not correspond to the dry weather runoff which is measured to be about 0 006 m3 s this discrepancy of 0 004 m3 s has also been observed by oslo municipality and cannot be explained by the estimated water use or by the local hydrology the reason for this discrepancy may be a significant water leakage into the system unknown industrial discharge or simply measurement errors we observe that the simulated runoff is in good agreement with the observed runoff for both catchments runoff from both p areas and ip areas contribute to a good agreement in the timing and the level of the peak flows between simulated and observed runoff although the runoff volume during peak flow appears to come mostly from ip areas table 3 shows the kge skill scores for calibration ris3 and gk2 and validation high values of kge were obtained for ris3 and gk2 and lower values for the validation periods we note that flow from permeable areas makes a steady contribution to the total flow corresponding on average to the fraction of permeable area for gk we also observe that the actual evapotranspiration drops significantly from the summer months to gk1 to autumn gk2 but is on average a substantial element of the water balance the simulated annual actual evapotranspiration at ris for the years 1995 and 1996 is 196 mm and 200 mm respectively these estimates cannot be verified against observed data at the catchment scale but are in good agreement with the long term 1983 2012 mean of actual evapotranspiration of 204 mm year estimated for an area of 9 km2 which comprises ris by a gridded rainfall runoff model using a penman monteith formulation and gridded meteorological input huang et al 2019 4 1 saturation excess overland flow in fig 6 we observe that for prolonged but not necessarily very intense precipitation events at ris the contribution from the p areas suddenly becomes flashy 30th of january 1997 fig 6 a and 30th of march 1997 fig 6 b fig 7 shows the saturation deficit for the same time period as in fig 6 and illustrates that for these flashy events the deficit becomes zero i e the subsurface is filled to capacity and additional precipitation is routed to the river network as overland flow the flood peak late march 1997 figs 6 and 7 b is the highest peak on record for ris in the period 1993 1998 although this peak is not simulated particularly well we see that runoff from the impermeable areas alone is not sufficient to explain the observed flood peak additional quick runoff is needed these are examples of the flood generating process termed saturation excess overland flow dunne and black 1970 in fig 8 we have plotted the hydrograph and precipitation together with the relative contribution of runoff from p and ip areas for two events at ris 30th of january 1997 a b and 8th of june 1995 c d in fig 8 b we see that at peak flow the contribution of runoff from p areas is about 30 40 of the peak flow and almost 60 for the second peak whereas for fig 8d the runoff contribution from the p areas at peak flow is very small these results emphasize that flood generating processes in urban areas include overland flow from permeable areas and that models need to include subsurface processes in permeable areas in order to simulate the dynamics of saturation and their contribution to peak flows 4 2 snow and snowmelt fig 9 shows an example of observed and simulated runoff during the snowmelt season at ris the blue line in the bottom panel shows simulated snow water equivalent swe and we see that the model simulates the observed diurnal variations in runoff due to snowmelt while swe 0 the first half of the melting season seems adequately simulated but the model does not fully capture the reduction in melting intensity at mid melting season the accumulated volumes of simulated and observed snowmelt appear to be in reasonable agreement but the melt out in the model is too early it must be noted that changes in the spatial distribution of snow caused by the snow removal clearly most important for the roads i e the ip areas have not been accounted for in dddurban 4 3 calibrated subsurface velocities table 4 shows the calibrated values of gsh and gsc together with the corresponding estimates of mean subsurface velocity we apply eq 2 and the mean λ is estimated as gsh gsc the calibrated mean velocities for gk and ris are quite similar and the calibrated velocity at gk is close to the saturated hydraulic conductivity measured by solheim 2017 using a double ring infiltrometer the calibrated velocity for ris is in the range of measured saturated conductivity reported by muthanna et al 2018 although the values in the study of muthanna et al 2018 vary considerably i e by an order of magnitude 1 5 10 6 5 5 10 5 m s these results nevertheless suggest that carefully measured saturated hydraulic conductivity may serve as an estimate of the mean subsurface velocity that can be used in the model and hence make the model less dependent on calibration 4 4 comparison with hailegeorgis and alfredsen 2018 the model of h a 2018 was calibrated for different time periods summer s and autumn a from ris and was then used to investigate how well the calibrated parameter set performed for times series not used in the calibration i e a model validation the time periods used for validation in h a 2018 are within the validation periods in this study and table 5 compares the nash sutcliffe efficiency criterion nse of h a 2018 and dddurban the average performance of dddurban is slightly better but the comparison is not straightforward in that when calibrating the dddurban we optimized kge not nse which does not penalize bias 4 5 modelling the effect of raingardens lids at the catchment scale we tested the model for raingardens at gk by assuming that 10 30 and 50 of the ip area is managed by raingardens fig 10 fig 10b shows the reduction in peak flows for the six significant peaks seen in fig 10 a fig 10a also shows the effect of 30 of the ip area managed by raingardens by comparing a simulation using 177 raingardens with a simulation without raingardens the raingardens effectively delay the runoff that would otherwise be rapid runoff from ip areas in fig 10 b we see that for raingardens with a depth of 1 m there is a significant reduction in peak flow even with relatively few raingardens and the reduction increases with the number of raingardens if however we reduce the depth of the raingarden to 0 5 m there is an increase in peak flow for precipitation events that follow the first event closely this is because the raingardens are filled to capacity during the first event and produce overland flow during the subsequent precipitation event this overland flow comes in addition to the delayed response of the raingardens from the first event this result highlights the importance of including antecedent moisture conditions in the design of lids 5 discussion as stated in the introduction a tool for assessing urban hydrology at data scarce sites is needed and this poses problems that are similar to those encountered when predicting runoff at ungauged sites see blӧschl et al 2013 on theory for prediction in ungauged basins pub in this respect it is interesting to study the sensitivity of the two parameters calibrated for dddurban in this study and evaluate the errors if these parameters were to be estimated without model calibration the sensitivity of the shape and scale gsh and gsc of the gamma distributed subsurface velocity was therefore tested by keeping the product gsh gsc constant but varying gsh and gsc correspondingly between 0 5 and 3 0 this corresponds to the case in which we have an estimate of the mean subsurface velocity from infiltration measurements or some other source but need to fix the shape and scale parameters of the gamma distribution for the simulation fig 11 shows for ris3 how the kge criterion and the subsurface capacity m change with the shape parameter of the velocity distribution kge values are acceptable for all the simulations but are clearly best for gsh values above 2 0 the effect of changing the shape parameter of the distribution on the subsurface capacity m is quite dramatic in that m for gsh 3 0 is reduced by more than 50 compared to that for gsh 0 5 this could have consequences for the number of times the catchment in subject to overland flow from the permeable areas but we see that m stays relatively constant for gsh values above 2 0 an important set of model parameters that is determined somewhat subjectively control the density of the gis derived river network we have used grass gis in this analysis and this tool suggests a value for the contributing upslope area ca necessary to initiate channelised flow the proposed value is the minimum area required for the derived flow accumulation https grass osgeo org grass78 manuals addons r threshold html however a different ca can be chosen and the larger the ca the less dense the corresponding river network in dddurban the choice of a ca value and the subsequent configuration of the river network is very important since it determines the dds and hence the subsurface velocities subsurface reservoir capacity frequency of overland flow from permeable areas and evapotranspiration we have calibrated dddurban at gk for different river networks different cas and table 6 shows the effects on kge calibrated velocities subsurface reservoir mean distance for p areas and subsurface reservoir capacity m we see from table 6 that the choice of ca has an impact on performance kge and the estimated physical properties of the catchment with generally longer travel distances for higher ca less rivers the velocity of subsurface water has to increase in order to match the observed runoff dynamics the reservoir capacity increases as an inverse function of the subsurface velocity as described in skaugen and mengistu 2016 the ca suggested by grass gis appears to work well at both gk ca 10000 m2 and ris ca 500 m2 for gk the kge value is slightly better for higher ca than ca 10000 perhaps at the cost of unrealistic subsurface velocities further investigation on why the suggested ca appears to work well at these sites and the possible dependence of the procedure on the spatial resolution of dems needs to be carried out the sensitivity analysis of the gamma parameters of the subsurface velocity distribution and the ca are promising for the potential for applying the model at data scarce sites further investigation on how dddurban performs at fully ungauged sites will be a topic for future work the simple analysis of the travel time distributions of the relevant flow processes at gk was conducted in order to distinguish those processes that have a temporal resolution that is adequately described given the time step used in the model simulations see table 1 and fig 4 the analysis indicates that infiltration and the flow transport in pipes are very quick processes that are not resolved by a model time step of 10 min and hence do not contribute to the shape of the simulated hydrographs the travel time analysis is simple but illustrates that the hydrological dynamics of urban catchments are largely determined by water transport on surfaces and in the subsurface and that simple routing schemes for the transport of water in the pipes probably suffice saturation excess overland flow appears to be an important flood generating process also in urban areas having zones of permeable surfaces and highlights the importance of modelling the dynamics of the subsurface processes the two examples analysed in figs 6 and 7 show that runoff from impermeable areas do not suffice to create the observed peaks and quick runoff from some other source is needed in dddurban this additional quick runoff is contributed by overland flow generated from permeable areas that become saturated this seems very plausible for this environment and gives confidence in the model structure i e the calibrated velocities determine the subsurface capacity which again enables flood generating processes such as saturation excess overland flow urban hydrological models such as swmm can incorporate various infiltration models green ampt and horton see rossmann and huber 2016 so that flood generating processes such as infiltration excess overland flow can be modelled from the results presented in this study we find that at least in the studied area extreme precipitation intensities are needed for such a process to take place in dddurban and that saturation excess overland flow appears to be a more important process to incorporate in urban hydrological models testing dddurban at sites where the precipitation intensity is more likely to be higher than the infiltration capacity hence enabling infiltration excess overland flow needs further investigation in norway snow hydrology remains important also in urban areas there are many uncertainties associated with the modelling of snow accumulation and melt the spatial distribution of snow for example has a particularly significant impact on the timing and dynamics of snowmelt essery and pomeroy 2004 changes in the spatial distribution of snow through snow removal on roads and snow on roofs exposed to drifting call for a more detailed model of snow accumulation and melt in urban catchments see matheussen 2004 in this study the parameterisation of the snow distribution for the ris simulations is based that for a natural catchment in the trondheim region whether this is the sole reason for the failure in the timing of snowmelt is not clear but there is clearly a potential for improvements in this component of dddurban if it is to be used in snow rich areas our dddurban simulations indicate that at least for the two study catchments considered all of the precipitation that falls within the catchment boundaries finds its way to the conduits or is evaporated the water balance in gk is uncertain and standard water use and simulated runoff are less than the flow volume measured in the conduits if rainfall is somehow was lost in the catchment due to unknown pathways we would expect the simulated runoff together with water use to be higher than what is measured in the conduits at ris the water balance seems reasonable in that simulated and observed runoff are almost identical for three out of four periods no correction of the observed precipitation input has been carried out in the simulations and the evapotranspiration routine has no calibrated parameters however actual evapotranspiration is of course a function of subsurface storage at any point in time and this capacity is indirectly calibrated through the calibrated velocities skaugen and mengistu 2016 i e the parameters gsc and gsh that all non evaporated water appears in the conduits implies that lateral subsurface flow enters the conduits through cracks in the pipes and possibly via subsurface drainage systems around buildings that are often coupled to the sewer or stormwater networks the intention of the combined sewage stormwater network is to transport only wastewater and possibly runoff from impermeable areas to water treatment plants and water that infiltrates is in principle not supposed to challenge the capacity of these facilities this study indicates however that infiltrated subsurface water is a significant part of the urban water budget in many areas i e the subsurface water storage is dynamic and dedicated pathways for these fluxes are also needed the comparison of skill scores for dddurban and the model of h a 2018 for the validation periods in table 5 shows that dddurban performs better both on average and for 3 out of 5 time periods the time periods of validation are very short 1 2 days excepting the fourth period which is 4 months in length the brevity of the time periods means that the comparison is uncertain the model of h a 2018 is distributed and highly complex and simulates many processes assumed to be relevant for urban hydrology such as infiltration excess depression storages and two way flow between subsurface storage and the urban drainage network the model of h a 2018 performs quite well in calibration producing nse values ranging between 0 65 and 0 94 for the validation periods however the nse values ranged between 0 46 0 81 for the fourth longer period the calibrated nse of h a 2018 was 0 76 whereas for the validation the nse ranged between 0 23 and 0 81 using the different parameter sets for this period dddurban obtained nse 0 69 such a discrepancy between skill scores for calibration and validation periods suggests a lack of robustness in the model that can be associated with overparameterization kirchner 2006 dddurban only has two parameters to calibrate and we see from table 3 where the validations are performed for timeseries of some length that the variability in the skill scores for the validation periods is quite low the catchment scale effect of lids raingardens has been tested and hence addresses some of the unresolved questions put forward by elliott and trowsdale 2007 and more recently by eckart et al 2017 they highlight the need for investigating the scaled up effect of lids from lot to catchment and regional scales in fig 10 we can see that even a quite modest use of raingardens 60 raingardens in a neighbourhood of 500 houses attenuates the investigated flood peaks by about 10 which may make a difference in the number of overflows of wastewater to sensitive recipients in addition by varying the number of raingardens and their specifications the implementation of the lid module in dddurban provides a tool for planning see eckart et al 2017 and more specifically enables quantifying the effect of step 2 in the s3sa such lids may be more cost effective for mitigating the effect of increased peak flows due to urbanization than increasing the capacity of the urban drainage network unofficial figures suggest a cost of 10 k per raingarden and 4 k per meter for the installation of pipes pers com b braskerud at oslo municipality the cost for 60 raingardens hence is equivalent to the cost of only 150 m of new pipes the possible adverse effects of under designed raingardens is however of concern such measures are designed to delay runoff and if a subsequent intense rainfall event occurs before the delayed runoff for an initial event is attenuated the flood peak can actually be larger than that it would be if the raingardens were not present 6 conclusions a parameter parsimonious rainfall runoff model dddurban has been developed for applications in urban hydrology the model aims at being useful in evaluating and quantifying the important runoff processes in an urban catchment and to be used in the design and planning of lids at the catchment scale this study shows that water infiltrated on permeable areas subsurface flows contribute on average to the flow measured in the conduits at a fraction equal to the fraction of permeable areas in addition when permeable areas are saturated overland flow from permeable areas makes a significant contribution 30 60 to the flood peak evapotranspiration is a significant part of the urban water budget and its estimates by dddurban for ris are in good agreement with the estimated long term mean by huang et al 2019 for this area skill scores kge for dddurban for the validation time series are acceptable ranging from 0 56 to 0 69 and are on average better than those reported in a previous study of hailegeorgis and alfredsen 2018 where a more complex urban hydrological models has been applied most of dddurban parameters are determined from a detailed dem by gis and from the literature only two parameters which describe the velocity of subsurface flow for different levels of saturation are calibrated against observed runoff the calibrated parameters are in agreement with measurements of saturated hydraulic conductivity the sensitivity of the dddurban to the choice of upslope contributing area for the gis analysis have been tested and the ca proposed by grass gis was found work well for both gk and ris these results are promising with respect to the potential for deriving model parameters for catchments without flow measurements the effect of raingardens on the catchment scale has been evaluated and significant reductions in flood peaks were found for a relatively modest installation of raingardens if every 8th house installs a raingarden flood peaks would be reduced by about 10 dependent on the capacity of the raingarden if the raingarden is under designed however flow peaks may increase for heavy rainfall

gis or taken from the literature is presented snowmelt and evapotranspiration are calculated using an energy balance approach with proxy models for the energy balance elements driven by temperature and precipitation the model focusses on subsurface and surface flow processes using an analysis of travel time distributions which indicates that the shape of the urban hydrograph is largely

show that precipitation infiltrated on permeable areas contributes on average to the total flow at a fraction corresponding to the areal fraction of permeable areas in addition simulations show that

multiple heavy precipitation events keywords parsimonious urban rainfall runoff models saturation excess overland flow subsurface flow in urban environments low impact development raingardens 1 introduction understanding the hydrological response to intense rainfall in urban areas is of paramount importance as both increased levels of urbanisation fletcher et al 2013 salvadore et al 2015 and higher observed short term rainfall intensities in recent years hanssen bauer et al 2017 exert increased pressure on urban runoff systems quantifying urban hydrological response is a significant challenge however due to the highly dynamic nature of the urban infrastructure and to a relative lack of long term monitoring of runoff processes in built up areas the locations of roads and buildings and the drainage networks serving them can change rapidly in time leading to non stationarity in data series used for quantifying the hydrological response bayazit 2015 in addition in many urban areas the only available runoff data are discharge series from combined css sewer systems in which both wastewater and stormwater flows are combined leading to a high degree of uncertainty when these data are used for hydrological analyses simultaneously many green solutions for coping with increased stormflow by implementing low impact developments lids such as green roofs and rain gardens represent strategies that are of an explicitly hydrological character their effectiveness and cost benefit can only be assessed to a reasonable degree of certainty if their potential role in mitigating the urban response to intense rainfall can be reliably quantified there is therefore a clear need for robust tools for modelling the urban hydrological regime that can be applied under conditions of limited data availability current approaches used in practise for urban hydrological analyses include a spectrum of strategies ranging from simple methods that transform a rainfall intensity or hyetograph into a stormflow response such as a peak flow rate to complex urban hydrological models that invoke more physically based processes and storages with the goal of creating a simulated runoff timeseries an example of the first of these two approaches is the rational method grimaldi and petroselli 2014 while both swmm rossmann and huber 2016 and mouse dhi 2017 mike 2020 are examples of urban hydrological models whereas the simple methods have the clear advantage of having minimal data requirements important processes linked to subsurface flow are not physically represented nor is the overall water balance before and after events fully characterised in the analysis the contribution of subsurface flow to urban runoff has been debated in the literature and is an important knowledge gap elliott and trowsdale 2007 fletcher et al 2013 salvadore et al 2015 several authors however have reported significant contributions from subsurface flow to both runoff volumes and dynamics belhadj et al 1995 berthier et al 2004 hailegeorgis and alfredsen 2018 broekhuizen et al 2019 in addition to subsurface flow evapotranspiration in urban areas is considered important for mitigating the effect of anthropogenic heat and knowledge regarding its efficacy is imperative for closing the urban water balance fletcher et al 2013 in order to simulate a realistic partitioning of overland and subsurface flow losses due to evapotranspiration between rainfall events are also required therefore for assessing the potential benefits of many lid strategies in attenuating or reducing urban stormflow models that account for subsurface flows and evapotranspiration including their overall role in the water balance are needed urban hydrological models such as mouse and swmm usually include schemes for characterising subsurface processes and losses due to evapotranspiration simultaneously the models have a large number of parameters in the equations characterising these processes and these parameters must be either calibrated or fixed using for example previously reported values found in the literature in mouse applications for example a classic conceptual model nam gustafsson 1992 is used for runoff generation and routing from permeable areas in urban catchments nam is a hydrological model with linear reservoirs describing both rapid and delayed runoff processes as well as a scheme for accounting for evapotranspiration the nam model has however 15 parameters in the equations describing these processes these parameters are of a conceptual nature and are difficult to associate with measurable physical properties and therefore must be determined via model calibration in swmm subsurface processes are modelled using a two zone saturated and unsaturated zones groundwater model and 13 parameters must be determined to implement the groundwater model in addition several different infiltration schemes are available within swmm each of which introduces a set of parameters similarly the urban hydrological model presented by hailegeorgis and alfredsen 2018 requires values for 43 parameters most of which must be determined from calibration against observed runoff although the need for model parameter calibration is not unique to urban hydrological modelling the relative paucity of reliable long term series for urban catchments leads to a high degree of uncertainty in the calibrated models in addition a problem that can plague all models with a large number of conceptual parameters is the issue of equifinality in that a range of possible combinations of parameters can produce the same runoff results beven and binley 1992 kirchner 2006 model overparameterization can make it difficult to identify the dominant physical processes controlling the runoff response and to diagnose model errors and is especially problematic when data for model calibration are scarce kirchner 2006 over the years various approaches and strategies for modelling hydrological processes in data sparse catchments have been developed primarily for natural non urban catchments e g blöschl et al 2013 a principal goal of such approaches is to reduce the number of parameters that require calibration by simplifying or refining process descriptions and by incorporating other data sources that can be used to either set or eliminate model parameters one can reduce model complexity and associated data requirements by first identifying processes and pathways that dominate the runoff response for the problem of interest e g in this case the urban hydrological response to intense rainfall based on characteristic length and timescales for a relevant model application see salvadore et al 2015 and references therein processes that vary over much shorter or longer length or timescales relative to those that dominate the problem of interest can often be either entirely neglected or set to fixed values using other data the distance distribution dynamics model ddd skaugen and onof 2014 skaugen and mengistu 2016 is an example of a parameter parsimonious rainfall runoff model developed for natural catchments that has also been previously extended to ungauged natural catchments skaugen et al 2015 including at high temporal 1 hour resolution tsegaw et al 2019 the ddd model has been developed following the principle of replacing process descriptions requiring long timeseries for calibration with alternative descriptions with parameters that can be estimated from other types of data in the ungauged applications mentioned above the model has 7 process parameters that are regionalised based on catchment properties in the current version of the model 5 of these process parameters have been replaced by process descriptions without parameters in need of calibration given the successful application of the ddd model to predicting runoff at high temporal resolution its further extension to runoff in urban areas which requires an even higher temporal resolution e g 10 min is potentially feasible given the need for reliable models for both assessing urban stormflow response and evaluating hydrologically based mitigation strategies the main objectives of this study are 1 to investigate if the physically based parameter parsimonious ddd model can be further developed for urban hydrological applications 2 to assess the relative importance of the subsurface processes and evapotranspiration in the urban landscape using the developed model 3 to apply the model to evaluate the catchment scale mitigating effects of distributed rain gardens e g elliott and trowsdale 2007 eckart et al 2017 in reducing peak flows 2 study area and data in order to demonstrate and validate the water balance approach used in this study we use urban catchments where high temporal resolution measurements of water in and water out of the catchment are available thereby giving a reasonable level of control on the water balance in addition detailed digital elevation models dem and information of land use are needed two catchments in norway were accordingly chosen for this study fig 1 a catchment in trondheim at risvollan ris and a catchment in oslo at grefsen kjelsås gk all simulations are carried out at a 10 min temporal resolution the ris catchment is situated 4 km southeast of the city centre of trondheim and is a research catchment of the norwegian university of science and technology ntnu the catchment has a separate system for stormwater and sewage and the catchment size is 0 18 km2 with an elevation range of 82 129 masl the area is mostly residential and fractions of impermeable roads and roofs and permeable areas are 0 49 and 0 51 respectively the fractional area of roofs is 0 13 and 1500 residents are registered in this catchment matheussen 2004 the catchment has been the subject of many research projects in urban hydrology see dalen et al 2016 and references therein and hailegeorgis and alfredsen h a 2018 used this catchment for assessing their urban hydrological model the results from h a 2018 will herein be compared with results from our work the grefsen kjelsås gk catchment is situated about 5 km northeast of the city centre of oslo the catchment has a combined stormwater sewage system a catchment size of 0 3 km2 and an elevation range of 170 188 masl the area is mostly residential with impermeable permeable fractions of 0 27 and 0 73 respectively about 500 houses and 1080 residents are registered in this catchment pers com bjørn christoffersen oslo municipality according to sivertsen and bomo 2016 freshwater consumption in norway per person is on average 140 l day in addition we include a 30 leakage from the water supply ssb 2017 total wastewater per person including leakage is hence 182 l day note however that these numbers represent national averages and may not be representative for this specific catchment runoff i e stormflow in ris and css flux in gk from the two catchments are measured by the norwegian water resources and energy directorate nve ris and by oslo municipality gk the records lengths vary significantly nve has measured flow at ris since 1986 though not continuously and the installation of the station was motivated by a need for continuous measurements of urban runoff including winter periods we use four time series from ris ris1 1993 1 1 00 00 1994 10 4 15 20 ris2 1994 10 12 15 50 1997 7 25 18 50 ris3 1997 7 28 11 00 1997 9 23 07 20 and ris4 1997 11 18 16 00 1998 8 31 23 20 ris3 is used for model calibration and the other time series for validation measurements at gk were carried out as a campaign over a short period and only data for june november 2010 are available this time series is split into two gk1 2010 9 1 00 00 2010 8 31 23

for gk measured about 100 m from the outlet are provided by measurements from oslo municipality and temperature data are from the norwegian meteorological institute located about 3 km north west at an elevation of 94 masl i e somewhat lower than the gk catchment and at lower temporal resolution 1 hr than the runoff and precipitation data in this study we use two datasets from the national common database fkb with roads and buildings and the national areal resources database ar5 landcover dataset from nibio nibio 2019 for gk we use a hybrid dem with 0 5 m resolution containing buildings and roads provided by the municipality of oslo blom 2014 pbe 2014 for ris we use a dem with 2 m resolution downloaded from the norwegian dem data repository https www kartverket no data hoydedata og terrengmodeller the 2 m resolution dem required pre processing to remove spurious data we use the fkb datasets to generate a data layer representing the impermeable surfaces and ar5 class landcover data to generate the data layer representing the permeable surfaces using a toolkit for drainage networks available in grass gis jasiewicz and metz 2011 we generate gis layers containing flow direction and flow accumulation distance to outlet and the urban catchment boundaries based on the analysis of the upslope contributing area suggested by di leo and di stefano 2013 we estimate the optimal contributing area ca for the extraction of the river networks 3 methods 3 1 distance distributions in the urban landscape in this study we consider two possible urban landscape classes permeable p and impermeable ip surfaces see fig 1 impermeable areas ip are areas classified as roofs and roads and all other areas are classified as permeable p using gis analysis we derive the distribution of distances dds between points in the landscape and the closest reach of the river network this dd is derived for each landscape class i e permeable and impermeable fig 2 illustrates how the dd s are computed the dds hence describes the configurations of the landscape classes with respect to the river network the dd is an important model component as it partitions travel times between the slower rates of flow in the landscape and the relatively rapid flow rates in the river network in the absence of a natural river network in the urban landscape the network of conduits for stormwater and sewage which are sometimes combined css represent the river i e rapid flow network in the case of insufficient information as to the structure of this network we apply a gis tool such as the multiple flow algorithm to create a surrogate flow network holmgren 1994 ehlschlaeger 1989 we hereafter refer to the network of conduits or the river network as the river network from previous work skaugen and onof 2014 the shape of the different dds has been shown to be exponential for distances between points in the catchment and the river network and normal for distances measured in the river network to the downstream outlet the gis analysis provides parameters a mean distance for exponential distributions and the mean and standard deviation for normal distributions of the dds the dd of a generic raingarden area 10 m2 2 2 4 4 m is approximated by a normal distribution and is similarly to the dds for the landscape classes the distribution of distances from points in the raingarden to the river network fig 3 shows boxplots of the dds for the landscape classes river network and raingarden for the two catchments 3 2 water velocities in the urban landscape for natural catchments velocities of subsurface and overland flow can be determined from a recession analysis see skaugen and mengistu 2016 in which high and low runoff are assumed to reflect high and low subsurface saturation states and velocities respectively however experience indicates that observed runoff from csss is not suitable for such analysis since amongst other issues the presence of wastewater disturbs the recession signal as an alternative we have a used overland flow velocities for p and ip from the literature b used observed velocities from conduits and c calibrated the subsurface velocities observed saturated hydraulic conductivities from infiltration measurements by solheim 2017 at gk and muthanna et al 2018 at ris serve as a validation for the calibrated subsurface velocities the distribution of subsurface velocities corresponding to different levels of subsurface saturation is assumed to follow a two parameter gamma distribution following skaugen and mengistu 2016 they define a recession characteristic λ from observed runoff series i e 1 λ log q t log q t δ t where q is the observed runoff and δ t is the temporal resolution of the observed series a gamma distribution is then fitted to the empirical distribution of λ the recession characteristic is related to the velocity v by skaugen and onof 2014 2 v λ d δ t where d is the mean of the dd input to dddurban is the shape gsh and scale gsc parameter of the gamma distributed recession characteristic λ eq 1 subsurface velocities are estimated from these parameters according to a procedure described in skaugen and onof 2014 table 1 lists the various velocities and the characteristic distance and time scales associated with the different flows for the study catchments gk and ris we observe that the transport of water in the conduits is not resolved using a 10 min temporal resolution and that the temporal resolution of infiltration is highly uncertain the velocity of infiltration is low but the distances are short whereas the velocity of flow through conduits is high but the transport distance is long in fig 4 we have illustrated this point by plotting travel time distributions for the processes that have a distribution of distances we can measure infiltration is not such a process and its inclusion in table 1 above is for illustrative purposes the travel time distributions are derived from randomly drawn distances from their respective distance distributions divided by the characteristic velocity of the process certainly the processes also have a temporal distribution of velocities but in the figure as in the proposed model velocity is a constant for each process fig 4 illustrates the temporal scale of the processes compared to that of the model resolution and we see that travel times in the river network are resolved within one timestep whereas the other processes are resolved in many timesteps 3 3 dddurban the model structure dddurban models runoff dynamics snow and evapotranspiration separately for the landscape classes p and ip see fig 1 the simulated runoff generation of the landscape classes is coupled together with the river network through the dds the dds form the basis for the runoff dynamics and with estimated water velocities provide the shape and scale of the unit hydrographs uhs used to distribute the water in time to the river network the subsurface and overland flows in dddurban use five uhs in parallel they all have the same shape derived from the same dd but have different temporal scales that are determined by differences in water velocity as a function of subsurface saturation the five uhs one for overland flow and four for the subsurface constitute the subsurface saturation layers with a given specific capacity and velocity the specific capacity is derived according to skaugen and mengistu 2016 and considers the capacity of subsurface storage at steady state conditions the routing of water in the river network itself is carried out in the same manner as above i e the dd of distances between points in the river network to the outlet together with the water velocity in the conduits constitute a uh that distributes the water entering the river network to the outlet as a function of time the main difference between dddurban and the original ddd model is that infiltration capacity is explicitly modelled for the different landscape classes for p areas the infiltration capacity is equal to the mean subsurface water velocity 5 3 10 5 m s corresponds to 3 2 mm minute which is an extremely high precipitation intensity and close to the idf estimate for the 50 year return period at oslo https klimaservicesenter no faces desktop idf xhtml overland flow occurs for these landscape classes if the capacity of the subsurface is exceeded i e saturation overland flow dunne and black 1970 and presumably more seldom if the infiltration capacity is exceeded for ip on the other hand the infiltration capacity is set very low although it is not set to zero as streets covered with asphalt may have some infiltration ramier et al 2011 fletcher et al 2013 the subsurface contribution to flow from ip areas is nevertheless negligible and runoff from ip areas consists mainly of overland flow when water infiltrates i e the rainfall intensity is less than the infiltration capacity the subsurface is filled up from the base layer upward so that the slower i e lower layers of the subsurface are the first to get saturated the velocity of the subsurface flow and level of saturation is therefore a monotonically increasing function the function is however non linear due to the superposition of the uhs having different time scales skaugen and mengistu 2016 introduced a procedure for estimating the capacity of the subsurface based on the mean annual runoff mad and a uh derived from the dd and the estimated mean velocity an estimate of the mean subsurface storage can be obtained the capacity of the subsurface is estimated as the 99 quantile of the temporal distribution of the subsurface storage in addition one can estimate the capacity of the different subsurface layers through the temporal distribution of saturation see skaugen and mengistu 2016 for a more detailed description table 2 provides an overview of the dddurban model parameters their description and method of estimation although there are many model parameters most of them can be determined independently of model calibration calibrated parameters are shown in bold face in table 2 3 4 raingardens low impact developments lids such as raingardens for stormwater retention represent important strategies for urban flood mitigation the city of oslo as well as other norwegian cities have adopted the so called stormwater 3 step approach s3sa lindholm et al 2008 as the main instrument for developing sustainable urban drainage systems that incorporate lids the three steps in this approach are 1 to handle low intensity precipitation locally at site through infiltration becker et al 2016 solheim 2017 2 to delay rainfall with higher intensities as long as possible through infiltration and attenuation using for example raingardens wet or dry ponds or constructed wetlands and 3 to transport overflow and excess surface runoff after heavy rainfall using dedicated secure flow pathways an algorithm for a generic raingarden has been developed for the dddurban so that the potential effect and benefit of this type of lid can be evaluated the design of the raingarden is derived from the studies of raingardens in norway undertaken by paus and braskerud 2013 and dalen et al 2012 the geometric shape of the raingarden is a rectangle with the length being twice the width i e 2 2 4 4 m the filter medium s depth is 1 m its porosity is 50 and its saturated hydraulic conductivity is 3 10 5 m s see table 1 paus and braskerud 2013 dalen et al 2012 from experience and empirical formulations paus and braskerud 2013 recommend a ratio between the size of a raingarden and the ip area to be 0 07 7 which implies that given the size of the raingarden proposed above 10 m2 every 140 m2 of ip area needs a raingarden if this measure is to be effective hence if we specify the fraction of the total ip area to be managed by a raingarden we obtain the number of raingardens with specifications as above the raingarden is located on p areas which is reduced accordingly and flow generated from the specified fraction of ip areas is routed to the raingardens the raingarden is drained at a bottom corner and the drained water is further transported by the river network the dd for such a raingarden is estimated simply by calculating the possible distance from a grid over the raingarden to the corner see fig 3 for the dd of a raingarden the size of 10 m2 we see from fig 4 that the raingarden has a significant distribution of the input in time and has hence the capacity to delay water compared to runoff from impermeable surfaces 3 5 snow snowmelt and evapotranspiration dddurban uses procedures for the spatial distribution of snow and for snowmelt from skaugen and weltzien 2016 and skaugen et al 2018 respectively the model for snow accumulation and melt is an energy balance approach and is forced by precipitation and temperature proxy modelling simulates the different energy balance elements a new model development in this study is to use the simulated energy balance elements to simulate potential evapotranspiration using the priestly taylor relation priestly and taylor 1972 weiβ

v and λ v is the latent heat pf vaporization and r n is the net radiation and calculated as r n sw net l a l t where sw net is the net shortwave radiation and l a and l t are the atmospheric and

soil moisture and g is the precipitation snowmelt the non linearity of actual evapotranspiration as a function of the degree of soil saturation has previously been proposed by chanzy and bruckler 1993 and arnell 2002 p50 4 results dddurban was calibrated using the timeseries gk2 and ris3 and validated on the remaining time series only two parameters gsh and gsc were calibrated and all other model parameters were either determined from gis or the literature see table 2 dddurban is coded in julia https julialang org and the kling gupta efficiency criterion kge gupta et al 2009 kling et al 2012 was optimized using the global optimization package blackboxoptim https github com jbrea blackboxoptim jl the kge ranges from 1 for a perfect simulation to minus infinity and assesses the errors in the mean bias and the bias in the variance in addition to the correlation between observed and simulated values the widely used nash sutcliffe efficiency criterion nash and sutcliffe 1970 only assesses the correlation and other factors such as the bias must be assessed using separate criteria during the calibration in addition due to the differing definitions of these two criteria their scores are not directly comparable knoben et al 2019 fig 5 shows examples of simulated and observed time series for gk a and ris b to achieve a suitable calibration at gk we had to increase the wastewater contribution significantly since the reported number of residents 1080 and their estimated daily water use of 180 l day only gives a total wastewater runoff of 0 002 m3 s this amount does not correspond to the dry weather runoff which is measured to be about 0 006 m3 s this discrepancy of 0 004 m3 s has also been observed by oslo municipality and cannot be explained by the estimated water use or by the local hydrology the reason for this discrepancy may be a significant water leakage into the system unknown industrial discharge or simply measurement errors we observe that the simulated runoff is in good agreement with the observed runoff for both catchments runoff from both p areas and ip areas contribute to a good agreement in the timing and the level of the peak flows between simulated and observed runoff although the runoff volume during peak flow appears to come mostly from ip areas table 3 shows the kge skill scores for calibration ris3 and gk2 and validation high values of kge were obtained for ris3 and gk2 and lower values for the validation periods we note that flow from permeable areas makes a steady contribution to the total flow corresponding on average to the fraction of permeable area for gk we also observe that the actual evapotranspiration drops significantly from the summer months to gk1 to autumn gk2 but is on average a substantial element of the water balance the simulated annual actual evapotranspiration at ris for the years 1995 and 1996 is 196 mm and 200 mm respectively these estimates cannot be verified against observed data at the catchment scale but are in good agreement with the long term 1983 2012 mean of actual evapotranspiration of 204 mm year estimated for an area of 9 km2 which comprises ris by a gridded rainfall runoff model using a penman monteith formulation and gridded meteorological input huang et al 2019 4 1 saturation excess overland flow in fig 6 we observe that for prolonged but not necessarily very intense precipitation events at ris the contribution from the p areas suddenly becomes flashy 30th of january 1997 fig 6 a and 30th of march 1997 fig 6 b fig 7 shows the saturation deficit for the same time period as in fig 6 and illustrates that for these flashy events the deficit becomes zero i e the subsurface is filled to capacity and additional precipitation is routed to the river network as overland flow the flood peak late march 1997 figs 6 and 7 b is the highest peak on record for ris in the period 1993 1998 although this peak is not simulated particularly well we see that runoff from the impermeable areas alone is not sufficient to explain the observed flood peak additional quick runoff is needed these are examples of the flood generating process termed saturation excess overland flow dunne and black 1970 in fig 8 we have plotted the hydrograph and precipitation together with the relative contribution of runoff from p and ip areas for two events at ris 30th of january 1997 a b and 8th of june 1995 c d in fig 8 b we see that at peak flow the contribution of runoff from p areas is about 30 40 of the peak flow and almost 60 for the second peak whereas for fig 8d the runoff contribution from the p areas at peak flow is very small these results emphasize that flood generating processes in urban areas include overland flow from permeable areas and that models need to include subsurface processes in permeable areas in order to simulate the dynamics of saturation and their contribution to peak flows 4 2 snow and snowmelt fig 9 shows an example of observed and simulated runoff during the snowmelt season at ris the blue line in the bottom panel shows simulated snow water equivalent swe and we see that the model simulates the observed diurnal variations in runoff due to snowmelt while swe 0 the first half of the melting season seems adequately simulated but the model does not fully capture the reduction in melting intensity at mid melting season the accumulated volumes of simulated and observed snowmelt appear to be in reasonable agreement but the melt out in the model is too early it must be noted that changes in the spatial distribution of snow caused by the snow removal clearly most important for the roads i e the ip areas have not been accounted for in dddurban 4 3 calibrated subsurface velocities table 4 shows the calibrated values of gsh and gsc together with the corresponding estimates of mean subsurface velocity we apply eq 2 and the mean λ is estimated as gsh gsc the calibrated mean velocities for gk and ris are quite similar and the calibrated velocity at gk is close to the saturated hydraulic conductivity measured by solheim 2017 using a double ring infiltrometer the calibrated velocity for ris is in the range of measured saturated conductivity reported by muthanna et al 2018 although the values in the study of muthanna et al 2018 vary considerably i e by an order of magnitude 1 5 10 6 5 5 10 5 m s these results nevertheless suggest that carefully measured saturated hydraulic conductivity may serve as an estimate of the mean subsurface velocity that can be used in the model and hence make the model less dependent on calibration 4 4 comparison with hailegeorgis and alfredsen 2018 the model of h a 2018 was calibrated for different time periods summer s and autumn a from ris and was then used to investigate how well the calibrated parameter set performed for times series not used in the calibration i e a model validation the time periods used for validation in h a 2018 are within the validation periods in this study and table 5 compares the nash sutcliffe efficiency criterion nse of h a 2018 and dddurban the average performance of dddurban is slightly better but the comparison is not straightforward in that when calibrating the dddurban we optimized kge not nse which does not penalize bias 4 5 modelling the effect of raingardens lids at the catchment scale we tested the model for raingardens at gk by assuming that 10 30 and 50 of the ip area is managed by raingardens fig 10 fig 10b shows the reduction in peak flows for the six significant peaks seen in fig 10 a fig 10a also shows the effect of 30 of the ip area managed by raingardens by comparing a simulation using 177 raingardens with a simulation without raingardens the raingardens effectively delay the runoff that would otherwise be rapid runoff from ip areas in fig 10 b we see that for raingardens with a depth of 1 m there is a significant reduction in peak flow even with relatively few raingardens and the reduction increases with the number of raingardens if however we reduce the depth of the raingarden to 0 5 m there is an increase in peak flow for precipitation events that follow the first event closely this is because the raingardens are filled to capacity during the first event and produce overland flow during the subsequent precipitation event this overland flow comes in addition to the delayed response of the raingardens from the first event this result highlights the importance of including antecedent moisture conditions in the design of lids 5 discussion as stated in the introduction a tool for assessing urban hydrology at data scarce sites is needed and this poses problems that are similar to those encountered when predicting runoff at ungauged sites see blӧschl et al 2013 on theory for prediction in ungauged basins pub in this respect it is interesting to study the sensitivity of the two parameters calibrated for dddurban in this study and evaluate the errors if these parameters were to be estimated without model calibration the sensitivity of the shape and scale gsh and gsc of the gamma distributed subsurface velocity was therefore tested by keeping the product gsh gsc constant but varying gsh and gsc correspondingly between 0 5 and 3 0 this corresponds to the case in which we have an estimate of the mean subsurface velocity from infiltration measurements or some other source but need to fix the shape and scale parameters of the gamma distribution for the simulation fig 11 shows for ris3 how the kge criterion and the subsurface capacity m change with the shape parameter of the velocity distribution kge values are acceptable for all the simulations but are clearly best for gsh values above 2 0 the effect of changing the shape parameter of the distribution on the subsurface capacity m is quite dramatic in that m for gsh 3 0 is reduced by more than 50 compared to that for gsh 0 5 this could have consequences for the number of times the catchment in subject to overland flow from the permeable areas but we see that m stays relatively constant for gsh values above 2 0 an important set of model parameters that is determined somewhat subjectively control the density of the gis derived river network we have used grass gis in this analysis and this tool suggests a value for the contributing upslope area ca necessary to initiate channelised flow the proposed value is the minimum area required for the derived flow accumulation https grass osgeo org grass78 manuals addons r threshold html however a different ca can be chosen and the larger the ca the less dense the corresponding river network in dddurban the choice of a ca value and the subsequent configuration of the river network is very important since it determines the dds and hence the subsurface velocities subsurface reservoir capacity frequency of overland flow from permeable areas and evapotranspiration we have calibrated dddurban at gk for different river networks different cas and table 6 shows the effects on kge calibrated velocities subsurface reservoir mean distance for p areas and subsurface reservoir capacity m we see from table 6 that the choice of ca has an impact on performance kge and the estimated physical properties of the catchment with generally longer travel distances for higher ca less rivers the velocity of subsurface water has to increase in order to match the observed runoff dynamics the reservoir capacity increases as an inverse function of the subsurface velocity as described in skaugen and mengistu 2016 the ca suggested by grass gis appears to work well at both gk ca 10000 m2 and ris ca 500 m2 for gk the kge value is slightly better for higher ca than ca 10000 perhaps at the cost of unrealistic subsurface velocities further investigation on why the suggested ca appears to work well at these sites and the possible dependence of the procedure on the spatial resolution of dems needs to be carried out the sensitivity analysis of the gamma parameters of the subsurface velocity distribution and the ca are promising for the potential for applying the model at data scarce sites further investigation on how dddurban performs at fully ungauged sites will be a topic for future work the simple analysis of the travel time distributions of the relevant flow processes at gk was conducted in order to distinguish those processes that have a temporal resolution that is adequately described given the time step used in the model simulations see table 1 and fig 4 the analysis indicates that infiltration and the flow transport in pipes are very quick processes that are not resolved by a model time step of 10 min and hence do not contribute to the shape of the simulated hydrographs the travel time analysis is simple but illustrates that the hydrological dynamics of urban catchments are largely determined by water transport on surfaces and in the subsurface and that simple routing schemes for the transport of water in the pipes probably suffice saturation excess overland flow appears to be an important flood generating process also in urban areas having zones of permeable surfaces and highlights the importance of modelling the dynamics of the subsurface processes the two examples analysed in figs 6 and 7 show that runoff from impermeable areas do not suffice to create the observed peaks and quick runoff from some other source is needed in dddurban this additional quick runoff is contributed by overland flow generated from permeable areas that become saturated this seems very plausible for this environment and gives confidence in the model structure i e the calibrated velocities determine the subsurface capacity which again enables flood generating processes such as saturation excess overland flow urban hydrological models such as swmm can incorporate various infiltration models green ampt and horton see rossmann and huber 2016 so that flood generating processes such as infiltration excess overland flow can be modelled from the results presented in this study we find that at least in the studied area extreme precipitation intensities are needed for such a process to take place in dddurban and that saturation excess overland flow appears to be a more important process to incorporate in urban hydrological models testing dddurban at sites where the precipitation intensity is more likely to be higher than the infiltration capacity hence enabling infiltration excess overland flow needs further investigation in norway snow hydrology remains important also in urban areas there are many uncertainties associated with the modelling of snow accumulation and melt the spatial distribution of snow for example has a particularly significant impact on the timing and dynamics of snowmelt essery and pomeroy 2004 changes in the spatial distribution of snow through snow removal on roads and snow on roofs exposed to drifting call for a more detailed model of snow accumulation and melt in urban catchments see matheussen 2004 in this study the parameterisation of the snow distribution for the ris simulations is based that for a natural catchment in the trondheim region whether this is the sole reason for the failure in the timing of snowmelt is not clear but there is clearly a potential for improvements in this component of dddurban if it is to be used in snow rich areas our dddurban simulations indicate that at least for the two study catchments considered all of the precipitation that falls within the catchment boundaries finds its way to the conduits or is evaporated the water balance in gk is uncertain and standard water use and simulated runoff are less than the flow volume measured in the conduits if rainfall is somehow was lost in the catchment due to unknown pathways we would expect the simulated runoff together with water use to be higher than what is measured in the conduits at ris the water balance seems reasonable in that simulated and observed runoff are almost identical for three out of four periods no correction of the observed precipitation input has been carried out in the simulations and the evapotranspiration routine has no calibrated parameters however actual evapotranspiration is of course a function of subsurface storage at any point in time and this capacity is indirectly calibrated through the calibrated velocities skaugen and mengistu 2016 i e the parameters gsc and gsh that all non evaporated water appears in the conduits implies that lateral subsurface flow enters the conduits through cracks in the pipes and possibly via subsurface drainage systems around buildings that are often coupled to the sewer or stormwater networks the intention of the combined sewage stormwater network is to transport only wastewater and possibly runoff from impermeable areas to water treatment plants and water that infiltrates is in principle not supposed to challenge the capacity of these facilities this study indicates however that infiltrated subsurface water is a significant part of the urban water budget in many areas i e the subsurface water storage is dynamic and dedicated pathways for these fluxes are also needed the comparison of skill scores for dddurban and the model of h a 2018 for the validation periods in table 5 shows that dddurban performs better both on average and for 3 out of 5 time periods the time periods of validation are very short 1 2 days excepting the fourth period which is 4 months in length the brevity of the time periods means that the comparison is uncertain the model of h a 2018 is distributed and highly complex and simulates many processes assumed to be relevant for urban hydrology such as infiltration excess depression storages and two way flow between subsurface storage and the urban drainage network the model of h a 2018 performs quite well in calibration producing nse values ranging between 0 65 and 0 94 for the validation periods however the nse values ranged between 0 46 0 81 for the fourth longer period the calibrated nse of h a 2018 was 0 76 whereas for the validation the nse ranged between 0 23 and 0 81 using the different parameter sets for this period dddurban obtained nse 0 69 such a discrepancy between skill scores for calibration and validation periods suggests a lack of robustness in the model that can be associated with overparameterization kirchner 2006 dddurban only has two parameters to calibrate and we see from table 3 where the validations are performed for timeseries of some length that the variability in the skill scores for the validation periods is quite low the catchment scale effect of lids raingardens has been tested and hence addresses some of the unresolved questions put forward by elliott and trowsdale 2007 and more recently by eckart et al 2017 they highlight the need for investigating the scaled up effect of lids from lot to catchment and regional scales in fig 10 we can see that even a quite modest use of raingardens 60 raingardens in a neighbourhood of 500 houses attenuates the investigated flood peaks by about 10 which may make a difference in the number of overflows of wastewater to sensitive recipients in addition by varying the number of raingardens and their specifications the implementation of the lid module in dddurban provides a tool for planning see eckart et al 2017 and more specifically enables quantifying the effect of step 2 in the s3sa such lids may be more cost effective for mitigating the effect of increased peak flows due to urbanization than increasing the capacity of the urban drainage network unofficial figures suggest a cost of 10 k per raingarden and 4 k per meter for the installation of pipes pers com b braskerud at oslo municipality the cost for 60 raingardens hence is equivalent to the cost of only 150 m of new pipes the possible adverse effects of under designed raingardens is however of concern such measures are designed to delay runoff and if a subsequent intense rainfall event occurs before the delayed runoff for an initial event is attenuated the flood peak can actually be larger than that it would be if the raingardens were not present 6 conclusions a parameter parsimonious rainfall runoff model dddurban has been developed for applications in urban hydrology the model aims at being useful in evaluating and quantifying the important runoff processes in an urban catchment and to be used in the design and planning of lids at the catchment scale this study shows that water infiltrated on permeable areas subsurface flows contribute on average to the flow measured in the conduits at a fraction equal to the fraction of permeable areas in addition when permeable areas are saturated overland flow from permeable areas makes a significant contribution 30 60 to the flood peak evapotranspiration is a significant part of the urban water budget and its estimates by dddurban for ris are in good agreement with the estimated long term mean by huang et al 2019 for this area skill scores kge for dddurban for the validation time series are acceptable ranging from 0 56 to 0 69 and are on average better than those reported in a previous study of hailegeorgis and alfredsen 2018 where a more complex urban hydrological models has been applied most of dddurban parameters are determined from a detailed dem by gis and from the literature only two parameters which describe the velocity of subsurface flow for different levels of saturation are calibrated against observed runoff the calibrated parameters are in agreement with measurements of saturated hydraulic conductivity the sensitivity of the dddurban to the choice of upslope contributing area for the gis analysis have been tested and the ca proposed by grass gis was found work well for both gk and ris these results are promising with respect to the potential for deriving model parameters for catchments without flow measurements the effect of raingardens on the catchment scale has been evaluated and significant reductions in flood peaks were found for a relatively modest installation of raingardens if every 8th house installs a raingarden flood peaks would be reduced by about 10 dependent on the capacity of the raingarden if the raingarden is under designed however flow peaks may increase for heavy rainfall

8591,in cold i e boreal subarctic snowy climate zones dynamic groundwater storage is greatly affected by the timing and amount of snowmelt with global warming cold climates in the northern hemisphere will transition to temperate as temperatures rise the dominant type of precipitation will change from snow to rain in winter further the growing season is prolonged this has a direct impact on the aquifer recharge pattern however little is known about the effect of changing annual recharge regimes on groundwater storage the present work deduces the impact of shifting climate zones on groundwater storage by evaluating the effect of climate seasonality on intra annual hydraulic head fluctuations the work compares intra annual hydraulic head fluctuations in a temperate cold climate transition zone fennoscandia from two different periods 1980 1989 2001 2010 this is done by associating rising vs declining hydraulic heads with hydrometeorology due to the northwards migration of the temperate climate zone there is a shift in seasonality between the two periods this has a negative impact on groundwater levels which are significantly lower in 2001 2010 particularly near the climate transition zone the results demonstrate that increasing temperatures in cold climate regions may change the seasonality of groundwater recharge by altering the main recharge period from being snowmelt dominated spring to rain dominated winter additionally this is connected to the duration of the growing season which impedes groundwater recharge the coupled effect of this on groundwater in the study area has led to a significant decrease in groundwater storage keywords groundwater level fluctuations climate change dynamic groundwater storage snowmelt recharge fennoscandia 1 introduction climate

clilverd et al 2011 surfleet et al 2012 kurylyk and macquarrie 2013 surfleet and tullos 2013 meixner et al 2016 this approach is partly justified since the study of significant trends require long time series stoll et al 2011 most groundwater observations do not fit this requirement which also does not allow for cross validation against model results as a consequence results indicate wildly

discrepancies between gcms surfleet et al 2012 surfleet and tullos 2013 2 the dependency on the type of downscaling method used chen et al 2006 baba et al 2011 kurylyk and macquarrie 2013 and 3 insufficient understanding of atmosphere groundwater interactions green et al 2011 kløve et al 2014 in addition output in the form of annual or longer term averages of groundwater recharge common for climate change impact studies portray neither extremes nor seasonal variations of recharge storage seasonal variability of groundwater recharge storage may develop into groundwater related hazards such as floods water scarcity and drought taylor et al 2012 any of these effects results in increased pressure on important groundwater dependent ecosystems taylor et al 2012 jyväsjärvi et al 2015 communities and industry their ability to adjust to future changes in water availability is reliant on the rate of change and more importantly their ability to adapt kirkinen et al 2005 kjellström et al 2014 kløve et al 2017 consequently changes in intra annual groundwater fluctuations can have a severe impact on both environment and society natural groundwater fluctuations are a result of hydrometeorologic factors that are changing spatiotemporally and topographic and hydrogeologic characteristics that are assumed to be temporally constant e g rinderer et al 2019 giese et al 2020 the dominant hydrometeorologic characteristic of cold humid i e boreal subarctic snowy climate zones are large quantities of winter precipitation stored as snowpack in the cold months and released as

dierauer et al 2018 or groundwater recharge kløve et al 2017 results from isotope analyses in central canada indicate that snowmelt is the main source of annual groundwater recharge jasechko et al 2017 which also explains why in fennoscandia groundwater recharge generally reaches annual maxima during or after snow melting events kløve et al 2017 according to the climate scenario rcp8 5 cold humid climate zones are expected to go through a major shift northwards within this century rubel et al 2017 beck et al 2018 the shift from cold to warmer temperate climate is thus expected to influence the annual water budget in these regions clilverd et al 2011 jasechko et al 2017 whether the net effect on groundwater storage is positive or negative is unclear a few studies already observe long term consequences of seasonality changes and climate variability on groundwater levels the general trend is negative coinciding with increased temperatures and precipitation but overall results are highly variable i e allen et al 2014 two studies modelled the effect of rising temperatures on groundwater storage okkonen and kløve 2011 and recharge jyrkama and sykes 2007 in cold climate both studies state an increase of groundwater recharge in winter as the change in dominating processes facilitate water infiltration and percolation through soil this change in processes include jyrkama and sykes 2007 okkonen and kløve 2011 1 increased winter rain opposed to snowfall during a period with low to nil evapotranspiration 2 decreased snow storage which lead to reduced snowmelt magnitudes and a lower spring snowmelt peak and 3 the reduction of soil frost that hinder percolation another modelling study by sultana and coulibaly 2011 claims that decreased snow storage 1 and 2 also leads to decreased annual groundwater recharge although total annual precipitation increases this could be related to changes in duration and intensity of precipitation events as infiltration capacity varies with rainfall intensity fu et al 2019 nevertheless it implies snow accumulation and melt processes facilitate recharge in general lee et al 2013 and jang et al 2015 studied the impact of climate on groundwater levels in a region with temperate and cold climate and a distinct wet season they attribute the negative trend in groundwater levels to limited infiltration capacity therefore increased precipitation in the wet season cannot contribute to increased recharge other studies predict that increasing precipitation will boost effective rainfall and groundwater recharge overriding the increasing annual evapotranspiration rates with rising temperatures jyrkama and sykes 2007 kovalevskii 2007 meixner et al 2016 however shallow aquifers and aquifers with a thick capillary fringe are vulnerable as the hydraulic connection between root zone and aquifer enables vegetation to transpire and deplete groundwater kløve et al 2014 bloomfield et al 2019 condon et al 2020 unless balanced by sufficient rainfall this would extend the duration of groundwater level recession and systematically reduce storage hamlet et al 2007 such as presented in a catchment scale modelling study for southern finland by luoma and okkonen 2014 other studies in cold humid scibek and allen 2006 scibek et al 2007 and also in cold to hot arid meixner et al 2016 climate zones conclude that the effect of warming and increased precipitation on storage could be negligible thus there remains a discrepancy in the interpretation of climate and seasonality effects on groundwater the overall objective of this study is therefore to improve the understanding of the connection between intra annual fluctuations in hydraulic heads and hydrometeorological seasons specific to temperate and cold climate thus the aim is to 1 classify spatiotemporal differences in hydraulic head fluctuations and compare to known climate zones 2 elucidate spatial change in seasonality between two climatically different periods and 3 quantify the effect of spatiotemporal change on hydraulic heads 2 study area and data 2 1 climate sweden and finland are located in northern europe between 55 70 n and 10 62 e in this region the climate zones range from temperate humid to cold humid with warm or cold summers fig 1 a based on the köppen geiger climate classification kottek et al 2006 cold climate is defined as having monthly average temperatures of more than 10 c in summer but below 3 c in winter temperate climate is defined as having monthly average temperatures also exceeding 10 c in summer and between 3 c and 18 c in winter humid is defined as the climate lacking a dry season peel et al 2007 beck et al 2018 according to chen and chen 2013 climate zone classifications in fennoscandia are highly unstable on inter annual timescales in northern sweden and in finland the climate zones stabilise for decadal to 30 year timescales this is probably linked to the strong dependency to the arctic oscillation north atlantic oscillation and scandinavia teleconnections in winter and to the east atlantic western russia teleconnections in spring and summer engström and uvo 2016 irannezhad et al 2019 regardless of climate zone classification projections of average annual change according to the scenario rcp8 5 for the period 2011 2099 predict annual average differences in sweden and finland to be an increase in temperatures of 0 06 c and in precipitation of 0 25 smhi no date ruosteenoja et al 2016 2 2 hydrogeological context the hydrogeological context is important to reduce misconceptions and misinterpretations of the results even though it is not the focus of the study nordic hydrogeology is different in terms of typical mechanisms and processes that prevail in central or southern europe in general aquifers in sedimentary formations are limited in depth and spatial extent resulting in local aquifers asch 2003 these small aquifers often lack a connection to rivers and streams as low permeability bedrock isolate sedimentary deposits thus the mechanisms of groundwater surface water interactions often differ from those in other parts of the world the geology and landscape is strongly influenced by peneplanation and recent glacial history and thus very different from regions that have not undergone these processes for example the vadose zone is generally thin so the mostly unconfined shallow groundwater systems are well connected to the atmosphere richts et al 2011 fan et al 2013 the bedrock in sweden and finland is part of the fennoscandian shield a geologically distinct area of the european craton the bedrock is mainly composed of granites and gneisses from the archaean and proterozoic eons with relatively few and small elements of mostly palaeozoic lime and sandstone fig 1b adrielsson et al 2006 fredén 2009 due to long term peneplanation the bedrock surface and surface topography is mostly flat or gently undulating lidmar bergström et al 2013 bedrock and superficial sedimentary deposits are separated by an unconformity shaped by quaternary glacial erosion this together with earlier peneplanation and glacial deposition has created a knock and lochan landscape shield terrain with surficial layers mainly consisting of till kleman et al 2008 ebert et al 2015 the diagenesis and permeability of the glacial deposits is affected by different stages of the baltic sea which is delimited by the elevation of the highest shoreline åberg 2013 sgu 2015 the highest shoreline elevation varies between 10 and 289 m a s l and 20 109 m a s l in sweden and finland respectively below the highest shoreline sediments have a subaquatic origin and are therefore more well sorted and have extensive silt and clay lenses above the highest shoreline sediments have a supra aquatic origin these layers are hence heterogenous and unsorted supra aquatic till is often clayey resulting in a low hydraulic conductivity englund et al 1986 regionally depth to bedrock is commonly 10 m kleman et al 2008 exceptions are fracture valleys eskers and end moraine formations see fig 1b coarse sediments where thicknesses of more than 100 m can be reached fredén 2009 stroeven et al 2016 ymparisto 2019 the piezometers used in this study are all located in superficial glacial deposits of subaquatic or

classified as having bad quality by sgu or syke and time series visually affected by unnatural disturbances are excluded groups where piezometer hydrographs have highly variable fluctuation are

this study are all in glacial sediment at a surface elevation lower than 500 m a s l with a median depth below surface ranging between 0 to 18 m fig 2 3 methods 3 1 classification of hydrometeorology the classification of hydrometeorology is based on a simplified water budget for each climate grid cell 1 p e t q δs where p mm is precipitation et mm is evapotranspiration q mm is stream discharge and δs mm is dynamic groundwater storage the net effect of groundwater recharge and discharge since et is unknown potential evapotranspiration pet is used as an approximation mean monthly pet mm is calculated using the spei package in r studio beguería and vicente serrano 2017 based on thornthwaite 1948 as 2 pet m 1 6 n m 10 t m i a with 3 i t m 5 1 514 4 a 6 75 10 7 i 3 7 71 10 5 i 2 1 791 10 2 i 0 49239 where m is the month n is a factor based on latitude and month that accounts for daylight hours latitudes above 50 n have the same correction factor i e all piezometers in the study t c is the mean monthly temperature and i is the heat index the relationship between mean monthly temperatures and pet is highly complex the complexity increases in warmer climates and decreases in colder climates the approach does not account for freezing temperatures and differences in land cover which affect pet thornthwaite 1948 acknowledges that the relationship differs based on location and pet tends to be overestimated especially in tropical or warm climates however the method is preferable due to the small data requirements and the expected small errors in the cold and temperate climate zones of fennoscandia variations in evapotranspiration due to varying plant properties and land use change are not considered as no vegetation data is included in the approach since the study is focussed on δs as a function of water availability i e p et and due to the generally low hydraulic connection between rivers and aquifers the groundwater component of q is considered constant as a simplification effective precipitation p et determines surface water availability for infiltration and percolation and δs indicates the effect on groundwater surface water surpluses or deficits as determined by effective precipitation are represented by two hydrometeorology types rain and high pet respectively for every hydrometeorological type and the assumption that baseflow is constant drivers of dynamic groundwater storage can be written as 5 δs r s e t where rs mm is the rainfall and snowmelt output from the snowmelt model in temperate and cold climate a surface water surplus facilitating infiltration mainly occurs when rainfall or snowmelt production exceeds pet these types will hereafter be referred to as rain or snowmelt surface water deficits or weakening of infiltration occurs when pet exceeds rainfall this is referred to as high pet in the classification jasechko et al 2014 or when precipitation accumulates as snow at the surface hereafter referred to as snowfall clilverd et al 2011 jasechko et al 2017 if there is snowfall effective precipitation rs et is 0 mm the classification according to eq 5 is applied to each re analysis climate grid cell and is based on daily average values of rs pet and melt production m eq 8 for two different periods see section 4 1 climate context for a description of the two periods chosen for analysis for the classification of hydrometeorology as snowmelt evapotranspiration and rain are excluded to emphasise the effect of snowmelt on hydraulic head dynamics the hydrometeorology is given the snowmelt classification when snowmelt production exceeds 0 5 mm table 1 this is due to the computation of 10 year means producing low values of daily snowmelt meaning a threshold of 0 mm snowmelt greatly exaggerates average snowmelt days rain on snow episodes are not represented each condition is specified in table 1 3 1 1 precipitation phase to calculate the sums of daily snow water equivalent and snowmelt a single temperature index based model is used the method is based on the snow routine of the hbv model using five coefficients describing empirical relationships between water freezing melting and snowpack runoff bergström 1976 the approach may be simplified as 6 p p s w h e n t 1 c 7 p p l w h e n t 1 c where p s mm is solid precipitation i e snow water equivalent and p l mm is liquid precipitation i e rain snowmelt production m is simulated according to a degree day factor how much snow may melt per degree per day regardless of precipitation as 8 m m i n a c m t t t where a mm is snowfall accumulation of the previous day cm 2 74 mm c day is the degree day factor t c is the air temperature and tt c is the air temperature threshold a detailed account of the different steps are described in appendix b literature parameter values optimised for sweden are used for the entire study area seibert 2005 seibert and vis 2012 a temperature threshold of 1 c is used for the study based on findings from feiccabrino and lundberg 2008 3 2 classification of groundwater hydrographs this study aims to elucidate the relationship between dynamic groundwater storage and varying groundwater recharge the approach considers fluctuating hydraulic heads and recharge as a product of infiltration and percolation of effective precipitation eq 5 because discharge as a product of runoff subsurface flow and groundwater drainage and hydrogeological properties of the piezometer locations are unknown dynamic storage δs cannot be directly quantified however temporal variation of δs is represented in relative terms by fluctuations in hydraulic heads this fluctuation represents a relationship that based on a simplified aquifer water budget can be written as 9 δs g r g q where gr mm is groundwater recharge and gq mm is groundwater discharge for natural hydrogeological systems undisturbed by human influence rising hydraulic heads rh corresponds to δs 0 i e gr gq and declining hydraulic heads dh corresponds to δs 0 i e gr gq identifying rh and dh patterns enables the analysis of piezometric hydrographs for the qualitative determination of timing and duration of fluctuating patterns in hydraulic heads by connecting rh and dh to hydrometeorology types inferences on the impact of different hydrometeorology on dynamic groundwater storage in cold and temperate climate can be made a statistical approach is applied to quantify differences in hydraulic heads for all piezometers using measures of depth to groundwater depth to groundwater is estimated by subtracting the surface elevation by hydraulic heads and dividing the result by the record median head thereby values are made dimensionless and spatially comparable for each period and piezometer this value is used to calculate measures of the seasonal standard deviation of median minimum and maximum depth s to groundwater the standard deviation indicates inter annual differences the median indicates median groundwater depth per season winter djf spring mam summer jja autumn son and period minimum and maximum values indicate lowest and highest depth to groundwater attained per season and period the percent difference between the two periods for every measure and piezometer is calculated the result is presented as the median of the percent difference for each latitude group defined based on the climate zones in fig 1a together with the significance the significance is tested using the paired nonparametric two tailed wilcoxon signed rank test bauer 1972 a paired test is used since the measures are affected by the fluctuation amplitude of hydraulic heads which are spatially heterogeneous and specific to hydrogeological characteristics measure results per piezometers are plotted and analysed one period against another to visualise differences this enables the relative quantification of local changes presumably caused by differences in climate 3 3 linking hydraulic head fluctuations to hydrometeorology to simplify the spatial component of the analysis piezometers are grouped by proximity piezometers are grouped according to their location in the climate grid cell 100 km2 for finland 121 km2 for sweden most piezometers within the same group i e climate grid cell portray similar seasonality some piezometers are apparently different in dynamics within the group e g slope amplitude this can be due to strong local differences in hydrogeology or even the location in different aquifer systems however since the analyses on groups focus on differences in timing of fluctuations initiation duration of rh or dh it is not considered detrimental to the study that groups may have piezometer hydrographs with different shape such as slope recession curve and amplitude in fluctuation see appendix c for all median hydraulic heads of individual piezometers in all groups for the analysis of groups the hydraulic heads of each piezometer are first normalised by subtracting the surface elevation and median period hydraulic head to get the normalised head per group the median of heads within each group is calculated for each biweekly time step hydraulic head fluctuations at smaller temporal resolution are not retained however for the comparison to hydrometeorology fluctuation patterns are interpolated between observations to a daily resolution hydraulic head and hydrometeorology classifications are linked as follows the day of year with a specific hydrometeorology is associated to the same day of year hydraulic head class rising or declining heads each piezometer class hydrometeorology pair is presented per period and season days with a specific pair are summarised per season and the duration for such a relationship e g rising heads associated with rain are presented as a fraction of that season e g sep nov 4 results 4 1 climate context to put the study in a climate change context annual decadal and 15 year means of temperature and precipitation are calculated for the three climate zones fig 1 between 1980 and 2010 this indicates generally increasing temperatures between 1980 and 2010 fig 3 annual sums of precipitation is mainly increasing for the temperate and cold climate zone and decreasing for the cold climate subcategory of warm summers referred to as the climate transition zone fig 1 59 63 n the 1990 s show opposing trends in precipitation for the temperate and the cold latitudes above 63 n climate zones compared to the general trend between 1980 and 2010 projected changes for sweden and finland are based on model ensemble results for the scenario rcp8 5 covering the period 2000 2099 and 2000 2084 respectively the average annual increase for the projected changes and their corresponding period is 0 05 0 07 c per year for temperature and 0 2 0 3 per year for precipitation for a 20 year period which correspond to differences between the middle of the 1980 s and 2000 s the increase is 1 0 1 4 c and 4 3 6 4 smhi no date ruosteenoja et al 2016 this is similar to differences between the 1980 s and the 2000 s with a mean annual temperature and precipitation difference of 0 9 1 2 c and 4 1 8 respectively fig 3 therefore to match general precipitation trends and maximise the difference in average temperature between the two periods the data is divided and analysed using two 10 year periods 1980 1989 p1 and 2001 2010 p2 4 2 seasonality of the hydrologic cycle in general seasonality in groundwater fluctuation follow a distinct pattern in fennoscandia as presented by four piezometers in fig 4 in cold climate piezometer 23 and 1204p10 heads rise quickly as temperatures increase above the freezing point in spring thereafter heads either remain high during summer 1204p10 or decrease if temperatures are warm 23 if heads decline during warm conditions they rise again as temperatures decrease in autumn as temperatures drop below the freezing point in winter hydraulic heads continuously decline until temperatures rise again in spring this general trend occurs regardless of the amount of precipitation except in summer during sustained precipitation over more than a few days in temperate climate piezometer 9 and 3 fig 4 temperatures usually are not below the freezing point for long thus in winter hydraulic heads rise summers are warmer and hydraulic heads decline the declining trend usually continues until temperatures decrease in autumn 4 3 classification of hydrometeorology and groundwater hydrographs the results from the hydrometeorology and hydrograph classifications for 8 groups are shown as examples from p1 and p2 in fig 5 the annotated groups in fig 1a there is a clear geographical distinction with group 1 being northernmost and 8 the southernmost group fig 1a the northern groups 1 4 have a distinct snowfall period with dh and spring snowmelt peaks with some 2 4 also having a summer recession during high pet the southern groups 5 8 have a long summer recession but generally rh in autumn and winter during rainfall group 5 7 also have a short winter recession followed by an increase with spring snowmelt similar to groups 1 4 between p1 and p2 the groundwater fluctuations are different either in timing duration and or amplitude fig 5 for example group 2 has a change in timing and amplitude of groundwater fluctuations with a slightly longer autumn recession another example is group 4 which has a shorter winter recession and a longer summer recession and also a different amplitude in fluctuations simultaneously the snowfall period has a shorter duration in p2 than in p1 intermixed with days of snowmelt rain and high pet groups 2 5 there is an increase in high pet groups 1 5 and in rain duration 3 5 4 4 quantitative difference in hydraulic heads the comparison of hydraulic heads indicate that changes to groundwater storage have occurred between p1 and p2 fig 6 shows the hydraulic head changes expressed as depth to groundwater for each piezometer and period and in table 2 the difference is summarised by the median percent difference for each latitude group climate zone most piezometers have increased depths to groundwater in p2 compared to p1 fig 6 and this is clearly mirrored by the percent difference table 2 the magnitude of the difference varies by season both for individual piezometers fig 6 and collectively for the three latitude groups climate zones table 2 the minimum depth to groundwater represents high level conditions in the piezometers based on the hydrologic seasonality fig 4 piezometers in cold temperate climate normally have high level conditions in spring winter however for the latitudes 59 63 n and north of 63 n the spring minimum depth has increased more than in any other season in p2 the minimum depth is higher in summer and autumn as well with no significant change in winter there is no significant change in minima south of 59 n table 2 changes in autumn and winter seasons which represent the end and the beginning of the hydrologic year indicate accumulated differences in storage throughout the year for the latitudes 59 63 n and north of 63 n the autumn or winter change in median and maximum depth is the largest between the seasons and is significantly deeper in p2 than in p1 table 2 furthermore the standard deviation indicating changes between p1 and p2 of the inter annual variability within the two decades is significantly higher at 10 and 23 difference in winter at 59 63 n and north of 63 n respectively this implies that there is an increased variability in storage at the beginning of the hydrologic year in p2 the standard deviation south of 59 n has not changed significantly but autumn median depths have the highest significant percent difference a 7 increase in depth from any of the measures and seasons thus piezometers at all latitudes have generally significantly decreased groundwater storage in p2 table 2 however it should be noted that there is also large variability between piezometers and some have decreased depths to groundwater i e increased storage in p2 compared to p1 fig 6 4 5 link between hydraulic head fluctuations and hydrometeorology seasonality in groundwater is mainly characterised by rh in spring and autumn and dh in winter and summer there is a spatial boundary around 60 n fig 7 in winter dh dominates north of 60 n finland and northern sweden and is associated with snowfall south of 60 n southern sweden rh is predominant in winter and is associated with snowmelt and rain spring is characterised by snowmelt and rh throughout fennoscandia fig 7 although southern sweden is affected by dh associated to high pet in spring as well days classified as rain occur throughout the year but are most frequent in autumn and spring in association with rh particularly southward in summer high pet conditions dominate in association with dh thus spatial differences in hydrometeorology type association to hydraulic head pattern is most apparent in winter and spring between the two periods there is a spatiotemporal change in groundwater hydrometeorology links in winter rh associated with rain has migrated north in p2 occurring south of 62 n fig 7 in spring the same groups have a shorter rh duration high pet associated dh has increased in occurrence and duration in the entire study area this increase is most pronounced during spring in southern sweden and finland the duration of snowfall associated dh at latitudes south of 65 n have shortened or ceased there appears to be fewer days with a rh pattern in autumn p2 overall but in northern sweden in particular 5 discussion 5 1 spatiotemporal differences in hydraulic head fluctuations the approach of associating rising or declining hydraulic heads with hydrometeorology indicates the spatial and temporal differences in the two climate zones cold and temperate figs 1a and 8 in accordance with studies on groundwater recharge in temperate climate lee et al 2013 jasechko et al 2014 jang et al 2015 southern sweden has a long duration of rising hydraulic heads associated with rain in winter and declining hydraulic heads associated with high evapotranspiration in spring fig 8 northern sweden and finland have a long duration of declining hydraulic heads associated with snowfall in winter and rising hydraulic heads associated with snowmelt in spring this is consistent with findings from other studies in cold climate regions regarding the effect of these hydrometeorological conditions on groundwater recharge and consequently storage jyrkama and sykes 2007 clilverd et al 2011 okkonen and kløve 2011 luoma and okkonen 2014 jasechko et al 2014 2017 in summer and autumn the spatial differences are less pronounced generally in the study area declining hydraulic heads associated with high evapotranspiration occur in summer while rising heads associated with rain occur in autumn fig 7 consequently rain and evapotranspiration affects hydraulic heads in both climates 5 2 spatial changes in seasonality between p1 and p2 in addition to spatial and seasonal differences there is a notable difference in the spatial extent of different seasonal characteristics between the two periods p1 1980 1989 and p2 2001 2010 particularly above the temperate cold climate zone boundary 59 n fig 1a differences are most apparent in winter and spring fig 7 conceptualised in fig 8 temperate zone conditions have shifted north in p2 the duration of rising hydraulic heads associated with rain in winter have migrated northeast and snowfall associated with declining heads have retracted in spring the duration of rising heads associated with snowmelt has decreased and retracted similarly to the snowfall pattern in winter high evapotranspiration associated with declining heads occurs in sweden south of 60 n and in finland south of 64 n fig 7 the spatial difference between p1 and p2 is not as clear in sweden as in finland however data quality requirements lead to a low number of piezometers in sweden at these latitudes thus the absence of a visible change is not conclusive nevertheless gcm results for 1901 2100 based on an ensemble of ipcc scenarios indicate that the climate zone shift in sweden is delayed compared to same latitude shifts in finland rubel and kottek 2010 this may explain the lack of visible spatial change between p1 and p2 in sweden 5 3 impact on hydraulic heads a cold to temperate climate shift would make groundwater increasingly affected by rain and evapotranspiration and less by snow processes as temperatures increase and land cover evolves sultana and coulibaly 2011 scheliga et al 2018 wang et al 2018 most studies agree that this leads to increased winter infiltration and summer evapotranspiration e g jasechko et al 2014 therefore the seasonality of precipitation is considered a key feature of annual groundwater recharge clilverd et al 2011 okkonen and kløve 2011 jasechko et al 2014 the changing seasonality of hydrometeorology may here be defined as 1 the transition from snowfall dominated to rainy winters and 2 high evapotranspiration in spring previously dominated by snowmelt the percent difference in depth to groundwater table 2 clearly show that depths are significantly deeper in p2 compared to p1 in all seasons this suggests that recharge in p2 cannot maintain the groundwater storage of p1 therefore in contrast to modelling studies which found 1 and 2 leading to increased groundwater recharge in the future e g jyrkama and sykes 2007 kovalevskii 2007 clilverd et al 2011 the here presented results suggest the opposite this despite the general trend of increasing precipitation in most of the region fig 3 piezometers north of 59 n show a larger variability from the group median fig 6 indicating the change is largest in the location of most seasonal change this could be related to changes in precipitation patterns as not only total amounts but also the intensity of precipitation affects infiltration and percolation processes clilverd et al 2011 furthermore some studies argue that depending on the growing season effective recharge from rainfall could decrease in relation to snowmelt clilverd et al 2011 hamlet et al 2007 hinzman et al 2005 significantly deeper autumn and winter depths including the increase in standard deviation indicate that increasing groundwater depths are inherited by successive years table 2 consequently groundwater storage decreases continuously on an inter annual perspective despite increased duration of rising hydraulic heads in winter although less self evident this implies antecedent conditions are indeed hugely important for the water balance as found by okkonen and kløve 2011 van loon 2015 dierauer et al 2018 and cuthbert et al 2019 some piezometers have decreased depths i e increased storage in p2 compared to p1 fig 6 scibek and allen 2006 allen et al 2014 and meixner et al 2016 report divergence from large scale trends or ambiguity in results which they attribute to hydrogeological limitations or complexity additionally differing forest canopy cover has been modelled to greatly alter recharge ala aho et al 2015 thus land cover and land use change in addition to hydrogeology has the capacity to greatly affect groundwater recharge and influence the net effect of a climate shift it is not possible to derive the cause of variability in the change of depth to groundwater in this study however it is likely that heterogeneity of hydrogeology and differences in land cover is causing variance in the response to changing climate pressures 5 4 implications of shifting cold climate zones for changing groundwater seasonality on the global scale compared to studies on groundwater resources in a global context where focus is on regional aquifers in extensive sedimentary deposits hydrogeology in sweden and finland is dominated by small aquifers with relatively low hydraulic connectivity groundwater resources in much of the northern hemisphere north of 50 n has been similarly classified richts et al 2011 fan et al 2013 additionally the unsaturated zone is commonly very thin 2 m and water tables are well connected to the atmosphere this results in little capacity of the groundwater system to buffer climate change over more than a few years cuthbert et al 2019 considering that temperature and precipitation differences are within the same magnitudes as future projections for rcp8 5 fig 3 future climate change may be represented by differences between p1 and p2 for a shorter timescale results presented here suggest a shift from cold to temperate climate could change spring snowmelt from being the main recharge source instead spring could be a period with less or no recharge due to warmer temperatures the main recharge period could instead be in winter as snow is increasingly replaced by rain and reduced soil frost increases the infiltration capacity of the soil the statistical test implies that annual groundwater recharge is reduced increased end of year maximum and median depths table 2 as a result of this shift figs 7 and 8 if these changes are representative of similar processes occurring over longer timescales groundwater storage could generally be expected to decrease in fennoscandia within the century it is likely that similar effects may be seen in comparable hydrogeological and climatological settings i e in areas with mainly local aquifers and cold humid climate zones in addition to fennoscandia such settings can be found in large parts of northern asia and east of the rocky mountains in north america richts et al 2011 fan et al 2013 beck et al 2018 5 5 approach limitations the approach used here to associate hydraulic head class to hydrometeorology type has three main limitations 1 the hydrometeorology classification is based on two simple models estimating rain snowmelt and pet which may not always be representing the actual hydrometeorology state and evapotranspiration is considered equal to pet factors affecting rain snow and evapotranspiration magnitudes include but are not limited to land cover characteristics wind and humidity healy and cook 2002 taylor et al 2012 jasechko et al 2014 and limitations caused by spatiotemporal resolution 2 the approach is not designed to consider lag in groundwater hydrometeorology responses or responses at a less than biweekly temporal resolution however the plots showing hydraulic head fluctuations with the hydrometeorology classes fig 5 and appendix d indicate that even where lag occurs there exists at least partial overlap further fast responses biweekly are not expected to affect the results since values are based on the median hydraulic head of 264 piezometers over two 10 year periods 3 the term effective precipitation eq 5 does not describe actual groundwater recharge which would be measured in the field water may instead constitute runoff of different variations and surface or vadose zone storage vadose zone storage particularly may introduce an error for piezometers in finland as soil has an increasing water holding capacity north of 63 n as compared to southern finland hiederer 2013a b the effect of runoff surface storage and the connection of aquifer systems to rivers varies spatially with hydrogeology and topography additionally any recharge produced from effective precipitation may be insufficient to change the hydraulic head pattern rh vs dh as it also depends on relative groundwater discharge the use of a group of piezometers to represent one grid cell of climate effects on groundwater may introduce further error piezometers in a group are not necessarily connected to the same aquifer as they are mostly small and disconnected in fennoscandia piezometers therefore reflect local hydrogeological differences independent of climate also the seasonality of some piezometer hydrographs in a group are too dissimilar to include in the study probably due to anthropogenic impacts this suggest that in groups where only one piezometer is used 20 out of 74 groups of which 17 are in sweden appendix a such effects may be undiscovered 6 conclusions the study analyses the effect of climate differences on the seasonality of groundwater fluctuations the aim is to identify spatiotemporal differences in groundwater fluctuations and potential changes between two climatically different periods 1980 1989 and 2001 2010 additionally the aim is to quantify the effect on hydraulic heads the approach consists of a qualitative assessment associating hydraulic head fluctuations to hydrometeorology types plus a quantitative assessment of differences in heads expressed as depth to groundwater between the selected periods thus for the first time annual groundwater recharge patterns are put in the context of shifting climate zones the results indicate that 1 intra annual groundwater fluctuations in fennoscandia are closely related to the 1986 2010 köppen geiger climate zones as defined by beck et al 2018 a in temperate climate intra annual fluctuations in hydraulic heads are driven by rainy autumns and winters and high evapotranspiration in spring and summer b in cold climate intra annual fluctuations in hydraulic heads are driven by winter snowfall snowmelt in spring varyingly by rain and high evapotranspiration rates in summer and rain in autumn 2 for the period 2001 2010 compared to 1980 1989 the duration of rain associated rising hydraulic heads in winter is longer as is the duration of declining hydraulic heads associated with high evapotranspiration in spring thus the main recharge mechanism is shifting from spring snowmelt to winter rain 3 depth to groundwater and the standard deviation has increased significantly for the period 2001 2010 compared to 1980 1989 this has implications for groundwater storage indicating a decreasing trend over time the link between rising vs declining hydraulic heads and hydrometeorology types suggests this is a result of shorter snowmelt periods and longer high evapotranspiration rate duration that is higher temperatures have driven the change irrespective of precipitation changes 4 differences in groundwater seasonality and depth between the periods 1980 1989 and 2001 2010 are pronounced along the climate transition zone temperate to cold climate this indicates that groundwater in fennoscandia is highly influenced by and vulnerable to short term changes to the climate regime 5 the time scales used here 10 years are too short to draw solid conclusions on the impact of climate change on groundwater resources in fennoscandia however the difference in hydrometeorology between 1980 and 1989 and 2001 2010 is in accordance with future projections for climate change in sweden and finland therefore assuming these results may represent the impact on groundwater resources also over longer timescales it is suggested that groundwater storage will mainly decrease in fennoscandia future work should focus on quantifying groundwater recharge and storage by analysing hydraulic heads and stream discharge together note that a completely new selection of piezometers is necessary for such a study in fennoscandia as sites need to be chosen with careful consideration given to hydrogeological setting due to the generally poor hydraulic connection to streams additionally a statistical analysis of driving climatology for the region could further clarify climate groundwater interactions declaration of competing interest the authors

groundwater hydrometeorology associations are removed fig e 1 therefore presents all results from fig 7 and the additional links which using our approach of a simple water budget equation eq 5 are not easily explained these results cannot be explained in this study due to a combination of limitations including the daily resolution of the groundwater hydrometeorology associations there being no data on soil frost land cover and hydrogeological characteristics and since no quantitative water budget calculations are made there are possible explanations for why certain counter intuitive links exist which can be seen in figs 5 and d1 for example groundwater could have the dh classification associated with rain since effective rainfall enough to produce recharge is dependent on the infiltration capacity of the soil thus for rainfall to be effective not only do the conditions need to be energy instead of water limited eq 5 but it has been found that the magnitude of rainfall need to exceed a certain threshold for a certain number of days for recharge to be produced e g clilverd et al 2011 fu et al 2019 however since such conclusions cannot be made based on the approach used here this

8591,in cold i e boreal subarctic snowy climate zones dynamic groundwater storage is greatly affected by the timing and amount of snowmelt with global warming cold climates in the northern hemisphere will transition to temperate as temperatures rise the dominant type of precipitation will change from snow to rain in winter further the growing season is prolonged this has a direct impact on the aquifer recharge pattern however little is known about the effect of changing annual recharge regimes on groundwater storage the present work deduces the impact of shifting climate zones on groundwater storage by evaluating the effect of climate seasonality on intra annual hydraulic head fluctuations the work compares intra annual hydraulic head fluctuations in a temperate cold climate transition zone fennoscandia from two different periods 1980 1989 2001 2010 this is done by associating rising vs declining hydraulic heads with hydrometeorology due to the northwards migration of the temperate climate zone there is a shift in seasonality between the two periods this has a negative impact on groundwater levels which are significantly lower in 2001 2010 particularly near the climate transition zone the results demonstrate that increasing temperatures in cold climate regions may change the seasonality of groundwater recharge by altering the main recharge period from being snowmelt dominated spring to rain dominated winter additionally this is connected to the duration of the growing season which impedes groundwater recharge the coupled effect of this on groundwater in the study area has led to a significant decrease in groundwater storage keywords groundwater level fluctuations climate change dynamic groundwater storage snowmelt recharge fennoscandia 1 introduction climate change impact studies on groundwater resources generally use the output of global climate models gcms as input to hydrological models e g scibek and allen 2006 jyrkama and sykes 2007 scibek et al 2007 clilverd et al 2011 surfleet et al 2012 kurylyk and macquarrie 2013 surfleet and tullos 2013 meixner et al 2016 this approach is partly justified since the study of significant trends require long time series stoll et al 2011 most groundwater observations do not fit this requirement which also does not allow for cross validation against model results as a consequence results indicate wildly varying possibilities for future change ranging from decreasing e g sultana and coulibaly 2011 luoma and okkonen 2014 jang et al 2015 over stable e g scibek and allen 2006 scibek et al 2007 meixner et al 2016 to increasing e g jyrkama and sykes 2007 kovalevskii 2007 clilverd et al 2011 groundwater storage or recharge this variability is highly connected to uncertainty with regard to initialisation and parameterisation of processes known to heavily affect future groundwater recharge estimates these uncertainties are associated with 1 global precipitation patterns climate change scenarios and discrepancies between gcms surfleet et al 2012 surfleet and tullos 2013 2 the dependency on the type of downscaling method used chen et al 2006 baba et al 2011 kurylyk and macquarrie 2013 and 3 insufficient understanding of atmosphere groundwater interactions green et al 2011 kløve et al 2014 in addition output in the form of annual or longer term averages of groundwater recharge common for climate change impact studies portray neither extremes nor seasonal variations of recharge storage seasonal variability of groundwater recharge storage may develop into groundwater related hazards such as floods water scarcity and drought taylor et al 2012 any of these effects results in increased pressure on important groundwater dependent ecosystems taylor et al 2012 jyväsjärvi et al 2015 communities and industry their ability to adjust to future changes in water availability is reliant on the rate of change and more importantly their ability to adapt kirkinen et al 2005 kjellström et al 2014 kløve et al 2017 consequently changes in intra annual groundwater fluctuations can have a severe impact on both environment and society natural groundwater fluctuations are a result of hydrometeorologic factors that are changing spatiotemporally and topographic and hydrogeologic characteristics that are assumed to be temporally constant e g rinderer et al 2019 giese et al 2020 the dominant hydrometeorologic characteristic of cold humid i e boreal subarctic snowy climate zones are large quantities of winter precipitation stored as snowpack in the cold months and released as meltwater in spring clilverd et al 2011 jasechko et al 2017 this seasonal snow cover highly affects the regional hydrology e g discharge of rivers staudinger and seibert 2014 jenicek et al 2016 dierauer et al 2018 or groundwater recharge kløve et al 2017 results from isotope analyses in central canada indicate that snowmelt is the main source of annual groundwater recharge jasechko et al 2017 which also explains why in fennoscandia groundwater recharge generally reaches annual maxima during or after snow melting events kløve et al 2017 according to the climate scenario rcp8 5 cold humid climate zones are expected to go through a major shift northwards within this century rubel et al 2017 beck et al 2018 the shift from cold to warmer temperate climate is thus expected to influence the annual water budget in these regions clilverd et al 2011 jasechko et al 2017 whether the net effect on groundwater storage is positive or negative is unclear a few studies already observe long term consequences of seasonality changes and climate variability on groundwater levels the general trend is negative coinciding with increased temperatures and precipitation but overall results are highly variable i e allen et al 2014 two studies modelled the effect of rising temperatures on groundwater storage okkonen and kløve 2011 and recharge jyrkama and sykes 2007 in cold climate both studies state an increase of groundwater recharge in winter as the change in dominating processes facilitate water infiltration and percolation through soil this change in processes include jyrkama and sykes 2007 okkonen and kløve 2011 1 increased winter rain opposed to snowfall during a period with low to nil evapotranspiration 2 decreased snow storage which lead to reduced snowmelt magnitudes and a lower spring snowmelt peak and 3 the reduction of soil frost that hinder percolation another modelling study by sultana and coulibaly 2011 claims that decreased snow storage 1 and 2 also leads to decreased annual groundwater recharge although total annual precipitation increases this could be related to changes in duration and intensity of precipitation events as infiltration capacity varies with rainfall intensity fu et al 2019 nevertheless it implies snow accumulation and melt processes facilitate recharge in general lee et al 2013 and jang et al 2015 studied the impact of climate on groundwater levels in a region with temperate and cold climate and a distinct wet season they attribute the negative trend in groundwater levels to limited infiltration capacity therefore increased precipitation in the wet season cannot contribute to increased recharge other studies predict that increasing precipitation will boost effective rainfall and groundwater recharge overriding the increasing annual evapotranspiration rates with rising temperatures jyrkama and sykes 2007 kovalevskii 2007 meixner et al 2016 however shallow aquifers and aquifers with a thick capillary fringe are vulnerable as the hydraulic connection between root zone and aquifer enables vegetation to transpire and deplete groundwater kløve et al 2014 bloomfield et al 2019 condon et al 2020 unless balanced by sufficient rainfall this would extend the duration of groundwater level recession and systematically reduce storage hamlet et al 2007 such as presented in a catchment scale modelling study for southern finland by luoma and okkonen 2014 other studies in cold humid scibek and allen 2006 scibek et al 2007 and also in cold to hot arid meixner et al 2016 climate zones conclude that the effect of warming and increased precipitation on storage could be negligible thus there remains a discrepancy in the interpretation of climate and seasonality effects on groundwater the overall objective of this study is therefore to improve the understanding of the connection between intra annual fluctuations in hydraulic heads and hydrometeorological seasons specific to temperate and cold climate thus the aim is to 1 classify spatiotemporal differences in hydraulic head fluctuations and compare to known climate zones 2 elucidate spatial change in seasonality between two climatically different periods and 3 quantify the effect of spatiotemporal change on hydraulic heads 2 study area and data 2 1 climate sweden and finland are located in northern europe between 55 70 n and 10 62 e in this region the climate zones range from temperate humid to cold humid with warm or cold summers fig 1 a based on the köppen geiger climate classification kottek et al 2006 cold climate is defined as having monthly average temperatures of more than 10 c in summer but below 3 c in winter temperate climate is defined as having monthly average temperatures also exceeding 10 c in summer and between 3 c and 18 c in winter humid is defined as the climate lacking a dry season peel et al 2007 beck et al 2018 according to chen and chen 2013 climate zone classifications in fennoscandia are highly unstable on inter annual timescales in northern sweden and in finland the climate zones stabilise for decadal to 30 year timescales this is probably linked to the strong dependency to the arctic oscillation north atlantic oscillation and scandinavia teleconnections in winter and to the east atlantic western russia teleconnections in spring and summer engström and uvo 2016 irannezhad et al 2019 regardless of climate zone classification projections of average annual change according to the scenario rcp8 5 for the period 2011 2099 predict annual average differences in sweden and finland to be an increase in temperatures of 0 06 c and in precipitation of 0 25 smhi no date ruosteenoja et al 2016 2 2 hydrogeological context the hydrogeological context is important to reduce misconceptions and misinterpretations of the results even though it is not the focus of the study nordic hydrogeology is different in terms of typical mechanisms and processes that prevail in central or southern europe in general aquifers in sedimentary formations are limited in depth and spatial extent resulting in local aquifers asch 2003 these small aquifers often lack a connection to rivers and streams as low permeability bedrock isolate sedimentary deposits thus the mechanisms of groundwater surface water interactions often differ from those in other parts of the world the geology and landscape is strongly influenced by peneplanation and recent glacial history and thus very different from regions that have not undergone these processes for example the vadose zone is generally thin so the mostly unconfined shallow groundwater systems are well connected to the atmosphere richts et al 2011 fan et al 2013 the bedrock in sweden and finland is part of the fennoscandian shield a geologically distinct area of the european craton the bedrock is mainly composed of granites and gneisses from the archaean and proterozoic eons with relatively few and small elements of mostly palaeozoic lime and sandstone fig 1b adrielsson et al 2006 fredén 2009 due to long term peneplanation the bedrock surface and surface topography is mostly flat or gently undulating lidmar bergström et al 2013 bedrock and superficial sedimentary deposits are separated by an unconformity shaped by quaternary glacial erosion this together with earlier peneplanation and glacial deposition has created a knock and lochan landscape shield terrain with surficial layers mainly consisting of till kleman et al 2008 ebert et al 2015 the diagenesis and permeability of the glacial deposits is affected by different stages of the baltic sea which is delimited by the elevation of the highest shoreline åberg 2013 sgu 2015 the highest shoreline elevation varies between 10 and 289 m a s l and 20 109 m a s l in sweden and finland respectively below the highest shoreline sediments have a subaquatic origin and are therefore more well sorted and have extensive silt and clay lenses above the highest shoreline sediments have a supra aquatic origin these layers are hence heterogenous and unsorted supra aquatic till is often clayey resulting in a low hydraulic conductivity englund et al 1986 regionally depth to bedrock is commonly 10 m kleman et al 2008 exceptions are fracture valleys eskers and end moraine formations see fig 1b coarse sediments where thicknesses of more than 100 m can be reached fredén 2009 stroeven et al 2016 ymparisto 2019 the piezometers used in this study are all located in superficial glacial deposits of subaquatic or supra aquatic origin 2 3 data 2 3 1 climate data the finnish meteorological institute fmi provide data of daily sums of precipitation and average temperatures for finland the dataset is part of fmi climgrid a 100 km2 daily regional reanalysis climate grid covering the period 1961 2014 aalto et al 2016 the swedish meteorological and hydrological institute smhi provide data of daily sums of precipitation and average temperatures for sweden the dataset is part of the regional reanalysis for europe a copernicus climate change service undén 2017 it is a 121 km2 daily regional re analysis climate grid covering the period 1961 2015 2 3 2 groundwater data groundwater hydrographs are provided by the swedish geological survey sgu and the finnish environment agency syke the time series contain at least 31 years of biweekly observations 1980 2010 with a maximum of 4 months missing data missing data is imputed by the mean of the previous and following measurement piezometers with data classified as having bad quality by sgu or syke and time series visually affected by unnatural disturbances are excluded groups where piezometer hydrographs have highly variable fluctuation are excluded from further analysis as this is likely due to anthropogenic influence after pre processing 264 piezometers 74 geographically distinct groups out of 1500 piezometers 197 groups remained with biweekly on average 1 8 measurements month observation intervals the distribution of piezometers per geographically distinct group 1 11 median of 5 is detailed in table a 1 the piezometers used in this study are all in glacial sediment at a surface elevation lower than 500 m a s l with a median depth below surface ranging between 0 to 18 m fig 2 3 methods 3 1 classification of hydrometeorology the classification of hydrometeorology is based on a simplified water budget for each climate grid cell 1 p e t q δs where p mm is precipitation et mm is evapotranspiration q mm is stream discharge and δs mm is dynamic groundwater storage the net effect of groundwater recharge and discharge since et is unknown potential evapotranspiration pet is used as an approximation mean monthly pet mm is calculated using the spei package in r studio beguería and vicente serrano 2017 based on thornthwaite 1948 as 2 pet m 1 6 n m 10 t m i a with 3 i t m 5 1 514 4 a 6 75 10 7 i 3 7 71 10 5 i 2 1 791 10 2 i 0 49239 where m is the month n is a factor based on latitude and month that accounts for daylight hours latitudes above 50 n have the same correction factor i e all piezometers in the study t c is the mean monthly temperature and i is the heat index the relationship between mean monthly temperatures and pet is highly complex the complexity increases in warmer climates and decreases in colder climates the approach does not account for freezing temperatures and differences in land cover which affect pet thornthwaite 1948 acknowledges that the relationship differs based on location and pet tends to be overestimated especially in tropical or warm climates however the method is preferable due to the small data requirements and the expected small errors in the cold and temperate climate zones of fennoscandia variations in evapotranspiration due to varying plant properties and land use change are not considered as no vegetation data is included in the approach since the study is focussed on δs as a function of water availability i e p et and due to the generally low hydraulic connection between rivers and aquifers the groundwater component of q is considered constant as a simplification effective precipitation p et determines surface water availability for infiltration and percolation and δs indicates the effect on groundwater surface water surpluses or deficits as determined by effective precipitation are represented by two hydrometeorology types rain and high pet respectively for every hydrometeorological type and the assumption that baseflow is constant drivers of dynamic groundwater storage can be written as 5 δs r s e t where rs mm is the rainfall and snowmelt output from the snowmelt model in temperate and cold climate a surface water surplus facilitating infiltration mainly occurs when rainfall or snowmelt production exceeds pet these types will hereafter be referred to as rain or snowmelt surface water deficits or weakening of infiltration occurs when pet exceeds rainfall this is referred to as high pet in the classification jasechko et al 2014 or when precipitation accumulates as snow at the surface hereafter referred to as snowfall clilverd et al 2011 jasechko et al 2017 if there is snowfall effective precipitation rs et is 0 mm the classification according to eq 5 is applied to each re analysis climate grid cell and is based on daily average values of rs pet and melt production m eq 8 for two different periods see section 4 1 climate context for a description of the two periods chosen for analysis for the classification of hydrometeorology as snowmelt evapotranspiration and rain are excluded to emphasise the effect of snowmelt on hydraulic head dynamics the hydrometeorology is given the snowmelt classification when snowmelt production exceeds 0 5 mm table 1 this is due to the computation of 10 year means producing low values of daily snowmelt meaning a threshold of 0 mm snowmelt greatly exaggerates average snowmelt days rain on snow episodes are not represented each condition is specified in table 1 3 1 1 precipitation phase to calculate the sums of daily snow water equivalent and snowmelt a single temperature index based model is used the method is based on the snow routine of the hbv model using five coefficients describing empirical relationships between water freezing melting and snowpack runoff bergström 1976 the approach may be simplified as 6 p p s w h e n t 1 c 7 p p l w h e n t 1 c where p s mm is solid precipitation i e snow water equivalent and p l mm is liquid precipitation i e rain snowmelt production m is simulated according to a degree day factor how much snow may melt per degree per day regardless of precipitation as 8 m m i n a c m t t t where a mm is snowfall accumulation of the previous day cm 2 74 mm c day is the degree day factor t c is the air temperature and tt c is the air temperature threshold a detailed account of the different steps are described in appendix b literature parameter values optimised for sweden are used for the entire study area seibert 2005 seibert and vis 2012 a temperature threshold of 1 c is used for the study based on findings from feiccabrino and lundberg 2008 3 2 classification of groundwater hydrographs this study aims to elucidate the relationship between dynamic groundwater storage and varying groundwater recharge the approach considers fluctuating hydraulic heads and recharge as a product of infiltration and percolation of effective precipitation eq 5 because discharge as a product of runoff subsurface flow and groundwater drainage and hydrogeological properties of the piezometer locations are unknown dynamic storage δs cannot be directly quantified however temporal variation of δs is represented in relative terms by fluctuations in hydraulic heads this fluctuation represents a relationship that based on a simplified aquifer water budget can be written as 9 δs g r g q where gr mm is groundwater recharge and gq mm is groundwater discharge for natural hydrogeological systems undisturbed by human influence rising hydraulic heads rh corresponds to δs 0 i e gr gq and declining hydraulic heads dh corresponds to δs 0 i e gr gq identifying rh and dh patterns enables the analysis of piezometric hydrographs for the qualitative determination of timing and duration of fluctuating patterns in hydraulic heads by connecting rh and dh to hydrometeorology types inferences on the impact of different hydrometeorology on dynamic groundwater storage in cold and temperate climate can be made a statistical approach is applied to quantify differences in hydraulic heads for all piezometers using measures of depth to groundwater depth to groundwater is estimated by subtracting the surface elevation by hydraulic heads and dividing the result by the record median head thereby values are made dimensionless and spatially comparable for each period and piezometer this value is used to calculate measures of the seasonal standard deviation of median minimum and maximum depth s to groundwater the standard deviation indicates inter annual differences the median indicates median groundwater depth per season winter djf spring mam summer jja autumn son and period minimum and maximum values indicate lowest and highest depth to groundwater attained per season and period the percent difference between the two periods for every measure and piezometer is calculated the result is presented as the median of the percent difference for each latitude group defined based on the climate zones in fig 1a together with the significance the significance is tested using the paired nonparametric two tailed wilcoxon signed rank test bauer 1972 a paired test is used since the measures are affected by the fluctuation amplitude of hydraulic heads which are spatially heterogeneous and specific to hydrogeological characteristics measure results per piezometers are plotted and analysed one period against another to visualise differences this enables the relative quantification of local changes presumably caused by differences in climate 3 3 linking hydraulic head fluctuations to hydrometeorology to simplify the spatial component of the analysis piezometers are grouped by proximity piezometers are grouped according to their location in the climate grid cell 100 km2 for finland 121 km2 for sweden most piezometers within the same group i e climate grid cell portray similar seasonality some piezometers are apparently different in dynamics within the group e g slope amplitude this can be due to strong local differences in hydrogeology or even the location in different aquifer systems however since the analyses on groups focus on differences in timing of fluctuations initiation duration of rh or dh it is not considered detrimental to the study that groups may have piezometer hydrographs with different shape such as slope recession curve and amplitude in fluctuation see appendix c for all median hydraulic heads of individual piezometers in all groups for the analysis of groups the hydraulic heads of each piezometer are first normalised by subtracting the surface elevation and median period hydraulic head to get the normalised head per group the median of heads within each group is calculated for each biweekly time step hydraulic head fluctuations at smaller temporal resolution are not retained however for the comparison to hydrometeorology fluctuation patterns are interpolated between observations to a daily resolution hydraulic head and hydrometeorology classifications are linked as follows the day of year with a specific hydrometeorology is associated to the same day of year hydraulic head class rising or declining heads each piezometer class hydrometeorology pair is presented per period and season days with a specific pair are summarised per season and the duration for such a relationship e g rising heads associated with rain are presented as a fraction of that season e g sep nov 4 results 4 1 climate context to put the study in a climate change context annual decadal and 15 year means of temperature and precipitation are calculated for the three climate zones fig 1 between 1980 and 2010 this indicates generally increasing temperatures between 1980 and 2010 fig 3 annual sums of precipitation is mainly increasing for the temperate and cold climate zone and decreasing for the cold climate subcategory of warm summers referred to as the climate transition zone fig 1 59 63 n the 1990 s show opposing trends in precipitation for the temperate and the cold latitudes above 63 n climate zones compared to the general trend between 1980 and 2010 projected changes for sweden and finland are based on model ensemble results for the scenario rcp8 5 covering the period 2000 2099 and 2000 2084 respectively the average annual increase for the projected changes and their corresponding period is 0 05 0 07 c per year for temperature and 0 2 0 3 per year for precipitation for a 20 year period which correspond to differences between the middle of the 1980 s and 2000 s the increase is 1 0 1 4 c and 4 3 6 4 smhi no date ruosteenoja et al 2016 this is similar to differences between the 1980 s and the 2000 s with a mean annual temperature and precipitation difference of 0 9 1 2 c and 4 1 8 respectively fig 3 therefore to match general precipitation trends and maximise the difference in average temperature between the two periods the data is divided and analysed using two 10 year periods 1980 1989 p1 and 2001 2010 p2 4 2 seasonality of the hydrologic cycle in general seasonality in groundwater fluctuation follow a distinct pattern in fennoscandia as presented by four piezometers in fig 4 in cold climate piezometer 23 and 1204p10 heads rise quickly as temperatures increase above the freezing point in spring thereafter heads either remain high during summer 1204p10 or decrease if temperatures are warm 23 if heads decline during warm conditions they rise again as temperatures decrease in autumn as temperatures drop below the freezing point in winter hydraulic heads continuously decline until temperatures rise again in spring this general trend occurs regardless of the amount of precipitation except in summer during sustained precipitation over more than a few days in temperate climate piezometer 9 and 3 fig 4 temperatures usually are not below the freezing point for long thus in winter hydraulic heads rise summers are warmer and hydraulic heads decline the declining trend usually continues until temperatures decrease in autumn 4 3 classification of hydrometeorology and groundwater hydrographs the results from the hydrometeorology and hydrograph classifications for 8 groups are shown as examples from p1 and p2 in fig 5 the annotated groups in fig 1a there is a clear geographical distinction with group 1 being northernmost and 8 the southernmost group fig 1a the northern groups 1 4 have a distinct snowfall period with dh and spring snowmelt peaks with some 2 4 also having a summer recession during high pet the southern groups 5 8 have a long summer recession but generally rh in autumn and winter during rainfall group 5 7 also have a short winter recession followed by an increase with spring snowmelt similar to groups 1 4 between p1 and p2 the groundwater fluctuations are different either in timing duration and or amplitude fig 5 for example group 2 has a change in timing and amplitude of groundwater fluctuations with a slightly longer autumn recession another example is group 4 which has a shorter winter recession and a longer summer recession and also a different amplitude in fluctuations simultaneously the snowfall period has a shorter duration in p2 than in p1 intermixed with days of snowmelt rain and high pet groups 2 5 there is an increase in high pet groups 1 5 and in rain duration 3 5 4 4 quantitative difference in hydraulic heads the comparison of hydraulic heads indicate that changes to groundwater storage have occurred between p1 and p2 fig 6 shows the hydraulic head changes expressed as depth to groundwater for each piezometer and period and in table 2 the difference is summarised by the median percent difference for each latitude group climate zone most piezometers have increased depths to groundwater in p2 compared to p1 fig 6 and this is clearly mirrored by the percent difference table 2 the magnitude of the difference varies by season both for individual piezometers fig 6 and collectively for the three latitude groups climate zones table 2 the minimum depth to groundwater represents high level conditions in the piezometers based on the hydrologic seasonality fig 4 piezometers in cold temperate climate normally have high level conditions in spring winter however for the latitudes 59 63 n and north of 63 n the spring minimum depth has increased more than in any other season in p2 the minimum depth is higher in summer and autumn as well with no significant change in winter there is no significant change in minima south of 59 n table 2 changes in autumn and winter seasons which represent the end and the beginning of the hydrologic year indicate accumulated differences in storage throughout the year for the latitudes 59 63 n and north of 63 n the autumn or winter change in median and maximum depth is the largest between the seasons and is significantly deeper in p2 than in p1 table 2 furthermore the standard deviation indicating changes between p1 and p2 of the inter annual variability within the two decades is significantly higher at 10 and 23 difference in winter at 59 63 n and north of 63 n respectively this implies that there is an increased variability in storage at the beginning of the hydrologic year in p2 the standard deviation south of 59 n has not changed significantly but autumn median depths have the highest significant percent difference a 7 increase in depth from any of the measures and seasons thus piezometers at all latitudes have generally significantly decreased groundwater storage in p2 table 2 however it should be noted that there is also large variability between piezometers and some have decreased depths to groundwater i e increased storage in p2 compared to p1 fig 6 4 5 link between hydraulic head fluctuations and hydrometeorology seasonality in groundwater is mainly characterised by rh in spring and autumn and dh in winter and summer there is a spatial boundary around 60 n fig 7 in winter dh dominates north of 60 n finland and northern sweden and is associated with snowfall south of 60 n southern sweden rh is predominant in winter and is associated with snowmelt and rain spring is characterised by snowmelt and rh throughout fennoscandia fig 7 although southern sweden is affected by dh associated to high pet in spring as well days classified as rain occur throughout the year but are most frequent in autumn and spring in association with rh particularly southward in summer high pet conditions dominate in association with dh thus spatial differences in hydrometeorology type association to hydraulic head pattern is most apparent in winter and spring between the two periods there is a spatiotemporal change in groundwater hydrometeorology links in winter rh associated with rain has migrated north in p2 occurring south of 62 n fig 7 in spring the same groups have a shorter rh duration high pet associated dh has increased in occurrence and duration in the entire study area this increase is most pronounced during spring in southern sweden and finland the duration of snowfall associated dh at latitudes south of 65 n have shortened or ceased there appears to be fewer days with a rh pattern in autumn p2 overall but in northern sweden in particular 5 discussion 5 1 spatiotemporal differences in hydraulic head fluctuations the approach of associating rising or declining hydraulic heads with hydrometeorology indicates the spatial and temporal differences in the two climate zones cold and temperate figs 1a and 8 in accordance with studies on groundwater recharge in temperate climate lee et al 2013 jasechko et al 2014 jang et al 2015 southern sweden has a long duration of rising hydraulic heads associated with rain in winter and declining hydraulic heads associated with high evapotranspiration in spring fig 8 northern sweden and finland have a long duration of declining hydraulic heads associated with snowfall in winter and rising hydraulic heads associated with snowmelt in spring this is consistent with findings from other studies in cold climate regions regarding the effect of these hydrometeorological conditions on groundwater recharge and consequently storage jyrkama and sykes 2007 clilverd et al 2011 okkonen and kløve 2011 luoma and okkonen 2014 jasechko et al 2014 2017 in summer and autumn the spatial differences are less pronounced generally in the study area declining hydraulic heads associated with high evapotranspiration occur in summer while rising heads associated with rain occur in autumn fig 7 consequently rain and evapotranspiration affects hydraulic heads in both climates 5 2 spatial changes in seasonality between p1 and p2 in addition to spatial and seasonal differences there is a notable difference in the spatial extent of different seasonal characteristics between the two periods p1 1980 1989 and p2 2001 2010 particularly above the temperate cold climate zone boundary 59 n fig 1a differences are most apparent in winter and spring fig 7 conceptualised in fig 8 temperate zone conditions have shifted north in p2 the duration of rising hydraulic heads associated with rain in winter have migrated northeast and snowfall associated with declining heads have retracted in spring the duration of rising heads associated with snowmelt has decreased and retracted similarly to the snowfall pattern in winter high evapotranspiration associated with declining heads occurs in sweden south of 60 n and in finland south of 64 n fig 7 the spatial difference between p1 and p2 is not as clear in sweden as in finland however data quality requirements lead to a low number of piezometers in sweden at these latitudes thus the absence of a visible change is not conclusive nevertheless gcm results for 1901 2100 based on an ensemble of ipcc scenarios indicate that the climate zone shift in sweden is delayed compared to same latitude shifts in finland rubel and kottek 2010 this may explain the lack of visible spatial change between p1 and p2 in sweden 5 3 impact on hydraulic heads a cold to temperate climate shift would make groundwater increasingly affected by rain and evapotranspiration and less by snow processes as temperatures increase and land cover evolves sultana and coulibaly 2011 scheliga et al 2018 wang et al 2018 most studies agree that this leads to increased winter infiltration and summer evapotranspiration e g jasechko et al 2014 therefore the seasonality of precipitation is considered a key feature of annual groundwater recharge clilverd et al 2011 okkonen and kløve 2011 jasechko et al 2014 the changing seasonality of hydrometeorology may here be defined as 1 the transition from snowfall dominated to rainy winters and 2 high evapotranspiration in spring previously dominated by snowmelt the percent difference in depth to groundwater table 2 clearly show that depths are significantly deeper in p2 compared to p1 in all seasons this suggests that recharge in p2 cannot maintain the groundwater storage of p1 therefore in contrast to modelling studies which found 1 and 2 leading to increased groundwater recharge in the future e g jyrkama and sykes 2007 kovalevskii 2007 clilverd et al 2011 the here presented results suggest the opposite this despite the general trend of increasing precipitation in most of the region fig 3 piezometers north of 59 n show a larger variability from the group median fig 6 indicating the change is largest in the location of most seasonal change this could be related to changes in precipitation patterns as not only total amounts but also the intensity of precipitation affects infiltration and percolation processes clilverd et al 2011 furthermore some studies argue that depending on the growing season effective recharge from rainfall could decrease in relation to snowmelt clilverd et al 2011 hamlet et al 2007 hinzman et al 2005 significantly deeper autumn and winter depths including the increase in standard deviation indicate that increasing groundwater depths are inherited by successive years table 2 consequently groundwater storage decreases continuously on an inter annual perspective despite increased duration of rising hydraulic heads in winter although less self evident this implies antecedent conditions are indeed hugely important for the water balance as found by okkonen and kløve 2011 van loon 2015 dierauer et al 2018 and cuthbert et al 2019 some piezometers have decreased depths i e increased storage in p2 compared to p1 fig 6 scibek and allen 2006 allen et al 2014 and meixner et al 2016 report divergence from large scale trends or ambiguity in results which they attribute to hydrogeological limitations or complexity additionally differing forest canopy cover has been modelled to greatly alter recharge ala aho et al 2015 thus land cover and land use change in addition to hydrogeology has the capacity to greatly affect groundwater recharge and influence the net effect of a climate shift it is not possible to derive the cause of variability in the change of depth to groundwater in this study however it is likely that heterogeneity of hydrogeology and differences in land cover is causing variance in the response to changing climate pressures 5 4 implications of shifting cold climate zones for changing groundwater seasonality on the global scale compared to studies on groundwater resources in a global context where focus is on regional aquifers in extensive sedimentary deposits hydrogeology in sweden and finland is dominated by small aquifers with relatively low hydraulic connectivity groundwater resources in much of the northern hemisphere north of 50 n has been similarly classified richts et al 2011 fan et al 2013 additionally the unsaturated zone is commonly very thin 2 m and water tables are well connected to the atmosphere this results in little capacity of the groundwater system to buffer climate change over more than a few years cuthbert et al 2019 considering that temperature and precipitation differences are within the same magnitudes as future projections for rcp8 5 fig 3 future climate change may be represented by differences between p1 and p2 for a shorter timescale results presented here suggest a shift from cold to temperate climate could change spring snowmelt from being the main recharge source instead spring could be a period with less or no recharge due to warmer temperatures the main recharge period could instead be in winter as snow is increasingly replaced by rain and reduced soil frost increases the infiltration capacity of the soil the statistical test implies that annual groundwater recharge is reduced increased end of year maximum and median depths table 2 as a result of this shift figs 7 and 8 if these changes are representative of similar processes occurring over longer timescales groundwater storage could generally be expected to decrease in fennoscandia within the century it is likely that similar effects may be seen in comparable hydrogeological and climatological settings i e in areas with mainly local aquifers and cold humid climate zones in addition to fennoscandia such settings can be found in large parts of northern asia and east of the rocky mountains in north america richts et al 2011 fan et al 2013 beck et al 2018 5 5 approach limitations the approach used here to associate hydraulic head class to hydrometeorology type has three main limitations 1 the hydrometeorology classification is based on two simple models estimating rain snowmelt and pet which may not always be representing the actual hydrometeorology state and evapotranspiration is considered equal to pet factors affecting rain snow and evapotranspiration magnitudes include but are not limited to land cover characteristics wind and humidity healy and cook 2002 taylor et al 2012 jasechko et al 2014 and limitations caused by spatiotemporal resolution 2 the approach is not designed to consider lag in groundwater hydrometeorology responses or responses at a less than biweekly temporal resolution however the plots showing hydraulic head fluctuations with the hydrometeorology classes fig 5 and appendix d indicate that even where lag occurs there exists at least partial overlap further fast responses biweekly are not expected to affect the results since values are based on the median hydraulic head of 264 piezometers over two 10 year periods 3 the term effective precipitation eq 5 does not describe actual groundwater recharge which would be measured in the field water may instead constitute runoff of different variations and surface or vadose zone storage vadose zone storage particularly may introduce an error for piezometers in finland as soil has an increasing water holding capacity north of 63 n as compared to southern finland hiederer 2013a b the effect of runoff surface storage and the connection of aquifer systems to rivers varies spatially with hydrogeology and topography additionally any recharge produced from effective precipitation may be insufficient to change the hydraulic head pattern rh vs dh as it also depends on relative groundwater discharge the use of a group of piezometers to represent one grid cell of climate effects on groundwater may introduce further error piezometers in a group are not necessarily connected to the same aquifer as they are mostly small and disconnected in fennoscandia piezometers therefore reflect local hydrogeological differences independent of climate also the seasonality of some piezometer hydrographs in a group are too dissimilar to include in the study probably due to anthropogenic impacts this suggest that in groups where only one piezometer is used 20 out of 74 groups of which 17 are in sweden appendix a such effects may be undiscovered 6 conclusions the study analyses the effect of climate differences on the seasonality of groundwater fluctuations the aim is to identify spatiotemporal differences in groundwater fluctuations and potential changes between two climatically different periods 1980 1989 and 2001 2010 additionally the aim is to quantify the effect on hydraulic heads the approach consists of a qualitative assessment associating hydraulic head fluctuations to hydrometeorology types plus a quantitative assessment of differences in heads expressed as depth to groundwater between the selected periods thus for the first time annual groundwater recharge patterns are put in the context of shifting climate zones the results indicate that 1 intra annual groundwater fluctuations in fennoscandia are closely related to the 1986 2010 köppen geiger climate zones as defined by beck et al 2018 a in temperate climate intra annual fluctuations in hydraulic heads are driven by rainy autumns and winters and high evapotranspiration in spring and summer b in cold climate intra annual fluctuations in hydraulic heads are driven by winter snowfall snowmelt in spring varyingly by rain and high evapotranspiration rates in summer and rain in autumn 2 for the period 2001 2010 compared to 1980 1989 the duration of rain associated rising hydraulic heads in winter is longer as is the duration of declining hydraulic heads associated with high evapotranspiration in spring thus the main recharge mechanism is shifting from spring snowmelt to winter rain 3 depth to groundwater and the standard deviation has increased significantly for the period 2001 2010 compared to 1980 1989 this has implications for groundwater storage indicating a decreasing trend over time the link between rising vs declining hydraulic heads and hydrometeorology types suggests this is a result of shorter snowmelt periods and longer high evapotranspiration rate duration that is higher temperatures have driven the change irrespective of precipitation changes 4 differences in groundwater seasonality and depth between the periods 1980 1989 and 2001 2010 are pronounced along the climate transition zone temperate to cold climate this indicates that groundwater in fennoscandia is highly influenced by and vulnerable to short term changes to the climate regime 5 the time scales used here 10 years are too short to draw solid conclusions on the impact of climate change on groundwater resources in fennoscandia however the difference in hydrometeorology between 1980 and 1989 and 2001 2010 is in accordance with future projections for climate change in sweden and finland therefore assuming these results may represent the impact on groundwater resources also over longer timescales it is suggested that groundwater storage will mainly decrease in fennoscandia future work should focus on quantifying groundwater recharge and storage by analysing hydraulic heads and stream discharge together note that a completely new selection of piezometers is necessary for such a study in fennoscandia as sites need to be chosen with careful consideration given to hydrogeological setting due to the generally poor hydraulic

groundwater hydrometeorology associations are removed fig e 1 therefore presents all results from fig 7 and the additional links which using our approach of a simple water budget equation eq 5 are not easily explained these results cannot be explained in this study due to a combination of limitations including the daily resolution of the groundwater hydrometeorology associations there being no data on soil frost land cover and hydrogeological characteristics and since no quantitative water budget calculations are made there are possible explanations for why certain counter intuitive links exist which can be seen in figs 5 and d1 for example groundwater could have the dh classification associated with rain since effective rainfall enough to produce recharge is dependent on the infiltration capacity of the soil thus for rainfall to be effective not only do the conditions need to be energy instead of water limited eq 5 but it has been found that the magnitude of rainfall need to exceed a certain threshold for a certain number of days for recharge to be produced e g clilverd et al 2011 fu et al 2019 however since such conclusions cannot be made based on the approach used here this

8592,artificial sweeteners are ubiquitous constituents of sanitary wastewater and are not completely attenuated by wastewater treatment processes consequently artificial sweeteners are increasingly employed as a tool to detect wastewater and help evaluate its impact on aquatic environments in rural areas septic systems are known point sources of artificial sweeteners to groundwater however the potential contribution of artificial sweeteners to streams via this pathway is unknown we analyzed 294 samples from 173 stream sites in southern ontario canada for acesulfame saccharin cyclamate and sucralose and found that 91 had one or more of these compounds present the stream sites sampled did not have municipal wastewater treatment plants upstream and therefore septic system effluent was the most likely source of the artificial sweeteners acesulfame which is the most recalcitrant of the four artificial sweeteners was by far the most ubiquitous in streams with a 91 detection frequency compared to 27 8 and 3 for saccharin cyclamate and sucralose respectively stream concentrations ranged from non detectable to maximum values of 225 380 204 and 291 ng l for acesulfame saccharin cyclamate and sucralose respectively we calculated that water from septic effluent contributed from 0 005 to 0 5 of streamflow with a median value of 0 052 this is the first study to use artificial sweetener concentrations to quantify the fraction of septic effluent reaching streams via groundwater flow using acesulfame concentrations we calculated that approximately 13 of the septic effluent water generated in rural southern ontario eventually ends up in local streams however this is likely a conservative estimate although much of the septic effluent water that reaches streams may be free of all but the most persistent anthropogenic compounds our study demonstrates that domestic wastewater must be considered as a possible source of stream contaminants even if municipal wastewater is not a factor in the watershed 1 introduction in the last decade artificial sweeteners have emerged as arguably the best tracers of sanitary wastewater in the environment due to their ubiquitous presence in sewage their high concentration compared to other wastewater tracers and the fact that they are highly specific to wastewater municipal wastewater treatment plant and septic system effluents studies have shown that artificial sweeteners are present in lakes and rivers where wastewater is discharged e g brorström lundén et al 2008 buerge et al 2009 scheurer et al 2009 spoelstra et al 2013 perkola and sainio 2014 and in groundwater where septic systems discharge treated wastewater to the subsurface e g oppenheimer et al 2011 van stempvoort et al 2011a robertson et al 2013 van stempvoort et al 2013 schaider et al 2016 snider et al 2017 spoelstra et al 2017 yang et al 2017 leaky urban sewer infrastructure wolf et al 2012 tran et al 2014a lee et al 2015 and leachate from landfills roy et al 2014 clarke et al 2015 have also been shown to be sources of artificial sweeteners in groundwater while the presence of artificial sweeteners in rivers with municipal wastewater discharges is expected surface waters without a direct wastewater effluent discharge may also contain artificial sweeteners derived from groundwater contaminated with these compounds for example spoelstra et al 2017 found that 30 of groundwater wells and springs in a rural aquifer in southern ontario canada were impacted by septic system effluent as indicated by the presence of one or more commonly used artificial sweeteners acesulfame ace saccharin sac cyclamate cyc sucralose suc based on their findings and the fact that groundwater provides baseflow to streams spoelstra et al 2017 concluded that streams without municipal wastewater discharges could contain artificial sweeteners and thus be impacted by sanitary wastewater the purpose of this study was to determine how widespread septic system effluent is in surface waters by looking specifically at the occurrence and concentrations of artificial sweeteners in streams that do not have municipal wastewater effluent discharges furthermore using the concentration and mass loading of acesulfame we estimate the percentage of stream water that originated as septic effluent and approximate the proportion of southern ontario s septic effluent that ends up in streams 2 methodology 2 1 sample collection the data included in this study are from a subset of water sampling sites in watersheds with no wastewater treatment plant upstream across southern ontario canada fig 1 that were sampled as part of other water quality research projects conducted by the authors the catchment areas are dominated by agricultural land use and residences consist mostly of single family dwellings that rely on septic systems for domestic wastewater treatment septic systems in the study area consist predominantly of a settling tank for primary treatment and a tile bed that distributes the partially treated effluent to the subsurface for additional treatment a total of 294 samples were collected and analyzed from 173 different stream sites from 2008 to 2015 forty percent of the sites contained at least one other sampling site within their watershed and twenty seven percent of sites were sampled on multiple occasions during the study period sampling was done during stream baseflow conditions when the influence of septic effluent in groundwater would be easiest to detect due to less dilution with event based water e g snowmelt surface runoff stream samples were collected using a stainless steel bucket and rope at locations where streams intersected roadways following rinsing of the bucket and bottles with sample bottles were filled with raw water and kept cold until further processing e g filtering preserving within 12 h for a variety of chemical and stable isotope parameters not all reported here samples for artificial sweeteners were filtered to 0 45 µm using a 47 mm diameter pall supor membrane disk filter and then frozen until analysis all samples were analyzed at the canada centre for inland waters in burlington ontario information on the stream sites is provided in the supporting information table s1 2 2 artificial sweetener analysis artificial sweeteners were analyzed using one of two versions of a suppressed ion chromatography ic tandem mass spectrometry ms ms method the original method is described by van stempvoort et al 2011b and was used for samples analyzed prior to august 2013 in brief ion chromotography was performed using a thermo fisher waltham ma usa dionex 2500 ic system on a dionex ionpac as20 analytical column 2 250 mm the ic was interfaced to an ab sciex concord on canada 5500 qtrap ms ms and operated in the negative electrospray ionization esi mode isotopically labelled compounds were used as internal standards to account for matrix effects this method was modified slightly as described in spoelstra et al 2017 to improve detection limits especially for sucralose for samples analyzed from august 2013 onward ion chromatography was done using a thermo fisher dionex ics 5000 system and ion suppression using a dionex aers 500 2 mm instead of a dionex asrs 300 2 mm method detection limits for ace sac cyc and suc were 8 21 3 5000 and 2 2 3 20 ng l for the original and newer versions of the ic ms ms method respectively due to the high method detection limit for sucralose with our original technique 5000 ng l these data were excluded from our study unless otherwise indicated artificial sweetener concentrations less than method detection limits were assigned a value of zero for statistical calculations e g mean standard deviation 2 3 watershed characteristics and calculations catchment areas and mean annual flows maf for each stream site were determined using the ontario flow assessment tool ofat omnrf 2017a the ofat is a gis based on line tool that uses statistical models and empirical relationships to perform hydrological analyses for ontario streams omnrf 2017b stainton 2010 the catchment area contributing to streamflow at a

moin and shaw 1986 using provincial mean annual runoff data omnrf 2017a for each site and sampling date artificial sweetener load in the stream was calculated using the measured artificial sweetener concentrations and an estimated flow flow was not measured at each site so it was calculated for each sampling date qest based on the ofat maf for the site compared to that of a nearby site where continuous discharge data was available from water survey of canada wsc 1 q est q wsc ma f wsc ma f s qwsc is the daily flow for the wsc site on the date s that nearby study sites were sampled mafwsc

used for the flow calculation for each sampling site are given in tables s1 and s2 2 4 calculation of rural population densities as part of this study we were interested in relating the artificial sweetener load in streams to septic system usage in the watershed the population contributing to septic system effluent production was calculated based on population density rural population density pdrural people km2 values of pdrural for the watersheds for each of our sampling sites were not available and therefore pdrural values were calculated using data from 28 census sub divisions fig 1 from statistics canada s 2016 census statistics canada 2016 we used total area and population for each census sub division statistics canada 2019a and subtracted out the major urban areas and corresponding urban populations statistics canada 2019b for population centres that use municipal wastewater systems in each census sub division for smaller urban areas not included as population centres by statistics canada but that were also serviced by municipal wastewater systems population size was determined from a variety of sources on the internet and land area was determined using google earth pro using the data sources indicated above for each census sub division pdrural was calculated using the following equation 2 p d rural pc d tot p urban ac d tot a urban where pcdtot and acdtot are the total population and area of the census sub division respectively and purban and aurban are the total population and area of the of the urban centres within the census sub division respectively the calculated pdrural values for the 28 census sub divisions ranged from 7 1 to 31 8 people km2 with a mean and standard deviation of 19 2 8 4 people km2 for watersheds that encompassed multiple census sub divisions an area weighted pdrural value was calculated 3 results and discussion 3 1 artificial sweeteners in streams 3 1 1 occurrence and concentration artificial sweeteners are nearly ubiquitous in the streams of rural watersheds of the 294 stream samples collected and analyzed as part of this study 91 had detectable levels of one or more of the four artificial sweeteners acesulfame saccharin cyclamate sucralose indicating an impact from septic systems via groundwater discharge to the streams this corresponds to 89 of the 173 individual sampling sites where artificial sweeteners were detected acesulfame was by far the most commonly occurring artificial sweetener with a 91 detection frequency compared to 27 8 and 3 for sac cyc and suc respectively fig 2 table 1 concentrations ranged over two orders of magnitude from below method detection limits to maximum values of 225 380 204 and 291 ng l for ace sac cyc and suc respectively fig 2 table 1 even at this maximum value the concentration of ace in streams is hundreds of times lower than in septic effluent and hundreds of thousands of times lower than in diet soft drinks statistical information regarding the occurrence and concentrations of the four artificial sweeteners is summarized in table 1 the relationship of the concentrations of sac cyc and suc to ace are also shown in the supporting information fig s2 acesulfame s prevalence in consumer products combined with its resistance to degradation favors a high occurrence in wastewater affected environments even in households where consumption of foods with artificial sweeteners is avoided widely used products such as toothpaste and medicines are a source of artificial sweeteners to domestic wastewater the low frequency of detection for suc 3 of samples is partially due to the fact that our method detection limit for suc is higher new method 20 ng l than those for the other artificial sweeteners new method ace 2 sac 2 cyc 3 ng l however this fact did not affect the overall percentage of samples that had one or more of the artificial sweeteners detected because all samples that had suc also had ace in fact with the exception of only two samples all samples that contain either sac cyc or suc also contained ace in a study of groundwater from 100 domestic wells in alberta canada wu et al 2014 also found that suc mdl 5 ng l was only present in wells that also contained ace mdl 0 2 ng l although the generally low levels of artificial sweeteners present in our samples suggest that the potential impact of septic derived contaminants in streams is small septic plumes can enter streams as point sources especially if they originate relatively close to the stream at these focused locations the potential impacts are much greater especially to aquatic organisms that spend all or part of their life cycle in or near the sediment water interface and experience groundwater inputs prior to substantial dilution by surface waters roy et al 2019 in areas where septic impacts are of particular concern e g habitats for species at risk systematic stream sampling and or drive point profiling e g roy and bickerton 2010 and analysis for artificial sweeteners could be used to locate exactly where individual septic plumes discharge to surface waters and thereby identify specific areas for remedial actions 3 1 2 sources of artificial sweeteners to streams artificial sweeteners in groundwater can subsequently be transported to streams spoelstra et al 2017 and other groundwater discharge zones such as lake shorelines roy et al 2017 in the rural watersheds sampled in this study septic systems are expected to be the primary source of artificial sweeteners to groundwater and to the streams which do not have municipal wastewater discharges septic system designs vary but in rural southern ontario predominantly consist of a septic tank for primary treatment and settling which discharges to a tile bed that allows for infiltration and further treatment of the effluent in the subsurface depending on their age landfills may also be a source of artificial sweeteners to groundwater roy et al 2014 clarke et al 2015 although we cannot absolutely rule out a contribution from landfills to the artificial sweeteners found in streams in this study their impact on the results if any is expected to be minimal as septic systems are far more common in the landscape furthermore the artificial sweetener used for loading estimates acesulfame was introduced for use in canada around 1988 gougeon et al 2004 and is therefore not expected to be present in older landfills which would be more susceptible to leaching to surface waters compared to more modern landfills that are better engineered to contain leachate in canada sac is the only artificial sweetener permitted in animal feed feeds regulations 1983 and therefore livestock manure particularly pig manure is another potential source of sac in these rural watersheds either through contamination of groundwater that discharges to a stream or by direct overland flow of manure contaminated runoff livestock manure has previously been identified as a potential source of artificial sweeteners particularly sac to the environment buerge et al 2011 ma et al 2017 several of the highest sac concentrations occurred where sac was also the dominant artificial sweetener present suggesting the possibility of a livestock source of sac at a few of our sites saccharin is also a breakdown product of some sulfonylurea herbicides berger and wolfe 1996 and therefore it is another potential source of some sac to groundwater and streams the application of biosolids is not expected to be a significant source of artificial sweeteners to groundwater due to their high solubility artificial sweeteners remain mostly in the liquid phase of treated sewage when it is dewatered for land application as biosolids pasquini et al 2013 subedi et al 2014 tran et al 2014b 2015 3 1 3 factors affecting the occurrence and concentration of artificial sweeteners in streams the frequency of occurrence and concentration of artificial sweeteners in streams are influenced by several factors including dietary preferences artificial sweetener degradability groundwater age and the relative amounts of the four artificial sweeteners in consumer products if a single septic system is responsible for the artificial sweeteners observed in a stream then the concentrations of the artificial sweeteners will be highly dependent on the diet of the members of that household these household specific influences diminish as the watershed size increases and more septic systems and people contribute to the stream artificial sweetener load unlike municipal effluents which typically discharge directly to surface waters artificial sweeteners derived from septic systems are affected by attenuation processes that can occur during transport in the groundwater flow system acesulfame and suc are much more resistant to degradation compared to cyc and sac buerge et al 2009 2011 ma et al 2017 scheurer et al 2009 2011 tran et al 2014 2015 studies have documented that when artificial sweeteners are found in groundwater ace is almost always detected if any other artificial sweetener is present and if only one is detected it is typically ace wu et al 2014 spoelstra et al 2017 this study therefore all else being the same as groundwater travel time increases the concentrations of the more degradable artificial sweeteners decreases eventually leaving only ace in an analysis of 20 domestic wells for a suite of 117 organic wastewater compounds owcs schaider et al 2016 found that ace was the most frequently detected owc and was always present if any other owc was detected further demonstrating the robustness of using ace as a wastewater tracer in groundwater as a consequence of their differing susceptibility to attenuation the artificial sweetener composition of a groundwater or stream sample can indicate something about how recently the wastewater entered the system and or the degree of treatment several studies have suggested or demonstrated that elevated concentrations of cyc and sac indicate the presence of untreated or undertreated wastewater buerge et al 2009 tran et al 2014a zirlewagen et al 2016 yang et al 2018 similarly high concentrations of all four artificial sweeteners in water samples indicates recent contamination by wastewater septic systems close to a stream are more likely to contribute all four artificial sweeteners since travel time would be relatively short thereby minimizing time for degradation conversely septic system plumes originating far away from the groundwater discharge area are likely to have lower concentrations or complete absence of the more degradable compounds another time distance consideration with respect to artificial sweetener concentrations in groundwater and their subsequent effect on streams are the dates they became available for consumer use saccharin and cyclamate were introduced in canada at least as far back as the 1970s whereas ace and suc became available for use more recently approximately 1988 and 1992 respectively gougeon et al 2004 as a consequence older sanitary wastewater plumes in groundwater between 1970 and 1988 would not contain ace or suc and if not already completely degraded should only contain cyc and sac two of the samples collected as part of this study had sac as the sole artificial sweetener present both 5 ng l and none had cyc or sac cyc without also having ace in canada groundwater containing suc must have recharged since 1992 and is therefore relatively young robertson et al 2016a 3 2 percentage of stream water derived from septic system effluent the fraction of streamflow derived from septic system effluent was estimated for each stream sample using a mean septic tank effluent ace concentration of 43 8 µg l 1 standard deviation 4 2 µg l from twelve single family septic systems snider et al 2017 and the measured stream ace concentrations the septic system data used from snider et al 2017 was collected mostly from ontario cottage properties that have seasonal to year round occupancy it is not known how well this data reflects artificial sweetener concentrations in septic systems of typical year round dwellings in southern ontario and this remains an opportunity for further research the streamflow contribution from water that was once discharged by a septic system ranged from 0 005 to a maximum value of just over 0 5 with a median of 0 052 fig 3 sampling was done during stream baseflow conditions therefore the measured concentrations of ace and other artificial sweeteners were likely higher than if sampling was done during higher flow periods and consequently the percentage of septic derived water calculated for these streams likely represents near maximum values however the effect of streamflow on the mass flux of artificial sweeteners at a given stream location is expected to be less dramatic since the lower artificial sweetener concentrations would be partially compensated for by the higher flow volumes by conducting the sampling campaigns during baseflow conditions the higher artificial sweetener concentrations allowed us to estimate mass fluxes at sites where ace concentrations might otherwise be below detection during higher flow periods artificial sweetener analysis provides useful constraints on the maximum impact that septic system effluent could have on stream water quality not surprisingly the fraction of streamflow that can be attributed to septic effluent is relatively small albeit almost ubiquitous in these rural watersheds similarly the low ace concentrations indicate that septic systems must generally contribute only small amounts of wastewater contaminants to streams even if these compounds are not degraded along the groundwater flow path however wastewater derived compounds that exhibit environmental impacts at very low concentrations e g hormone mimicking chemicals may still be of concern in streams with septic inputs 3 3 fraction of septic wastewater discharging to streams via groundwater flow given that septic systems ultimately discharge to shallow groundwater it is not surprising that some of this water eventually ends up in surface waters however as we demonstrate above even a small contribution of septic system effluent can be detected and quantified using ace concentrations to further investigate the fate of septic system effluent in rural watersheds we used stream artificial sweetener concentrations and ofat modelled flows to estimate the stream mass flux of each artificial sweetener which ranged from 1 to almost 1000 mg day km2 fig s3 as a recalcitrant tracer of wastewater we then used the mean per capita ace export from wastewater treatment plants in the grand river watershed ontario 7 mg person day spoelstra et al 2013 the ace loading values fig s3 and the pdrural values for each site to estimate the percentage of septic effluent generated in each watershed that ends up in the stream fig 4 ideally per capita ace loading values for septic effluent would be used for this calculation but these data were not available the percentage of septic effluent generated in each watershed that ends up in streams showed a wide range for small watersheds 0 5 to 174 and converged toward the overall median value of 13 with increasing catchment area fig 4 if we just consider samples from sites with catchment areas of 50 km2 or greater n 72 the mean value is 16 14 median 14 for catchments 100 km2 or greater in area n 35 the mean value is 13 10 median 12 in other words ace concentrations indicate that approximately 13 of septic effluent produced by the rural population in southern ontario is reaching local streams most of the septic effluent reaching surface waters will contain few other contaminants from the original effluent other than the most recalcitrant compounds e g ace and those that remain will be substantially diluted by stream water e g fig 3 for example spoelstra et al 2017 demonstrated that for a rural area in the nottawasaga river watershed ontario although more than 30 of groundwater samples contained artificial sweeteners from septic effluent septic effluent was not a significant source of the nitrate ammonium or soluble reactive phosphorus srp in the aquifer the estimated percentage of streamflow derived from septic effluent and the calculated percentage of septic effluent reaching southern ontario streams via groundwater discharge should be considered as conservative values since there are several underlying assumptions that could lead to these values being underestimated firstly the calculation assumes that there is no significant degradation of ace between the septic tank and the stream while ace is one of the most recalcitrant wastewater tracers currently used studies have shown that it can be broken down naturally in the environment by sunlight gan et al 2014 and biodegradation e g buerge et al 2011 castronovo et al 2017 the extent to which ace is broken down in groundwater flow systems including the infiltration bed of septic systems is unknown and likely highly variable buerge et al 2011 demonstrated ace biodegradation in surficial soils under aerobic unsaturated conditions and the lack of biodegradation in sub soils under saturated conditions with respect to septic system effluent the results of buerge et al 2011 suggest that ace biodegradation is more likely to occur in the near surface vadose zone and be much more recalcitrant once it reaches the deeper sub soils and groundwater assuming ace degradation does occur to some degree in the subsurface and or in stream our calculations would be underestimated by the fraction of ace degraded between the septic tank source and the sampling point another factor that could lead to underestimating the fraction of septic effluent making its way to streams is the fact that ace has only been in use in canada since 1988 gougeon et al 2004 therefore any septic system effluent reaching a stream that pre dates 1988 would not contain ace and therefore not be captured in our estimates all other factors being the same the chance that septic effluent discharging to a stream is old enough to pre date the use of ace increases with increasing distance between the septic system and stream i e greater groundwater travel time variation in the concentration of ace in different septic systems due to different dietary habits in individual households could also be a source of calculation uncertainty however as upstream catchment size increases the effects of this variability become reduced as more individual septic systems and people contribute to the measured ace in streams this dampening of the variability and a convergence toward the overall median value with increasing upstream catchment area can be observed in both figs 3 and 4 and suggests that the median values are representative of the overall contribution of septic effluent water in southern ontario streams albeit within the constraints of the assumptions outlined previously for these estimates 4 conclusions and implications the ability to detect even trace amounts of wastewater in the environment using artificial sweeteners and ace in particular enables the tracking of septic impacted groundwater to streams wetlands and lake shorelines it is important to reiterate the fact that if the groundwater flowpath is sufficiently long other wastewater constituents such as pathogens nutrients and pharmaceuticals may be completely removed from groundwater by attenuation processes occurring in the vadose zone below septic systems and in the saturated zone downgradient furthermore once groundwater reaches near stream areas riparian process have a high capacity to remove additional compounds within meters of the discharge point as such residual ace in discharging groundwater may be the only conclusive indicator that the water once originated as effluent from a septic system the concentration of ace in streams can provide constraints on the amount of septic derived nutrients or contaminants contributed to streams by wastewater which can be particularly useful when evaluating the importance of multiple contaminant sources to surface and ground waters e g nutrients from septic systems vs from agricultural activities robertson et al 2016b spoelstra et al 2017 nitka et al 2019 the fact that sanitary wastewater was detected in 90 of stream samples also means that wastewater must be considered as a potential source of contaminants to streams even if no direct discharges of effluent e g municipal wastewater treatment systems are present in the watershed this is especially relevant for wastewater contaminants that are of concern even at very low concentrations e g hormone mimicking compounds pharmaceuticals persistent organic chemicals and in areas with highly permeable surficial aquifers where a significant number of septic systems are located relatively close to streams and other groundwater discharge areas while artificial sweeteners are approved for human consumption by health canada the effects of artificial sweeteners and their breakdown products on aquatic species are largely unknown in cases where there is limited spatial and or temporal separation between the wastewater source and the receiving surface water body high concentrations of ace cyc sac and suc may signify the presence of undertreated wastewater and therefore a greater potential health risk from wastewater constituents as such the presence of artificial sweeteners in the environment serves as a sentinel parameter for the presence of wastewater and if present may warrant testing for parameters of human or ecological health concern conversely if artificial sweeteners are not found there is a significantly reduced chance that harmful domestic wastewater constituents are present the analysis of artificial sweetener concentrations in streams without municipal wastewater effluents goes beyond the simple detection of wastewater from septic systems and has practical applications with respect to watershed management and water resource protection point source wastewater issues can be identified through the watershed survey methods used here for example stream sites with unusually high concentrations of sac and where sac is the dominant or only artificial sweetener present likely indicate an upstream source of livestock manure leachate to the stream furthermore high concentrations of all four artificial sweetener could indicate a wastewater treatment system that discharges undertreated sewage directly to the stream as such the monitoring of artificial sweeteners in watersheds could aid in identifying compliance issues with respect to wastewater discharges and help locate contamination sources that could be targeted for remediation to improve and protect water quality from both human and aquatic ecosystem

8592,artificial sweeteners are ubiquitous constituents of sanitary wastewater and are not completely attenuated by wastewater treatment processes consequently artificial sweeteners are increasingly employed as a tool to detect wastewater and help evaluate its impact on aquatic environments in rural areas septic systems are known point sources of artificial sweeteners to groundwater however the potential contribution of artificial sweeteners to streams via this pathway is unknown we analyzed 294 samples from 173 stream sites in southern ontario canada for acesulfame saccharin cyclamate and sucralose and found that 91 had one or more of these compounds present the stream sites sampled did not have municipal wastewater treatment plants upstream and therefore septic system effluent was the most likely source of the artificial sweeteners acesulfame which is the most recalcitrant of the four artificial sweeteners was by far the most ubiquitous in streams with a 91 detection frequency compared to 27 8 and 3 for saccharin cyclamate and sucralose respectively stream concentrations ranged from non detectable to maximum values of 225 380 204 and 291 ng l for acesulfame saccharin cyclamate and sucralose respectively we calculated that water from septic effluent contributed from 0 005 to 0 5 of streamflow with a median value of 0 052 this is the first study to use artificial sweetener concentrations to quantify the fraction of septic effluent reaching streams via groundwater flow using acesulfame concentrations we calculated that approximately 13 of the septic effluent water generated in rural southern ontario eventually ends up in local streams however this is likely a conservative estimate although much of the septic effluent water that reaches streams may be free of all but the most persistent anthropogenic compounds our study demonstrates that domestic wastewater must be considered as a possible source of stream contaminants even if municipal wastewater is not a factor in the watershed 1 introduction in the last decade artificial sweeteners have emerged as arguably the best tracers of sanitary wastewater in the environment due to their ubiquitous presence in sewage their high concentration compared to other wastewater tracers and the fact that they are highly specific to wastewater municipal wastewater treatment plant and septic system effluents studies have shown that artificial sweeteners are present in lakes and rivers where wastewater is discharged e g brorström lundén et al 2008 buerge et al 2009 scheurer et al 2009 spoelstra et al 2013 perkola and sainio 2014 and in groundwater where septic systems discharge treated wastewater to the subsurface e g oppenheimer et al 2011 van stempvoort et al 2011a robertson et al 2013 van stempvoort et al 2013 schaider et al 2016 snider et al 2017 spoelstra et al 2017 yang et al 2017 leaky urban sewer infrastructure wolf et al 2012 tran et al 2014a lee et al 2015 and leachate from landfills roy et al 2014 clarke et al 2015 have also been shown to be sources of artificial sweeteners in groundwater while the presence of artificial sweeteners in rivers with municipal wastewater discharges is expected surface waters without a direct wastewater effluent discharge may also contain artificial sweeteners derived from groundwater contaminated with these compounds for example spoelstra et al 2017 found that 30 of groundwater wells and springs in a rural aquifer in southern ontario canada were impacted by septic system effluent as indicated by the presence of one or more commonly used artificial sweeteners acesulfame ace saccharin sac cyclamate cyc sucralose suc based on their findings and the fact that groundwater provides baseflow to streams spoelstra et al 2017 concluded that streams without municipal wastewater discharges could contain artificial sweeteners and thus be impacted by sanitary wastewater the purpose of this study was to determine how widespread septic system effluent is in surface waters by looking specifically at the occurrence and concentrations of artificial sweeteners in streams that do not have municipal wastewater effluent discharges furthermore using the concentration and mass loading of acesulfame we estimate the percentage of stream water that originated as septic effluent and approximate the proportion of southern ontario s septic effluent that ends up in streams 2 methodology 2 1 sample collection the data included in this study are from a subset of water sampling sites in watersheds with no wastewater treatment plant upstream across southern ontario canada fig 1 that were sampled as part of other water quality research projects conducted by the authors the catchment areas are dominated by agricultural land use and residences consist mostly of single family dwellings that rely on septic systems for domestic wastewater treatment septic systems in the study area consist predominantly of a settling tank for primary treatment and a tile bed that distributes the partially treated effluent to the subsurface for additional treatment a total of 294 samples were collected and analyzed from 173 different stream sites from 2008 to 2015 forty percent of the sites contained at least one other sampling site within their watershed and twenty seven percent of sites were sampled on multiple occasions during the study period sampling was done during stream baseflow conditions when the influence of septic effluent in groundwater would be easiest to detect due to less dilution with event based water e g snowmelt surface runoff stream samples were collected using a stainless steel bucket and rope at locations where streams intersected roadways following rinsing of the bucket and bottles with sample bottles were filled with raw water and kept cold until further processing e g filtering preserving within 12 h for a variety of chemical and stable isotope parameters not all reported here samples for artificial sweeteners were filtered to 0 45 µm using a 47 mm diameter pall supor membrane disk filter and then frozen until analysis all samples were analyzed at the canada centre for inland waters in burlington ontario information on the stream sites is provided in the supporting information table s1 2 2 artificial sweetener analysis artificial sweeteners were analyzed using one of two versions of a suppressed ion chromatography ic tandem mass spectrometry ms ms method the original method is described by van stempvoort et al 2011b and was used for samples analyzed prior to august 2013 in brief ion chromotography was performed using a thermo fisher waltham ma usa dionex 2500 ic system on a dionex ionpac as20 analytical column 2 250 mm the ic was interfaced to an ab sciex concord on canada 5500 qtrap ms ms and operated in the negative electrospray ionization esi mode isotopically labelled compounds were used as internal standards to account for matrix effects this method was modified slightly as described in spoelstra et al 2017 to improve detection limits especially for sucralose for samples analyzed from august 2013 onward ion chromatography was done using a thermo fisher dionex ics 5000 system and ion suppression using a dionex aers 500 2 mm instead of a dionex asrs 300 2 mm method detection limits for ace sac cyc and suc were 8 21 3 5000 and 2 2 3 20 ng l for the original and newer versions of the ic ms ms method respectively due to the high method detection limit for sucralose with our original technique 5000 ng l these data were excluded from our study unless otherwise indicated artificial sweetener concentrations less than method detection limits were assigned a value of zero for statistical calculations e g mean standard deviation 2 3 watershed characteristics and calculations catchment areas and mean annual flows maf for each stream site were determined using the ontario flow assessment tool ofat omnrf 2017a the ofat is a gis based on line tool that uses statistical models and empirical relationships to perform hydrological analyses for ontario streams omnrf 2017b stainton 2010 the catchment area contributing to streamflow at a

moin and shaw 1986 using provincial mean annual runoff data omnrf 2017a for each site and sampling date artificial sweetener load in the stream was calculated using the measured artificial sweetener concentrations and an estimated flow flow was not measured at each site so it was calculated for each sampling date qest based on the ofat maf for the site compared to that of a nearby site where continuous discharge data was available from water survey of canada wsc 1 q est q wsc ma f wsc ma f s qwsc is the daily flow for the wsc site on the date s that nearby study sites were sampled mafwsc

used for the flow calculation for each sampling site are given in tables s1 and s2 2 4 calculation of rural population densities as part of this study we were interested in relating the artificial sweetener load in streams to septic system usage in the watershed the population contributing to septic system effluent production was calculated based on population density rural population density pdrural people km2 values of pdrural for the watersheds for each of our sampling sites were not available and therefore pdrural values were calculated using data from 28 census sub divisions fig 1 from statistics canada s 2016 census statistics canada 2016 we used total area and population for each census sub division statistics canada 2019a and subtracted out the major urban areas and corresponding urban populations statistics canada 2019b for population centres that use municipal wastewater systems in each census sub division for smaller urban areas not included as population centres by statistics canada but that were also serviced by municipal wastewater systems population size was determined from a variety of sources on the internet and land area was determined using google earth pro using the data sources indicated above for each census sub division pdrural was calculated using the following equation 2 p d rural pc d tot p urban ac d tot a urban where pcdtot and acdtot are the total population and area of the census sub division respectively and purban and aurban are the total population and area of the of the urban centres within the census sub division respectively the calculated pdrural values for the 28 census sub divisions ranged from 7 1 to 31 8 people km2 with a mean and standard deviation of 19 2 8 4 people km2 for watersheds that encompassed multiple census sub divisions an area weighted pdrural value was calculated 3 results and discussion 3 1 artificial sweeteners in streams 3 1 1 occurrence and concentration artificial sweeteners are nearly ubiquitous in the streams of rural watersheds of the 294 stream samples collected and analyzed as part of this study 91 had detectable levels of one or more of the four artificial sweeteners acesulfame saccharin cyclamate sucralose indicating an impact from septic systems via groundwater discharge to the streams this corresponds to 89 of the 173 individual sampling sites where artificial sweeteners were detected acesulfame was by far the most commonly occurring artificial sweetener with a 91 detection frequency compared to 27 8 and 3 for sac cyc and suc respectively fig 2 table 1 concentrations ranged over two orders of magnitude from below method detection limits to maximum values of 225 380 204 and 291 ng l for ace sac cyc and suc respectively fig 2 table 1 even at this maximum value the concentration of ace in streams is hundreds of times lower than in septic effluent and hundreds of thousands of times lower than in diet soft drinks statistical information regarding the occurrence and concentrations of the four artificial sweeteners is summarized in table 1 the relationship of the concentrations of sac cyc and suc to ace are also shown in the supporting information fig s2 acesulfame s prevalence in consumer products combined with its resistance to degradation favors a high occurrence in wastewater affected environments even in households where consumption of foods with artificial sweeteners is avoided widely used products such as toothpaste and medicines are a source of artificial sweeteners to domestic wastewater the low frequency of detection for suc 3 of samples is partially due to the fact that our method detection limit for suc is higher new method 20 ng l than those for the other artificial sweeteners new method ace 2 sac 2 cyc 3 ng l however this fact did not affect the overall percentage of samples that had one or more of the artificial sweeteners detected because all samples that had suc also had ace in fact with the exception of only two samples all samples that contain either sac cyc or suc also contained ace in a study of groundwater from 100 domestic wells in alberta canada wu et al 2014 also found that suc mdl 5 ng l was only present in wells that also contained ace mdl 0 2 ng l although the generally low levels of artificial sweeteners present in our samples suggest that the potential impact of septic derived contaminants in streams is small septic plumes can enter streams as point sources especially if they originate relatively close to the stream at these focused locations the potential impacts are much greater especially to aquatic organisms that spend all or part of their life cycle in or near the sediment water interface and experience groundwater inputs prior to substantial dilution by surface waters roy et al 2019 in areas where septic impacts are of particular concern e g habitats for species at risk systematic stream sampling and or drive point profiling e g roy and bickerton 2010 and analysis for artificial sweeteners could be used to locate exactly where individual septic plumes discharge to surface waters and thereby identify specific areas for remedial actions 3 1 2 sources of artificial sweeteners to streams artificial sweeteners in groundwater can subsequently be transported to streams spoelstra et al 2017 and other groundwater discharge zones such as lake shorelines roy et al 2017 in the rural watersheds sampled in this study septic systems are expected to be the primary source of artificial sweeteners to groundwater and to the streams which do not have municipal wastewater discharges septic system designs vary but in rural southern ontario predominantly consist of a septic tank for primary treatment and settling which discharges to a tile bed that allows for infiltration and further treatment of the effluent in the subsurface depending on their age landfills may also be a source of artificial sweeteners to groundwater roy et al 2014 clarke et al 2015 although we cannot absolutely rule out a contribution from landfills to the artificial sweeteners found in streams in this study their impact on the results if any is expected to be minimal as septic systems are far more common in the landscape furthermore the artificial sweetener used for loading estimates acesulfame was introduced for use in canada around 1988 gougeon et al 2004 and is therefore not expected to be present in older landfills which would be more susceptible to leaching to surface waters compared to more modern landfills that are better engineered to contain leachate in canada sac is the only artificial sweetener permitted in animal feed feeds regulations 1983 and therefore livestock manure particularly pig manure is another potential source of sac in these rural watersheds either through contamination of groundwater that discharges to a stream or by direct overland flow of manure contaminated runoff livestock manure has previously been identified as a potential source of artificial sweeteners particularly sac to the environment buerge et al 2011 ma et al 2017 several of the highest sac concentrations occurred where sac was also the dominant artificial sweetener present suggesting the possibility of a livestock source of sac at a few of our sites saccharin is also a breakdown product of some sulfonylurea herbicides berger and wolfe 1996 and therefore it is another potential source of some sac to groundwater and streams the application of biosolids is not expected to be a significant source of artificial sweeteners to groundwater due to their high solubility artificial sweeteners remain mostly in the liquid phase of treated sewage when it is dewatered for land application as biosolids pasquini et al 2013 subedi et al 2014 tran et al 2014b 2015 3 1 3 factors affecting the occurrence and concentration of artificial sweeteners in streams the frequency of occurrence and concentration of artificial sweeteners in streams are influenced by several factors including dietary preferences artificial sweetener degradability groundwater age and the relative amounts of the four artificial sweeteners in consumer products if a single septic system is responsible for the artificial sweeteners observed in a stream then the concentrations of the artificial sweeteners will be highly dependent on the diet of the members of that household these household specific influences diminish as the watershed size increases and more septic systems and people contribute to the stream artificial sweetener load unlike municipal effluents which typically discharge directly to surface waters artificial sweeteners derived from septic systems are affected by attenuation processes that can occur during transport in the groundwater flow system acesulfame and suc are much more resistant to degradation compared to cyc and sac buerge et al 2009 2011 ma et al 2017 scheurer et al 2009 2011 tran et al 2014 2015 studies have documented that when artificial sweeteners are found in groundwater ace is almost always detected if any other artificial sweetener is present and if only one is detected it is typically ace wu et al 2014 spoelstra et al 2017 this study therefore all else being the same as groundwater travel time increases the concentrations of the more degradable artificial sweeteners decreases eventually leaving only ace in an analysis of 20 domestic wells for a suite of 117 organic wastewater compounds owcs schaider et al 2016 found that ace was the most frequently detected owc and was always present if any other owc was detected further demonstrating the robustness of using ace as a wastewater tracer in groundwater as a consequence of their differing susceptibility to attenuation the artificial sweetener composition of a groundwater or stream sample can indicate something about how recently the wastewater entered the system and or the degree of treatment several studies have suggested or demonstrated that elevated concentrations of cyc and sac indicate the presence of untreated or undertreated wastewater buerge et al 2009 tran et al 2014a zirlewagen et al 2016 yang et al 2018 similarly high concentrations of all four artificial sweeteners in water samples indicates recent contamination by wastewater septic systems close to a stream are more likely to contribute all four artificial sweeteners since travel time would be relatively short thereby minimizing time for degradation conversely septic system plumes originating far away from the groundwater discharge area are likely to have lower concentrations or complete absence of the more degradable compounds another time distance consideration with respect to artificial sweetener concentrations in groundwater and their subsequent effect on streams are the dates they became available for consumer use saccharin and cyclamate were introduced in canada at least as far back as the 1970s whereas ace and suc became available for use more recently approximately 1988 and 1992 respectively gougeon et al 2004 as a consequence older sanitary wastewater plumes in groundwater between 1970 and 1988 would not contain ace or suc and if not already completely degraded should only contain cyc and sac two of the samples collected as part of this study had sac as the sole artificial sweetener present both 5 ng l and none had cyc or sac cyc without also having ace in canada groundwater containing suc must have recharged since 1992 and is therefore relatively young robertson et al 2016a 3 2 percentage of stream water derived from septic system effluent the fraction of streamflow derived from septic system effluent was estimated for each stream sample using a mean septic tank effluent ace concentration of 43 8 µg l 1 standard deviation 4 2 µg l from twelve single family septic systems snider et al 2017 and the measured stream ace concentrations the septic system data used from snider et al 2017 was collected mostly from ontario cottage properties that have seasonal to year round occupancy it is not known how well this data reflects artificial sweetener concentrations in septic systems of typical year round dwellings in southern ontario and this remains an opportunity for further research the streamflow contribution from water that was once discharged by a septic system ranged from 0 005 to a maximum value of just over 0 5 with a median of 0 052 fig 3 sampling was done during stream baseflow conditions therefore the measured concentrations of ace and other artificial sweeteners were likely higher than if sampling was done during higher flow periods and consequently the percentage of septic derived water calculated for these streams likely represents near maximum values however the effect of streamflow on the mass flux of artificial sweeteners at a given stream location is expected to be less dramatic since the lower artificial sweetener concentrations would be partially compensated for by the higher flow volumes by conducting the sampling campaigns during baseflow conditions the higher artificial sweetener concentrations allowed us to estimate mass fluxes at sites where ace concentrations might otherwise be below detection during higher flow periods artificial sweetener analysis provides useful constraints on the maximum impact that septic system effluent could have on stream water quality not surprisingly the fraction of streamflow that can be attributed to septic effluent is relatively small albeit almost ubiquitous in these rural watersheds similarly the low ace concentrations indicate that septic systems must generally contribute only small amounts of wastewater contaminants to streams even if these compounds are not degraded along the groundwater flow path however wastewater derived compounds that exhibit environmental impacts at very low concentrations e g hormone mimicking chemicals may still be of concern in streams with septic inputs 3 3 fraction of septic wastewater discharging to streams via groundwater flow given that septic systems ultimately discharge to shallow groundwater it is not surprising that some of this water eventually ends up in surface waters however as we demonstrate above even a small contribution of septic system effluent can be detected and quantified using ace concentrations to further investigate the fate of septic system effluent in rural watersheds we used stream artificial sweetener concentrations and ofat modelled flows to estimate the stream mass flux of each artificial sweetener which ranged from 1 to almost 1000 mg day km2 fig s3 as a recalcitrant tracer of wastewater we then used the mean per capita ace export from wastewater treatment plants in the grand river watershed ontario 7 mg person day spoelstra et al 2013 the ace loading values fig s3 and the pdrural values for each site to estimate the percentage of septic effluent generated in each watershed that ends up in the stream fig 4 ideally per capita ace loading values for septic effluent would be used for this calculation but these data were not available the percentage of septic effluent generated in each watershed that ends up in streams showed a wide range for small watersheds 0 5 to 174 and converged toward the overall median value of 13 with increasing catchment area fig 4 if we just consider samples from sites with catchment areas of 50 km2 or greater n 72 the mean value is 16 14 median 14 for catchments 100 km2 or greater in area n 35 the mean value is 13 10 median 12 in other words ace concentrations indicate that approximately 13 of septic effluent produced by the rural population in southern ontario is reaching local streams most of the septic effluent reaching surface waters will contain few other contaminants from the original effluent other than the most recalcitrant compounds e g ace and those that remain will be substantially diluted by stream water e g fig 3 for example spoelstra et al 2017 demonstrated that for a rural area in the nottawasaga river watershed ontario although more than 30 of groundwater samples contained artificial sweeteners from septic effluent septic effluent was not a significant source of the nitrate ammonium or soluble reactive phosphorus srp in the aquifer the estimated percentage of streamflow derived from septic effluent and the calculated percentage of septic effluent reaching southern ontario streams via groundwater discharge should be considered as conservative values since there are several underlying assumptions that could lead to these values being underestimated firstly the calculation assumes that there is no significant degradation of ace between the septic tank and the stream while ace is one of the most recalcitrant wastewater tracers currently used studies have shown that it can be broken down naturally in the environment by sunlight gan et al 2014 and biodegradation e g buerge et al 2011 castronovo et al 2017 the extent to which ace is broken down in groundwater flow systems including the infiltration bed of septic systems is unknown and likely highly variable buerge et al 2011 demonstrated ace biodegradation in surficial soils under aerobic unsaturated conditions and the lack of biodegradation in sub soils under saturated conditions with respect to septic system effluent the results of buerge et al 2011 suggest that ace biodegradation is more likely to occur in the near surface vadose zone and be much more recalcitrant once it reaches the deeper sub soils and groundwater assuming ace degradation does occur to some degree in the subsurface and or in stream our calculations would be underestimated by the fraction of ace degraded between the septic tank source and the sampling point another factor that could lead to underestimating the fraction of septic effluent making its way to streams is the fact that ace has only been in use in canada since 1988 gougeon et al 2004 therefore any septic system effluent reaching a stream that pre dates 1988 would not contain ace and therefore not be captured in our estimates all other factors being the same the chance that septic effluent discharging to a stream is old enough to pre date the use of ace increases with increasing distance between the septic system and stream i e greater groundwater travel time variation in the concentration of ace in different septic systems due to different dietary habits in individual households could also be a source of calculation uncertainty however as upstream catchment size increases the effects of this variability become reduced as more individual septic systems and people contribute to the measured ace in streams this dampening of the variability and a convergence toward the overall median value with increasing upstream catchment area can be observed in both figs 3 and 4 and suggests that the median values are representative of the overall contribution of septic effluent water in southern ontario streams albeit within the constraints of the assumptions outlined previously for these estimates 4 conclusions and implications the ability to detect even trace amounts of wastewater in the environment using artificial sweeteners and ace in particular enables the tracking of septic impacted groundwater to streams wetlands and lake shorelines it is important to reiterate the fact that if the groundwater flowpath is sufficiently long other wastewater constituents such as pathogens nutrients and pharmaceuticals may be completely removed from groundwater by attenuation processes occurring in the vadose zone below septic systems and in the saturated zone downgradient furthermore once groundwater reaches near stream areas riparian process have a high capacity to remove additional compounds within meters of the discharge point as such residual ace in discharging groundwater may be the only conclusive indicator that the water once originated as effluent from a septic

nitka et al 2019 the fact that sanitary wastewater was detected in 90 of stream samples also means that wastewater must be considered as a potential source of contaminants to streams even if no direct

inflows skewed those results to overestimate retention continuous monitoring of discharge and specific conductance for inflows and outflows along with discrete sampling for dissolved constituents were used to compute long term load based mass balance mild gains of tds 34 000 15 000 mg yr and u 0 1 0 5 mg yr in jmr were detected although the additions are small relative to uncertainty they indicate little to no retention of tds and u and likely additions from ungaged inflows in contrast an average of 0 6 0 2 mg yr or 23 of gaged inflow se was removed in jmr the study illustrates the benefit of

many of the above studies focus on short often 2 years records such efforts provide a snapshot of reservoir effects but rarely acknowledge that reservoirs particularly those used for storage are

important to understand the controls on these constituents much research has focused upon effects of irrigated agriculture and geology e g bern and stogner 2017 burkhalter and gates 2005 water quality effects of storage whether in main stem or off channel reservoirs has received less attention yet jmr is a major feature on the arkansas river that can hold 3 years of average main stem inflow off channel reservoirs in the region have 192 000 ml of live storage capacity and numerous head stabilization and infiltration ponds exist on individual farms lower concentrations of se in outflow from jmr relative to arkansas river inflow have been understood to indicate se retention by the reservoir ortiz et al 1998 however accounting for water quality effects from reservoirs in detail whether in jmr or elsewhere is difficult because of residence and mixing times non steady state conditions and changes in storage the goal of this study is to test independent methodologies over two different

years as a buffer against drier years 2 2 short term monthly sampling of inflow and outflow the short term assessments of jmr evaporation and mass balance are developed based on monthly samples collected from february 2017 through may 2018 at the streamgages for the two major inflows to the reservoir the arkansas and purgatoire rivers and the reservoir discharge below jmr fig 1 discharge measurements were made by the standard velocity area method rantz 1982 water quality samples at the streamgage sites were collected as multiple vertical profiles as averages of integrating water

system nwis usgs 2019 all isotopic analyses were conducted at the usgs reston stable isotope laboratory in reston virginia deuterium and oxygen isotope ratios of water were measured using a h2 and a

on a per mil basis relative to vsmow brand et al 2009 the 2 σ uncertainties of δ34s and δ18o results for baso4 are 0 4 and 0 4 respectively 2 3 short term isotope based measure of evaporation a short term measure of the fraction of water evaporated during storage in jmr was calculated based upon the isotopic enrichment of water that occurs with evaporation evaporation favors the lighter isotopes of oxygen and hydrogen in water and causes heavy isotope enrichment in the water left behind models like the revised craig gordon model craig and gordon 1965 skrzypek et al 2015 used here relate the degree of enrichment between initial and final water to a proportion of water evaporated for this study the degree of heavy isotope enrichment in outflow water compared to inflow water was used to calculate the fraction evaporated by using the hydrocalculator v 1 03 software skrzypek et al 2015 the non steady state equation was used treating initial water as a volume that becomes progressively more fractionated as it moves downstream the initial inflow water isotopic composition was represented by discharge weighting the 32 samples from the 16 monthly samples each from the two inflow locations main stem arkansas river and the purgatoire river yielding a discharge weighted average of δd 96 1 and δ18o 12 4 these values are intended to represent a volume weighted average composition of water mixing in the reservoir prior to effects from evaporation the same initial value is used for each calculation with different monthly outflow values average temperature relative humidity and isotopic composition of precipitation inflows are required by hydrocalculator to estimate the fraction evaporated average temperature measured at the dryland lamar 1 station of the coagmet network https coagmet colostate edu was 12 5 c for january december of 2017 and average relative humidity was about 59 the isotopic composition of precipitation was represented by the weighted averages δd 74 δ18o 10 6 from northeastern colorado also on the great plains harvey 2005 2 4 long term volume based measure of evaporation a long term measure of the fraction of water evaporated during storage covering water years october september 1988 to 2018 was made using usace data amy louise usace written comm 2019 these data provided as volumes on a daily time step included reservoir storage total inflow and evaporation reservoir storage had been calculated using reservoir elevation as an input and reservoir bathymetry total inflow had been calculated as change in storage plus outflow and evaporation and thus accounts for all inflow sources not just the two gaged inflows the evaporation rate from jmr had been estimated using a pan evaporation method at the reservoir e g harwell 2012 the daily thickness of water evaporated had been multiplied by surface area of water in the reservoir to determine evaporation volumes amy louise usace written comm 2019 volumes were summed to make calculations for individual water years from 1988 to 2018 and using volumes evaporated and volumes of inflows the fraction of water evaporated was calculated by dividing the former by the latter water volumes are provided in appendix a in addition to annual calculations a separate calculation was made for the 16 month period of monthly sampling as a whole for comparison to the isotopic assessment of evaporation 2 5 short term chloride based mass balance chloride is often used for mass balance purposes to estimate groundwater recharge subyani and şen 2006 or detect hydrologic perturbations cartwright et al 2013 here we attempt to use cl to index gains or losses of other dissolved constituents the short term measure of reservoir effects on so4 2 a major component of tds tds se and u as water passed through jmr is based solely upon results from the monthly sampling from february 2017 through may 2018 the chloride based approach is chemistry based and as such it avoids calculating loads and the problem of net storage or release during the period of analysis the method borrows the index element concept from soil science using one index constituent that is neither gained nor lost to reference gains or losses of other constituents in a setting where neither mass nor volume is constant chadwick et al 1990 in this case volume and mass are changing due to evaporation the index is the anion cl and the method assumes cl is neither added nor removed by chemical reactions in the reservoir as water evaporates the concentration of cl increases proportionately if other constituents are also only affected by evaporation their ratio to cl remains the same if they are lost however that ratio will decrease if they are gained that ratio will increase computations were made using ratios of each of the four constituents individually to cl lower values of the ratios in outflow compared to inflow indicated that removal had occurred in the reservoir using so4 2 as an example the estimate of the fraction f so4 2 removed for the period was made by 1 f r o r i 1 where ro is the 16 month discharge weighted average of so4 2 cl ratios for jmr outflow and ri is the 16 month discharge weighted average of so4 2 cl ratios for the combined inflows using instantaneous discharges at the time of sampling tds se and u were be substituted for so4 2 to obtain their removal estimates the methodology also assumes that monthly sampling adequately represented cl and the other constituents in all inflows and outflows from jmr an assumption challenged by known yet unmeasured inflows 2 6 long term load based mass balance the long term measure of jmr s effects on tds se and u draws upon streamgage data and covers the years 1988 2018 continuous monitoring discharge and sc data for the three streamgage sites fig 1 were collected by the usgs and are hosted by nwis usgs 2019 daily average discharge data from streamgages were summed to give annual volumes for the two inflow and one outflow locations fig 1 however beginning in november 2018 reservoir outflow was diverted past the outflow streamgage so that the stilling basin could be inspected therefore for the purpose of mass balance analysis all three streamgage records are terminated on october 30 2018 uncertainty for discharge values was set to 10 novak 1985 daily average sc data were available from continuous monitoring for the arkansas river both at las animas streamgage 07124000 and below jmr streamgage 07130500 for 1988 2018 the sc data were used to calculate daily loads of salts se and u at each of the streamgages however gaps in the sc records where daily average data were missing due to monitoring equipment issues first had to be filled gaps constituted 11 and 6 of the record and averaged 4 0 and 6 4 days respectively for the las animas and below jmr streamgages when sc data gaps were 3 days or less the single values before and after the gap were averaged to represent sc where gaps were 4 days or greater or if discharge trended across the gap the power law relation between daily average discharge and daily average sc e g bern et al 2015 2 sc a discharge b was determined using 2 days of data preceding the gap and after the gap here a and b are simply the slope and exponent of the relation that relation was then used to estimate intervening sc values from daily average discharge all statistical analyses were conducted in r v 3 5 1 uncertainty for daily average sc values was set to 10 continuous sc data for the purgatoire river 07128500 were only available for water years 1990 1996 but discrete measurements of sc were available n 410 for the period of 1988 2018 a weighted regression on time discharge and season wrtds was made for the purgatoire river using the r package egret hirsch and de cicco 2014 hirsch et al 2010 the resulting estimated daily values of sc compare well to the discrete measurements as well as the continuously monitored values from 1990 to 1996 fig a 1 the wrtds estimated values of sc are used as the sc record for the purgatoire river in subsequent calculations the discharge weighted average sc for each year for each streamgage was calculated by summing the product of average discharge and average sc for each day and dividing by the sum of discharge for the year the discharge weighted average sc for each year for each streamgage was then used to calculate discharge weighted average annual concentrations of tds se and u using the linear relations between sc and those constituents as determined by regression table 1 fig a 2 the regressions between sc and constituent data were developed from discrete sampling at the streamgages over multiple years including the recent monthly sampling data back to 1990s are used here to provide more thorough temporal coverage for the purgtoire river and below jmr table 1 data are archived in nwis usgs 2019 and standard errors were determined to assess uncertainty in the relationships table 1 because no semblance of a linear relationship was apparent between sc and se for the arkansas river below jmr table 1 fig 2 a a power law regression e g eq 2 was used instead for discharge in units of m3 s versus se concentration fig 2b the regression had an r2 of 0 53 and p 0 001 substituting se in µg l for sc in eq 2 the resulting value of a is 5 1041 se 0 0206 and b is 0 1351 se 1 0512 fig 2b a multiple regression incorporating both discharge and sc was also tested but the sc component was not quite significant at the 95 confidence limit p 0 051 loads of tds se and u for each streamgage for each year were calculated by multiplying annual total discharge by annual average constituent concentration for se in the arkansas river below jmr because of the non linear relationship between se and discharge fig 2b daily loads of se were calculated and summed for each year mass balance analysis of jmr is challenging because of the nature of reservoir operations in which water can be stored in one year and released in other years on an annual timestep water volume inflows and outflows can be substantially out of balance causing similar problems for load based analysis of constituents to overcome the issue mass balance calculations were done on sums of loads and water volumes from the entire 31 year period of analysis such an approach cancels out effects from inter annual retention and release though the difference in storage between january 1 1988 and october 30 2018 was considered uncertainties from the data sources and standard errors from the regressions were propagated through calculations using standard error propagation methodology taylor 1997 conducting the mass balance analysis for the 31 year period also favorably increased the magnitudes of inflow and outflow loads relative to uncertainty calculated water volumes and loads from the mass balance analysis are provided in appendices b e 3 results and discussion 3 1 patterns from monthly sampling the monthly discharge measurements from february 2017 through may 2018 show within year variability of inflow and outflow from jmr measured discharges in the upstream arkansas river and purgatoire river each range across two orders of magnitude and dam controlled discharges downstream from jmr range across three orders of magnitude fig 3 a sc has an inverse relationship with discharge for the inflows but mixing and retention of waters in the reservoir generally eliminate this relation downstream from jmr fig 3b downstream sc exhibits less variation than inflow sc and the most distinct pattern of outflow sc is a steady decline through 2017 that lags the large springtime inflow of low sc water temporal patterns for so4 2 concentration fig 3c mimic those of sc fig 3b reflecting so4 2 as the dominant contributor to total salt content of arkansas river waters miller et al 2010 and therefore sc calculating tds as the sum of measured constituents indicated that so4 2 is the major component of tds accounting for 50 60 35 73 and 45 60 of tds in the arkansas river at las animas purgatoire river and outflow from jmr respectively data not shown sulfate is the major component of tds selenium shows distinct differences between the two reservoir inflows fig 3d the arkansas river at las animas 13 5 µg l 9 5 17 1 µg l 16 month average and range has consistently greater se concentrations than the purgatoire river 5 0 µg l 2 1 7 9 µg l frequently twice as high concentrations of se in outflow from jmr 5 2 µg l 1 8 6 5 µg l are less than the arkansas river upstream for all samples and because the arkansas river contributes the majority of inflows to jmr the reservoir is generally considered a sink for se ortiz et al 1998 the pattern for u is similar uranium concentrations in the arkansas river at las animas 28 9 µg l 13 3 43 7 µg l are relatively high those in the purgatoire river 14 9 µg l 6 8 27 1 µg l are lower and concentrations in outflow from jmr 16 5 µg l 12 3 21 1 µg l are also low however concentrations of u in the arkansas river at las animas during peak inflows for may and june of 2017 13 3 and 13 3 µg l are less than the average for jmr outflow fig 3e that fact and the narrower differences between inflows and outflows make it unclear based upon concentration data alone whether jmr is a sink for u concentrations of mn fig 3f are relatively low in most samples but spikes in concentration downstream from jmr occurred in february and march of 2017 june and july of 2017 and november 2017 through january of 2018 increased mn concentration commonly reflects biogeochemical reducing conditions two of the spikes occur in winter fig 3f during winter the gates of the reservoir are generally closed and there are three relatively small sources of water to the arkansas river channel below jmr leakage past the gate seals water pumped from the foundation drains and groundwater seepage that moves under or around the dam carlos aragon usace oral comm 2018 flows from the foundation drains and groundwater have certainly passed through sediments and the sediments are likely to be low oxygen reducing environments the greatest concentrations of mn in early 2017 fig 3f correspond to the lowest concentrations of se fig 3d supporting the idea that reduction in sediments is removing se ortiz et al 1998 the winter of 2017 2018 has a smaller mn concentration spike but a drop in se is less obvious perhaps because downstream flows were greater fig 3a the june july 2017 spike in mn concentration is the smallest and any associated decrease in se is difficult to discern however monitoring by the usace found low oxygen conditions in the water column around the dam intake in may june and july of 2017 justin reale usace written comm 2019 that could allow mobilization of mn from bottom sediments combined with the june july mn spike such conditions are evidence of reduction at other times and places than in mid winter and in the under dam sediments concentrations of the relatively conservative solutes cl and br fig 3g h show temporal patterns of dilution during increased flow and mixing within jmr similar to so4 2 and u but with an important exception concentrations of br spike downstream in early 2017 when essentially no water is being released from jmr and seepage dominates along with possible regional groundwater discharge at the downstream gage this sharp spike in br indicates a substantial br source likely from regional groundwater that makes cl a better choice as a conservative ion to index mass balance in section 3 4 the water isotope ratios δd and δ18o measured in monthly samples trace sources of water and processes affecting water values of water isotope ratios in the arkansas river at las animas are relatively low fig 4 a reflecting sources dominated by rocky mountain snowpack and limited increases driven by evaporation however they do not reach the 19 to 20 values of average snowpack in the arkansas river basin anderson et al 2016 the difference is likely due to snowmelt mixing with rainfall in upstream reservoirs along with upstream evaporation isotopic ratios in the purgatoire river are greater reflecting either greater evaporation of snowpack derived water larger contributions from local meteoric water on the great plains or both isotopic ratios in the arkansas river below jmr are also relatively enriched reflecting mixing of the two inflows however enrichment caused by evaporation is also indicated for the reservoir outflow because the outflow samples plot farther rightward relative to both the purgatoire river samples and the global meteoric water line e g gonfiantini 1986 patterns relative to timing further illustrate evaporation driven enrichment illustrated by δ18o fig 4b water isotope ratios in the arkansas river at las animas are lowest during spring runoff of snowmelt the more muted signal in 2018 reflects that the winter of 2017 2018 had a poor snowpack in the mountains samples from the purgatoire river are more enriched than outflow from jmr during spring and summer months outflow from jmr has muted seasonal differences reflecting mixing and residence time in the reservoir but its consistent enrichment relative to inflows reflects evaporation as with the water isotopes values of δ34s and δ18o reflect sources and processes affecting so4 2 values of δ34s in so4 2 for reservoir inflows from the arkansas river at las animas and the purgatoire river have relatively narrow ranges of 15 0 to 13 2 and 15 8 to 13 2 respectively fig 4c the reservoir inflow values are quite depleted compared to the range for sulfate 4 0 to 8 2 in rocky mountain snowpack mast et al 2001 naftz et al 2011 and much more depleted than expected values 14 to 16 for evaporite salts associated with cretaceous age formations in the arkansas river basin claypool et al 1980 the values are within the range 34 7 to 16 7 and similar to the average 19 7 values for pyrite or salts derived from pyrite weathering in cretaceous formations and shales which predominate geology in the basin gautier 1986 green 1992 values of δ34s in the arkansas and purgatoire rivers are also similar to those in the uncompahgre river at delta in western colorado 18 4 to 17 8 where the so4 2 load is dominated by leaching of gypsum and other salts derived from weathering of pyrite in the cretaceous age mancos shale tuttle and grauch 2009 the mancos shale west of the rocky mountains is coeval with the niobrara formation east of the mountains in the arkansas river valley bern and stogner 2017 values of δ18o in so4 2 for the arkansas river at las animas and the purgatoire river have narrow ranges of 0 3 to 2 9 and 0 5 to 2 8 such values match well with expectations of values near 2 2 based upon upstream δ18o values of 13 9 in snowmelt dominated water and partial incorporation of atmospheric oxygen to so4 2 derived from pyrite bern et al in press van stempvoort and krouse 1994 both isotopes indicate that shale associated pyrite sources dominate so4 2 entering jmr and that the sources are either homogenous themselves or relatively well mixed however the isotopes do not distinguish whether that pyrite has weathered recently or in the geologic past with so4 2 subsequently stored as gypsum in the unsaturated zone until mobilized by water examining isotopic values of δ34s through time fig 4d the most striking variations occur in the arkansas river below jmr during winter when dam releases were minimal fig 3a at the times of sampling discharge at the site averaged 0 04 m3 s in february and march of 2017 averaged 0 2 m3 s over november 2017 to january 2018 and averaged 12 9 m3 s over the other 11 sampling events the lowest flows generated the greatest δ34s and δ18o values in so4 2 bacterial sulfate reduction enriches the δ34s and δ18o of so4 2 and the slope of 0 5 between the two isotopes for samples from below jmr is similar to that expected for such reduction nriagu et al 1991 notable enrichment of the heavy isotopes during the lowest flows also corresponding to spikes in mn fig 3f indicating that reducing conditions occur in the sediments in and around the dam it is only during the lowest flows that waters that have interacted with such sediments make up a substantial fraction of the flow another subtle pattern of enrichment occurs in late summer fig 4d overlapping with the midsummer mn spike fig 3f and again indicates reduction at other times and places other than mid winter and in the under dam sediments 3 2 short term isotope based evaporation the short term measure of evaporation in jmr is based upon water isotope ratios δd and δ18o reported above the fractions of water evaporated in jmr as determined separately using δd and δ18o from monthly samples collected below jmr were averaged for each month and are shown in fig 5 the observed fraction evaporated in outflow reflects residence time inflow volumes and seasonal evaporation rates the value is relatively high in march and april of 2017 for water present all winter when inflow discharges were small the fraction decreases rapidly as snowmelt fills the reservoir in may and june and due to lag time and mixing the fraction continues to decrease in july as summer wears on with warmer and drier conditions the fraction evaporated increases relative increases in inflow discharge in january and february of 2018 drive the fraction down but decreased inflow in march and april allow the fraction to increase the fraction evaporated as averaged monthly for δd and δ18o and then discharge weighted over 16 months is 12 because their individual discharge magnitudes and isotopic compositions are unknown unmeasured inflows from gageby creek rule creek groundwater and return flow represent sources of uncertainty related to the short term measure of evaporation 3 3 long term volume based evaporation the usace data for volumes evaporated and volumes of total inflow provide the long term measure of evaporation calculated by dividing the former by the latter usace 2019 that measure was calculated for february 2017 through may 2018 to compare with the short term isotopic estimate and also yielded a value of 12 for the 16 month period the match between isotopic and usace estimates of evaporation lends confidence to both methods the long term evaporation fractions from the usace data range from 6 to 30 for 1988 2018 such a range of values overestimate actual variability in evaporation however because of movement of water in and out of porosity in the material surrounding the reservoir as detailed in section 3 5 the fraction of water evaporated from jmr over 31 years is 11 and this estimate is less influenced by such shorter term water movement in and out of surrounding material 3 4 short term chloride indexed mass balance ratios of so4 2 tds se and u to cl from the 16 month sampling are the basis for the short term mass balance analysis for those constituents fig 6 fractionation of isotopes in so4 2 indicates that reduction has removed so4 2 from waters downstream from jmr and might have removed se and u which are also redox sensitive visually comparing the two metrics helps illustrate how ratios like so4 2 cl can trace removal the conservative anion cl serves as an index by which removal of the constituents is assessed if so4 2 cl ratios decline between inflows and outflow it could be interpreted that so4 2 has been removed increased δ34s between inflows and outflow is a fingerprint of microbially mediated reduction nriagu et al 1991 combined lower values of the so4 2 cl ratio and greater δ34s indicate that so4 2 removal by reduction has occurred for so4 2 fig 6a some removal during low outflows is apparent as expected as evidenced by low so4 2 cl ratios corresponding to greater δ34s values however based upon a discharge weighted so4 2 cl ratio of 15 8 for inflows and 15 5 for outflows average removal of so4 2 in jmr during the 16 months of sampling is only 2 some removal of tds is suggested visually by the lower tds cl ratios at low flows and based upon the discharge weighted inflow ratio of 29 5 and discharge weighted outflow ratio of 27 4 tds removal of 7 of tds is suggested greater removal of tds than so4 2 is a clue that the cl index is not providing an accurate picture of reservoir effects because so4 2 removal is generally offset by alkalinity gains e g schindler 1986 thus less tds than so4 2 retention would be expected additionally tds transport in surface water and through reservoirs is generally conservative kelly 2001 for se removal is visually apparent in the low flow samples because markedly lower se cl ratios correspond to greater δ34s values fig 6c the discharge weighted se cl ratio of inflows 0 29 and outflows 0 14 indicate 52 removal of se during february 2017 through may 2018 visually it also appears that u is retained under reducing conditions coinciding with low discharges fig 6d the discharge weighted u cl ratio of inflows 0 45 and outflows 0 39 indicate 15 removal of u in summary cl indexed mass balance indicates 2 7 52 and 15 removal of so4 2 tds se and u respectively based on the short term dataset from february 2017 through may 2018 inflow of water with greater cl content than the gaged inflows would cause overestimation of removal and as detailed in section 3 6 there is reason to suspect that the short term removal estimates are overestimates 3 5 long term load based mass balance the long term mass balance analysis is based upon determining loads which hinge upon water volumes year to year changes in stored water volumes pose one challenge to mass balance analysis of jmr or any reservoir fig 7 a peak annual storage in jmr usually occurs in spring and ranges from a high of 562 034 ml in may 1999 to a low of 38 644 ml in april 2013 or 201 to 14 respectively of the average combined inflow from the arkansas and purgatoire rivers of 279 394 ml fig 7b by conducting the load analysis on the full 31 year period only the net decrease in storage between january 1 1988 333 467 ml and october 30 2018 164 126 ml usace 2019 is relevant to the mass balance that 169 341 ml difference is only 2 1 of total gaged outflows from jmr over the 31 year period to avoid having to make assumptions about tds se and u concentrations of that water the decrease in storage is omitted from the analysis thus causing some underestimate of any retention of constituents in jmr however as the difference is only 2 1 of outflow volume it is overshadowed by other uncertainties inflows not measured by the two upstream streamgages are another challenge to mass balance analysis the usace accounts for total gross inflow volumes usace 2019 by comparing changes in storage to estimated evaporation and gaged outflow amy louise usace written comm 2019 ungaged inflows can be determined as the difference between the usace total gross inflow and combined gaged inflows fig 7c ungaged inflows range from 82 476 ml in 2015 a year of reservoir filling to 64 076 in 2000 a year of substantial drawdown fig 7a b c connection to the timing of changes in storage and occasional negative ungaged inflows indicate that the method to track ungaged inflows calculated as above includes movement of water into and out of porosity surrounding jmr the minimum and maximum ungaged inflows are 30 and 23 respectively of the average combined inflow from the arkansas and purgatoire rivers of 279 394 ml and occur in 2015 and 2000 respectively such movement of water into and out of surrounding porosity can distort mass balance analysis particularly calculated on shorter time scales over the 31 year analysis 391 295 ml of ungaged inflow entered jmr which is only 4 5 more than the 8 661 224 ml of gaged inflow though volumes of ungaged inflows can be quantified the individual volumes compositions and loads of inflows from gageby creek rule creek groundwater and return flow are unknown to avoid having to make assumptions about tds se and u loads from these volumetrically small sources they are omitted from the analysis with the acknowledgement that underestimation of any constituent retention in jmr may result one other ungaged water flux opposes the mass balance effects of net storage change and ungaged inflows ungaged seepage under and around the jmr dam occurs but is difficult to quantify carlos aragon usace oral comm 2018 by bypassing the outflow streamgage seepage can cause overestimation of any retention of constituents in jmr and oppose to some degree the underestimates described above in this section having determined that change in net storage is relatively small over 31 years and that ungaged inflows and outflows are also relatively small and somewhat counteract each other s effects water volumes in the mass balance can be considered from 1988 to 2018 7 164 692 716 469 ml of water entered jmr from the arkansas river and 1 496 532 149 653 ml entered from the purgatoire river on an annual basis the purgatoire river accounts for 7 50 of the gaged inflows to jmr and over the total period analyzed it contributes 17 total discharge below jmr was 8 227 471 822 747 ml after subtracting the net release from storage between january 1 1988 and october 30 2018 gaged discharge from jmr is 93 of inflow indicating only 7 evaporation that value is smaller than the 11 value from usace data and indicates that ungaged inflows exceed ungaged seepage around the dam thus load based estimates of constituent retention in jmr are likely to be underestimates residence times of water in jmr can be calculated by dividing average storage for a given year by either inflow or outflow for that year fig 7a b using inflow residence time of water in jmr ranges 0 1 1 7 years and averages 0 5 year using outflow residence time ranges 0 1 1 1 years but also averages 0 5 year beyond the uncertainty of water volumes the mass balance of tds se and u includes uncertainty from the regressions table 1 fig a 2 and the 10 uncertainty assigned to the sc records the degree to which concentrations of tds se and u were accurately estimated from sc and regressions can be observed by comparing predictions to measured values from the 16 monthly samples generally predictions of tds match well for all three sites fig 8 a d g a few exceptions exist for the purgatoire river but those likely reflect that the continuous sc record there had to be generated from discrete samples via wrtds in contrast se concentrations match less well fig 8b e h reflecting the poorer correlations between sc and se table 1 below jmr se is predicted based upon discharge again with moderate success but incorporating sc via the multiple regression would not have been a substantial improvement fig 8h uranium is predicted better than se fig 8c f i reflecting better fits from the regressions how the various uncertainties manifest in the mass balance can be observed in calculated annual average concentrations of tds se and u uncertainty for any individual values in a given year is notable but variations through time reflect known processes in the upstream arkansas river and the differences between the monitoring locations are large enough to discern reservoir processes concentrations of tds and u fig 9 a c are slightly elevated in the arkansas river at las animas during 1988 and 1996 2000 because salts were flushed from the landscape to the river following times of above average water availability fig 7b bern et al in press concentration peaks in 2002 and 2012 are the results of droughts reducing dilution fig 7b tds and u concentrations in discharge from jmr reflect both mixing from the two inflows and a lag due to residence time in the reservoir selenium concentrations fig 9b show less year to year variability than tds or u this is true for both the sc derived values in inflows and the discharge derived values in outflow for this study consistency over time lends confidence to the calculated values across all years concentrations of se are greatest in the arkansas river at las animas lowest in the purgatoire river and intermediate in jmr discharge the mass balance analysis itself focuses upon loads using tds as an example the issue that inter annual storage poses for mass balance can be examined for individual years from 1988 to 2018 the difference between outflow loads and inflow loads range 257 000 to 343 000 mg yr the outflow loads scale with discharge and net storage or release distort the mass balance by summing loads for the full 31 year period a less distorted picture can be obtained but it is one that necessarily represents average effects without year to year detail from 1988 to 2018 8 045 927 264 715 mg of tds entered jmr from the arkansas river and 2 260 737 138 798 mg of tds entered from the purgatoire river discharge below jmr contained 11 363 829 374 993 mg of tds outflows of tds are therefore 110 of inflows and the difference indicates that ungaged inflows contribute at least 34 102 15 469 mg yr of tds to jmr in contrast to the extra tds in discharge se loads in jmr discharge are less than measured inflow loads from 1988 to 2018 75 4 6 1 mg of se entered jmr from the arkansas river and 6 1 0 8 mg entered from the purgatoire river discharge below jmr contained 63 3 6 mg of se indicating that 19 7 1 mg or 23 of the measured se inflow had been retained in jmr the average is 0 6 0 2 mg of se per year considering additional se entering jmr via ungaged inflows and that ungaged inflow volumes likely exceed ungaged outflow volumes this is a minimum value uranium outflow from jmr is quite similar to uranium inflow from 1988 to 2018 130 7 6 3 mg of u entered jmr from the arkansas river and 13 2 1 3 mg entered from the purgatoire river discharge below jmr contained 147 13 mg of u the difference indicates some extra 3 4 14 4 mg of u in outflows versus inflows a gain of 2 3 annually the average gain is 0 1 0 5 mg though that value is small relative to uncertainty it indicates that substantial u is not being retained in jmr and that ungaged inflows also contribute u to jmr in summary jmr retains about 23 of se that enters and ungaged inflows contribute measurable tds and possibly some u to reservoir discharge 3 6 comparison of mass balance results short term cl indexed mass balance results indicate 7 52 and 15 removal of tds se and u in jmr respectively and all short term removal fractions are substantially greater than the long term load based results the discrepancies seem driven more by differences in methodology than time frame in particular 7 retention of tds a constituent unlikely to be retained indicates that the cl indexed method overestimates retention of all constituents the likely cause is gains of substantial cl from ungaged sources particularly groundwater as an example of potential groundwater contributions a cl concentration of 94 mg l has been measured from a well fig 1 close to the upper end of jmr usgs 380507103073600 https waterdata usgs gov nwis qw usgs 2019 the measured cl groundwater concentration is greater than all but two of the jmr inflow and outflow samples fig 3g and illustrates how a relatively small contribution of ungaged groundwater inflow fig 7c could cause overestimation of constituent removal by enhancing cl concentrations in outflow eq 1 overestimation is disappointing because the cl index method would have been a relatively simple way to overcome issues with ungaged inflows and changes in reservoir storage even with short sampling records the method may yet be useful in settings where either all inflows can be adequately characterized or where ungaged inflows are not so chemically dissimilar to gaged inflows in contrast to the cl index results the 10 tds gain 23 se removal and 2 3 u gain from the long term load based mass balance are more dependable estimates of jmr s effects on water quality although the se removal value is a minimum the 31 year record largely overwhelmed the net change in storage between the beginning and end of the record as well as intermediate changes in storage fig 7a by analyzing the long term record effects of ungaged inflows and the movement of water in and out of surrounding materials fig 7c were also largely overcome uncertainty that was substantial relative to individual years fig 8 was proportionately smaller for loads summed across 31 years 3 7 selenium retention removal of se by jmr is a water quality benefit though not one unique to this reservoir engberg 1999 average se concentrations in jmr outflow still exceed the 4 6 µg l chronic wildlife toxicity standard colorado department of public health and the environment cdphe 2016 but they are substantially less than arkansas river inflow concentrations figs 3d 9b the link between lower se concentrations enriched sulfate isotope ratios fig 4c d point to biogeochemical reduction as playing a role in se removal correspondence between low se concentrations below jmr and mid winter low discharges fig 3a d indicate that as waters seep through low oxygen sediments in and around the jmr dam microbially facilitated reduction causes dissolved selenate seo4 2 and selenite seo3 2 precipitation as insoluble elemental selenium se0 oremland et al 1989 however the mn spikes and low oxygen conditions in the reservoir water column justin reale usace written comm 2019 indicate that se reduction and retention might occur more broadly in the reservoir selenium immobilization in wetland sediments as elemental and organic matter associated se or volatilization from plants in the wetland upstream from jmr fig 1 might also aid in se removal gao et al 2003 zhang and moore 1997 all these processes could contribute to se removal average annual rate 0 6 0 2 mg yr prior to outflow from jmr 4 conclusions discerning reservoir effects on water quality is challenging because net storage or release and movement of water into and out of surrounding porosity can alter the relation of outflows relative to inflows for a given time period and drive various degrees of mixing and lag times for waters passing through the reservoir here different methodologies were used and compared for assessing the effects of reservoir storage on water quantity and quality water isotopes were used to estimate evaporation for jmr yielding a 12 loss for a short term 16 month period in 2017 2018 and matching the fraction of evaporation calculated by the usace using pan evaporation and reservoir surface area evaporation estimated by the pan method averaged 11 for 1988 2018 isotopes of sulfate were used to detect biogeochemical reducing conditions in low flow discharges from jmr including seepage waters that had passed through sediments in and around the reservoir isotopes of sulfate also identified pyrite oxidation in upstream regions as the dominant source of sulfate and therefore tds to jmr that pyrite may have oxidized in the geologic past and resided in the subsurface as gypsum prior to mobilization short term mass balance calculations that used cl as an index overestimated retention of other constituents in jmr likely because of ungaged inflows containing substantial cl thirty one year records of discharge and sc monitoring along with discrete sampling for tds se and u were used to calculate mass balances for those constituents that overcame the inflow outflow issues jmr retains an average of 0 6 0 2 mg yr of se or 23 of inflows values that can be regarded as minimums discharges from jmr on average contain slightly greater loads of tds and u than inflows but the additions are small relative to uncertainty and are likely derived from ungaged inflows confidence in these patterns is possible because the long term 31 year record overwhelms the shorter term changes in net storage and influence of ungaged inflows and outflows because storage reservoirs are subject to residence and mixing times non steady state conditions and changes in storage longer time scale mass balance approaches like those demonstrated here are best for determining

8593,water quality and quantity can be influenced by transit through and storage in reservoirs assessing such effects can be challenging however because of mixing and residence times and inter annual

on water volumes and the problematic constituents salinity total dissolved solids tds selenium se and uranium u methodologies addressed short term 16 months and long term 31 years effects depending upon data availability evaporation was assessed by using isotopes of water to determine 12 short term evaporation and by pan evaporation and changes in storage to determine 11 long term evaporation salinity se and u mass balance were assessed by using chloride cl as an index by which to measure short term gains or losses between inflows and outflows in the short term chloride gain from ungaged inflows skewed those results to overestimate retention continuous monitoring of discharge and specific conductance for inflows and outflows along with discrete sampling for dissolved constituents were used to compute long term load based mass balance mild gains of tds 34 000 15 000 mg yr and u 0 1 0 5 mg yr in jmr were detected although the additions are small relative to uncertainty they indicate little to no retention of tds and u and likely additions from ungaged inflows in contrast an average of 0 6 0 2 mg yr or 23 of gaged inflow se was removed in jmr the study illustrates the benefit of

many of the above studies focus on short often 2 years records such efforts provide a snapshot of reservoir effects but rarely acknowledge that reservoirs particularly those used for storage are

jmr relative to arkansas river inflow have been understood to indicate se retention by the reservoir ortiz et al 1998 however accounting for water quality effects from reservoirs in detail whether in

term measure of the fraction of water evaporated during storage in jmr was calculated based upon the isotopic enrichment of water that occurs with evaporation evaporation favors the lighter isotopes of oxygen and hydrogen in water and causes heavy isotope enrichment in the water left behind models like the revised craig gordon model craig and gordon 1965 skrzypek et al 2015 used here relate the degree of enrichment between initial and final water to a proportion of water evaporated for this study the degree of heavy isotope enrichment in outflow water compared to inflow water was used to calculate the fraction evaporated by using the hydrocalculator v 1 03 software skrzypek et al 2015 the non steady state equation was used treating initial water as a volume that becomes progressively more fractionated as it moves downstream the initial inflow water isotopic composition was represented by discharge weighting the 32 samples from the 16 monthly samples each from the two inflow locations main stem arkansas river and the purgatoire river yielding a discharge weighted average of δd 96 1 and δ18o 12 4 these values are intended to represent a volume weighted average composition of water mixing in the reservoir prior to effects from evaporation the same initial value is used for each calculation with different monthly outflow values average temperature relative humidity and isotopic composition of precipitation inflows are required by hydrocalculator to estimate the fraction evaporated average temperature measured at the dryland lamar 1 station of the coagmet network https coagmet colostate edu was 12 5 c for january december of 2017 and average relative humidity was about 59 the isotopic composition of precipitation was represented by the weighted averages δd 74 δ18o 10 6 from northeastern colorado also on the great plains harvey 2005 2 4 long term volume based measure of evaporation a long term measure of the fraction of water evaporated during storage covering water years october september 1988 to 2018 was made using usace data amy louise usace written comm 2019 these data provided as volumes on a daily time step included reservoir storage total inflow and evaporation reservoir storage had been calculated using reservoir elevation as an input and reservoir bathymetry total inflow had been calculated as change in storage plus outflow and evaporation and thus accounts for all inflow sources not just the two gaged inflows the evaporation rate from jmr had been estimated using a pan evaporation method at the reservoir e g harwell 2012 the daily thickness of water evaporated had been multiplied by surface area of water in the reservoir to determine evaporation volumes amy louise usace written comm 2019 volumes were summed to make calculations for individual water years from 1988 to 2018 and using volumes evaporated and volumes of inflows the fraction of water evaporated was calculated by dividing the former by the latter water volumes are provided in appendix a in addition to annual calculations a separate calculation was made for the 16 month period of monthly sampling as a whole for comparison to the isotopic assessment of evaporation 2 5 short term chloride based mass balance chloride is often used for mass balance purposes to estimate groundwater recharge subyani and şen 2006 or detect hydrologic perturbations cartwright et al 2013 here we attempt to use cl to index gains or losses of other dissolved constituents the short term measure of reservoir effects on so4 2 a major component of tds tds se and u as water passed through jmr is based solely upon results from the monthly sampling from february 2017 through may 2018 the chloride based approach is chemistry based and as such it avoids calculating loads and the problem of net storage or release during the period of analysis the method borrows the index element concept from soil science using one index constituent that is neither gained nor lost to reference gains or losses of other constituents in a setting where neither mass nor volume is constant chadwick et al 1990 in this case volume and mass are changing due to evaporation the index is the anion cl and the method assumes cl is neither added nor removed by chemical reactions in the reservoir as water evaporates the concentration of cl increases proportionately if other constituents are also only affected by evaporation their ratio to cl remains the same if they are lost however that ratio will decrease if they are gained that ratio will increase computations were made using ratios of each of the four constituents individually to cl lower values of the ratios in outflow compared to inflow indicated that removal had occurred in the reservoir using so4 2 as an example the estimate of the fraction f so4 2 removed for the period was made by 1 f r o r i 1 where ro is the 16 month discharge weighted average of so4 2 cl ratios for jmr outflow and ri is the 16 month discharge weighted average of so4 2 cl ratios for the combined inflows using instantaneous discharges at the time of sampling tds se and u were be substituted for so4 2 to obtain their removal estimates the methodology also assumes that monthly sampling adequately represented cl and the other constituents in all inflows and outflows from jmr an assumption challenged by known yet unmeasured inflows 2 6 long term load based mass balance the long term measure of jmr s effects on tds se and u draws upon streamgage data and covers the years 1988 2018 continuous monitoring discharge and sc data for the three streamgage sites fig 1 were collected by the usgs and are hosted by nwis usgs 2019 daily average discharge data from streamgages were summed to give annual volumes for the two inflow and one outflow locations fig 1 however beginning in november 2018 reservoir outflow was diverted past the outflow streamgage so that the stilling basin could be inspected therefore for the purpose of mass balance analysis all three streamgage records are terminated on october 30 2018 uncertainty for discharge values was set to 10 novak 1985 daily average sc data were available from continuous monitoring for the arkansas river both at las animas streamgage 07124000 and below jmr streamgage 07130500 for 1988 2018 the sc data were used to calculate daily loads of salts se and u at each of the streamgages however gaps in the sc records where daily average data were missing due to monitoring equipment issues first had to be filled gaps constituted 11 and 6 of the record and averaged 4 0 and 6 4 days respectively for the las animas and below jmr streamgages when sc data gaps were 3 days or less the single values before and after the gap were averaged to represent sc where gaps were 4 days or greater or if discharge trended across the gap the power law relation between daily average discharge and daily average sc e g bern et al 2015 2 sc a discharge b was determined using 2 days of data preceding the gap and after the gap here a and b are simply the slope and exponent of the relation that relation was then used to estimate intervening sc values from daily average discharge all statistical analyses were conducted in r v 3 5 1 uncertainty for daily average sc values was set to 10 continuous sc data for the purgatoire river 07128500 were only available for water years 1990 1996 but discrete measurements of sc were available n 410 for the period of 1988 2018 a weighted regression on time discharge and season wrtds was made for the purgatoire river using the r package egret hirsch and de cicco 2014 hirsch et al 2010 the resulting estimated daily values of sc compare well to the discrete measurements as well as the continuously monitored values from 1990 to 1996 fig a 1 the wrtds estimated values of sc are used as the sc record for the purgatoire river in subsequent calculations the discharge weighted average sc for each year for each streamgage was calculated by summing the product of average discharge and average sc for each day and dividing by the sum of discharge for the year the discharge weighted average sc for each year for each streamgage was then used to calculate discharge weighted average annual concentrations of tds se and u using the linear relations between sc and those constituents as determined by regression table 1 fig a 2 the regressions between sc and constituent data were developed from discrete sampling at the streamgages over multiple years including the recent monthly sampling data back to 1990s are used here to provide more thorough temporal coverage for the purgtoire river and below jmr table 1 data are archived in nwis usgs 2019 and standard errors were determined to assess uncertainty in the relationships table 1 because no semblance of a linear relationship was apparent between sc and se for the arkansas river below jmr table 1 fig 2 a a power law regression e g eq 2 was used instead for discharge in units of m3 s versus se concentration fig 2b the regression had an r2 of 0 53 and p 0 001 substituting se in µg l for sc in eq 2 the resulting value of a is 5 1041 se 0 0206 and b is 0 1351 se 1 0512 fig 2b a multiple regression incorporating both discharge and sc was also tested but the sc component was not quite significant at the 95 confidence limit p 0 051 loads of tds se and u for each streamgage for each year were calculated by multiplying annual total discharge by annual average constituent concentration for se in the arkansas river below jmr because of the non linear relationship between se and discharge fig 2b daily loads of se were calculated and summed for each year mass balance analysis of jmr is challenging because of the nature of reservoir operations in which water can be stored in one year and released in other years on an annual timestep water volume inflows and outflows can be substantially out of balance causing similar problems for load based analysis of constituents to overcome the issue mass balance calculations were done on sums of loads and water volumes from the entire 31 year period of analysis such an approach cancels out effects from inter annual retention and release though the difference in storage between january 1 1988 and october 30 2018 was considered uncertainties from the data sources and standard errors from the regressions were propagated through calculations using standard error propagation methodology taylor 1997 conducting the mass balance analysis for the 31 year period also favorably increased the magnitudes of inflow and outflow loads relative to uncertainty calculated water volumes and loads from the mass balance analysis are provided in appendices b e 3 results and discussion 3 1 patterns from monthly sampling the monthly discharge measurements from february 2017 through may 2018 show within year variability of inflow and outflow from jmr measured discharges in the upstream arkansas river and purgatoire river each range across two orders of magnitude and dam controlled discharges downstream from jmr range across three orders of magnitude fig 3 a sc has an inverse relationship with discharge for the inflows but mixing and retention of waters in the reservoir generally eliminate this relation downstream from jmr fig 3b downstream sc exhibits less variation than inflow sc and the most distinct pattern of outflow sc is a steady decline through 2017 that lags the large springtime inflow of low sc water temporal patterns for so4 2 concentration fig 3c mimic those of sc fig 3b reflecting so4 2 as the dominant contributor to total salt content of arkansas river waters miller et al 2010 and therefore sc calculating tds as the sum of measured constituents indicated that so4 2 is the major component of tds accounting for 50 60 35 73 and 45 60 of tds in the arkansas river at las animas purgatoire river and outflow from jmr respectively data not shown sulfate is the major component of tds selenium shows distinct differences between the two reservoir inflows fig 3d the arkansas river at las animas 13 5 µg l 9 5 17 1 µg l 16 month average and range has consistently greater se concentrations than the purgatoire river 5 0 µg l 2 1 7 9 µg l frequently twice as high concentrations of se in outflow from jmr 5 2 µg l 1 8 6 5 µg l are less than the arkansas river upstream for all samples and because the arkansas river contributes the majority of inflows to jmr the reservoir is generally considered a sink for se ortiz et al 1998 the pattern for u is similar uranium concentrations in the arkansas river at las animas 28 9 µg l 13 3 43 7 µg l are relatively high those in the purgatoire river 14 9 µg l 6 8 27 1 µg l are lower and concentrations in outflow from jmr 16 5 µg l 12 3 21 1 µg l are also low however concentrations of u in the arkansas river at las animas during peak inflows for may and june of 2017 13 3 and 13 3 µg l are less than the average for jmr outflow fig 3e that fact and the narrower differences between inflows and outflows make it unclear based upon concentration data alone whether jmr is a sink for u concentrations of mn fig 3f are relatively low in most samples but spikes in concentration downstream from jmr occurred in february and march of 2017 june and july of 2017 and november 2017 through january of 2018 increased mn concentration commonly reflects biogeochemical reducing conditions two of the spikes occur in winter fig 3f during winter the gates of the reservoir are generally closed and there are three relatively small sources of water to the arkansas river channel below jmr leakage past the gate seals water pumped from the foundation drains and groundwater seepage that moves under or around the dam carlos aragon usace oral comm 2018 flows from the foundation drains and groundwater have certainly passed through sediments and the sediments are likely to be low oxygen reducing environments the greatest concentrations of mn in early 2017 fig 3f correspond to the lowest concentrations of se fig 3d supporting the idea that reduction in sediments is removing se ortiz et al 1998 the winter of 2017 2018 has a smaller mn concentration spike but a drop in se is less obvious perhaps because downstream flows were greater fig 3a the june july 2017 spike in mn concentration is the smallest and any associated decrease in se is difficult to discern however monitoring by the usace found low oxygen conditions in the water column around the dam intake in may june and july of 2017 justin reale usace written comm 2019 that could allow mobilization of mn from bottom sediments combined with the june july mn spike such conditions are evidence of reduction at other times and places than in mid winter and in the under dam sediments concentrations of the relatively conservative solutes cl and br fig 3g h show temporal patterns of dilution during increased flow and mixing within jmr similar to so4 2 and u but with an important exception concentrations of br spike downstream in early 2017 when essentially no water is being released from jmr and seepage dominates along with possible regional groundwater discharge at the downstream gage this sharp spike in br indicates a substantial br source likely from regional groundwater that makes cl a better choice as a conservative ion to index mass balance in section 3 4 the water isotope ratios δd and δ18o measured in monthly samples trace sources of water and processes affecting water values of water isotope ratios in the arkansas river at las animas are relatively low fig 4 a reflecting sources dominated by rocky mountain snowpack and limited increases driven by evaporation however they do not reach the 19 to 20 values of average snowpack in the arkansas river basin anderson et al 2016 the difference is likely due to snowmelt mixing with rainfall in upstream reservoirs along with upstream evaporation isotopic ratios in the purgatoire river are greater reflecting either greater evaporation of snowpack derived water larger contributions from local meteoric water on the great plains or both isotopic ratios in the arkansas river below jmr are also relatively enriched reflecting mixing of the two inflows however enrichment caused by evaporation is also indicated for the reservoir outflow because the outflow samples plot farther rightward relative to both the purgatoire river samples and the global meteoric water line e g gonfiantini 1986 patterns relative to timing further illustrate evaporation driven enrichment illustrated by δ18o fig 4b water isotope ratios in the arkansas river at las animas are lowest during spring runoff of snowmelt the more muted signal in 2018 reflects that the winter of 2017 2018 had a poor snowpack in the mountains samples from the purgatoire river are more enriched than outflow from jmr during spring and summer months outflow from jmr has muted seasonal differences reflecting mixing and residence time in the reservoir but its consistent enrichment relative to inflows reflects evaporation as with the water isotopes values of δ34s and δ18o reflect sources and processes affecting so4 2 values of δ34s in so4 2 for reservoir inflows from the arkansas river at las animas and the purgatoire river have relatively narrow ranges of 15 0 to 13 2 and 15 8 to 13 2 respectively fig 4c the reservoir inflow values are quite depleted compared to the range for sulfate 4 0 to 8 2 in rocky mountain snowpack mast et al 2001 naftz et al 2011 and much more depleted than expected values 14 to 16 for evaporite salts associated with cretaceous age formations in the arkansas river basin claypool et al 1980 the values are within the range 34 7 to 16 7 and similar to the average 19 7 values for pyrite or salts derived from pyrite weathering in cretaceous formations and shales which predominate geology in the basin gautier 1986 green 1992 values of δ34s in the arkansas and purgatoire rivers are also similar to those in the uncompahgre river at delta in western colorado 18 4 to 17 8 where the so4 2 load is dominated by leaching of gypsum and other salts derived from weathering of pyrite in the cretaceous age mancos shale tuttle and grauch 2009 the mancos shale west of the rocky mountains is coeval with the niobrara formation east of the mountains in the arkansas river valley bern and stogner 2017 values of δ18o in so4 2 for the arkansas river at las animas and the purgatoire river have narrow ranges of 0 3 to 2 9 and 0 5 to 2 8 such values match well with expectations of values near 2 2 based upon upstream δ18o values of 13 9 in snowmelt dominated water and partial incorporation of atmospheric oxygen to so4 2 derived from pyrite bern et al in press van stempvoort and krouse 1994 both isotopes indicate that shale associated pyrite sources dominate so4 2 entering jmr and that the sources are either homogenous themselves or relatively well mixed however the isotopes do not distinguish whether that pyrite has weathered recently or in the geologic past with so4 2 subsequently stored as gypsum in the unsaturated zone until mobilized by water examining isotopic values of δ34s through time fig 4d the most striking variations occur in the arkansas river below jmr during winter when dam releases were minimal fig 3a at the times of sampling discharge at the site averaged 0 04 m3 s in february and march of 2017 averaged 0 2 m3 s over november 2017 to january 2018 and averaged 12 9 m3 s over the other 11 sampling events the lowest flows generated the greatest δ34s and δ18o values in so4 2 bacterial sulfate reduction enriches the δ34s and δ18o of so4 2 and the slope of 0 5 between the two isotopes for samples from below jmr is similar to that expected for such reduction nriagu et al 1991 notable enrichment of the heavy isotopes during the lowest flows also corresponding to spikes in mn fig 3f indicating that reducing conditions occur in the sediments in and around the dam it is only during the lowest flows that waters that have interacted with such sediments make up a substantial fraction of the flow another subtle pattern of enrichment occurs in late summer fig 4d overlapping with the midsummer mn spike fig 3f and again indicates reduction at other times and places other than mid winter and in the under dam sediments 3 2 short term isotope based evaporation the short term measure of evaporation in jmr is based upon water isotope ratios δd and δ18o reported above the fractions of water evaporated in jmr as determined separately using δd and δ18o from monthly samples collected below jmr were averaged for each month and are shown in fig 5 the observed fraction evaporated in outflow reflects residence time inflow volumes and seasonal evaporation rates the value is relatively high in march and april of 2017 for water present all winter when inflow discharges were small the fraction decreases rapidly as snowmelt fills the reservoir in may and june and due to lag time and mixing the fraction continues to decrease in july as summer wears on with warmer and drier conditions the fraction evaporated increases relative increases in inflow discharge in january and february of 2018 drive the fraction down but decreased inflow in march and april allow the fraction to increase the fraction evaporated as averaged monthly for δd and δ18o and then discharge weighted over 16 months is 12 because their individual discharge magnitudes and isotopic compositions are unknown unmeasured inflows from gageby creek rule creek groundwater and return flow represent sources of uncertainty related to the short term measure of evaporation 3 3 long term volume based evaporation the usace data for volumes evaporated and volumes of total inflow provide the long term measure of evaporation calculated by dividing the former by the latter usace 2019 that measure was calculated for february 2017 through may 2018 to compare with the short term isotopic estimate and also yielded a value of 12 for the 16 month period the match between isotopic and usace estimates of evaporation lends confidence to both methods the long term evaporation fractions from the usace data range from 6 to 30 for 1988 2018 such a range of values overestimate actual variability in evaporation however because of movement of water in and out of porosity in the material surrounding the reservoir as detailed in section 3 5 the fraction of water evaporated from jmr over 31 years is 11 and this estimate is less influenced by such shorter term water movement in and out of surrounding material 3 4 short term chloride indexed mass balance ratios of so4 2 tds se and u to cl from the 16 month sampling are the basis for the short term mass balance analysis for those constituents fig 6 fractionation of isotopes in so4 2 indicates that reduction has removed so4 2 from waters downstream from jmr and might have removed se and u which are also redox sensitive visually comparing the two metrics helps illustrate how ratios like so4 2 cl can trace removal the conservative anion cl serves as an index by which removal of the constituents is assessed if so4 2 cl ratios decline between inflows and outflow it could be interpreted that so4 2 has been removed increased δ34s between inflows and outflow is a fingerprint of microbially mediated reduction nriagu et al 1991 combined lower values of the so4 2 cl ratio and greater δ34s indicate that so4 2 removal by reduction has occurred for so4 2 fig 6a some removal during low outflows is apparent as expected as evidenced by low so4 2 cl ratios corresponding to greater δ34s values however based upon a discharge weighted so4 2 cl ratio of 15 8 for inflows and 15 5 for outflows average removal of so4 2 in jmr during the 16 months of sampling is only 2 some removal of tds is suggested visually by the lower tds cl ratios at low flows and based upon the discharge weighted inflow ratio of 29 5 and discharge weighted outflow ratio of 27 4 tds removal of 7 of tds is suggested greater removal of tds than so4 2 is a clue that the cl index is not providing an accurate picture of reservoir effects because so4 2 removal is generally offset by alkalinity gains e g schindler 1986 thus less tds than so4 2 retention would be expected additionally tds transport in surface water and through reservoirs is generally conservative kelly 2001 for se removal is visually apparent in the low flow samples because markedly lower se cl ratios correspond to greater δ34s values fig 6c the discharge weighted se cl ratio of inflows 0 29 and outflows 0 14 indicate 52 removal of se during february 2017 through may 2018 visually it also appears that u is retained under reducing conditions coinciding with low discharges fig 6d the discharge weighted u cl ratio of inflows 0 45 and outflows 0 39 indicate 15 removal of u in summary cl indexed mass balance indicates 2 7 52 and 15 removal of so4 2 tds se and u respectively based on the short term dataset from february 2017 through may 2018 inflow of water with greater cl content than the gaged inflows would cause overestimation of removal and as detailed in section 3 6 there is reason to suspect that the short term removal estimates are overestimates 3 5 long term load based mass balance the long term mass balance analysis is based upon determining loads which hinge upon water volumes year to year changes in stored water volumes pose one challenge to mass balance analysis of jmr or any reservoir fig 7 a peak annual storage in jmr usually occurs in spring and ranges from a high of 562 034 ml in may 1999 to a low of 38 644 ml in april 2013 or 201 to 14 respectively of the average combined inflow from the arkansas and purgatoire rivers of 279 394 ml fig 7b by conducting the load analysis on the full 31 year period only the net decrease in storage between january 1 1988 333 467 ml and october 30 2018 164 126 ml usace 2019 is relevant to the mass balance that 169 341 ml difference is only 2 1 of total gaged outflows from jmr over the 31 year period to avoid having to make assumptions about tds se and u concentrations of that water the decrease in storage is omitted from the analysis thus causing some underestimate of any retention of constituents in jmr however as the difference is only 2 1 of outflow volume it is overshadowed by other uncertainties inflows not measured by the two upstream streamgages are another challenge to mass balance analysis the usace accounts for total gross inflow volumes usace 2019 by comparing changes in storage to estimated evaporation and gaged outflow amy louise usace written comm 2019 ungaged inflows can be determined as the difference between the usace total gross inflow and combined gaged inflows fig 7c ungaged inflows range from 82 476 ml in 2015 a year of reservoir filling to 64 076 in 2000 a year of substantial drawdown fig 7a b c connection to the timing of changes in storage and occasional negative ungaged inflows indicate that the method to track ungaged inflows calculated as above includes movement of water into and out of porosity surrounding jmr the minimum and maximum ungaged inflows are 30 and 23 respectively of the average combined inflow from the arkansas and purgatoire rivers of 279 394 ml and occur in 2015 and 2000 respectively such movement of water into and out of surrounding porosity can distort mass balance analysis particularly calculated on shorter time scales over the 31 year analysis 391 295 ml of ungaged inflow entered jmr which is only 4 5 more than the 8 661 224 ml of gaged inflow though volumes of ungaged inflows can be quantified the individual volumes compositions and loads of inflows from gageby creek rule creek groundwater and return flow are unknown to avoid having to make assumptions about tds se and u loads from these volumetrically small sources they are omitted from the analysis with the acknowledgement that underestimation of any constituent retention in jmr may result one other ungaged water flux opposes the mass balance effects of net storage change and ungaged inflows ungaged seepage under and around the jmr dam occurs but is difficult to quantify carlos aragon usace oral comm 2018 by bypassing the outflow streamgage seepage can cause overestimation of any retention of constituents in jmr and oppose to some degree the underestimates described above in this section having determined that change in net storage is relatively small over 31 years and that ungaged inflows and outflows are also relatively small and somewhat counteract each other s effects water volumes in the mass balance can be considered from 1988 to 2018 7 164 692 716 469 ml of water entered jmr from the arkansas river and 1 496 532 149 653 ml entered from the purgatoire river on an annual basis the purgatoire river accounts for 7 50 of the gaged inflows to jmr and over the total period analyzed it contributes 17 total discharge below jmr was 8 227 471 822 747 ml after subtracting the net release from storage between january 1 1988 and october 30 2018 gaged discharge from jmr is 93 of inflow indicating only 7 evaporation that value is smaller than the 11 value from usace data and indicates that ungaged inflows exceed ungaged seepage around the dam thus load based estimates of constituent retention in jmr are likely to be underestimates residence times of water in jmr can be calculated by dividing average storage for a given year by either inflow or outflow for that year fig 7a b using inflow residence time of water in jmr ranges 0 1 1 7 years and averages 0 5 year using outflow residence time ranges 0 1 1 1 years but also averages 0 5 year beyond the uncertainty of water volumes the mass balance of tds se and u includes uncertainty from the regressions table 1 fig a 2 and the 10 uncertainty assigned to the sc records the degree to which concentrations of tds se and u were accurately estimated from sc and regressions can be observed by comparing predictions to measured values from the 16 monthly samples generally predictions of tds match well for all three sites fig 8 a d g a few exceptions exist for the purgatoire river but those likely reflect that the continuous sc record there had to be generated from discrete samples via wrtds in contrast se concentrations match less well fig 8b e h reflecting the poorer correlations between sc and se table 1 below jmr se is predicted based upon discharge again with moderate success but incorporating sc via the multiple regression would not have been a substantial improvement fig 8h uranium is predicted better than se fig 8c f i reflecting better fits from the regressions how the various uncertainties manifest in the mass balance can be observed in calculated annual average concentrations of tds se and u uncertainty for any individual values in a given year is notable but variations through time reflect known processes in the upstream arkansas river and the differences between the monitoring locations are large enough to discern reservoir processes concentrations of tds and u fig 9 a c are slightly elevated in the arkansas river at las animas during 1988 and 1996 2000 because salts were flushed from the landscape to the river following times of above average water availability fig 7b bern et al in press concentration peaks in 2002 and 2012 are the results of droughts reducing dilution fig 7b tds and u concentrations in discharge from jmr reflect both mixing from the two inflows and a lag due to residence time in the reservoir selenium concentrations fig 9b show less year to year variability than tds or u this is true for both the sc derived values in inflows and the discharge derived values in outflow for this study consistency over time lends confidence to the calculated values across all years concentrations of se are greatest in the arkansas river at las animas lowest in the purgatoire river and intermediate in jmr discharge the mass balance analysis itself focuses upon loads using tds as an example the issue that inter annual storage poses for mass balance can be examined for individual years from 1988 to 2018 the difference between outflow loads and inflow loads range 257 000 to 343 000 mg yr the outflow loads scale with discharge and net storage or release distort the mass balance by summing loads for the full 31 year period a less distorted picture can be obtained but it is one that necessarily represents average effects without year to year detail from 1988 to 2018 8 045 927 264 715 mg of tds entered jmr from the arkansas river and 2 260 737 138 798 mg of tds entered from the purgatoire river discharge below jmr contained 11 363 829 374 993 mg of tds outflows of tds are therefore 110 of inflows and the difference indicates that ungaged inflows contribute at least 34 102 15 469 mg yr of tds to jmr in contrast to the extra tds in discharge se loads in jmr discharge are less than measured inflow loads from 1988 to 2018 75 4 6 1 mg of se entered jmr from the arkansas river and 6 1 0 8 mg entered from the purgatoire river discharge below jmr contained 63 3 6 mg of se indicating that 19 7 1 mg or 23 of the measured se inflow had been retained in jmr the average is 0 6 0 2 mg of se per year considering additional se entering jmr via ungaged inflows and that ungaged inflow volumes likely exceed ungaged outflow volumes this is a minimum value uranium outflow from jmr is quite similar to uranium inflow from 1988 to 2018 130 7 6 3 mg of u entered jmr from the arkansas river and 13 2 1 3 mg entered from the purgatoire river discharge below jmr contained 147 13 mg of u the difference indicates some extra 3 4 14 4 mg of u in outflows versus inflows a gain of 2 3 annually the average gain is 0 1 0 5 mg though that value is small relative to uncertainty it indicates that substantial u is not being retained in jmr and that ungaged inflows also contribute u to jmr in summary jmr retains about 23 of se that enters and ungaged inflows contribute measurable tds and possibly some u to reservoir discharge 3 6 comparison of mass balance results short term cl indexed mass balance results indicate 7 52 and 15 removal of tds se and u in jmr respectively and all short term removal fractions are substantially greater than the long term load based results the discrepancies seem driven more by differences in methodology than time frame in particular 7 retention of tds a constituent unlikely to be retained indicates that the cl indexed method overestimates retention of all constituents the likely cause is gains of substantial cl from ungaged sources particularly groundwater as an example of potential groundwater contributions a cl concentration of 94 mg l has been measured from a well fig 1 close to the upper end of jmr usgs 380507103073600 https waterdata usgs gov nwis qw usgs 2019 the measured cl groundwater concentration is greater than all but two of the jmr inflow and outflow samples fig 3g and illustrates how a relatively small contribution of ungaged groundwater inflow fig 7c could cause overestimation of constituent removal by enhancing cl concentrations in outflow eq 1 overestimation is disappointing because the cl index method would have been a relatively simple way to overcome issues with ungaged inflows and changes in reservoir storage even with short sampling records the method may yet be useful in settings where either all inflows can be adequately characterized or where ungaged inflows are not so chemically dissimilar to gaged inflows in contrast to the cl index results the 10 tds gain 23 se removal and 2 3 u gain from the long term load based mass balance are more dependable estimates of jmr s effects on water quality although the se removal value is a minimum the 31 year record largely overwhelmed the net change in storage between the beginning and end of the record as well as intermediate changes in storage fig 7a by analyzing the long term record effects of ungaged inflows and the movement of water in and out of surrounding materials fig 7c were also largely overcome uncertainty that was substantial relative to individual years fig 8 was proportionately smaller for loads summed across 31 years 3 7 selenium retention removal of se by jmr is a water quality benefit though not one unique to this reservoir engberg 1999 average se concentrations in jmr outflow still exceed the 4 6 µg l chronic wildlife toxicity standard colorado department of public health and the environment cdphe 2016 but they are substantially less than arkansas river inflow concentrations figs 3d 9b the link between lower se concentrations enriched sulfate isotope ratios fig 4c d point to biogeochemical reduction as playing a role in se removal correspondence between low se concentrations below jmr and mid winter low discharges fig 3a d indicate that as waters seep through low oxygen sediments in and around the jmr dam microbially facilitated reduction causes dissolved selenate seo4 2 and selenite seo3 2 precipitation as insoluble elemental selenium se0 oremland et al 1989 however the mn spikes and low oxygen conditions in the reservoir water column justin reale usace written comm 2019 indicate that se reduction and retention might occur more broadly in the reservoir selenium immobilization in wetland sediments as elemental and organic matter associated se or volatilization from plants in the wetland upstream from jmr fig 1 might also aid in se removal gao et al 2003 zhang and moore 1997 all these processes could contribute to se removal average annual rate 0 6 0 2 mg yr prior to outflow from jmr 4 conclusions discerning reservoir effects on water quality is challenging because net storage or release and movement of water into and out of surrounding porosity can alter the relation of outflows relative to inflows for a given time period and drive various degrees of mixing and lag times for waters passing through the reservoir here different methodologies were used and compared for assessing the effects of reservoir storage on water quantity and quality water isotopes were used to estimate evaporation for jmr yielding a 12 loss for a short term 16 month period in 2017 2018 and matching the fraction of evaporation calculated by the usace using pan evaporation and reservoir surface area evaporation estimated by the pan method averaged 11 for 1988 2018 isotopes of sulfate were used to detect biogeochemical reducing conditions in low flow discharges from jmr including seepage waters that had passed through sediments in and around the reservoir isotopes of sulfate also identified pyrite oxidation in upstream regions as the dominant source of sulfate and therefore tds to jmr that pyrite may have oxidized in the geologic past and resided in the subsurface as gypsum prior to mobilization short term mass balance calculations that used cl as an index overestimated

8594,drought research customarily uses statistics collected over a reference period to establish a threshold for declaring a region to be in a drought or to estimate baseline return periods often these statistics involve quantile values from the tails of the distribution of reference period observations such as 10th or even 1st percentile values the length of the reference period is dictated by the available record length often it is no longer than 50 100 years depending on the purpose for which the drought study is intended the unit of time used as the averaging period for the hydrologic or meteorologic variables of interest is often as small as one month in this circumstance percentile values are each based on at most 100 data points we show here that the statistical uncertainty resulting from these small sample sizes for estimating the threshold value is sufficient to compromise many types of analysis we provide formulae for calculating the statistical uncertainties caused by limited record lengths and for estimating the record length needed to achieve a specified level of accuracy in an analysis our results show that datasets of 100 years or less are approximately 1 10 the length needed to achieve the level of reliability required for many applications we also summarize options for augmenting the historical record when the existing record length is not long enough to support analysis at the desired level of accuracy keywords statistics drought thresholds 1 introduction one of the most important projected effects of global climate change is its potential impact on the timing and incidence of drought extensive research has been conducted on this topic field et al 2012 dai 2011 burke and brown 2010 mishra and singh 2009 naumann et al 2018 no universal definition of drought exists dracup et al 1980 dracup et al 1980 nalbantis and tsakiris 2009 however broadly a drought is defined to be an abnormal relatively infrequent departure from typical conditions for the region being considered comparison to normal conditions is necessary to avoid declaring a naturally arid region to be perpetually in drought or considering regions with a strong seasonal cycle to experience a drought in every dry season therefore these definitions necessarily vary by location and often vary by season drought is commonly defined by establishing a threshold if the hydrological variable being considered drops below the threshold at a location such as a grid cell or river catchment then the location is deemed to be experiencing a drought conversely when the variable exceeds the threshold the drought is deemed to have ended the hydrometeorologic community also commonly refers to drought thresholds as truncation levels dracup et al 1980 a variety of derived metrics such as severity intensity and duration are commonly employed for analyzing the effects of the drought but all of these metrics are defined relative to the threshold prudhomme et al 2014 sheffield and wood 2008 because the drought threshold underpins all of the other metrics results from studies using such metrics are only as reliable as the drought thresholds on which they are based typically these thresholds are derived from a statistical analysis on model outputs or observations from a reference period in which a statistic from the reference distribution is adopted as the drought threshold the distribution of the variable over the reference period is presumed to be stationary and this distribution is deemed to be representative of normal behavior in the region while many studies identify a constant threshold level at a coarse time scale e g a mean annual statistic see mishra and singh 2010 for examples increasingly detailed studies are developing monthly thresholds often based upon the 10th percentile of the observed distribution prudhomme et al 2014 thus such studies are fitting 12 separate distributions one for each month of the year the effectiveness of any such threshold based technique depends critically on the amount of historical data available for analysis because quantile values of an empirical or fitted distribution based on a small sample size are subject to large uncertainties modarres et al 2002 lemoine et al 2016 there is reason to believe that the historical sample size used by many studies is too small to produce reliable thresholds whether derived from reanalysis e g kalnay et al 1996 kanamitsu et al 2002 reichle 2012 model runs over the historical period harding et al 2011 hempel et al 2013 taylor et al 2012 or gauge stations the data available seldom exceed 100 years and records shorter than 50 years are common in many parts of the world sivapalan 2003 although 100 years may sound like a reasonably long period by the time this record is divided up by month and location we are left with but a single observation per year for each month and location that is we are estimating quantiles with at best just 100 data points in this paper we will show that currently available datasets of 100 years or less are approximately 10 times too short to provide the accuracy typically desired in this kind of research researchers and practitioners in the hydrology community are generally aware of the effects of limited data sets on estimating thresholds yet the uncertainty inherent in threshold estimates is rarely acknowledged and quantified in the scientific literature e g jain et al 2014 thus in this article we seek to raise this issue as a topic in need of serious discussion by the community the importance of reliable threshold estimates to society cannot be overstated the drought thresholds that are the focus of this paper are not only used for risk assessment of future drought conditions prudhomme et al 2014 wan et al 2018 but also in the present in triggering water use restrictions quiring 2009 planning infrastructure investments cai et al 2015 zeff et al 2016 and establishing indices triggering insurance payments during drought conditions chantarat et al 2007 moreover the same statistical analysis used to estimate thresholds is also used to derive statistics such as return period and standardized precipitation index spi which are used to design and operate reservoirs to safely withstand future droughts as well as to guide municipality policies in implementing water restrictions werick and whipple 1994 given recent high profile droughts such as those in california usa and cape town south africa governments are increasingly looking to policy and infrastructure planning to mitigate the effects of these droughts california 2018 manie and johnstone 2017 success or failure of these efforts will depend critically on the reliability of the statistical analysis of the historical record in the remainder of this paper we derive some error estimates for thresholds derived from distribution functions estimated empirically from data these estimates are based on theoretical properties of the distribution function therefore they are applicable irrespective of the source of the data or the hydro meteorological variable being analyzed 2 derivation of ecdf confidence intervals to investigate the effects of short record lengths on the reliability of statistically determined thresholds we will derive an expression for the uncertainty in empirically determined probability distributions starting with a collection of n samples from some unknown distribution we can approximate the cumulative distribution function cdf f x of the unknown distribution using its empirical cdf ecdf f n x consider the problem of estimating probabilities from such an ecdf if f n x p for some quantile estimate x of interest we can ask what is the likely range of values for the corresponding probability p in the underlying distribution f x this range is a measure of the uncertainty in the estimate of p f x that is this range tells us how large a discrepancy we can expect between p the probability estimated from the ecdf and p the actual probability in the cdf we can calculate the distribution of p by observing that each of the n samples represents a bernoulli trial with probability p that is each time we draw a sample from the underlying distribution it will be less than x with probability p and it will be greater than x with probability 1 p the distribution of p follows the beta distribution sivia 1996 1 p beta k 1 n k 1 the 95 confidence interval for p i e the likely range of p values we seek runs from the 2 5th percentile of eq 1 to the 97 5th in other words we are 95 certain that p lies in p l p h with p l and p h the 0 025 and 0 975 quantiles of the beta distribution in eq 1 for reasonably large n we can approximate this interval with the parametric interval p ε p ε by approximating the beta distribution with a normal distribution q v appendix a we can derive a closed form approximation for ε the half width of the 95 confidence interval 2 p p ε ε 2 p 1 p n a notable feature of eq 2 is that the confidence interval for f n x depends only on p and n not on any other details of the underlying or empirical cdf describing the record data this property allows us to define a useful measure of error in the quantiles used to produce thresholds for analyzing impacts suppose we define our threshold x as the empirical quantile corresponding to probability p in the ecdf by picking x as the threshold we are assuming that f x p for the underlying distribution but that is just an estimate the true value of p might plausibly lie anywhere in the range given in eq 2 the discrepancy can be substantial for p 0 1 and n 100 ε 0 06 meaning that the putative 10th percentile value could actually be anything from about the 4th percentile up to the 16th percentile in the underlying distribution probability values near the edges of this confidence interval could severely distort the results of any analysis based on the threshold we can solve eq 2 for n to determine how large the sample size n must be in order to achieve a specified level of accuracy in the cdf and therefore an acceptable confidence in the threshold value x being selected 3 ε 2 p 1 p n n 2 ε 2 p 1 p for an ecdf being evaluated at p 0 1 i e the 10th percentile to achieve a 95 confidence interval no wider than 0 02 i e 8th 12th percentile eq 3 shows that at least n 900 years of data binned at the same time scale as its resolution e g monthly average data with a separate threshold for each month of the year would be necessary this is approximately 10 times larger than the datasets typically used to establish historical baselines for drought thresholds fig 1 shows the relationship between n and ε for several values of p confidence intervals for more extreme values are tighter but this is a little misleading at n 900 the confidence interval for p 0 01 is about 0 007 which though smaller than the corresponding interval for p 0 1 is larger in proportion to the probability level being estimated this effect can be illustrated by drawing samples from a known distribution fig 2 shows the results of a simulation experiment using a gamma distribution the gamma distribution is one of the most commonly employed distributions in hydrology studies because it is flexible and describes only positive random variable values aksoy 2000 yue et al 2001 mathier et al 1992 shiau and shen 2001 samples were drawn from this distribution in small batches of 100 and large batches of 900 this procedure was repeated 2500 times and the empirical estimates x of the 10th percentile values for each batch size were tabulated because the true probability distribution is known for each of these empirical 10th percentile estimates we can calculate the probability level in the true cdf p f x the density of true 10th percentile values associated with the sampled i e empirical percentile values is plotted in fig 2 as expected the large samples produce threshold i e 10th percentile values much closer to the intended value over half of the large samples produced thresholds with probabilities between 9 5 and 10 5 in the underlying gamma distribution and 95 of them were between 8 and 12 as predicted by eq 2 the smaller samples on the other hand which are closer in size to those used to establish historical drought thresholds in practice produced thresholds with probabilities that were substantially different from the intended value nearly a third had threshold probabilities less than 0 08 or greater than 0 12 in the underlying distribution in some cases instead of estimating the ecdf researchers fit a parametric form for the distribution mckee et al 1993 guttman 1999 wan et al 2017 wan et al 2018 the standardized precipitation index spi is an example of such a method where the distribution being fit is the gamma distribution mckee et al 1993 the fitted distribution is then used in the same way as an ecdf spi values are expressed as quantiles of the standard normal distribution but these are functionally identical to cdf probability values fitting a distribution in this way does not substantially improve the statistical reliability of the analysis for example in a simulation experiment in which we drew sets of 100 samples from a fiducial gamma distribution and determined the empirical quantiles by fitting gamma distribution parameters to the sampled data we found that the 95 confidence interval for the true probabilities i e derived from the fiducial distribution extended from 0 06 to 0 16 which is close to the range predicted by eq 2 moreover fitting the wrong distribution can increase the errors dramatically and can introduce a systematic bias therefore in the rest of this discussion we will use the ecdf method as a marker for an optimistic assessment of the reliability of empirically determined thresholds 3 discussion 3 1 deleterious effects of short record lengths the small sample sizes discussed here and shown in fig 2 are typical of the historical datasets used in setting thresholds for planning exercises and impacts studies this analysis shows that the actual probabilities of these thresholds in the underlying cdf can be substantially different from the intended probabilities whether or not these discrepancies make a difference depends on how the thresholds will be used in subsequent analysis in cases where the intended use is to do a statistical analysis of extreme events with the threshold value defining extreme discrepancies in threshold values could have a profound influence on the outcome of the analysis by creating spurious effects or obscuring real hydrometeorologic behavior consider for example applications of the standardized precipitation index spi recall from section 1 that spi values are cdf probabilities from a gamma distribution fit to the record expressed as quantiles of the standard normal distribution typically the spi is binned into categories ranging from extremely dry p 0 02 through extremely wet p 0 98 table 1 shows the spi and cdf values corresponding to these categories the severely dry bin comprises 0 02 p 0 07 using eq 3 we can see that for n 100 the confidence interval for the p 0 07 quantile estimate is p 0 07 0 05 if the true p is close to the lower end of that range then the entire severely dry bin could be miscategorized into less dry categories conversely if the true value of p is close to the high end of that range nearly half of the moderately dry bin could be placed in the wrong category these errors are the extreme edge of the confidence interval so most sites will have smaller errors than these however in a large dataset such as a grid cell level analysis in a gridded dataset one is practically guaranteed to see errors this large in at least some parts of the data these theoretical effects have been observed in data wu et al 2005 examined the effect of shorter and longer record lengths on spi calculations they compared spi derived categories for 30 year records to categories similarly derived from longer records for the 24 week spi 65 independent observations in the 30 year period the fraction of observations that had category discrepancies ranged from 11 to 22 over the various sites and periods they studied at one of the sites nearly 10 of the observations had discrepancies of two or more categories such discrepancies could have profound influence on for example water use restrictions based on spi quiring 2009 in light of these results it seems clear that where possible short records should not be used to establish thresholds or bin boundaries what constitutes a short record in this context can be counterintuitive as discussed in section 1 one commonly used method of grouping the data for analysis results in just a single effective observation per year in the record in such an analysis fig 1 and fig 2 show that a 100 year record will produce unreliable estimates of cdfs or quantile values possibly creating severe distortions in any results based on them one way to address this problem is to accept the analytical limitations imposed by short records and to acknowledge them in results as larger confidence intervals this strategy is most effective when adopting the upper edge of the confidence interval serves as a conservative estimate of the quantity of interest for example consider the return period t which is related to the probability p by t 1 p in other words a 50 year return period means identifying the p 0 02 quantile in the underlying unknown distribution as demonstrated above there is considerable uncertainty in any values arrived at for p 0 02 from the ecdf suppose one is designing for a return period t with a desired 95 probability that the return period is longer than some time window of interest t 1 p 0 where p 0 is the event probability that corresponds to the desired minimum return period following this conservative estimate approach a design could be based on selecting the p quantile such that p ε p 0 since ε is given by eq 2 we can solve for p 4 p 2 np 0 4 2 np 0 4 2 4 np 0 2 n 4 2 n 4 however for short records this approach can result in substantial overdesign for n 100 to give 95 confidence of t 50 years eq 4 suggests one must select p 0 0054 the expected return period would therefore be over 185 years more than three times the intended value this example illustrates a general principle viz that because of the inverse relationship between t and p errors in return period t can be very large even for seemingly large samples fig 3 shows the relationship between sample size and return period uncertainty even with 1000 years of data assuming one effective sample per year the uncertainty on the estimate of a 50 year return period is 20 years 3 2 methods for extending short records for some applications such as drought severity intensity and duration calculations involving thresholds large errors in either direction for the threshold estimates will render the analysis meaningless a variety of techniques have been proposed to extend the record length so as to reduce the uncertainties in these analyses one strategy is to pool information from other locations in an attempt to create a longer record such methods are referred to in the literature by a variety of names including regional frequency analysis cunnane 1988 hosking and wallis 1993 and transfer methods zaidman et al 2003 these approaches draw in observations from other locations with presumed similar characteristics to extend the effective length of the hydrometeorologic record tallaksen et al 2004 as is often done in the flood estimation literature hirsch 1982 vogel and stedinger 1985 one assumption underlying these methods is that the measurements from donor locations have the same probability distribution possibly after scaling the data by some factor as the target location this procedure is equivalent to combining the observations using complete pooling the assumption of identical distributions across sites can be relaxed using statistical techniques such as hierarchical partial pooling mcelreath 2018 ch 12 but this possibility does not seem to have been well explored in the hydrology literature the efficacy of pooling methods depends on the degree of spatial correlation between the locations being pooled an independent donor location effectively extends the record by the number of observations at the donor location correlated donor locations however are less effective at reducing uncertainty a topic explored in depth by hosking and wallis 1988 fig 4 shows the results of a simulation experiment described in detail in appendix b exploring the dependence of ε on n when the donor locations are correlated with the target location each location has a record length of 100 and there are up to 9 locations to use to extend the record length for the original location the results show that correlation reduces the effectiveness of adding additional sites but the size of the effect depends on what statistic is being measured in the case of the 10th percentile for a correlation coefficient between locations of 0 5 adding nine donor locations provides only as much reduction in ε as a single uncorrelated donor location would have done in the case of the first percentile the nine donor locations provide additional certainty equivalent to between four and five uncorrelated observations the magnitude of the effect of inter site dependence however is sensitive to the structure of the dependence the right column of fig 4 shows ε versus n for a dependence structure based on a t copula hofert et al 2019 these simulated datasets have stronger tail dependence than the ones from the gaussian copula family left column of the figure we can see that for equivalent nominal values of n errors are higher for the t copula family than for the corresponding member of the gaussian family in fact even for a correlation of 0 the t family still exhibits some tail dependence resulting in a lower effective n relative to independent sites ten sites with this level of tail dependence only provide about as much information as 6 independent sites even when the measured correlation is zero from this we conclude that site pooling should be used to augment the record only with extreme caution a second approach is to augment the historical record by using observations of tree ring records meko et al 2007 kress et al 2010 gonzález valdés 2003 this approach is similarly used in flood frequency analysis hupp 1988 yanosky and jarrett 2002 however these approaches are not practical in the context of national and global assessments of drought that encompass areas with significant data limitations alternatively instead of trying to extend an existing record one could obtain a longer record by running a model or a collection of models that purport to reproduce the dynamical behavior of the system the advantage of this approach is that the model can be run for as long as needed to generate a sufficiently long record however this assumes that the model output is a faithful representation of the physical system moreover some of the most sophisticated models such as earth system models require significant computing resources to run therefore although the length of the record that can be generated this way is theoretically unlimited there may be practical limitations recently however a variety of emulators and surrogate models have become available e g link et al 2019 lu and ricciuto 2019 which allow for the possibility of generating very large collections of simulation data at reasonable computational cost 4 conclusion the effects of record length on the reliability of drought thresholds i e truncation levels and on the reliability of subsequent threshold based analyses have largely been underestimated or ignored in the hydrological literature this is perhaps due to the lack of a robust and tractable solution however as shown in this paper adequate sampling of the tails of any distribution requires substantially more data than is available from most historical records and inadequate sampling of the tails can have substantial real world consequences for many common analysis types used in the translational science community approximately 1000 or more independent samples may be needed for a sufficiently reliable tail value estimate although we have focused on drought research in this discussion the statistical problems caused by short historical record lengths extends to many other types of research involving extremes flooding is another notable example in hydrology heatwaves are also similarly defined robinson 2001 have direct consequences for human mortality anderson and bell 2009 anderson and bell 2010 and have impacts on building and energy infrastructure via deployment of cooling technologies to combat expected heat waves mcevoy et al 2012 nguyen et al 2010 wilhelmi et al 2004 the distribution independent estimates arrived at in this analysis such as eqs 2 and 3 should be broadly useful in applications at the interface of human and natural systems research that depends implicitly or explicitly on quantiles derived from a historical record period should at a minimum include an analysis of the uncertainties associated with the historical estimates of the quantile values and how those uncertainties affect the results eq 2 can be used to compute a distribution independent estimate of these uncertainties another option is to use eq 3 to estimate the sample size required to reduce the uncertainty from the record period to an acceptable level then a method such as the ones described in section 3 2 can be used to extend the record as required however users of these methods should exercise caution each of the methods has limitations issues like spatial dependence should be carefully considered and their effects on results evaluated screening for spatial dependence should include estimates of tail dependence as it can be present even when measures of correlation are small regardless of the approach used to address this issue this analysis has made it clear that ignoring the uncertainties in threshold estimates arrived at from 50 to 100 year long historical records has serious impacts on human relevant quantities including and beyond drought return periods such as flood return periods and heat wave analysis for many types of societally

to influence the work reported in this paper appendix a normal approximation to the beta distribution consider a bernoulli experiment repeated n times with n successes if our prior for the success probability p is uniform then the posterior probability is p beta n 1 n n 1 or for the maximum a posteriori estimate of p p n n 5 p beta np 1 n 1 p 1 to derive an analytically tractable estimate of the error as a function of n as in eq 2 we can approximate this distribution with a normal distribution having equivalent mode and variance centering the normal approximation at the mean of the beta distribution would produce a better approximation but centering at the mode is more consistent with the typical usage of quoting an error of the form p ε the variance of the distribution beta α β is walck 1996 6 σ 2 α β α β 2 α β 1 or in terms of n and p 7 σ 2 n 2 p 1 p n 1 n 2 2 n 3 even for relatively small n the lower order terms in the numerator and denominator are negligible so we can simplify to 8 σ 2 n 2 p 1 p n 3 p 1 p n eq 2 is derived from this expression in conjunction with the fact that the half width of 95 confidence interval for the standard normal is 1 96 which we have rounded to 2 for convenience how good is this approximation one area of concern is that for p 0 5 the beta distribution is skewed whereas the normal distribution is symmetric the skewness of beta α β is johnson et al 1995 9 γ 1 2 β α α β 1 α β 2 α β written in terms of p and n 10 γ 1 2 n 2 p 1 n 3 n 4 p 1 p n 2 n 1 the numerator in this expression is o n 3 2 and the denominator is o n 2 therefore the entire expression is o n 1 2 indicating that with p fixed skewness decreases as 1 n as a practical matter the normal approximation to the beta distribution is reasonably good by the time n 100 the smallest sample size we consider in this paper fig 5 shows a comparison of the probability density function for a beta distribution with p 0 1 and n 100 along with the normal approximation described above the equal tail 95 confidence interval for the beta distribution is 0 056 0 17 giving a width of 0 119 the corresponding interval for the normal approximation is 0 041 0 16 giving a width of 0 118 the lack of skewness in the normal approximation is apparent in these figures but the widths of the intervals are practically the same therefore the difference between the beta and normal approximations is not so large that it would alter the basic conclusion that n 100 is too small to provide a reliable estimate of the 10th percentile by the time we get up to values of n corresponding to a desirable value of ε in eqs 2 and 3 the differences between the approximation and the true intervals are small enough not to matter appendix b simulation of correlated sites augmenting the record from a site by pooling data from other sites implicitly assumes that the data from the other sites is statistically independent if this assumption is violated then the amount of information provided by the additional sites may be less than is suggested by the nominal number of observations n the magnitude of this effect depends on the strength and structure of the dependence between the sites being pooled to investigate the effect of inter site dependence on pooling we use a simulation experiment in this experiment we select a joint distribution h x 1 x 2 x k for k different hypothetical sites this distribution is constructed so as to have a known identical marginal distribution f for the variables at each site along with a known dependence structure including both correlation and potentially other forms of dependence we then draw samples from the sites and estimate the 0 1 and 0 01 quantiles q 10 and q 1 with data pooled from 1 2 k sites because we know the true marginal distribution f we can estimate the true probability levels f q 10 and f q 1 for the putative 0 1 and 0 01 quantiles as a function of n the difference between these true probability levels and the nominal values is the error ε we repeat the sampling procedure 5000 times to get an average value for ε which we tabulate as a function of n by repeating the experiment with different distributions h we can investigate the sensitivity of the error to the inter site correlation and other measures of inter site dependence we represent inter site dependence using copula models nelsen 2007 hofert et al 2019 a copula model allows us to specify the inter site dependence structure irrespective of the marginal distribution by sklar s theorem a copula can be transformed to have any desired marginal distribution however the error in probability level ε is invariant under such transformations so in practice it is not necessary to specify a marginal distribution for purposes of the simulation the copula package hofert et al 2018 in r r core team 2019 was used to construct and sample from the copula models in this experiment we considered two families of joint distributions the first was based on the gaussian copula which expresses the dependence structure exhibited by a multivariate normal distribution this family is parameterized by the correlation as measured by spearman s rho ρ s and it generally corresponds to what is meant by correlated data in this experiment we looked at ρ s values of 0 0 1 0 5 and 0 9 the model with ρ s 0 is of particular importance since it corresponds to independent sites it therefore serves as a baseline against which all of the other models can be judged the second family of joint distributions was based on the t copula which expresses the dependence structure exhibited by a multivariate student s t distribution this family has two parameters correlation ρ and degrees of freedom ν the former is equivalent to the parameter in the normal copula while the latter is derived from the corresponding parameter in the univariate t distribution the principal difference between the gaussian copula and the t copula is that the latter exhibits tail dependence an asymptotic association between values in the tail of the distribution while the gaussian copula does not smaller values of ν produce more tail dependence but the coefficient of tail dependence λ depends on both ρ and ν for this experiment we fixed ν 4 which resulted in λ values ranging from 0 08 for ρ 0 to 0 6 for ρ 0 9 note that the nonzero tail dependence means that for this family even when ρ 0 the simulated sites are not independent and error values ε are accordingly larger than the errors produced by independent samples the results of these simulations are plotted in fig 4 with the gaussian family in the left column and the t family in the right and they are discussed in section 3 2 
8594,drought research customarily uses statistics collected over a reference period to establish a threshold for declaring a region to be in a drought or to estimate baseline return periods often these statistics involve quantile values from the tails of the distribution of reference period observations such as 10th or even 1st percentile values the length of the reference period is dictated by the available record length often it is no longer than 50 100 years depending on the purpose for which the drought study is intended the unit of time used as the averaging period for the hydrologic or meteorologic variables of interest is often as small as one month in this circumstance percentile values are each based on at most 100 data points we show here that the statistical uncertainty resulting from these small sample sizes for estimating the threshold value is sufficient to compromise many types of analysis we provide formulae for calculating the statistical uncertainties caused by limited record lengths and for estimating the record length needed to achieve a specified level of accuracy in an analysis our results show that datasets of 100 years or less are approximately 1 10 the length needed to achieve the level of reliability required for many applications we also summarize options for augmenting the historical record when the existing record length is not long enough to support analysis at the desired level of accuracy keywords statistics drought thresholds 1 introduction one of the most important projected effects of global climate change is its potential impact

definition of drought exists dracup et al 1980 dracup et al 1980 nalbantis and tsakiris 2009 however broadly a drought is defined to be an abnormal relatively infrequent departure from typical conditions for the region being considered comparison to normal conditions is necessary to avoid declaring a naturally arid region to be perpetually in drought or considering regions with a strong seasonal cycle to experience a drought in every dry season therefore these definitions necessarily vary by location and often vary by season drought is commonly defined by establishing a threshold if the hydrological variable being considered drops below the threshold at a location such as a grid cell or river catchment then the location is deemed to be experiencing a drought conversely when the variable exceeds the threshold the drought is deemed to have ended the hydrometeorologic community also commonly refers to drought thresholds as truncation levels dracup et al 1980 a variety of derived metrics such as severity intensity and duration are commonly employed for analyzing the effects of the drought but all of these metrics are defined relative to the threshold prudhomme et al 2014 sheffield and wood 2008 because the drought threshold underpins all of the other metrics results from studies using such metrics are only as reliable as the drought thresholds on which they are based typically these thresholds are derived from a statistical analysis on model outputs or observations from a reference period in which a statistic from the reference distribution is adopted as the drought threshold the distribution of the variable over the reference period is presumed to be stationary and this distribution is deemed to be representative of normal behavior in the region while many studies identify a constant threshold level at a coarse time scale e g a mean annual statistic see mishra and singh 2010 for examples increasingly detailed studies are developing monthly thresholds often based upon the 10th percentile of the observed distribution prudhomme et al 2014 thus such studies are fitting 12 separate distributions one for each month of the year the effectiveness of any such threshold based technique depends critically on the amount of historical data available for analysis because quantile values of an empirical or fitted distribution based on a small sample size are subject to large uncertainties modarres et al 2002 lemoine et al 2016 there is reason to believe that the historical sample size used by many studies is too small to produce reliable thresholds whether derived from reanalysis e g kalnay et al 1996 kanamitsu et al 2002 reichle 2012 model runs over the historical period harding et al 2011 hempel et al 2013 taylor et al 2012 or gauge stations the data available seldom exceed 100 years and records shorter than 50 years are common in many parts of the world sivapalan 2003 although 100 years may sound like a reasonably long period by the time this record is divided up by month and location we are left with but a single observation per year for each month and location that is we are estimating quantiles with at best just 100 data points in this paper we will show that currently available datasets of 100 years or less are approximately 10 times too short to provide the accuracy typically desired in this kind of research researchers and practitioners in the hydrology community are generally aware of the effects of limited data sets on estimating thresholds yet the uncertainty inherent in threshold estimates is rarely acknowledged and quantified in the scientific literature e g jain et al 2014 thus in this article we seek to raise this issue as a topic in need of serious discussion by the community the importance of reliable threshold estimates to society cannot be overstated the drought thresholds that are the focus of this paper are not only used for risk assessment of future drought conditions prudhomme et al 2014 wan et al 2018 but also in the present in triggering water use restrictions quiring 2009 planning infrastructure investments cai et al 2015 zeff et al 2016 and establishing indices triggering insurance payments during drought conditions chantarat et al 2007 moreover the same statistical analysis used to estimate thresholds is also used to derive statistics such as return period and standardized precipitation index spi which are used to design and operate reservoirs to safely withstand future droughts as well as to guide municipality policies in implementing water restrictions werick and whipple 1994 given recent high profile droughts such as those in california usa and cape town south africa governments are increasingly looking to policy and infrastructure planning to mitigate the effects of these droughts california 2018 manie and johnstone 2017 success or failure of these efforts will depend critically on the reliability of the statistical analysis of the historical record in the remainder of this paper we derive some error estimates for thresholds derived from distribution functions estimated empirically from data these estimates are based on theoretical properties of the distribution function therefore they are applicable irrespective of the source of the data or the hydro meteorological variable being analyzed 2 derivation of ecdf confidence intervals to investigate the effects of short record lengths on the reliability of statistically determined thresholds we will derive an expression for the uncertainty in empirically determined probability distributions starting with a collection of n samples from some unknown distribution we can approximate the cumulative distribution function cdf f x of the unknown distribution using its empirical cdf ecdf f n x consider the problem of estimating probabilities from such an ecdf if f n x p for some quantile estimate x of interest we can ask what is the likely range of values for the corresponding probability p in the underlying distribution f x this range is a measure of the uncertainty in the estimate of p f x that is this range tells us how large a discrepancy we can expect between p the probability estimated from the ecdf and p the actual probability in the cdf we can calculate the distribution of p by observing that each of the n samples represents a bernoulli trial with probability p that is each time we draw a sample from the underlying distribution it will be less than x with probability p and it will be greater than x with probability 1 p the distribution of p follows the beta distribution sivia 1996 1 p beta k 1 n k 1 the 95 confidence interval for p i e the likely range of p values we seek runs from the 2 5th percentile of eq 1 to the 97 5th in other words we are 95 certain that p lies in p l p h with p l and p h the 0 025 and 0 975 quantiles of the beta distribution in eq 1 for reasonably large n we can approximate this interval with the parametric interval p ε p ε by approximating the beta distribution with a normal distribution q v appendix a we can derive a closed form approximation for ε the half width of the 95 confidence interval 2 p p ε ε 2 p 1 p n a notable feature of eq 2 is that the confidence interval for f n x depends only on p and n not on any other details of the underlying or empirical cdf describing the record data this property allows us to define a useful measure of error in the quantiles used to produce thresholds for analyzing impacts suppose we define our threshold x as the empirical quantile corresponding to probability p in the ecdf by picking x as the threshold we are assuming that f x p for the underlying distribution but that is just an estimate the true value of p might plausibly lie anywhere in the range given in eq 2 the discrepancy can be substantial for p 0 1 and n 100 ε 0 06 meaning that the putative 10th percentile value could actually be anything from about the 4th percentile up to the 16th percentile in the underlying distribution probability values near the edges of this confidence interval could severely distort the results of any analysis based on the threshold we can solve eq 2 for n to determine how large the sample size n must be in order to achieve a specified level of accuracy in the cdf and therefore an acceptable confidence in the threshold value x being selected 3 ε 2 p 1 p n n 2 ε 2 p 1 p for an ecdf being evaluated at p 0 1 i e the 10th percentile to achieve a 95 confidence interval no wider than 0 02 i e 8th 12th percentile eq 3 shows that at least n 900 years of data binned at the same time scale as its resolution e g monthly average data with a separate threshold for each month of the year would be necessary this is approximately 10 times larger than the datasets typically used to establish historical baselines for drought thresholds fig 1 shows the relationship between n and ε for several values of p confidence intervals for more extreme values are tighter but this is a little misleading at n 900 the confidence interval for p 0 01 is about 0 007 which though smaller than the corresponding interval for p 0 1 is larger in proportion to the probability level being estimated this effect can be illustrated by drawing samples from a known distribution fig 2 shows the results of a simulation experiment using a gamma distribution the gamma distribution is one of the most commonly employed distributions in hydrology studies because it is flexible and describes only positive random variable values aksoy 2000 yue et al 2001 mathier et al 1992 shiau and shen 2001 samples were drawn from this distribution in small batches of 100 and large batches of 900 this procedure was repeated 2500 times and the empirical estimates x of the 10th percentile values for each batch size were tabulated because the true probability distribution is known for each of these empirical 10th percentile estimates we can calculate the probability level in the true cdf p f x the density of true 10th percentile values associated with the sampled i e empirical percentile values is plotted in fig 2 as expected the large samples produce threshold i e 10th percentile values much closer to the intended value over half of the large samples produced thresholds with probabilities between 9 5 and 10 5 in the underlying gamma distribution and 95 of them were between 8 and 12 as predicted by eq 2 the smaller samples on the other hand which are closer in size to those used to establish historical drought thresholds in practice produced thresholds with probabilities that were substantially different from the intended value nearly a third had threshold probabilities less than 0 08 or greater than 0 12 in the underlying distribution in some cases instead of estimating the ecdf researchers fit a parametric form for the distribution mckee et al 1993 guttman 1999 wan et al 2017 wan et al 2018 the standardized precipitation index spi is an example of such a method where the distribution being fit is the gamma distribution mckee et al 1993 the fitted distribution is then used in the same way as an ecdf spi values are expressed as quantiles of the standard normal distribution but these are functionally identical to cdf probability values fitting a distribution in this way does not substantially improve the statistical reliability of the analysis for example in a simulation experiment in which we drew sets of 100 samples from a fiducial gamma distribution and determined the empirical quantiles by fitting gamma distribution parameters to the sampled data we found that the 95 confidence interval for the true probabilities i e derived from the fiducial distribution extended from 0 06 to 0 16 which is close to the range predicted by eq 2 moreover fitting the wrong distribution can increase the errors dramatically and can introduce a systematic bias therefore in the rest of this discussion we will use the ecdf method as a marker for an optimistic assessment of the reliability of empirically determined thresholds 3 discussion 3 1 deleterious effects of short record lengths the small sample sizes discussed here and shown in fig 2 are typical of the historical datasets used in setting thresholds for planning exercises and impacts studies this analysis shows that the actual probabilities of these thresholds in the underlying cdf can be substantially different from the intended probabilities whether or not these discrepancies make a difference depends on how the thresholds will be used in subsequent analysis in cases where the intended use is to do a statistical analysis of extreme events with the threshold value defining extreme discrepancies in threshold values could have a profound influence on the outcome of the analysis by creating spurious effects or obscuring real hydrometeorologic behavior consider for example applications of the standardized precipitation index spi recall from section 1 that spi values are cdf probabilities from a gamma distribution fit to the record expressed as quantiles of the standard normal distribution typically the spi is binned into categories ranging from extremely dry p 0 02 through extremely wet p 0 98 table 1 shows the spi and cdf values corresponding to these categories the severely dry bin comprises 0 02 p 0 07 using eq 3 we can see that for n 100 the confidence interval for the p 0 07 quantile estimate is p 0 07 0 05 if the true p is close to the lower end of that range then the entire severely dry bin could be miscategorized into less dry categories conversely if the true value of p is close to the high end of that range nearly half of the moderately dry bin could be placed in the wrong category these errors are the extreme edge of the confidence interval so most sites will have smaller errors than these however in a large dataset such as a grid cell level analysis in a gridded dataset one is practically guaranteed to see errors this large in at least some parts of the data these theoretical effects have been observed in data wu et al 2005 examined the effect of shorter and longer record lengths on spi calculations they compared spi derived categories for 30 year records to categories similarly derived from longer records for the 24 week spi 65 independent observations in the 30 year period the fraction of observations that had category discrepancies ranged from 11 to 22 over the various sites and periods they studied at one of the sites nearly 10 of the observations had discrepancies of two or more categories such discrepancies could have profound influence on for example water use restrictions based on spi quiring 2009 in light of these results it seems clear that where possible short records should not be used to establish thresholds or bin boundaries what constitutes a short record in this context can be counterintuitive as discussed in section 1 one commonly used method of grouping the data for analysis results in just a single effective observation per year in the record in such an analysis fig 1 and fig 2 show that a 100 year record will produce unreliable estimates of cdfs or quantile values possibly creating severe distortions in any results based on them one way to address this problem is to accept the analytical limitations imposed by short records and to acknowledge them in results as larger confidence intervals this strategy is most effective when adopting the upper edge of the confidence interval serves as a conservative estimate of the quantity of interest for example consider the return period t which is related to the probability p by t 1 p in other words a 50 year return period means identifying the p 0 02 quantile in the underlying unknown distribution as demonstrated above there is considerable uncertainty in any values arrived at for p 0 02 from the ecdf suppose one is designing for a return period t with a desired 95 probability that the return period is longer than some time window of interest t 1 p 0 where p 0 is the event probability that corresponds to the desired minimum return period following this conservative estimate approach a design could be based on selecting the p quantile such that p ε p 0 since ε is given by eq 2 we can solve for p 4 p 2 np 0 4 2 np 0 4 2 4 np 0 2 n 4 2 n 4 however for short records this approach can result in substantial overdesign for n 100 to give 95 confidence of t 50 years eq 4 suggests one must select p 0 0054 the expected return period would therefore be over 185 years more than three times the intended value this example illustrates a general principle viz that because of the inverse relationship between t and p errors in return period t can be very large even for seemingly large samples fig 3 shows the relationship between sample size and return period uncertainty even with 1000 years of data assuming one effective sample per year the uncertainty on the estimate of a 50 year return period is 20 years 3 2 methods for extending short records for some applications such as drought severity intensity and duration calculations involving thresholds large errors in either direction for the threshold estimates will render the analysis meaningless a variety of techniques have been proposed to extend the record length so as to reduce the uncertainties in these analyses one strategy is to pool information from other locations in an attempt to create a longer record such methods are referred to in the literature by a variety of names including regional frequency analysis cunnane 1988 hosking and wallis 1993 and transfer methods zaidman et al 2003 these approaches draw in observations from other locations with presumed similar characteristics to extend the effective length of the hydrometeorologic record tallaksen et al 2004 as is often done in the flood estimation literature hirsch 1982 vogel and stedinger 1985 one assumption underlying these methods is that the measurements from donor locations have the same probability distribution possibly after scaling the data by some factor as the target location this procedure is equivalent to combining the observations using complete pooling the assumption of identical distributions across sites can be relaxed using statistical techniques such as hierarchical partial pooling mcelreath 2018 ch 12 but this possibility does not seem to have been well explored in the hydrology literature the efficacy of pooling methods depends on the degree of spatial correlation between the locations being pooled an independent donor location effectively extends the record by the number of observations at the donor location correlated donor locations however are less effective at reducing uncertainty a topic explored in depth by hosking and wallis 1988 fig 4 shows the results of a simulation experiment described in detail in appendix b exploring the dependence of ε on n when the donor locations are correlated with the target location each location has a record length of 100 and there are up to 9 locations to use to extend the record length for the original location the results show that correlation reduces the effectiveness of adding additional sites but the size of the effect depends on what statistic is being measured in the case of the 10th percentile for a correlation coefficient between locations of 0 5 adding nine donor locations provides only as much reduction in ε as a single uncorrelated donor location would have done in the case of the first percentile the nine donor locations provide additional certainty equivalent to between four and five uncorrelated observations the magnitude of the effect of inter site dependence however is sensitive to the structure of the dependence the right column of fig 4 shows ε versus n for a dependence structure based on a t copula hofert et al 2019 these simulated datasets have stronger tail dependence than the ones from the gaussian copula family left column of the figure we can see that for equivalent nominal values of n errors are higher for the t copula family than for the corresponding member of the gaussian family in fact even for a correlation of 0 the t family still exhibits some tail dependence resulting in a lower effective n relative to independent sites ten sites with this level of tail dependence only provide about as much information as 6 independent sites even when the measured correlation is zero from this we conclude that site pooling should be used to augment the record only with extreme caution a second approach is to augment the historical record by using observations of tree ring records meko et al 2007 kress et al 2010 gonzález valdés 2003 this approach is similarly used in flood frequency analysis hupp 1988 yanosky and jarrett 2002 however these approaches are not practical in the context of national and global assessments of drought that encompass areas with significant data limitations alternatively instead of trying to extend an existing record one could obtain a longer record by running a model or a collection of models that purport to reproduce the dynamical behavior of the system the advantage of this approach is that the model can be run for as long as needed to generate a sufficiently long record however this assumes that the model output is a faithful representation of the physical system moreover some of the most sophisticated models such as earth system models require significant computing resources to run therefore although the length of the record that can be generated this way is theoretically unlimited there may be practical limitations recently however a variety of emulators and surrogate models have become available e g link et al 2019 lu and ricciuto 2019 which allow for the possibility of generating very large collections of simulation data at reasonable computational cost 4 conclusion the effects of record length on the reliability of drought thresholds i e truncation levels and on the reliability of subsequent threshold based analyses have largely been underestimated or ignored in the hydrological literature this is perhaps due to the lack of a robust and tractable solution however as shown in this paper adequate sampling of the tails of any distribution requires substantially more data than is available from most historical records and inadequate sampling of the tails can have substantial real world consequences for many common analysis types used in the translational science community approximately 1000 or more independent samples may be needed for a sufficiently reliable tail value estimate although we have focused on drought research in this discussion the statistical problems caused by short historical record lengths extends to many other types of research involving extremes flooding is another notable example in hydrology heatwaves are also similarly defined robinson 2001 have direct consequences for human mortality anderson and bell 2009 anderson and bell 2010 and have impacts on building and energy infrastructure via deployment of cooling technologies to combat expected heat waves mcevoy et al 2012 nguyen et al 2010 wilhelmi et al 2004 the distribution independent estimates arrived at in this analysis such as eqs 2 and 3 should be broadly useful in applications at the interface of human and natural systems research that depends implicitly or explicitly on quantiles derived from a historical record period should at a minimum include an analysis of the uncertainties associated with the historical estimates of the quantile values and how those uncertainties affect the results eq 2 can be used to compute a distribution independent estimate of these uncertainties another option is to use eq 3 to estimate the sample size required to reduce the uncertainty from the record period to an acceptable level then a method such as the ones described in section 3 2 can be used to extend the record as required however users of these methods should exercise caution each of the methods has limitations issues like spatial dependence should be carefully considered and their effects on results evaluated screening for spatial dependence should include estimates of tail dependence as it can be present even when measures of correlation are small regardless of the approach used to address this issue this analysis has made it clear that ignoring the uncertainties in threshold estimates arrived at from 50 to 100 year long historical records has serious impacts on human relevant quantities including and beyond drought return periods such as flood return periods and heat wave analysis for many types of societally

to influence the work reported in this paper appendix a normal approximation to the beta distribution consider a bernoulli experiment repeated n times with n successes if our prior for the success probability p is uniform then the posterior probability is p beta n 1 n n 1 or for the maximum a posteriori estimate of p p n n 5 p beta np 1 n 1 p 1 to derive an analytically tractable estimate of the error as a function of n as in eq 2 we can approximate this distribution with a normal distribution having equivalent mode and variance centering the normal approximation at the mean of the beta distribution would produce a better approximation but centering at the mode is more consistent with the typical usage of quoting an error of the form p ε the variance of the distribution beta α β is walck 1996 6 σ 2 α β α β 2 α β 1 or in terms of n and p 7 σ 2 n 2 p 1 p n 1 n 2 2 n 3 even for relatively small n the lower order terms in the numerator and denominator are negligible so we can simplify to 8 σ 2 n 2 p 1 p n 3 p 1 p n eq 2 is derived from this expression in conjunction with the fact that the half width of 95 confidence interval for the standard normal is 1 96 which we have rounded to 2 for convenience how good is this approximation one area of concern is that for p 0 5 the beta distribution is skewed whereas the normal distribution is symmetric the skewness of beta α β is johnson et al 1995 9 γ 1 2 β α α β 1 α β 2 α β written in terms of p and n 10 γ 1 2 n 2 p 1 n 3 n 4 p 1 p n 2 n 1 the numerator in this expression is o n 3 2 and the denominator is o n 2 therefore the entire expression is o n 1 2 indicating that with p fixed skewness decreases as 1 n as a practical matter the normal approximation to the beta distribution is reasonably good by the time n 100 the smallest sample size we consider in this paper fig 5 shows a comparison of the probability density function for a beta distribution with p 0 1 and n 100 along with the normal approximation described above the equal tail 95 confidence interval for the beta distribution is 0 056 0 17 giving a width of 0 119 the corresponding interval for the normal approximation is 0 041 0 16 giving a width of 0 118 the lack of skewness in the normal approximation is apparent in these figures but the widths of the intervals are practically the same therefore the difference between the beta and normal approximations is not so large that it would alter the basic conclusion that n 100 is too small to provide a reliable estimate of the 10th percentile by the time we get up to values of n corresponding to a desirable value of ε in eqs 2 and 3 the differences between the approximation and the true intervals are small enough not to matter appendix b simulation of correlated sites augmenting the record from a site by pooling data from other sites implicitly assumes that the data from the other sites is statistically independent if this assumption is violated then the amount of information provided by the additional sites may be less than is suggested by the nominal number of observations n the magnitude of this effect depends on the strength and structure of the dependence between the sites being pooled to investigate the effect of inter site dependence on pooling we use a simulation experiment in this experiment we select a joint distribution h x 1 x 2 x k for k different hypothetical sites this distribution is constructed so as to have a known identical marginal distribution f for the variables at each site along with a known dependence structure including both correlation and potentially other forms of dependence we then draw samples from the sites and estimate the 0 1 and 0 01 quantiles q 10 and q 1 with data pooled from 1 2 k sites because we know the true marginal distribution f we can estimate the true probability levels f q 10 and f q 1 for the putative 0 1 and 0 01 quantiles as a function of n the difference between these true probability levels and the nominal values is the error ε we repeat the sampling procedure 5000 times to get an average value for ε which we tabulate as a function of n by repeating the experiment with different distributions h we can investigate the sensitivity of the error to the inter site correlation and other measures of inter site dependence we represent inter site dependence using copula models nelsen 2007 hofert et al 2019 a copula model allows us to specify the inter site dependence structure irrespective of the marginal distribution by sklar s theorem a copula can be transformed to have any desired marginal distribution however the error in probability level ε is invariant under such transformations so in practice it is not necessary to specify a marginal distribution for purposes of the simulation the copula package hofert et al 2018 in r r core team 2019 was used to construct and sample from the copula models in this experiment we considered two families of joint distributions the first was based on the gaussian copula which expresses the dependence structure exhibited by a multivariate normal distribution this family is parameterized by the correlation as measured by spearman s rho ρ s and it generally corresponds to what is meant by correlated data in this experiment we looked at ρ s values of 0 0 1 0 5 and 0 9 the model with ρ s 0 is of particular importance since it corresponds to independent sites it therefore serves as a baseline against which all of the other models can be judged the second family of joint distributions was based on the t copula which expresses the dependence structure exhibited by a multivariate student s t distribution this family has two parameters correlation ρ and degrees of freedom ν the former is equivalent to the parameter in the normal copula while the latter is derived from the corresponding parameter in the univariate t distribution the principal difference between the gaussian copula and the t copula is that the latter exhibits tail dependence an asymptotic association between values in the tail of the distribution while the gaussian copula does not smaller values of ν produce more tail dependence but the coefficient of tail dependence λ depends on both ρ and ν for this experiment we fixed ν 4 which resulted in λ values ranging from 0 08 for ρ 0 to 0 6 for ρ 0 9 note that the nonzero tail dependence means that for this family even when ρ 0 the simulated sites are not independent and error values ε are accordingly larger than the errors produced by independent samples the results of these simulations are plotted in fig 4 with the gaussian family in the left column and the t family in the right and they are discussed in section 3 2
