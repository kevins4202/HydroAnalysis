13800,the main aim of this work was the development of the chemical activated carbon ac method from specific wood biomass i e eucalyptus camaldulensis sawdust ecs and this ac is proposed as a promising alternative treatment for hazardous cr vi from aqueous solution ecs waste sawdust was carbonized in two stages i e 170 c for 60 min followed by 500 c for 120 min under the continuous steam of nitrogen gas and rated as an efficient method with h3po4 activation 80 cr vi removal finally activated carbon eucalyptus camaldulensis sawdust ac ecs was selected for batch and column reactor studies and different influencing parameters such as contact time ph temperature initial cr vi metal concentration particle size and bed height were optimized ac ecs was characterized through analysis by sem edx ftir and bet cr vi adsorption was found to be highly ph dependent i e 87 at ph 3 0 ac ecs adsorption mechanism for cr vi with experimental and maximum predicted adsorption capacities of 104 and 125 mg g 1 respectively was best described by the langmuir isotherm r2 0 999 and pseudo second order kinetics r2 0 999 the column study showed an improvement in the breakthrough curve time from 5595 to 12 270 min with the respective increase of bed height from 5 to 15 cm respectively column breakthrough data was found to be well fitted to the bed depth service time model current batch and column studies indicate that freshwater contamination with cr vi can be managed by upscaling the ac ecs as an efficient treatment solution keywords specific plant precursors eucalyptus camaldulensis sawdust mesoporous activated carbon batch and column adsorption equilibrium kinetics breakthrough curve 1 introduction increasing industrialization urbanization and agricultural activities result in the production of various obnoxious environmental pollutants including heavy metal ions at exceeding threshold levels 1 which adversely affect both the environment and the health of living organisms 2 heavy metal ions are found to be toxic non biodegradable carcinogenic persistent and possess bioaccumulation capability 3 hence they are responsible for health related issues in humans such as brain damage renal and neurological failure 4 lead mercury cadmium chromium and arsenic are well reported highly toxic metallic ions 5 6 among various heavy metal ions chromium is commonly used and it can enter into various components of the environment like soil air and natural waters through effluent discharge from different well known industries such as tanneries alloys electroplating paint and pigments metal processing textiles dyeing steel manufacturing and canning 7 environmental pollution caused by cr vi is gaining attention globally because of its high content in the soil and water chromium is reported above the allowable concentrations in soil and groundwater in various parts of different countries e g india china and pakistan 8 10 pakistan has a large number of registered and unregistered tanneries along with the footwear manufacturing units that release chromium rich effluents in sahiwal a central district in the punjab province of pakistan chromium pollution in drinking water has been reported to be as high as 5 50 mg l 1 11 the toxicity of chromium in a solution depends on its oxidizing state in natural waters chromium is usually found in two major oxidation states i e cr iii and cr vi with each type having different physicochemical properties toxicity level and bioavailability cr vi has been reported to be more toxic as compared to cr iii 12 although trace amounts of cr iii are essential for the metabolism of protein fat and carbohydrates 13 but large amounts of cr iii become toxic 14 cr iii possesses very low solubility as well as mobility and is sorbed by the soil that prevents it from leaching into the groundwater along with its absorption by the plants in acidic medium cr vi is most likely present as hydrogen chromate hcro4 and dichromate cr2o7 2 anions while in basic media it exists as chromate anions cro4 2 13 all of these cr vi ions have high solubility and strong oxidation rendering them very active in various environmental niches including soil and water 15 high solubility and mobility of the cr vi in aqueous medium serving as gateways to enter into the living biota causing various neurological and physiological disorders such as anemia nausea diarrhea epigastric discomfort internal hemorrhaging circulatory shutdown liver or stomach damage ulcers vomiting lung cancer kidney cancer eye and skin irritation 13 the toxicity mutagenicity and cytotoxicity caused by cr vi have been reported to be 1000 times higher than those caused by cr iii 16 because of its elevated toxic level united states environment protection agency us epa has classified cr vi in to group a inhalation carcinogen while international agency for research on cancer has placed it in group i of human carcinogen 7 cr vi is the third most common hazardous pollutant present at the waste disposal sites and is among the eight most harmful chemicals to the human body 17 the toxicity of cr vi was correlated with its oxidizing power as it strongly oxidizes biomolecules such as protein and dna 18 because of its high mutagenic characteristics it may also affect reproductive health harm dna and can trigger various birth defects 18 a groundwater study for cr in the catchment of luan river in china showed an average hazard value of 2 074 for residents in the nearby area which is 2 074 times greater than the permissible value of 1 overall the average carcinogenic risk value for cr was 3 99 10 5 19 in another study cr vi was reported to be 0 027 2 48 mg l 1 in the surface water and 1 35 mg l 1 in the groundwater in the sukinda area of odisha state of india the cancer risk caused by the cr vi in adults and children of sukinda was 1 21 10 3 and 1 05 10 3 respectively while oral hazard index was 1 90 and 1 64 times higher in the same age groups 20 literature also reported the highest probability of cancer risks i e 6 54 10 3 from the chromium in drinking water to the residents of khorramabad iran 21 cr vi also affects the physiology of plants biochemical cycle resulting in necrosis slow growth and chlorosis in several countries as set out in the epa guidelines acceptable limits of cr vi for inland surface water drinking water and industrial effluent are 0 1 mg l 1 0 05 mg l 1 and 0 25 mg l 1 respectively 22 therefore it becomes imperative to keep the concentration of cr vi in the industrial effluents within permissible levels before drainage into the freshwater reservoirs different techniques such as chemical precipitation reduction ion exchange solvent extractions electrochemical precipitation membrane separation evaporation and reverse osmosis have been documented for the removal of cr vi these methods are not environmentally friendly due to the resulting sludge which poses disposal hazards and pollution risks to the environment adsorption has emerged as a highly effective technique for the removal of heavy metal ions and being low cost and easy designing and operation is prioritized over the other methods 23 in adsorption processes activated carbon is the most widely used traditional adsorbent and is efficient in extracting various contaminants from wastewater 24 agricultural waste containing lignin and celluloses materials could be a potential alternative and low cost source for the production of activated carbon 25 because of its abundance economic viability and regenerability these wastes also exhibit good properties such as a low amount of inorganic material as the presence of inorganic materials in the precursor material affecting the adsorption capacity of the resulting activated adsorbents in addition high volatile contents i e above 50 help to establish basic pore structure throughout the carbonization process 26 preparation of activated carbon from organic materials involves two steps first the carbonization of raw material under the inert atmosphere which not only increases the yield of carbon contents but also helps to create the initial porosity of the material in the second step the pre carbonized material is activated by either of the physical or chemical methods to increase the overall porosity in the case of physical activation the carbonization of the precursor is performed in an inert atmosphere nitrogen gas followed by the activation using oxidizing agents steam or carbon dioxide co2 the precursor material is first impregnated with various chemicals such as h3po4 zncl2 alcl3 naoh or koh during chemical activation followed by carbonization in the presence of an inert atmosphere 27 h3po4 is widely used as impregnating agent because of low cost and environment friendly nature 28 chemical activation is preferred over physical activation because it requires lower carbonization temperature and less activation time chemical activation also contributes to the formation of a mesoporous adsorbent with a large surface area 29 adsorption capacity is one of the important features of the activated carbon and depends on the in built nature of the precursor material along with its method of preparation 25 it is determined by various conditions of activation such as time of activation activating chemical and temperature activating chemicals have an enormous impact on both the surface properties and porosity of the resulting activated carbon it is the need of the hour to identify local adsorbents with judicious costs and high adsorption potential for cr vi different activated biomasses have shown promising potential for treatment of cr vi in batch and column studies i e peach stone 99 58 30 leucaena leucocephala seed pod 81 31 groundnut hull 96 32 sargassum myriocystum 53 57 33 corn cob 39 8 and orange peel 30 6 34 fungal biomasses for instance penicillium griseofulvum msr1 35 aspergillus niger msr4 36 ceratocystis paradoxa msr2 37 graphene oxide chitosan ferrite nanocomposite 38 and novel nanocomposite 39 adsorbents have also been used for the wastewater treatment cr vi adsorption mechanism on activated carbon has been studied by various researchers and revealed that one amongst possible mechanisms including physical adsorption electrostatic attraction ion exchange chemical adsorption adsorption coupled reduction and reduction to cr iii are involved in the cr vi adsorption on the surface of adsorbent 40 nevertheless increasing efforts are being underway to search for more abundant available lignocellulosic wastes as a potential precursor for activated carbon ac preparation and its successful application for the hazardous cr vi adsorptions in both batch and column modes adsorption can be achieved by experiments in batch and fixed bed column reactors 41 however fixed bed column adsorption is preferred over batch mode as the data obtained from the column studies are useful for the treatment of industrial effluent 42 43 comprehensive insights into the column adsorption output are being provided by the breakthrough time and curve as per existing knowledge eucalyptus camaldulensis sawdust waste has not been investigated in activated forms in both batch and column modes simultaneously it is an evergreen abundant and rapidly grown tree in pakistan and its sawdust is produced from the wood industry as waste 41 therefore the current study was aimed at refining the chemically activated carbon ac preparation methods using the sawdust waste from eucalyptus camaldulensis the effective ac preparation was then employed for different lignocellulosic waste biosorbents and the most efficient precursor was selected besides adsorption experiments on batch and column reactors were carried out the adsorption mechanisms and spontaneity of the adsorption process were explored through various isotherms kinetics and thermodynamic studies adsorbent regeneration and metal recovery experiments were also performed in the analysis of the fixed bed column the breakthrough curve for cr vi adsorption was also explored through the bed depth service time bdst model 2 materials and methods 2 1 lignocellulosic wastes collection and initial treatment four abundantly available biomasses eucalyptus camaldulensis sawdust nicotiana tabacum tobacco stems eucalyptus camaldulensis bark and melia azedarach white cedar sawdust were collected from the khyber pakhtunkhwa province of pakistan the collected biomasses were washed using deionized water to remove all the adhesive dust particles and dried at room temperature for 24 h the biomasses were then placed in an oven at 60 c for 12 h and the complete dryness was ensured untill constant weight was obtained after drying all adsorbents were ground using an electrical grinder jm disk mill model ffc 15 and then separated into different particle sizes 420 250 177 149 125 and 105 μm using a set of variable sieves of 40 60 80 100 120 and 140 mesh sizes 2 2 development of various methods of ac preparation for an efficient cr vi adsorption five different methods given below were developed and the optimum ac preparation conditions were optimized based on cr vi adsorption efficiency 80 cr vi at the lab scale eucalyptus camaldulensis sawdust was taken as a precursor lignocellulosic waste 2 2 1 method i eucalyptus camaldulensis sawdust was first impregnated in 1 m solution of different chemicals i e phosphoric acid hydrochloric acid nitric acid acetic acid and sulphuric acid in the ratio of 1 7 biomass acid g ml the mixture was then immediately boiled at 80 c for 30 min with heating mantle afterward the precursor material was washed with deionized water until neutral ph was recorded and then dried at 60 c for 900 min lastly the dried material was carbonized in a muffle furnace at 300 c for 180 min in the presence of a nitrogen stream the inert atmosphere was maintained with continuous nitrogen supply until carbonized material had cooled down to 80 c 2 2 2 method ii the procedure of ac preparation under this method was the same as explained in the method i except that after impregnation of biomass with the reagents the mixture was tightly covered and left overnight to ensure the complete absorption of acids in the precursor biomass after that the mixture was boiled at 80 c for 30 min the precursor material was washed with deionized water until neutral ph and then dried at 60 c for 900 min 2 2 3 method iii in method iii some of the adsorbent prepared from method ii was carbonized in a muffle furnace at 300 c for 180 min in the presence of nitrogen gas in order to prevent the burning of adsorbent biomass nitrogen gas flow and pressure were maintained at 180 ml min 1 and 100 psi respectively 2 2 4 method iv instead of eucalyptus camaldulensis sawdust eucalyptus camaldulensis wood was carbonized in the presence of nitrogen at 500 c for 30 min the inert atmosphere was maintained with continuous nitrogen supply until carbonized material cooled down to 80 c after that the carbonized wood was ground sieved through 40 mm mesh size and impregnated with 1 m solution of reagents i e phosphoric acid hydrochloric acid nitric acid acetic acid and sulphuric acid using ratio of 1 7 biomass acid g ml and left overnight the precursor material was washed with deionized water until neutral ph was reached and then dried at 60 c for 900 min 2 2 5 method v the precursor lignocellulosic waste was impregnated in five reagents i e phosphoric acid hydrochloric acid nitric acid acetic acid and sulphuric acid in the ratio of 1 2 biomass acid g ml and left overnight carbonization was carried out in the presence of nitrogen gas in two stages initially at 170 c for 60 min and then at 500 c for 120 min the inert atmosphere was maintained with continuous nitrogen supply until carbonized material cooled down to 80 c precursor material was then washed with deionized water until neutral ph was reached followed by drying at 70 c for 720 min the particle size ratio of 2 3 40 microns less than 40 microns was maintained in the batch cr vi adsorption the cr vi adsorption efficiency of ac prepared using the above methods was evaluated in batch experiments as a function of initial adsorbate concentration 50 mg l 1 adsorbent dose 0 05 g ac l 1 ph 5 5 temperature 30 c agitation speed 220 rpm and contact time 120 min amongst these h3po4 activated carbon following the method v was found to be efficient 80 removal against cr vi adsorption see fig 1 a results and discussion 2 3 selection of an efficient lignocellulosic waste precursor for ac preparation in order to determine the specificity of method and the lignocellulosic waste precursor the same conditions of ac preparation as stated in method v along with h3po4 activation were applied to three other lignocellulosic wastes precursors i e nicotiana tabacum stem acnst eucalyptus camaldulensis bark aceb and melia azedarach sawdust acms ac prepared from these waste biomasses were also examined for cr vi adsorption efficiency and the batch conditions were kept the same as stated above finally the ac ecs showed an efficient cr vi removal potential among the waste precursors tested and was selected for further batch experiments see fig 1 b 2 4 solution preparation stock solution 1000 mg l 1 of potassium dichromate k2cr2o7 was prepared by dissolving 2 83 g of analytical grade potassium dichromate in 1000 ml deionized water however the required concentration of solutions was further prepared by diluting the stock solution with deionized water the ph of the solution was maintained by using 0 1 m hcl of naoh solutions already prepared for this purpose 2 5 batch experimentation of ac ecs for cr vi adsorption adsorption capacity and behavior of the selected ac ecs during cr vi adsorption were determined in the batch experiments in this experiment 50 ml of cr vi solution with a concentration of 50 mg l 1 was taken in a 100 ml flask the adsorbent dose of 0 05 g was added to the flask containing cr vi solution with an original ph of 5 5 and was shaken at 220 rpm in a temperature controlled 30 c orbital incubator wise cube korea samples were filtered using a cellulose nitrate filter paper of 0 45 μm size atomic absorption spectrophotometer perkin elmer aanalyst 700 was used for the analysis of the residual concentration of cr vi in the filtrate the effect of various process variables i e contact time 20 840 min particle size 105 420 μm initial cr vi concentration 10 150 mg l 1 temperature 25 50 c and ph 2 0 7 0 on the cr vi adsorption by ac ecs were also examined at pre determined time intervals the samples were taken out of the shaking incubator to get the equilibrium time while all other parameters were optimized at the equilibrium time each experiment was performed in triplicate to ensure the accuracy of results adsorption capacity at any time t of contact was determined by the general formula 1 q c 0 c f v m q is the cr vi adsorption capacity mg g 1 and co and cf indicate the initial and the final concentrations of cr vi mg l 1 respectively v represents the volume of the cr vi solution used while m is the mass of the adsorbent the removal percentage of cr vi was determined using the eq 2 2 r e m o v a l c 0 c f c 0 100 2 6 equilibrium kinetics and thermodynamic studies various isotherm models such as langmuir freundlich halsey temkin d r and harkin jura were applied to the equilibrium data obtained at variable initial concentrations of cr vi and the phenomenon behind cr vi adsorption on the ac ecs was investigated a kinetic study was also carried out to find the mechanism and cr vi adsorption rate the thermodynamic study was conducted to calculate the enthalpy of the system spontaneity of the adsorption reaction and randomness at the solid solution interface 2 7 column experimentation glass tube with a height of 50 cm and an internal diameter of 2 5 cm was filled with ac ecs up to the desired height of the bed and then used for column experiments for better adsorbent packing and to prevent any adsorbent loss both ends of the glass tube were covered with glass wool and glass beads layer column experiments were performed by adjusting the bed height 5 10 and 15 cm peristaltic pump with a flow rate of 10 ml min 1 was used for the downward movement of 50 mg l 1 cr vi solution through the column bed the solution of cr vi was kept at an optimal ph value of 3 0 as discussed in the batch experiment the effluent from the column was collected and tested for residual cr vi concentration at predefined time intervals effluent volume i e vef ml can be measured using eq 3 3 v ef q t total where q indicates the flow rate of the cr vi solution which is measured in ml min 1 and ttotal indicates total flow time which is measured in min q0 5 is the 50 breakthrough capacity ct co 0 5 of cr vi mg g 1 adsorption and can be calculated using eq 4 4 q 0 5 breakthrough time at 50 flow rate inlet concentration mass of adsorbent in the bed g bdst model was used to analyze the column adsorption data 2 8 characterization various analytical tools were used to characterize the ac ecs before and after loading with cr vi the speciﬁc surface area was determined by brunauer emmett teller bet analysis tristar ii 3020 version 2 00 at 77 k in an n2 atmosphere pore volume was determined from the volume of the absorbed nitrogen at p p 0 99 and the pore size was calculated from 4 v a by bet the morphology of the adsorbent surface was determined using a secondary electron detector jsm 5910 with scanning electron microscope sem sem images were recorded at magnifications of x1000 and x2000 and a voltage of 20 kv energy dispersive x ray spectrometer edx oxford made uk model inca 200 was used to find the elemental composition and evidence of the cr vi adsorption ftir spectrum two analysis was carried out to identify the functional groups involved in cr vi adsorption ph drift method was used to assess the ph at the point of zero charges phpzc where a series of 0 01 m nacl solutions were prepared for various initial ph levels from 2 0 to 10 0 the ph was adjusted using 0 1 m solutions of hcl and naoh 0 05 g of ac ecs was then added to each 50 ml of nacl solution and afterward the samples were agitated at 220 rpm at 30 c for 24 h then final ph values were measured with the help of ph meter and the graph was plotted between initial phi and final phf values of the solutions phpzc is noted as a point where the curve between phi and phf intersects the line phi versus phf 2 9 desorption experiment in this experiment 0 05 g of ac ecs was first treated with cr vi solution under optimum time 540 min ph 3 0 and temperature 50 c conditions after filtration cr vi loaded ac ecs was dried in next step the dried cr vi loaded ac ecs adsorbent was agitated at 220 rpm for 180 min with 0 1 m solutions of various chemicals i e potassium hydroxide sulphuric acid n hexane nitric acid acetic acid ethanol phosphoric acid hydrochloric acid acetone citric acid methanol copper sulfate acetonitrile ethyl acetate ferrous sulfate sodium hydroxide and deionized water desorption study was carried out at a temperature of 35 c as the batch temperature study showed endothermic adsorption so the temperature was chosen for desorption where low cr vi adsorption was seen which may lead to further metal desorption percentage desorption of cr vi was calculated by the eq 5 5 c r v i d e s o r p t i o n a m o u n t o f c r v i d e s o r b e d a m o u n t o f c r v i a d s o r b e d 100 2 10 statistical analysis each triplicate experiment was performed maintaining identical conditions in order to obtain credible results adsorption data were analyzed by anova one way analysis of variance at a significance level of 0 01 using statistica software version 10 3 results and discussion 3 1 development and selection of activated carbon preparation method method v showed encouraging results for cr vi removal by 82 with phosphoric acid followed by hydrochloric acid 43 3 among the conditions tested for ac ecs preparation the method i exhibited maximum removal with nitric acid 35 82 acetic acid 32 28 and sulphuric acid 30 38 as shown in fig 1 a the average removal of sulphuric acid ac ecs prepared from method ii and method iv was 15 and 26 respectively whereas method iii showed poor performance after the acetic acid activation for the cr vi removal 17 efficient adsorption of cr vi by ac ecs following method v can be ascribed to the use of concentrated acids and two stage pyrolysis this can result in the production of high porosity high surface area and low ash content which enhanced the cr vi adsorption from aqueous solution fig 1 b indicated the efficacy and applicability of method v for ac preparation on three other waste precursors data showed the cr vi removal efficiency of acms acnst and aceb by 61 49 78 and 45 82 respectively nonetheless these activated waste precursors prepared by method v exhibited low adsorption efficiency for cr vi compared to ac ecs which showed efficient removal of cr vi 80 the best outcome of ac ecs may be attributed to the built in nature of the eucalyptus camaldulensis and the use of h3po4 literature reported the presence of cellulose hemicellulose lignin extractive and an ash content by 31 27 39 1 24 4 77 and 0 86 respectively in the aforesaid biomass 44 45 elemental composition and functional groups for precursor materials i e eucalyptus camaldulensis melia azedarach sawdust nicotiana tabacum stem and eucalyptus camaldulensis bark have also been reported in our already published work 41 46 in addition h3po4 was found to be a stronger activating reagent in contrast with hno3 hcl ch3cooh and h2so4 since during the activation phase it may serve as an acid catalyst and dehydrating agent to improve the hydrolysis bond cleavage condensation and cross linking reactions between phosphoric acid and biopolymers of the lignocellulosic material literature also shows that h3po4 may act as a template because the volume occupied within the activated biomass correlates with the volume micropore of the derived activated carbon 47 ac ecs was chosen further for further studies in batch and column reactor as well as process variable optimization 3 2 brunauer emmett teller bet analysis adsorption capacity is an important characteristic of the activated carbon and is proportional to the surface area bet surface area of the ac ecs was found to be 217 14 m2 g 1 higher than that reported for activated carbon produced from the leucaena leucocephala seedpod 31 ziziphus spina christi leaf 48 and palm kernel shell 49 i e 89 74 m2 g 1 69 43 m2 g 1 and 121 82 m2 g 1 respectively 50 pore volume of ac ecs was observed as 0 344 cm3 g 1 which is higher than ac derived from leucaena leucocephala seed pod 0 0232 cm3 g 1 31 coal tar pitch 0 285 cm3 g 1 51 and cashew nutshell 0 2209 cm3 g 1 52 adsorption properties are determined by the pore size of the activated adsorbent for instance micropores will not adsorb the adsorbate with large molecular size and macropores will not adsorb small molecular size adsorbates however mesopores promote diffusion as well as adsorption of larger adsorbates 53 according to iupac pore sizes are classified based on pore diameter i e micropores 20 å mesopores between 20 å and 500 å and macropores 500 å in the current study pore size 4 v a by bet of the ac ecs was found to be 63 36 å which is higher than activated leucaena leucocephala 3 59 å seedpod 31 it reveals the mesoporous nature of the ac ecs which could have promising application for liquid phase adsorption of any adsorbate tamarind seed activated with koh also have mesopores having a pore size of 67 98 å 54 large surface area and mesoporous nature of the ac ecs favors the efficient cr vi adsorption 82 and suggests the selection of ac preparation method and ecs as the waste biomass precursor 3 3 sem and edx analysis sem photographs of the ac ecs were taken with magnifications of x1 000 and x2 000 fig 2 a and b they showed the porous and rough surface of the ac ecs which could well facilitate the cr vi adsorption edx spectra for ac ecs displayed the presence of c 48 98 o 35 11 and p 15 91 by weight fig 2 c nevertheless in the case of chromium loaded adsorbent apart from c 53 72 o 28 87 and p 5 17 an extra peak at 0 5 kev confirmed the cr vi adsorption 55 on the ac ecs surface by 12 24 fig 2 d other characteristic peaks for cr vi were also observed at 5 and 6 kev also suggesting the adsorption of chromate anions 56 3 4 ftir analysis of ac ecs the ftir peak at 852 cm 1 is assigned to the aromatic cc stretching 57 the peak fig s1 a at 942 cm 1 refers to deformation outside the plane of oh band 58 nevertheless the peak appeared at 1086 cm 1 is characteristic of the stretching of co band 59 and symmetric po2 60 the presence of phosphorous was also confirmed through edx analysis another peak at 1193 cm 1 shows co of carboxyl functional group 61 while the peak at 1584 cm 1 indicates carboxylates and lactones 62 the peak at 1715 cm 1 is attributed to the stretching of co 63 but the peak at 3417 cm 1 depicts the stretching of oh bands 64 the shift in five peaks were observed fig s1 a and b from 852 cm 1 740 cm 1 942 cm 1 914 cm 1 1086 cm 1 1096 cm 1 1193 cm 1 1247 cm 1 and 1715 cm 1 1719 cm 1 which showed the involvement of cc oh co po2 and c o in cr vi adsorption 3 5 batch process variables 3 5 1 time cr vi adsorption was examined over a wide range of contact time from 20 840 min data revealed an increase in cr vi adsorption capacity over time as shown in fig 3 a while the maximum value 39 36 mg g 1 78 72 was observed at 540 min after that time there was no significant p 0 01 increase in the adsorption this can be ascribed to the availability of initially more vacant sites on the surface of ac ecs and macroporosity as shown in fig 2 a which can promote the rapid adsorption of cr vi furthermore the remaining vacant sites are less accessible to the cr vi ions with time lapse 65 because of the possible repulsion between already adsorbed ions and ions in the solution the equilibrium point is the time at which the adsorbent reaches the saturation state 66 and could not adsorb metals further so the increase in cr vi adsorption capacity was not observed after 540 min thus this point was marked as the equilibrium time and the batch experiments for the rest of the influencing parameters were performed until equilibrium time 3 5 2 temperature and thermodynamic temperature considerably affects the metal adsorption mechanism because it changes molecular interaction and solubility the effects of temperature on cr vi adsorption were studied at two temperature ranges i e t1 298 308 k and t2 313 323 k it was observed from fig 3 b that the cr vi adsorption capacity of ac ecs was found to be 39 mg g 1 79 at 298 k which significantly declined p 0 01 to 34 mg g 1 68 at 308 k revealing an exothermic adsorption nature in the t1 temperature range fig 3 b this might have been due to the less kinetic energy of the chromate anions at low temperature which results in less interaction between anions and active sites of the ac ecs adsorbent thus decreased cr vi removal however at t2 313 323 k adsorption of cr vi increased significantly p 0 01 from 34 mg g 1 68 to 41 mg g 1 81 which reflected an endothermic nature of the adsorption reactions this was because that high temperature resulted in the creation of new active sites on the ac ecs surface and also increased the rate of pore diffusion of the adsorbent the thermodynamic parameters including gibbs free energy δg kj mol 1 enthalpy δh kj mol 1 and entropy δs kj mol 1 showed the energy and spontaneity of the adsorption process kd is the distribution coefficient and was calculated using eq s1 δh and δs were determined from the van t hoff plot lnkd versus 1 t using eq s2 δg kj mol 1 was determined by using the gibbs helmholtz equation using eq s3 at t1 298 308 k values of δh and δg were found to be negative table 1 revealing the exothermic as well as the spontaneous existence of the cr vi adsorption less randomness δs 0 was observed at the interface of the solid solution during the adsorption of cr vi on the surface of the studied adsorbent data also reflected that the reaction was favorable for the enthalpy but unfavorable for the entropy change in our study the value of enthalpy was less than zero δh 0 putting credence on our arguments that the reaction was exothermic and supportive for enthalpy but not favorable for entropy because of the negative value of entropy δs 0 this revealed that cr vi adsorption was not controlled by the entropy of the system and the surface active sites of the ac ecs remained stable at t2 313 323 k values of both enthalpy δh and entropy δs were positive indicating respectively the endothermic nature and increased randomness at the solid solution interface during cr vi adsorption both enthalpy δh 0 and entropy δs 0 values showed that the reaction was unfavorable for enthalpy but favorable for entropy in this temperature range on the other hand gibbs free energy δg 0 showed the spontaneous adsorption of cr vi on the surface of ac ecs 3 5 3 ph and point zero charge solution ph plays a key role in the cr vi adsorption by influencing the chemistry or speciation of the metals in a solution 46 dissociation degree of functional groups on the adsorbents surface and the overall surface charge of the adsorbent effect of ph on adsorption was examined over a ph range of 2 0 7 0 as shown in fig 4 a maximum adsorption capacity 44 mg g 1 and percentage removal 87 was observed at ph 3 0 while adsorption capacity as well as percentage removal decreased significantly p 0 01 at higher ph and minimum value of 21 mg g 1 42 was observed at ph 7 0 cr vi occurs in various forms over a spectrum of ph it exists in the form of h2cro4 at ph 1 0 but with the rise in ph value its concentration rapidly decreased significantly p 0 01 whereas over a ph range of 2 0 6 0 chromium exists in the form of specific ions for instance cr2o7 hcro4 and cr3o10 2 among these ions hcro4 is the dominant one in the ph range of 2 0 3 0 as the ionic size of hcro4 is 44 0 cm3 mol 1 which is smaller compared to cr2o7 73 0 cm3 mol 1 so hcro4 becomes easily adsorbed on the active sites of the adsorbent results in fig 4 a showed that maximum adsorption 87 of cr vi occurred at ph 3 0 fig 4 a this can be attributed to the fact that at ph value of 3 0 adsorbent surface acquired more positive charges which attracted the hcro4 ions the dominant form of cr vi at ph 3 0 cr vi reduction to cr iii occurs after adsorption of hcro4 onto the adsorbent surface 67 point zero charge of ac ecs was noted as 6 8 fig 4 b which also resulted in further positive charges on the ac ecs surface at ph less than 6 8 causing more percent removal of cr vi maximum adsorption of cr vi was also observed at ph 3 0 by many researchers 68 maximum cr vi removal from electroplating wastewater at ph 3 0 was also noticed using activated corncob 66 at ph 2 0 low cr vi adsorption was observed as opposed to ph 3 0 because of the repulsion generated by a large number of hydrogen ions 66 the reduction in the net positive surface potential results in the decreased electrostatic forces of attraction between cr vi ionic species and the ac ecs which resulted in less adsorption at higher ph cr vi usually exists in the form of cr2o7 and hcro4 ions which decreased adsorption possibly due to a competition between oh and cr2o7 or hcro4 ions 46 the charge of the adsorbent plays a critical role in the adsorption process the phpzc point zero charge is defined as the ph value at which the net surface charge of the adsorbent is neutral or zero phpzc of ac ecs was determined as 6 8 from the plot as shown in fig 4 b which showed that ac ecs acquired positive charge below the point zero charge value of 6 8 and resulted in more removal of cr vi anions whereas at ph phpzc ac ecs acquired negative charge and resulted in less removal of the cr vi ions 3 5 4 initial concentration the initial concentration of metal plays a key role in the adsorption capacity of the adsorbent the data revealed significantly high adsorption capacity p 0 01 from 7 6 mg g 1 to 104 mg g 1 with the increase in the cr vi concentration from 10 mg l 1 to 300 mg l 1 respectively fig 5 a equilibrium condition was then observed as adsorbent surface reached saturation and there was no further increase in the adsorption capacity even when the cr vi concentration was increased to 350 mg l 1 accordingly the available adsorption sites are limited to adsorb the increasing solution concentration of cr vi which reduces the percentage of metal removal 39 the high initial concentration of cr vi resulted in the large gradient forces that overcame the resistance to cr vi ions transport between the liquid and solid phases resulting in increased uptake of cr vi 66 similar trends in cr vi adsorption have also been reported by the use of activated carbon produced from apple peel 69 however removal percentage of cr vi significantly p 0 01 decreased from 76 3 to 29 64 with an increase in cr vi concentration from 10 mg l 1 to 300 mg l 1 at lower concentrations almost all cr vi metal ions will interact with the available adsorbent sites resulting in a maximum percentage removal 3 5 5 particle size the particle size of the adsorbent is an important parameter for the adsorption process the effect of variable particle sizes 420 to 105 microns on the cr vi adsorption capacity of the ac ecs was studied keeping all other parameters constant fig 5 b this observation depicts that the adsorption capacity increased significantly p 0 01 with a reduction in particle size from 420 microns 35 36 mg g 1 70 72 to 105 microns 39 49 mg g 1 78 99 this was due to an increased surface area at reduced particle size which increased the cr vi adsorption at the initial stage 46 as a result the adsorption capacity of cr vi increased due to accessibility to adsorption sites as the active sites of the adsorbent were more exposed to the adsorbate with the decrease in particle size modified orange peel and corn cob also showed similar results for the smallest particle size 34 bet analysis also confirmed the large surface area 217 1397 m2 g 1 and mesoporous 63 36 å nature of the adsorbent that enhanced the adsorption of cr vi by ac ecs the particle size of 2 3 40 microns less than 40 microns ratio was used for further experimentation in this study 3 6 isotherms adsorption isotherm models use mathematical equations to examine the equilibrium data and to design and optimize an operating system for extensive applications they also provide a link between the metal ions that are adsorbed on the adsorbent surface and those present in the solution at equilibrium condition 70 evaluation of the adsorption process in a unit system can be done by isotherm models which provide information about the adsorption capacity as well as the mechanism and favorability of the adsorption langmuir and freundlich isotherm models showing the non linear relationship between adsorbed metal ions on the adsorbent surface and metal ions in the solution are the most commonly used models as these two parameter models are simplest they describe experimental activities well over a wide range of operating conditions in addition to the langmuir and freundlich isotherms various other models such as halsey temkin d r and harkin jura were also used in this study 3 6 1 langmuir isotherm this isotherm assumes the monolayer adsorption of the adsorbate and homogeneous surface of the adsorbent where all adsorption sites of the adsorbent surface have the same energy the linear equation for langmuir isotherm is given in supplementary information as eq s4 rl is the separation factor dimensionless constant that shows the favorable nature of the adsorption and is generally expressed as eq s5 adsorption of cr vi can be favorable 0 rl 1 unfavorable rl 1 linear rl 1 and irreversible rl 0 in the current study the value of rl ranged from 0 to 1 an indication of the favorable adsorption of cr vi on the adsorbent surface the obtained experimental maximum adsorption capacity of the ac ecs 104 mg g 1 is comparable with the already reported h3po4 activated biomasses as shown in table 3 the maximum adsorption capacity of the ac ecs over the reported adsorbents revealed its usefulness and suitability for the cr vi removal langmuir isotherm reflected the excellent fit r2 0 999 to the equilibrium data fig 6 a coefficient of determination for langmuir r2 0 999 showed that this model was best fitted to the cr vi adsorption data among all other studied isotherm freundlich halsey temkin dubinin radushkevich and harkin jura models suggesting the monolayer adsorption of cr vi on the ac ecs surface as reported by other researchers 78 79 the value of rl marked the ac ecs as an appropriate adsorbent for cr vi adsorption 3 6 2 freundlich isotherm this model shows the multilayer adsorption and the heterogeneous surface of the adsorbent 80 it also assumes that the adsorption of pollutants on the surface of adsorbent increases directly with the adsorbate concentration in the aqueous media the empirical equation for this model is given as eq s6 generally the adsorption capacity of the adsorbent increased with an increase in the value of kf adsorption capacity the value of 1 n adsorption intensity varied from 0 to 1 in our study table 2 reflecting the favorable adsorption of cr vi on the surface of the adsorbent experimental data also reflected a better fit for the freundlich model r2 0 988 but poor than langmuir isotherm fig 6 b 3 6 3 halsey isotherm halsey isotherm model 81 explains the multilayer adsorption at a relatively large distance from the surface like freundlich isotherm this model also shows that adsorbent is heterogeneous when the experimental data best fitted into its equation the non linear and linear forms equations for this model are given as eq s7 and eq s8 kh halsey isotherm constant and nh halsey exponent are obtained from the slope and intercept of the plot ince versus inqe table 2 this model fitted in the same way to cr vi adsorption data r2 0 988 fig 7 a as the freundlich model which means that the multilayer adsorption of the cr vi occurs at a short to the large distance from the heterogeneous surface of the ac ecs 3 6 4 temkin isotherm according to this model the decline in the adsorption heat is linear and the adsorption is done by the supply of binding energies 82 the general equation for the temkin model is given as eq s9 where r is the universal gas constant 8 314 j mol 1 k 1 and t is the temperature b is the heat of sorption j mol 1 which can be determined using eq s10 bt and at are the temkin isotherm constant and temkin isotherm equilibrium constant l mg 1 respectively and are given in table 2 and were calculated by plotting qe versus ince temkin model r2 0 985 as shown in fig 7 b was well fitted to the cr vi adsorption data as compared to dubinin radushkevich r2 0 948 and harkin jura r2 0 947 but it was less fitted than langmuir freundlich and halsey isotherm models 3 6 5 dubinin radushkevich d r isotherm dubinin radushkevich d r 83 is a semi empirical isotherm model which assumes that the process of adsorption in the microporous material is based on the polanyi potential adsorption theory 84 generally it is written as eq s11 qdr as shown in table 2 represents the theoretical monolayer adsorption capacity mol g 1 and β indicates the constant of sorption energy mol2 j 2 and ε is the polanyi potential and is given as eq s12 the mean or apparent free energy of the adsorption is represented by e and is obtained using the formula given in eq s13 the d r model is generally applied to determine the mean free energy of the adsorption e it is useful to distinguish the nature of adsorption either physical physisorption or chemical chemisorption if e was smaller than 8 kj mol 1 then adsorption was physical but if the e value ranges between 8 and 16 kj mol 1 the adsorption would be chemical in nature 65 although experimental data showed poor fit to the d r isotherm with r2 0 948 as shown in fig 7 c but the value of e was 15 81 kj mol 1 table 2 indicating the chemisorption of cr vi on the surface of ac ecs adsorbent this was also in line with the assumptions made by langmuir isotherm models the chemisorption nature of ac ecs was also confirmed through kinetics and regeneration results of the ac ecs as shown in figs 8 and 10 3 6 6 harkin jura isotherm this model assumes adsorption as a multilayer and can be described with the existence of heterogeneous pore distribution it is generally expressed as explained in eq s14 b and a which are harkin jura isotherm constants table 2 and were obtained from the slope and intercept of the plot 1 qe2 versus log ce the coefficient of determination value r2 0 947 reflected the worst fitting of the harkin jura isotherm to the cr vi adsorption data among the studied isotherms as shown in fig 7 d 3 7 adsorption kinetics prediction of the solute uptake rate is important for the construction of a wastewater treatment plant as it identifies the residence time of the adsorbate at the solid liquid interface the pseudo second order equation is used to determine the characteristic constants of the adsorption rate which help to investigate the mechanism involved in the adsorption of pollutants adsorption mechanism depends on the physical and chemical characteristics of the adsorbents 38 the pseudo second order model was applied to study the kinetics and uptake rate of cr vi on the adsorbent surface 70 this model involves all steps of adsorption such as internal particle diffusion external film diffusion and adsorption 85 from the application point of view it is important to determine the cr vi uptake rate from the solution by ac ecs adsorbent the rapid uptake of the pollutant is best for the practical application as it requires a short time to reach the equilibrium 3 7 1 pseudo second order kinetic model the pseudo second order model of kinetics assumes that chemisorption is the rate limiting step in the adsorption and involves sharing or bonding of electrons between adsorbate and the adsorbent surface the general equation for this model can be written as eq s15 where qt mg g 1 is the amount of adsorbate adsorbed i e cr vi at time t min and k2 is the pseudo second order rate constant expressed in g mg 1 min 1 however h represents mg g 1 h 1 the initial adsorption rate and is generally given by the eq s16 therefore eq s16 can be written as eq s17 values of h qe and k2 are given in table 4 and were obtained from the slope and intercept of the plot between t qt and t fig 8 showed that our results fitted well into the pseudo second order kinetics reflecting the chemisorption nature of cr vi adsorption on the ac ecs surface best fitted pseudo second order kinetics confirmed a strong bond between cr vi and the ac ecs surface standing at par with previous researches 86 qe exp values were observed in close agreement with that of qe cal at all initial cr vi concentrations i e 30 mg l 1 50 mg l 1 and 90 mg l 1 the value of h increased table 4 as the concentration of cr vi increases from 30 90 mg l 1 and the reason behind this is the increase in the driving force at the liquid solid phase at high cr vi concentration however reverse behavior was observed in case of k2 3 8 fixed bed column reactor study adsorbent dose or bed height plays a substantial role in the adsorbate update 87 in column adsorption studies bed height can influence the breakthrough curve as the treatment of cr vi may depend upon the amount of ac ecs packed in the column and consequently the height of column bed in order to study the effect of bed height three columns were filled with ac ecs adsorbent doses of 12 5 g 25 g and 36 5 g resulting in the respective bed heights of 5 cm 10 cm and 15 cm the influent cr vi value of 50 mg l 1 and rate of flow were maintained at 10 ml min 1 while the influent ph was kept constant at 3 0 fig 9 showed an increase in breakthrough time with the rising bed heights breakthrough time 50 increased from 5595 12270 min 93 25 h 204 5 h for ac ecs packed columns fig 9 with an increase in bed height from 5 to 15 cm respectively the volumes of the treated cr vi solution at 50 breakthrough point for ac ecs at 5 cm 10 cm and 15 cm were 55 95 l 80 l and 122 7 l respectively similarly exhaust times c0 ct 1 for ac ecs packed columns also increased from 12 000 to 36 000 min 200 600 h with the increase in bed height from 5 cm to 15 cm with the increase in bed height amount of adsorbent the surface area of the adsorbent and the availability of the active sites for cr vi binding also increased which increases the column s breakthrough time and exhaust time 88 with the increase in bed height a large amount of adsorbent was available for the solute to travel before exiting the column and thus required a longer time to fully saturate the ac ecs with cr vi 52 for ac ecs packed columns the exhaust volumes for bed heights of 5 10 and 15 cm were 1227 l 243 6 l and 363 3 l respectively in addition the breakthrough curve of 5 cm bed height was steeper as compared to 10 and 15 cm column bed heights respectively this is due to the predominance of axial dispersion of mass transfer phenomenon at lower bed height which reduced the diffusion of chromate ions effectively available active sites for the binding of cr vi were also less so that column exhaust time reached earlier and the saturation rate was also faster whereas at higher bed height the mass transfer zone is widened time of contact between cr vi ions and the adsorbent increases and the number of available active positions for the cr vi uptake also increased 52 which caused the longer extended exhaustion and breakthrough times and therefore adsorption of cr vi increased this indicated that a smaller column bed was saturated with cr vi ions faster than the longer bed the highest breakthrough and exhaust times at all studied bed heights in the case of ac ecs proved that activation increased the available active positions of the adsorbent 3 8 1 bed depth service time bdst model it is a simple model used to find the relationship between bed depth z and service time t according to the bdst model the adsorbate adsorption occurs directly on the surface of the adsorbent while intraparticle diffusion and external mass transfer resistance become negligible 89 the bdst model can be written as eq s18 both n0 and ka rate constant measured in l mg 1 min 1 can be acquired from the slope and intercept of the plot between t vs z at 50 breakthrough t t0 5 eq s18 can be represented as eq s19 s20 s21 and s22 the values of the bdst constants play an important role in extending the process with different initial metal concentrations and flow rates without any additional experiments the r2 regression coefficient values i e 0 973 0 998 and 0 91 disclosed that the column data was well fitted in the bdst model table 5 showed that with the increase in breakthrough from 20 0 2 to 60 0 6 slope a and adsorption capacity n0 values also increased from 446 to 986 and 11 353 mg l 1 to 25 098 mg l 1 respectively in lower breakthrough the adsorbent was unsaturated as most of the adsorbents active sites were not occupied by the cr vi 41 if the value of ka is large then even a small bed will avoid the breakthrough but with the decreases in ka value a larger column bed is needed to avoid breakthrough the bdst model values in table 5 revealed that at 20 0 2 breakthrough the value of the slope a indicated that 4 46 min was needed to exhaust 1 cm of the ac ecs column bed height with the increase in breakthrough from 40 to 60 the column exhaust time for 1 cm also increased from 5 70 to 9 86 min ac ecs column data revealed that for full scale column design operation the ac ecs bed height of 15 cm cr vi solution concentration of 50 mg l 1 ph of 3 0 and flow rate of 10 ml min 1 should be used by column operator the exhaust time for the ac ecs packed column was 36 000 min 600 h and the treated volume of cr vi solution was found to be 363 3 l under the above mentioned conditions 3 9 regeneration of adsorbent and adsorbate recovery the desorption study describes the physical reversible or chemical irreversible nature of the cr vi adsorption from the surface of ac ecs cr vi had very little 0 17 desorption i e 0 066 mg l 1 recovery by the deionized water which confirmed the chemisorption nature of the ac ecs fig 10 regeneration result of ac ecs in particular with deionized water also indicates the stability of the ac ecs mean that cr vi can not enter or mix into the water once it is adsorbed by ac ecs the desorbed cr vi concentration of 0 066 mg l 1 is less than the permissible limits of 0 1 mg l 1 0 05 mg l 1 and 0 25 mg l 1 of cr vi as set by epa guidelines for inland surface waters drinking water and industrial effluent respectively 22 however little desorption or recovery was observed fig 10 in the case of 0 1 m solution of different reagents i e acids and bases potassium hydroxide kh showed maximum percent desorption 15 and recovery 6 mg l 1 of cr vi from ac ecs highlighting that the adsorption was chemisorption chemical in nature and irreversible results in fig 10 indicated the highest recovery 6 mg l 1 of cr vi from the exhausted ac ecs using potassium hydroxide kh however the lowest recovery of cr vi was observed with deionized water 0 066 mg l 1 and acetone 0 015 mg l 1 chemisorption reveals a strong chemical bond between cr vi and the ac ecs surface making it difficult to regenerate recover and reuse as observed by other researches 41 4 conclusions this study reported the successful development of the activated carbon from eucalyptus camaldulensis sawdust using method v for cr vi 80 ac ecs removal the bet surface area of the ac ecs was found to be 217 14 m2 g 1 ac ecs was further explored for the adsorption of cr vi in both batch and column modes maximum adsorption efficiency 87 was observed at ph 3 0 adsorption data were described by both langmuir isotherm and pseudo second order kinetics column study reflected that different bed heights play a critical role in the column performance the bdst model was best fitted to the column adsorption data it was concluded that ac ecs can be prepared from the locally available waste precursor i e eucalyptus camaldulensis and can be used as an alternative to the expensive commercial activated carbon for the removal cr vi from aqueous solution however it is recommended to explore the interference of other metals and salts with cr vi through

13800,the main aim of this work was the development of the chemical activated carbon ac method from specific wood biomass i e eucalyptus camaldulensis sawdust ecs and this ac is proposed as a promising alternative treatment for hazardous cr vi from aqueous solution ecs waste sawdust was carbonized in two stages i e 170 c for 60 min followed by 500 c for 120 min under the continuous steam of nitrogen gas and rated as an efficient method with h3po4 activation 80 cr vi removal finally activated carbon eucalyptus camaldulensis sawdust ac ecs was selected for batch and column reactor studies and different influencing parameters such as contact time ph temperature initial cr vi metal concentration particle size and bed height were optimized ac ecs was characterized through analysis by sem edx ftir and bet cr vi adsorption was found to be highly ph dependent i e 87 at ph 3 0 ac ecs adsorption mechanism for cr vi with experimental and maximum predicted adsorption capacities of 104 and 125 mg g 1 respectively was best described by the langmuir isotherm r2 0 999 and pseudo second order kinetics r2 0 999 the column study showed an improvement in the breakthrough curve time from 5595 to 12 270 min with the respective increase of bed height from 5 to 15 cm respectively column breakthrough data was found to be well fitted to the bed depth service time model current batch and column studies indicate that freshwater contamination with cr vi can be managed by upscaling the ac ecs as an efficient treatment solution keywords specific plant precursors eucalyptus camaldulensis sawdust mesoporous activated carbon batch and column adsorption equilibrium kinetics breakthrough curve 1 introduction increasing industrialization urbanization and agricultural activities result in the production of various obnoxious environmental pollutants including heavy metal ions at exceeding threshold levels 1 which adversely affect both the environment and the health of living organisms 2 heavy metal ions are found to be toxic non biodegradable carcinogenic persistent and possess bioaccumulation capability 3 hence they are responsible for health related issues in humans such as brain damage renal and neurological failure 4 lead mercury cadmium chromium and arsenic are well reported highly toxic metallic ions 5 6 among various heavy metal ions chromium is commonly used and it can enter into various components of the environment like soil air and natural waters through effluent discharge from different well known industries such as tanneries alloys electroplating paint and pigments metal processing textiles dyeing steel manufacturing and canning 7 environmental pollution caused by cr vi is gaining attention globally because of its high content in the soil and water chromium is reported above the allowable concentrations in soil and groundwater in various parts of different countries e g india china and pakistan 8 10 pakistan has a large number of registered and unregistered tanneries along with the footwear manufacturing units that release chromium rich effluents in sahiwal a central district in the punjab province of pakistan chromium pollution in drinking water has been reported to be as high as 5 50 mg l 1 11 the toxicity of chromium in a solution depends on its oxidizing state in natural waters chromium is usually found in two major oxidation states i e cr iii and cr vi with each type having different physicochemical properties toxicity level and bioavailability cr vi has been reported to be more toxic as compared to cr iii 12 although trace amounts of cr iii are essential for the metabolism of protein fat and carbohydrates 13 but large amounts of cr iii become toxic 14 cr iii possesses very low solubility as well as mobility and is sorbed by the soil that prevents it from leaching into the groundwater along with its absorption by the plants in acidic medium cr vi is most likely present as hydrogen chromate hcro4 and dichromate cr2o7 2 anions while in basic media it exists as chromate anions cro4 2 13 all of these cr vi ions have high solubility and strong oxidation rendering them very active in various environmental niches including soil and water 15 high solubility and mobility of the cr vi in aqueous medium serving as gateways to enter into the living biota causing various neurological and physiological disorders such as anemia nausea diarrhea epigastric discomfort internal hemorrhaging circulatory shutdown liver or stomach damage ulcers vomiting lung cancer kidney cancer eye and skin irritation 13 the toxicity mutagenicity and cytotoxicity caused by cr vi have been reported to be 1000 times higher than those caused by cr iii 16 because of its elevated toxic level united states environment protection agency us epa has classified cr vi in to group a inhalation carcinogen while international agency for research on cancer has placed it in group i of human carcinogen 7 cr vi is the third most common hazardous pollutant present at the waste disposal sites and is among the eight most harmful chemicals to the human body 17 the toxicity of cr vi was correlated with its oxidizing power as it strongly oxidizes biomolecules such as protein and dna 18 because of its high mutagenic characteristics it may also affect reproductive health harm dna and can trigger various birth defects 18 a groundwater study for cr in the catchment of luan river in china showed an average hazard value of 2 074 for residents in the nearby area which is 2 074 times greater than the permissible value of 1 overall the average carcinogenic risk value for cr was 3 99 10 5 19 in another study cr vi was reported to be 0 027 2 48 mg l 1 in the surface water and 1 35 mg l 1 in the groundwater in the sukinda area of odisha state of india the cancer risk caused by the cr vi in adults and children of sukinda was 1 21 10 3 and 1 05 10 3 respectively while oral hazard index was 1 90 and 1 64 times higher in the same age groups 20 literature also reported the highest probability of cancer risks i e 6 54 10 3 from the chromium in drinking water to the residents of khorramabad iran 21 cr vi also affects the physiology of plants biochemical cycle resulting in necrosis slow growth and chlorosis in several countries as set out in the epa guidelines acceptable limits of cr vi for inland surface water drinking water and industrial effluent are 0 1 mg l 1 0 05 mg l 1 and 0 25 mg l 1 respectively 22 therefore it becomes imperative to keep the concentration of cr vi in the industrial effluents within permissible levels before drainage into the freshwater reservoirs different techniques such as chemical precipitation reduction ion exchange solvent extractions electrochemical precipitation membrane separation evaporation and reverse osmosis have been documented for the removal of cr vi these methods are not environmentally friendly due to the resulting sludge which poses disposal hazards and pollution risks to the environment adsorption has emerged as a highly effective technique for the removal of heavy metal ions and being low cost and easy designing and operation is prioritized over the other methods 23 in adsorption processes activated carbon is the most widely used traditional adsorbent and is efficient in extracting various contaminants from wastewater 24 agricultural waste containing lignin and celluloses materials could be a potential alternative and low cost source for the production of activated carbon 25 because of its abundance economic viability and regenerability these wastes also exhibit good properties such as a low amount of inorganic material as the presence of inorganic materials in the precursor material affecting the adsorption capacity of the resulting activated adsorbents in addition high volatile contents i e above 50 help to establish basic pore structure throughout the carbonization process 26 preparation of activated carbon from organic materials involves two steps first the carbonization of raw material under the inert atmosphere which not only increases the yield of carbon contents but also helps to create the initial porosity of the material in the second step the pre carbonized material is activated by either of the physical or chemical methods to increase the overall porosity in the case of physical activation the carbonization of the precursor is performed in an inert atmosphere nitrogen gas followed by the activation using oxidizing agents steam or carbon dioxide co2 the precursor material is first impregnated with various chemicals such as h3po4 zncl2 alcl3 naoh or koh during chemical activation followed by carbonization in the presence of an inert atmosphere 27 h3po4 is widely used as impregnating agent because of low cost and environment friendly nature 28 chemical activation is preferred over physical activation because it requires lower carbonization temperature and less activation time chemical activation also contributes to the formation of a mesoporous adsorbent with a large surface area 29 adsorption capacity is one of the important features of the activated carbon and depends on the in built nature of the precursor material along with its method of preparation 25 it is determined by various conditions of activation such as time of activation activating chemical and temperature activating chemicals have an enormous impact on both the surface properties and porosity of the resulting activated carbon it is the need of the hour to identify local adsorbents with judicious costs and high adsorption potential for cr vi different activated biomasses have shown promising potential for treatment of cr vi in batch and column studies i e peach stone 99 58 30 leucaena leucocephala seed pod 81 31 groundnut hull 96 32 sargassum myriocystum 53 57 33 corn cob 39 8 and orange peel 30 6 34 fungal biomasses for instance penicillium griseofulvum msr1 35 aspergillus niger msr4 36 ceratocystis paradoxa msr2 37 graphene oxide chitosan ferrite nanocomposite 38 and novel nanocomposite 39 adsorbents have also been used for the wastewater treatment cr vi adsorption mechanism on activated carbon has been studied by various researchers and revealed that one amongst possible mechanisms including physical adsorption electrostatic attraction ion exchange chemical adsorption adsorption coupled reduction and reduction to cr iii are involved in the cr vi adsorption on the surface of adsorbent 40 nevertheless increasing efforts are being underway to search for more abundant available lignocellulosic wastes as a potential precursor for activated carbon ac preparation and its successful application for the hazardous cr vi adsorptions in both batch and column modes adsorption can be achieved by experiments in batch and fixed bed column reactors 41 however fixed bed column adsorption is preferred over batch mode as the data obtained from the column studies are useful for the treatment of industrial effluent 42 43 comprehensive insights into the column adsorption output are being provided by the breakthrough time and curve as per existing knowledge eucalyptus camaldulensis sawdust waste has not been investigated in activated forms in both batch and column modes simultaneously it is an evergreen abundant and rapidly grown tree in pakistan and its sawdust is produced from the wood industry as waste 41 therefore the current study was aimed at refining the chemically activated carbon ac preparation methods using the sawdust waste from eucalyptus camaldulensis the effective ac preparation was then employed for different lignocellulosic waste biosorbents and the most efficient precursor was selected besides adsorption experiments on batch and column reactors were carried out the adsorption mechanisms and spontaneity of the adsorption process were explored through various isotherms kinetics and thermodynamic studies adsorbent regeneration and metal recovery experiments were also performed in the analysis of the fixed bed column the breakthrough curve for cr vi adsorption was also explored through the bed depth service time bdst model 2 materials and methods 2 1 lignocellulosic wastes collection and initial treatment four abundantly available biomasses eucalyptus camaldulensis sawdust nicotiana tabacum tobacco stems eucalyptus camaldulensis bark and melia azedarach white cedar sawdust were collected from the khyber pakhtunkhwa province of pakistan the collected biomasses were washed using deionized water to remove all the adhesive dust particles and dried at room temperature for 24 h the biomasses were then placed in an oven at 60 c for 12 h and the complete dryness was ensured untill constant weight was obtained after drying all adsorbents were ground using an electrical grinder jm disk mill model ffc 15 and then separated into different particle sizes 420 250 177 149 125 and 105 μm using a set of variable sieves of 40 60 80 100 120 and 140 mesh sizes 2 2 development of various methods of ac preparation for an efficient cr vi adsorption five different methods given below were developed and the optimum ac preparation conditions were optimized based on cr vi adsorption efficiency 80 cr vi at the lab scale eucalyptus camaldulensis sawdust was taken as a precursor lignocellulosic waste 2 2 1 method i eucalyptus camaldulensis sawdust was first impregnated in 1 m solution of different chemicals i e phosphoric acid hydrochloric acid nitric acid acetic acid and sulphuric acid in the ratio of 1 7 biomass acid g ml the mixture was then immediately boiled at 80 c for 30 min with heating mantle afterward the precursor material was washed with deionized water until neutral ph was recorded and then dried at 60 c for 900 min lastly the dried material was carbonized in a muffle furnace at 300 c for 180 min in the presence of a nitrogen stream the inert atmosphere was maintained with continuous nitrogen supply until carbonized material had cooled down to 80 c 2 2 2 method ii the procedure of ac preparation under this method was the same as explained in the method i except that after impregnation of biomass with the reagents the mixture was tightly covered and left overnight to ensure the complete absorption of acids in the precursor biomass after that the mixture was boiled at 80 c for 30 min the precursor material was washed with deionized water until neutral ph and then dried at 60 c for 900 min 2 2 3 method iii in method iii some of the adsorbent prepared from method ii was carbonized in a muffle furnace at 300 c for 180 min in the presence of nitrogen gas in order to prevent the burning of adsorbent biomass nitrogen gas flow and pressure were maintained at 180 ml min 1 and 100 psi respectively 2 2 4 method iv instead of eucalyptus camaldulensis sawdust eucalyptus camaldulensis wood was carbonized in the presence of nitrogen at 500 c for 30 min the inert atmosphere was maintained with continuous nitrogen supply until carbonized material cooled down to 80 c after that the carbonized wood was ground sieved through 40 mm mesh size and impregnated with 1 m solution of reagents i e phosphoric acid hydrochloric acid nitric acid acetic acid and sulphuric acid using ratio of 1 7 biomass acid g ml and left overnight the precursor material was washed with deionized water until neutral ph was reached and then dried at 60 c for 900 min 2 2 5 method v the precursor lignocellulosic waste was impregnated in five reagents i e phosphoric acid hydrochloric acid nitric acid acetic acid and sulphuric acid in the ratio of 1 2 biomass acid g ml and left overnight carbonization was carried out in the presence of nitrogen gas in two stages initially at 170 c for 60 min and then at 500 c for 120 min the inert atmosphere was maintained with continuous nitrogen supply until carbonized material cooled down to 80 c precursor material was then washed with deionized water until neutral ph was reached followed by drying at 70 c for 720 min the particle size ratio of 2 3 40 microns less than 40 microns was maintained in the batch cr vi adsorption the cr vi adsorption efficiency of ac prepared using the above methods was evaluated in batch experiments as a function of initial adsorbate concentration 50 mg l 1 adsorbent dose 0 05 g ac l 1 ph 5 5

results and discussion 2 3 selection of an efficient lignocellulosic waste precursor for ac preparation in order to determine the specificity of method and the lignocellulosic waste precursor the same conditions of ac preparation as stated in method v along with h3po4 activation were applied to three other lignocellulosic wastes precursors i e nicotiana tabacum stem acnst eucalyptus camaldulensis bark aceb and melia azedarach sawdust acms ac prepared from these waste biomasses were also examined for cr vi adsorption efficiency and the batch conditions were kept the same as stated above finally the ac ecs showed an efficient cr vi removal potential among the waste precursors tested and was selected for further batch experiments see fig 1 b 2 4 solution preparation stock solution 1000 mg l 1 of potassium dichromate k2cr2o7 was prepared by dissolving 2 83 g of analytical grade potassium dichromate in 1000 ml deionized water however the required concentration of solutions was further prepared by diluting the stock solution with deionized water the ph of the solution was maintained by using 0 1 m hcl of naoh solutions already prepared for this purpose 2 5 batch experimentation of ac ecs for cr vi adsorption adsorption capacity and behavior of the selected ac ecs during cr vi adsorption were determined in the batch experiments in this experiment 50 ml of cr vi solution with a concentration of 50 mg l 1 was taken in a 100 ml flask the adsorbent dose of 0 05 g was added to the flask containing cr vi solution with an original ph of 5 5 and was shaken at 220 rpm in a temperature controlled 30 c orbital incubator wise cube korea samples were filtered using a cellulose nitrate filter paper of 0 45 μm size atomic absorption spectrophotometer perkin elmer aanalyst 700 was used for the analysis of the residual concentration of cr vi in the filtrate the effect of various process variables i e contact time 20 840 min particle size 105 420 μm initial cr vi concentration 10 150 mg l 1 temperature 25 50 c and ph 2 0 7 0 on the cr vi adsorption by ac ecs were also examined at pre determined time intervals the samples were taken out of the shaking incubator to get the equilibrium time while all other parameters were optimized at the equilibrium time each experiment was performed in triplicate to ensure the accuracy of results adsorption capacity at any time t of contact was determined by the general formula 1 q c 0 c f v m q is the cr vi adsorption capacity mg g 1 and co and cf indicate the initial and the final concentrations of cr vi mg l 1 respectively v represents the volume of the cr vi solution used while m is the mass of the adsorbent the removal percentage of cr vi was determined using the eq 2 2 r e m o v a l c 0 c f c 0 100 2 6 equilibrium kinetics and thermodynamic studies various isotherm models such as langmuir freundlich halsey temkin d r and harkin jura were applied to the equilibrium data obtained at variable initial concentrations of cr vi and the phenomenon behind cr vi adsorption on the ac ecs was investigated a kinetic study was also carried out to find the mechanism and cr vi adsorption rate the thermodynamic study was conducted to calculate the enthalpy of the system spontaneity of the adsorption reaction and randomness at the solid solution interface 2 7 column experimentation glass tube with a height of 50 cm and an internal diameter of 2 5 cm was filled with ac ecs up to the desired height of the bed and then used for column experiments for better adsorbent packing and to prevent any adsorbent loss both ends of the glass tube were covered with glass wool and glass beads layer column experiments were performed by adjusting the bed height 5 10 and 15 cm peristaltic pump with a flow rate of 10 ml min 1 was used for the downward movement of 50 mg l 1 cr vi solution through the column bed the solution of cr vi was kept at an optimal ph value of 3 0 as discussed in the batch experiment the effluent from the column was collected and tested for residual cr vi concentration at predefined time intervals effluent volume i e vef ml can be measured using eq 3 3 v ef q t total where q indicates the flow rate of the cr vi solution which is measured in ml min 1 and ttotal indicates total flow time which is measured in min q0 5 is the 50 breakthrough capacity ct co 0 5 of cr vi mg g 1 adsorption and can be calculated using eq 4 4 q 0 5 breakthrough time at 50 flow rate inlet concentration mass of adsorbent in the bed g bdst model was used to analyze the column adsorption data 2 8 characterization various analytical tools were used to characterize the ac ecs before and after loading with cr vi the speciﬁc surface area was determined by brunauer emmett teller bet analysis tristar ii 3020 version 2 00 at 77 k in an n2 atmosphere pore volume was determined from the volume of the absorbed nitrogen at p p 0 99 and the pore size was calculated from 4 v a by bet the morphology of the adsorbent surface was determined using a secondary electron detector jsm 5910 with scanning electron microscope sem sem images were recorded at magnifications of x1000 and x2000 and a voltage of 20 kv energy dispersive x ray spectrometer edx oxford made uk model inca 200 was used to find the elemental composition and evidence of the cr vi adsorption ftir spectrum two analysis was carried out to identify the functional groups involved in cr vi adsorption ph drift method was used to assess the ph at the point of zero charges phpzc where a series of 0 01 m nacl solutions were prepared for various initial ph levels from 2 0 to 10 0 the ph was adjusted using 0 1 m solutions of hcl and naoh 0 05 g of ac ecs was then added to each 50 ml of nacl solution and afterward the samples were agitated at 220 rpm at 30 c for 24 h then final ph values were measured with the help of ph meter and the graph was plotted between initial phi and final phf values of the solutions phpzc is noted as a point where the curve between phi and phf intersects the line phi versus phf 2 9 desorption experiment in this experiment 0 05 g of ac ecs was first treated with cr vi solution under optimum time 540 min ph 3 0 and temperature 50 c conditions after filtration cr vi loaded ac ecs was dried in next step the dried cr vi loaded ac ecs adsorbent was agitated at 220 rpm for 180 min with 0 1 m solutions of various chemicals i e potassium hydroxide sulphuric acid n hexane nitric acid acetic acid ethanol phosphoric acid hydrochloric acid acetone citric acid methanol copper sulfate acetonitrile ethyl acetate ferrous sulfate sodium hydroxide and deionized water desorption study was carried out at a temperature of 35 c as the batch temperature study showed endothermic adsorption so the temperature was chosen for desorption where low cr vi adsorption was seen which may lead to further metal desorption percentage desorption of cr vi was calculated by the eq 5 5 c r v i d e s o r p t i o n a m o u n t o f c r v i d e s o r b e d a m o u n t o f c r v i a d s o r b e d 100 2 10 statistical analysis each triplicate experiment was performed maintaining identical conditions in order to obtain credible results adsorption data were analyzed by anova one way analysis of variance at a significance level of 0 01 using statistica software version 10 3 results and discussion 3 1 development and selection of activated carbon preparation method method v showed encouraging results for cr vi removal by 82 with phosphoric acid followed by hydrochloric acid 43 3 among the conditions tested for ac ecs preparation the method i exhibited maximum removal with nitric acid 35 82 acetic acid 32 28 and sulphuric acid 30 38 as shown in fig 1 a the average removal of sulphuric acid ac ecs prepared from method ii and method iv was 15 and 26 respectively whereas method iii showed poor performance after the acetic acid activation for the cr vi removal 17 efficient adsorption of cr vi by ac ecs following method v can be ascribed to the use of concentrated acids and two stage pyrolysis this can result in the production of high porosity high surface area and low ash content which enhanced the cr vi adsorption from aqueous solution fig 1 b indicated the efficacy and applicability of method v for ac preparation on three other waste precursors data showed the cr vi removal efficiency of acms acnst and aceb by 61 49 78 and 45 82 respectively nonetheless these activated waste precursors prepared by method v exhibited low adsorption efficiency for cr vi compared to ac ecs which showed efficient removal of cr vi 80 the best outcome of ac ecs may be attributed to the built in nature of the eucalyptus camaldulensis and the use of h3po4 literature reported the presence of cellulose hemicellulose lignin extractive and an ash content by 31 27 39 1 24 4 77 and 0 86 respectively in the aforesaid biomass 44 45 elemental composition and functional groups for precursor materials i e eucalyptus camaldulensis melia azedarach sawdust nicotiana tabacum stem and eucalyptus camaldulensis bark have also been reported in our already published work 41 46 in addition h3po4 was found to be a stronger activating reagent in contrast with hno3 hcl ch3cooh and h2so4 since during the activation phase it may serve as an acid catalyst and dehydrating agent to improve the hydrolysis bond cleavage condensation and cross linking reactions between phosphoric acid and biopolymers of the lignocellulosic material literature also shows that h3po4 may act as a template because the volume occupied within the activated biomass correlates with the volume micropore of the derived activated carbon 47 ac ecs was chosen further for further studies in batch and column reactor as well as process variable optimization 3 2 brunauer emmett teller bet analysis adsorption capacity is an important characteristic of the activated carbon and is proportional to the surface area bet surface area of the ac ecs was found to be 217 14 m2 g 1 higher than that reported for activated carbon produced from the leucaena leucocephala seedpod 31 ziziphus spina christi leaf 48 and palm kernel shell 49 i e 89 74 m2 g 1 69 43 m2 g 1 and 121 82 m2 g 1 respectively 50 pore volume of ac ecs was observed as 0 344 cm3 g 1 which is higher than ac derived from leucaena leucocephala seed pod 0 0232 cm3 g 1 31 coal tar pitch 0 285 cm3 g 1 51 and cashew nutshell 0 2209 cm3 g 1 52 adsorption properties are determined by the pore size of the activated adsorbent for instance micropores will not adsorb the adsorbate with large molecular size and macropores will not adsorb small molecular size adsorbates however mesopores promote diffusion as well as adsorption of larger adsorbates 53 according to iupac pore sizes are classified based on pore diameter i e micropores 20 å mesopores between 20 å and 500 å and macropores 500 å in the current study pore size 4 v a by bet of the ac ecs was found to be 63 36 å which is higher than activated leucaena leucocephala 3 59 å seedpod 31 it reveals the mesoporous nature of the ac ecs which could have promising application for liquid phase adsorption of any adsorbate tamarind seed activated with koh also have mesopores having a pore size of 67 98 å 54 large surface area and mesoporous nature of the ac ecs favors the efficient cr vi adsorption 82 and suggests the selection of ac preparation method and ecs as the waste biomass precursor 3 3 sem and edx analysis sem photographs of the ac ecs were taken with magnifications of x1 000 and x2 000 fig 2 a and b they showed the porous and rough surface of the ac ecs which could well facilitate the cr vi adsorption edx spectra for ac ecs displayed the presence of c 48 98 o 35 11 and p 15 91 by weight fig 2 c nevertheless in the case of chromium loaded adsorbent apart from c 53 72 o 28 87 and p 5 17 an extra peak at 0 5 kev confirmed the cr vi adsorption 55 on the ac ecs surface by 12 24 fig 2 d other characteristic peaks for cr vi were also observed at 5 and 6 kev also suggesting the adsorption of chromate anions 56 3 4 ftir analysis of ac ecs the ftir peak at 852 cm 1 is assigned to the aromatic cc stretching 57 the peak fig s1 a at 942 cm 1 refers to deformation outside the plane of oh band 58 nevertheless the peak appeared at 1086 cm 1 is characteristic of the stretching of co band 59 and symmetric po2 60 the presence of phosphorous was also confirmed through edx analysis another peak at 1193 cm 1 shows co of carboxyl functional group 61 while the peak at 1584 cm 1 indicates carboxylates and lactones 62 the peak at 1715 cm 1 is attributed to the stretching of co 63 but the peak at 3417 cm 1 depicts the stretching of oh bands 64 the shift in five peaks were observed fig s1 a and b from 852 cm 1 740 cm 1 942 cm 1 914 cm 1 1086 cm 1 1096 cm 1 1193 cm 1 1247 cm 1 and 1715 cm 1 1719 cm 1 which showed the involvement of cc oh co po2 and c o in cr vi adsorption 3 5 batch process variables 3 5 1 time cr vi adsorption was examined over a wide range of contact time from 20 840 min data revealed an increase in cr vi adsorption capacity over time as shown in fig 3 a while the maximum value 39 36 mg g 1 78 72 was observed at 540 min after that time there was no significant p 0 01 increase in the adsorption this can be ascribed to the availability of initially more vacant sites on the surface of ac ecs and macroporosity as shown in fig 2 a which can promote the rapid adsorption of cr vi furthermore the remaining vacant sites are less accessible to the cr vi ions with time lapse 65 because of the possible repulsion between already adsorbed ions and ions in the solution the equilibrium point is the time at which the adsorbent reaches the saturation state 66 and could not adsorb metals further so the increase in cr vi adsorption capacity was not observed after 540 min thus this point was marked as the equilibrium time and the batch experiments for the rest of the influencing parameters were performed until equilibrium time 3 5 2 temperature and thermodynamic temperature considerably affects the metal adsorption mechanism because it changes molecular interaction and solubility the effects of temperature on cr vi adsorption were studied at two temperature ranges i e t1 298 308 k and t2 313 323 k it was observed from fig 3 b that the cr vi adsorption capacity of ac ecs was found to be 39 mg g 1 79 at 298 k which significantly declined p 0 01 to 34 mg g 1 68 at 308 k revealing an exothermic adsorption nature in the t1 temperature range fig 3 b this might have been due to the less kinetic energy of the chromate anions at low temperature which results in less interaction between anions and active sites of the ac ecs adsorbent thus decreased cr vi removal however at t2 313 323 k adsorption of cr vi increased significantly p 0 01 from 34 mg g 1 68 to 41 mg g 1 81 which reflected an endothermic nature of the adsorption reactions this was because that high temperature resulted in the creation of new active sites on the ac ecs surface and also increased the rate of pore diffusion of the adsorbent the thermodynamic parameters including gibbs free energy δg kj mol 1 enthalpy δh kj mol 1 and entropy δs kj mol 1 showed the energy and spontaneity of the adsorption process kd is the distribution coefficient and was calculated using eq s1 δh and δs were determined from the van t hoff plot lnkd versus 1 t using eq s2 δg kj mol 1 was determined by using the gibbs helmholtz equation using eq s3 at t1 298 308 k values of δh and δg were found to be negative table 1 revealing the exothermic as well as the spontaneous existence of the cr vi adsorption less randomness δs 0 was observed at the interface of the solid solution during the adsorption of cr vi on the surface of the studied adsorbent data also reflected that the reaction was favorable for the enthalpy but unfavorable for the entropy change in our study the value of enthalpy was less than zero δh 0 putting credence on our arguments that the reaction was exothermic and supportive for enthalpy but not favorable for entropy because of the negative value of entropy δs 0 this revealed that cr vi adsorption was not controlled by the entropy of the system and the surface active sites of the ac ecs remained stable at t2 313 323 k values of both enthalpy δh and entropy δs were positive indicating respectively the endothermic nature and increased randomness at the solid solution interface during cr vi adsorption both enthalpy δh 0 and entropy δs 0 values showed that the reaction was unfavorable for enthalpy but favorable for entropy in this temperature range on the other hand gibbs free energy δg 0 showed the spontaneous adsorption of cr vi on the surface of ac ecs 3 5 3 ph and point zero charge solution ph plays a key role in the cr vi adsorption by influencing the chemistry or speciation of the metals in a solution 46 dissociation degree of functional groups on the adsorbents surface and the overall surface charge of the adsorbent effect of ph on adsorption was examined over a ph range of 2 0 7 0 as shown in fig 4 a maximum adsorption capacity 44 mg g 1 and percentage removal 87 was observed at ph 3 0 while adsorption capacity as well as percentage removal decreased significantly p 0 01 at higher ph and minimum value of 21 mg g 1 42 was observed at ph 7 0 cr vi occurs in various forms over a spectrum of ph it exists in the form of h2cro4 at ph 1 0 but with the rise in ph value its concentration rapidly decreased significantly p 0 01 whereas over a ph range of 2 0 6 0 chromium exists in the form of specific ions for instance cr2o7 hcro4 and cr3o10 2 among these ions hcro4 is the dominant one in the ph range of 2 0 3 0 as the ionic size of hcro4 is 44 0 cm3 mol 1 which is smaller compared to cr2o7 73 0 cm3 mol 1 so hcro4 becomes easily adsorbed on the active sites of the adsorbent results in fig 4 a showed that maximum adsorption 87 of cr vi occurred at ph 3 0 fig 4 a this can be attributed to the fact that at ph value of 3 0 adsorbent surface acquired more positive charges which attracted the hcro4 ions the dominant form of cr vi at ph 3 0 cr vi reduction to cr iii occurs after adsorption of hcro4 onto the adsorbent surface 67 point zero charge of ac ecs was noted as 6 8 fig 4 b which also resulted in further positive charges on the ac ecs surface at ph less than 6 8 causing more percent removal of cr vi maximum adsorption of cr vi was also observed at ph 3 0 by many researchers 68 maximum cr vi removal from electroplating wastewater at ph 3 0 was also noticed using activated corncob 66 at ph 2 0 low cr vi adsorption was observed as opposed to ph 3 0 because of the repulsion generated by a large number of hydrogen ions 66 the reduction in the net positive surface potential results in the decreased electrostatic forces of attraction between cr vi ionic species and the ac ecs which resulted in less adsorption at higher ph cr vi usually exists in the form of cr2o7 and hcro4 ions which decreased adsorption possibly due to a competition between oh and cr2o7 or hcro4 ions 46 the charge of the adsorbent plays a critical role in the adsorption process the phpzc point zero charge is defined as the ph value at which the net surface charge of the adsorbent is neutral or zero phpzc of ac ecs was determined as 6 8 from the plot as shown in fig 4 b which showed that ac ecs acquired positive charge below the point zero charge value of 6 8 and resulted in more removal of cr vi anions whereas at ph phpzc ac ecs acquired negative charge and resulted in less removal of the cr vi ions 3 5 4 initial concentration the initial concentration of metal plays a key role in the adsorption capacity of the adsorbent the data revealed significantly high adsorption capacity p 0 01 from 7 6 mg g 1 to 104 mg g 1 with the increase in the cr vi concentration from 10 mg l 1 to 300 mg l 1 respectively fig 5 a equilibrium condition was then observed as adsorbent surface reached saturation and there was no further increase in the adsorption capacity even when the cr vi concentration was increased to 350 mg l 1 accordingly the available adsorption sites are limited to adsorb the increasing solution concentration of cr vi which reduces the percentage of metal removal 39 the high initial concentration of cr vi resulted in the large gradient forces that overcame the resistance to cr vi ions transport between the liquid and solid phases resulting in increased uptake of cr vi 66 similar trends in cr vi adsorption have also been reported by the use of activated carbon produced from apple peel 69 however removal percentage of cr vi significantly p 0 01 decreased from 76 3 to 29 64 with an increase in cr vi concentration from 10 mg l 1 to 300 mg l 1 at lower concentrations almost all cr vi metal ions will interact with the available adsorbent sites resulting in a maximum percentage removal 3 5 5 particle size the particle size of the adsorbent is an important parameter for the adsorption process the effect of variable particle sizes 420 to 105 microns on the cr vi adsorption capacity of the ac ecs was studied keeping all other parameters constant fig 5 b this observation depicts that the adsorption capacity increased significantly p 0 01 with a reduction in particle size from 420 microns 35 36 mg g 1 70 72 to 105 microns 39 49 mg g 1 78 99 this was due to an increased surface area at reduced particle size which increased the cr vi adsorption at the initial stage 46 as a result the adsorption capacity of cr vi increased due to accessibility to adsorption sites as the active sites of the adsorbent were more exposed to the adsorbate with the decrease in particle size modified orange peel and corn cob also showed similar results for the smallest particle size 34 bet analysis also confirmed the large surface area 217 1397 m2 g 1 and mesoporous 63 36 å nature of the adsorbent that enhanced the adsorption of cr vi by ac ecs the particle size of 2 3 40 microns less than 40 microns ratio was used for further experimentation in this study 3 6 isotherms adsorption isotherm models use mathematical equations to examine the equilibrium data and to design and optimize an operating system for extensive applications they also provide a link between the metal ions that are adsorbed on the adsorbent surface and those present in the solution at equilibrium condition 70 evaluation of the adsorption process in a unit system can be done by isotherm models which provide information about the adsorption capacity as well as the mechanism and favorability of the adsorption langmuir and freundlich isotherm models showing the non linear relationship between adsorbed metal ions on the adsorbent surface and metal ions in the solution are the most commonly used models as these two parameter models are simplest they describe experimental activities well over a wide range of operating conditions in addition to the langmuir and freundlich isotherms various other models such as halsey temkin d r and harkin jura were also used in this study 3 6 1 langmuir isotherm this isotherm assumes the monolayer adsorption of the adsorbate and homogeneous surface of the adsorbent where all adsorption sites of the adsorbent surface have the same energy the linear equation for langmuir isotherm is given in supplementary information as eq s4 rl is the separation factor dimensionless constant that shows the favorable nature of the adsorption and is generally expressed as eq s5 adsorption of cr vi can be favorable 0 rl 1 unfavorable rl 1 linear rl 1 and irreversible rl 0 in the current study the value of rl ranged from 0 to 1 an indication of the favorable adsorption of cr vi on the adsorbent surface the obtained experimental maximum adsorption capacity of the ac ecs 104 mg g 1 is comparable with the already reported h3po4 activated biomasses as shown in table 3 the maximum adsorption capacity of the ac ecs over the reported adsorbents revealed its usefulness and suitability for the cr vi removal langmuir isotherm reflected the excellent fit r2 0 999 to the equilibrium data fig 6 a coefficient of determination for langmuir r2 0 999 showed that this model was best fitted to the cr vi adsorption data among all other studied isotherm freundlich halsey temkin dubinin radushkevich and harkin jura models suggesting the monolayer adsorption of cr vi on the ac ecs surface as reported by other researchers 78 79 the value of rl marked the ac ecs as an appropriate adsorbent for cr vi adsorption 3 6 2 freundlich isotherm this model shows the multilayer adsorption and the heterogeneous surface of the adsorbent 80 it also assumes that the adsorption of pollutants on the surface of adsorbent increases directly with the adsorbate concentration in the aqueous media the empirical equation for this model is given as eq s6 generally the adsorption capacity of the adsorbent increased with an increase in the value of kf adsorption capacity the value of 1 n adsorption intensity varied from 0 to 1 in our study table 2 reflecting the favorable adsorption of cr vi on the surface of the adsorbent experimental data also reflected a better fit for the freundlich model r2 0 988 but poor than langmuir isotherm fig 6 b 3 6 3 halsey isotherm halsey isotherm model 81 explains the multilayer adsorption at a relatively large distance from the surface like freundlich isotherm this model also shows that adsorbent is heterogeneous when the experimental data best fitted into its equation the non linear and linear forms equations for this model are given as eq s7 and eq s8 kh halsey isotherm constant and nh halsey exponent are obtained from the slope and intercept of the plot ince versus inqe table 2 this model fitted in the same way to cr vi adsorption data r2 0 988 fig 7 a as the freundlich model which means that the multilayer adsorption of the cr vi occurs at a short to the large distance from the heterogeneous surface of the ac ecs 3 6 4 temkin isotherm according to this model the decline in the adsorption heat is linear and the adsorption is done by the supply of binding energies 82 the general equation for the temkin model is given as eq s9 where r is the universal gas constant 8 314 j mol 1 k 1 and t is the temperature b is the heat of sorption j mol 1 which can be determined using eq s10 bt and at are the temkin isotherm constant and temkin isotherm equilibrium constant l mg 1 respectively and are given in table 2 and were calculated by plotting qe versus ince temkin model r2 0 985 as shown in fig 7 b was well fitted to the cr vi adsorption data as compared to dubinin radushkevich r2 0 948 and harkin jura r2 0 947 but it was less fitted than langmuir freundlich and halsey isotherm models 3 6 5 dubinin radushkevich d r isotherm dubinin radushkevich d r 83 is a semi empirical isotherm model which assumes that the process of adsorption in the microporous material is based on the polanyi potential adsorption theory 84 generally it is written as eq s11 qdr as shown in table 2 represents the theoretical monolayer adsorption capacity mol g 1 and β indicates the constant of sorption energy mol2 j 2 and ε is the polanyi potential and is given as eq s12 the mean or apparent free energy of the adsorption is represented by e and is obtained using the formula given in eq s13 the d r model is generally applied to determine the mean free energy of the adsorption e it is useful to distinguish the nature of adsorption either physical physisorption or chemical chemisorption if e was smaller than 8 kj mol 1 then adsorption was physical but if the e value ranges between 8 and 16 kj mol 1 the adsorption would be chemical in nature 65 although experimental data showed poor fit to the d r isotherm with r2 0 948 as shown in fig 7 c but the value of e was 15 81 kj mol 1 table 2 indicating the chemisorption of cr vi on the surface of ac ecs adsorbent this was also in line with the assumptions made by langmuir isotherm models the chemisorption nature of ac ecs was also confirmed through kinetics and regeneration results of the ac ecs as shown in figs 8 and 10 3 6 6 harkin jura isotherm this model assumes adsorption as a multilayer and can be described with the existence of heterogeneous pore distribution it is generally expressed as explained in eq s14 b and a which are harkin jura isotherm constants table 2 and were obtained from the slope and intercept of the plot 1 qe2 versus log ce the coefficient of determination value r2 0 947 reflected the worst fitting of the harkin jura isotherm to the cr vi adsorption data among the studied isotherms as shown in fig 7 d 3 7 adsorption kinetics prediction of the solute uptake rate is important for the construction of a wastewater treatment plant as it identifies the residence time of the adsorbate at the solid liquid interface the pseudo second order equation is used to determine the characteristic constants of the adsorption rate which help to investigate the mechanism involved in the adsorption of pollutants adsorption mechanism depends on the physical and chemical characteristics of the adsorbents 38 the pseudo second order model was applied to study the kinetics and uptake rate of cr vi on the adsorbent surface 70 this model involves all steps of adsorption such as internal particle diffusion external film diffusion and adsorption 85 from the application point of view it is important to determine the cr vi uptake rate from the solution by ac ecs adsorbent the rapid uptake of the pollutant is best for the practical application as it requires a short time to reach the equilibrium 3 7 1 pseudo second order kinetic model the pseudo second order model of kinetics assumes that chemisorption is the rate limiting step in the adsorption and involves sharing or bonding of electrons between adsorbate and the adsorbent surface the general equation for this model can be written as eq s15 where qt mg g 1 is the amount of adsorbate adsorbed i e cr vi at time t min and k2 is the pseudo second order rate constant expressed in g mg 1 min 1 however h represents mg g 1 h 1 the initial adsorption rate and is generally given by the eq s16 therefore eq s16 can be written as eq s17 values of h qe and k2 are given in table 4 and were obtained from the slope and intercept of the plot between t qt and t fig 8 showed that our results fitted well into the pseudo second order kinetics reflecting the chemisorption nature of cr vi adsorption on the ac ecs surface best fitted pseudo second order kinetics confirmed a strong bond between cr vi and the ac ecs surface standing at par with previous researches 86 qe exp values were observed in close agreement with that of qe cal at all initial cr vi concentrations i e 30 mg l 1 50 mg l 1 and 90 mg l 1 the value of h increased table 4 as the concentration of cr vi increases from 30 90 mg l 1 and the reason behind this is the increase in the driving force at the liquid solid phase at high cr vi concentration however reverse behavior was observed in case of k2 3 8 fixed bed column reactor study adsorbent dose or bed height plays a substantial role in the adsorbate update 87 in column adsorption studies bed height can influence the breakthrough curve as the treatment of cr vi may depend upon the amount of ac ecs packed in the column and consequently the height of column bed in order to study the effect of bed height three columns were filled with ac ecs adsorbent doses of 12 5 g 25 g and 36 5 g resulting in the respective bed heights of 5 cm 10 cm and 15 cm the influent cr vi value of 50 mg l 1 and rate of flow were maintained at 10 ml min 1 while the influent ph was kept constant at 3 0 fig 9 showed an increase in breakthrough time with the rising bed heights breakthrough time 50 increased from 5595 12270 min 93 25 h 204 5 h for ac ecs packed columns fig 9 with an increase in bed height from 5 to 15 cm respectively the volumes of the treated cr vi solution at 50 breakthrough point for ac ecs at 5 cm 10 cm and 15 cm were 55 95 l 80 l and 122 7 l respectively similarly exhaust times c0 ct 1 for ac ecs packed columns also increased from 12 000 to 36 000 min 200 600 h with the increase in bed height from 5 cm to 15 cm with the increase in bed height amount of adsorbent the surface area of the adsorbent and the availability of the active sites for cr vi binding also increased which increases the column s breakthrough time and exhaust time 88 with the increase in bed height a large amount of adsorbent was available for the solute to travel before exiting the column and thus required a longer time to fully saturate the ac ecs with cr vi 52 for ac ecs packed columns the exhaust volumes for bed heights of 5 10 and 15 cm were 1227 l 243 6 l and 363 3 l respectively in addition the breakthrough curve of 5 cm bed height was steeper as compared to 10 and 15 cm column bed heights respectively this is due to the predominance of axial dispersion of mass transfer phenomenon at lower bed height which reduced the diffusion of chromate ions effectively available active sites for the binding of cr vi were also less so that column exhaust time reached earlier and the saturation rate was also faster whereas at higher bed height the mass transfer zone is widened time of contact between cr vi ions and the adsorbent increases and the number of available active positions for the cr vi uptake also increased 52 which caused the longer extended exhaustion and breakthrough times and therefore adsorption of cr vi increased this indicated that a smaller column bed was saturated with cr vi ions faster than the longer bed the highest breakthrough and exhaust times at all studied bed heights in the case of ac ecs proved that activation increased the available active positions of the adsorbent 3 8 1 bed depth service time bdst model it is a simple model used to find the relationship between bed depth z and service time t according to the bdst model the adsorbate adsorption occurs directly on the surface of the adsorbent while intraparticle diffusion and external mass transfer resistance become negligible 89 the bdst model can be written as eq s18 both n0 and ka rate constant measured in l mg 1 min 1 can be acquired from the slope and intercept of the plot between t vs z at 50 breakthrough t t0 5 eq s18 can be represented as eq s19 s20 s21 and s22 the values of the bdst constants play an important role in extending the process with different initial metal concentrations and flow rates without any additional experiments the r2 regression coefficient values i e 0 973 0 998 and 0 91 disclosed that the column data was well fitted in the bdst model table 5 showed that with the increase in breakthrough from 20 0 2 to 60 0 6 slope a and adsorption capacity n0 values also increased from 446 to 986 and 11 353 mg l 1 to 25 098 mg l 1 respectively in lower breakthrough the adsorbent was unsaturated as most of the adsorbents active sites were not occupied by the cr vi 41 if the value of ka is large then even a small bed will avoid the breakthrough but with the decreases in ka value a larger column bed is needed to avoid breakthrough the bdst model values in table 5 revealed that at 20 0 2 breakthrough the value of the slope a indicated that 4 46 min was needed to exhaust 1 cm of the ac ecs column bed height with the increase in breakthrough from 40 to 60 the column exhaust time for 1 cm also increased from 5 70 to 9 86 min ac ecs column data revealed that for full scale column design operation the ac ecs bed height of 15 cm cr vi solution concentration of 50 mg l 1 ph of 3 0 and flow rate of 10 ml min 1 should be used by column operator the exhaust time for the ac ecs packed column was 36 000 min 600 h and the treated volume of cr vi solution was found to be 363 3 l under the above mentioned conditions 3 9 regeneration of adsorbent and adsorbate recovery the desorption study describes the physical reversible or chemical irreversible nature of the cr vi adsorption from the surface of ac ecs cr vi had very little 0 17 desorption i e 0 066 mg l 1 recovery by the deionized water which confirmed the chemisorption nature of the ac ecs fig 10 regeneration result of ac ecs in particular with deionized water also indicates the stability of the ac ecs mean that cr vi can not enter or mix into the water once it is adsorbed by ac ecs the desorbed cr vi concentration of 0 066 mg l 1 is less than the permissible limits of 0 1 mg l 1 0 05 mg l 1 and 0 25 mg l 1 of cr vi as set by epa guidelines for inland surface waters drinking water and industrial effluent respectively 22 however little desorption or recovery was observed fig 10 in the case of 0 1 m solution of different reagents i e acids and bases potassium hydroxide kh showed maximum percent desorption 15 and recovery 6 mg l 1 of cr vi from ac ecs highlighting that the adsorption was chemisorption chemical in nature and irreversible results in fig 10 indicated the highest recovery 6 mg l 1 of cr vi from the exhausted ac ecs using potassium hydroxide kh however the lowest recovery of cr vi was observed with deionized water 0 066 mg l 1 and acetone 0 015 mg l 1 chemisorption reveals a strong chemical bond between cr vi and the ac ecs surface making it difficult to regenerate recover and reuse as observed by other researches 41 4 conclusions this study reported the successful development of the activated carbon from eucalyptus camaldulensis sawdust using method v for cr vi 80 ac ecs removal the bet surface area of the ac ecs was found to be 217 14 m2 g 1 ac ecs was further explored for the adsorption of cr vi in both batch and column modes maximum adsorption efficiency 87 was observed at ph 3 0 adsorption data were described by both langmuir isotherm and pseudo second order kinetics column study reflected that different bed heights play a critical role in the column performance the bdst model was best fitted to the column adsorption data it was concluded that ac ecs can be prepared from the locally available waste precursor i e eucalyptus camaldulensis and can be used as an alternative to the expensive commercial activated carbon for the removal cr vi from aqueous solution however it is recommended to explore the interference of other metals and salts with cr vi through

13801,4 nitrobenzaldehyde 4 nba degradation pathway was studied during single and catalytic ozonation processes multi walled carbon nanotubes cnt were used as ozonation catalysts and different textural and chemical modifications were performed to obtain samples with enhanced catalytic activity cnt bm and cnt m bm 4 h single ozonation was capable of total pollutant degradation after 180 min of reaction however complete mineralization was not achieved reaching nearly 40 of total organic carbon toc removal catalytic ozonation presented a faster pollutant removal rate and a high content of organic matter was removed in the first 30 min of reaction for this specific case the incorporation of nitrogen heteroatoms in the cnt structure sample cnt m bm 4 h did not actively contribute to increasing the performance of the material achieving a mineralization degree very similar to that obtained with the commercial catalyst cnt at the end of the reaction the most promising catalyst was the ball milled sample cnt bm attaining 60 of mineralization degree after 180 min of reaction the catalyst cnt bm proved to be stable even after several reuses presenting a loss of efficiency of 15 in terms of toc from the first to the fifth cycle radical scavenger experiments revealed that there is a significant contribution of oh radicals during single ozonation whereas for catalytic ozonation process the reaction mechanism is quite different with less involvement of oh radicals in solution and a large contribution of the pathway involving adsorption and surface reactions abbreviations cnt

dessorption tert but tert butanol toc total organic carbon keywords catalytic ozonation carbon materials multi walled carbon nanotubes 4 nitrobenzaldehyde surface modifications 1 introduction the lack of available freshwater on a worldwide scale due to population growth and increase of industrialization is one of the major environmental challenges facing our planet to minimize this problem the reuse of water from unconventional sources is necessary and different water treatment techniques have been explored to obtain water suitable for human consumption 1 3 ozone o3 is an effective oxidant that has long been used during water treatment processes o3 presents a high reactivity that is attributed largely to its electronic configuration and it is a very selective molecule that attacks electron rich functional groups like double bonds amines and activated aromatic rings 1 4 7 ozonation process can proceed through direct and indirect routes direct route happens when molecular o3 reacts directly with the organic molecules present in solution indirect pathway is related to o3 decomposition and generation of hydroxyl radicals oh who will actively participate in the organic matter degradation process unlike o3 that reacts selectively with certain molecules oh are non selective with organic compounds and are capable to completely oxidize less reactive organic molecules that were not possible to oxidize with a single ozonation process these free radicals come from reaction mechanisms of o3 decomposition in water that can be accelerated by increasing solution ph or by adding an external factor to the reaction such as uv radiation hydrogen peroxide or a solid catalyst 7 9 taking advantage of the non selective character of oh catalytic ozonation arises as an effective advanced oxidation process aop in the removal of organic compounds from water 1 3 6 8 9 aops are considered as the most innovative and promising technologies applied for water and wastewater treatment this type of technology is based on physicochemical processes that are capable of producing a large amount of chemical reactive species such as oh that will oxidize the organic matter present in solution 8 10 11 the combination of o3 with an appropriate catalyst uv or h2o2 improves the decomposition of o3 and enhances the formation of oh that will react freely with organics present in solution promoting the mineralization of refractory compounds that are difficult to dissociate by single ozonation at ambient temperature and pressure 6 12 16 heterogeneous catalytic ozonation is an attractive alternative where the most used catalysts are metal oxides or metal oxide on supports 1 6 7 17 18 this type of catalysts not only promotes o3 decomposition into more reactive species but also aids the process through adsorption and reaction of the pollutants in solution on the surface of the catalyst 7 19 among all the supports used carbon materials attract growing interest due to their particular characteristics such as high specific surface area high pore volume application in several types of reactions in liquid and or gas medium and the possibility of modifications of their textural and chemical properties furthermore this type of materials has been reported as efficient catalysts for o3 decomposition in water 7 15 19 21 modifications of the surface properties of the carbon materials as the incorporation of different groups on their surface can influence the catalytic activity being an interesting alternative for this application in addition to take advantage of metal free catalyst that will avoid the harmful impact that metals can have in the environment 22 25 4 nba is a synthetic raw material and an important photodegradation product from chloramphenicol which is a widely used broad spectrum antibiotic this product represents a danger to human health due to its genotoxic effect and reported mutagenicity 26 28 as in many cases of organic pollutants degradation in water the possible intermediaries of degradation are more toxic than the main compound there are several studies that report photodegradation processes for the degradation of chloramphenicol and highlight the predominance of 4 nba as a toxic reaction intermediate 26 31 however there are few studies focused on the degradation of 4 nba and taking into account the harmful effect that this pollutant can have on human health it is important to study alternatives to 4 nba degradation in the present work 4 nba was studied in order to understand which is the contribution of single and catalytic ozonation for their removal mineralization of organic matter and formation of inorganic nitrogen species commercial multi walled carbon nanotubes cnt were subjected to different treatments in order to modify their chemical and textural properties and they were used as catalysts for catalytic ozonation of 4 nba 2 materials and methods 2 1 catalysts preparation commercial multi walled carbon nanotubes nanocyl 3100 labelled as cnt were used as starting material according to the supplier the material has a carbon purity higher than 95 in order to obtain catalysts with different chemical and textural properties modified materials were synthesized using the ball millling technique in a retsch mm200 equipment cnt bm sample was obtained through the ball mill of cnt during 2 h and using a frequency of 15 vibrations s for the synthesis of cnt doped with nitrogen melamine 99 fluka was used as nitrogen precursor and was milled together with cnt during 4 h using a frequency of 15 vibrations s after the material was was exposed to a thermal treatment under n2 flow at 600 c for 1 h to ensure that melamine was completely decomposed sample cnt m bm 4 h the application of this methodology allows the incorporation of a considerable number of n groups in carbon nanotubes surface through the rearrangement of electrons allowing to change their properties and resulting in highly active catalyst to be applied in oxidation processes the milling and thermal treatment conditions were optimized in previous works 32 33 2 2 catalysts characterization textural characterization of samples was calculated from the n2 adsorption isotherms determined at 196 c in a quantachrome nova 4200e multistation apparatus samples were previously degassed at 150 c for 3 h temperature programmed desorption tpd analysis was performed to study the surface chemistry of the catalysts co and co2 tpd spectra were obtained with a fully automated ami 300 altamira instruments connected to a dycor dymaxion mass spectrometer the ph at the point of zero charge phpzc was measured through the analysis of ph change of nacl solutions with different initial values of ph when in contact with samples of the synthesized materials during 24 h these experiments were performed for all the studied materials nitrogen content of the doped sample was determined by elemental analysis in a vario micro cube analyser from elemental gmbh more detailed information on the characterization techniques used can be found in references 32 33 2 3 ozonation experiments 4 nba 99 alfa aesar was used as initial pollutant all the experiments were carried out in a semi batch reactor ca 1 l equipped with magnetic stirring ozone o3 was produced from oxygen in a bmt 802x o3 generator and the gas concentration was controlled with a bmt 964 o3 analyzer a series of gas washing bottles filled with a potassium iodide solution was coupled to the system to remove unreacted o3 for each assay 700 ml solution of 4 nba diluted in distilled water was added to the reactor for catalytic ozonation experiments 350 mg of catalyst was added to the volume considered and the experiments were performed at a constant flow rate 150 cm3 min with an inlet ozone concentration of 50 g m3 and stirring 400 rpm 18 tert butanol 99 7 sigma aldrich was used as radical scavenger for some experiments the reactions performed lasted 3 h and all samples were collected using a syringe at selected times the 4 nba concentration was monitored by hplc hitachi elite lachrom hplc equipped with a diode array detector chromatographic separation was carried out in a ymc hydrosphere c18 column 250 mm 4 6 mm i d working at room temperature under isocratic elution mode of 0 1 h3po4 methanol 25 75 v v at a flow rate of 1 0 ml min and with 20 μl of injection volume the detection wavelength was set at 267 nm 27 oxalic and oxamic acids that could result from 4 nba degradation process were analyzed by hplc hitachi elite lachrom hplc with uv detector using an altech ao 1000 column 300 mm 6 5 mm i d operating under isocratic elution of h2so4 5 mm nitrogen inorganic species were monitored by ionic chromatography in a metrohm 881 compact ic pro equipment equipped with a metrosep c4 cationic exchange column 250 mm 4 0 mm for quantification of ammonia nh4 and a metrosep a supp 7 anionic exchange column 250 mm 4 0 mm for quantification of nitrate no3 and nitrite no2 mineralization degree of the parent organic molecule was evaluated through toc analysis in a shimadzu toc l csh analyzer most of the experiments were performed in triplicate and consistent results were obtained with a maximum deviation of 2 5 3 results and discussion 3 1 catalysts characterization table 1 presents the values of surface areas obtained by the bet method and pore volume of the original and modified carbon nanotube catalysts the amounts of co2 and co evolved during tpd analysis are also presented as well as the phpzc for each of the considered catalysts and the nitrogen amount of the n doped catalyst determined by elemental analysis cnt bm is the catalyst that presents the highest surface area the mechanical process applied to the original cnt led to an increase of the superficial surface area from 201 m2 g to 249 m2 g due to the reduction of the entanglement of the carbon nanotubes and formation of shorter cnt by breaking up the tubes 33 besides the catalyst doped with nitrogen cnt m bm 4 h was milled during more time 4 h than the milled catalyst cnt bm the former sample present a lower surface area which must be related to the presence of nitrogen on its surface 1 4 leading to a decrease in the available area and pore volume of the material 32 tpd analysis allowed to characterize the oxygen containing groups on the surface of the carbon materials through their thermal decomposition into co and or co2 19 20 34 tpd profiles not shown revealed that all the catalysts considered for this work do not present significant amounts of oxygenated surface groups since the amounts of co and co2 released are very low and similar among the samples as can be seen from the data present in table 1 these results are in accordance with the phpzc values obtained that all are very similar displaying the neutral character of carbon nanotube samples between 6 5 and 6 7 generally for the modified samples co released was always significantly higher than co2 the mechanical treatment applied to the original cnt to synthesize the ground sample cnt bm does not promote any functionalization of the carbon nanotubes surface since it is a process that leads to physical alterations culminating in a material with higher surface area than the original however for the nitrogen functionalized sample cnt m bm 4 h it is possible to see an increase in the amount of co released during the analysis and a great decrease in the amount of co2 when compared with original cnt with the co increase happening for temperatures higher than 600 c temperature of the thermal treatment applied to the sample it is known that the co signal is related to the groups that were not susceptible of being removed during the thermal treatment such as carbonyl quinone groups that are released at temperatures higher than 600 c and phenol compounds whose decomposition happens for a range of temperatures of 500 700 c co2 signal registered may be strongly associated with the release of lactone groups that decompose to a temperature range between 600 c and 800 c 20 at this point it is expected that carboxyl acid groups were already fully decomposed during the thermal treatment performed not being present in materials surface soares et al 35 reported this behaviour in a previous study on the influence of different methodologies for the incorporation of n heteroatoms in carbon nanotubes structure 3 2 ozonation process single and catalytic ozonation processes were performed to evaluate the catalytic performance of the synthesized materials for the removal of 4 nba in a first stage preliminary experiments were carried out with different initial concentrations of 4 nba natural ph of the solution around 5 4 in order to evaluate the efficiency of the degradation process and the concentration of inorganic species formed during the oxidation of the parent molecule these tests were performed to understand the reaction behaviour of the pollutant only in the presence of ozone and to define the initial conditions to be implemented during catalytic ozonation processes results regarding pollutant degradation toc removal and inorganic species formation during these experiments are present in figs 1 and 2 according with the results obtained for single ozonation experiments with different initial concentrations of pollutant it is possible to conclude that for concentrations higher than 60 mg l both pollutant removal rate and mineralization degree tend to stabilize without no major differences related to the final results obtained for these parameters as can be seen regardless of pollutant initial concentration single ozonation process is able to completely remove the pollutant after 180 min of reaction 4 nba is an organic aromatic compound that is easily degraded by ozonation alone since o3 is capable of selectively attack aromatic moieties and unsaturated bonds such as the ones present in the molecule 15 as it was expected the reaction of ozone with the model organic pollutant occurred more rapidly when it was present in the solution at lower concentrations 40 and 60 mg l however for concentrations above 60 mg l the reaction became slightly slower but allowed the total removal of 4 nba after 180 min of reaction time it is known that the single ozonation process is not capable of completely mineralize the solution for the lowest initial concentration 40 mg l it was possible to achieve a maximum mineralization degree of approximately 62 yet it was registered a decrease in mineralization efficiency of about 16 when initial 4 nba concentration varied from 40 to 60 mg l for higher initial concentrations toc values did not register very significant variations presenting very close mineralization values after 180 min of reaction being possible to observe a trend towards stabilization of the toc values obtained at the end of the reaction as a result of the decomposition of the parent organic molecule organic and inorganic intermediate compounds are formed the intermediate organic compounds formed actively contribute to the toc values registered however the identification and quantification of these species was not possible to perform with the available analytical methods present in the laboratory for this reason and taking into account that the main objective of the present work is related to the evaluation of the selected catalysts in the catalytic ozonation process for the degradation of the main organic molecule it was not possible to trace a possible degradation mechanism of 4 nba and identify the intermediate species presented in the solutions after ozonation treatment the concentration of inorganic species formed during the ozonation process was measured during reaction time fig 2 the control of these species is important taking into account the toxicity associated with n species that can be formed for initial 4 nba concentrations higher than 40 mg l nitrate ions no3 concentration stabilizes at maximum values very close to 30 mg l regardless of the initial pollutant concentration considered nitrite and ammonia concentrations remained low during reaction time without significant differences between reactions although the previously selected concentrations are very high and in real conditions this type of species is detected in a lower order of magnitude high initial concentration will assist to properly evaluate the results obtained regarding the catalytic activity of the synthesized catalyst thus taking into account the results obtained where there is a clear trend towards stabilization of toc values and inorganic species concentration formed during ozonation process an initial concentration of 80 mg l was established for the following tests in the presence of a solid catalyst catalytic ozonation experiments were carried out for the different catalysts synthesized and the results regarding 4 nba degradation and toc removal during reaction time are presented in fig 3 the presence of a solid catalyst during reaction time increased the pollutant degradation rate especially with cnt bm sample making it faster than in single ozonation however the best improvement achieved is related with organic matter mineralization degree the presence of the tested catalysts contributes to increasing the toc removal rate especially at the beginning of the reaction cnt bm was the best catalyst converting about 60 of organic matter after 180 min of reaction previous studies had shown that when carbon nanotube materials were used as ozonation catalysts the larger surface area favours the reaction since there are more available active sites where the reaction can occur and the pollutant can adsorb 19 32 33 thus the ball milling process applied to the cnt was capable of improving the catalytic performance in ozonation reactions because the mechanical treatment promotes changes in the cnt structure breaking the tubes and forming shorter cnts therefore the decrease in the nanotubes entanglement and the break of the tubes allowed to increase the specific surface area creating more active sites for reaction with organic molecules 32 33 previous studies have reported that the introduction of nitrogen on the surface of carbon materials might enhance the catalytic activity of the material 22 however in this particular case the n doped sample did not show the best catalytic activity presenting an organic matter mineralization degree of about 40 this result may be associated with the decrease of surface area in comparison with non doped milled samples due to the introduction of nitrogen on cnt additionally previous studies verified that the effect of n doping is more evident when the reactions were carried out at high temperature and pressure than at ambient temperature and pressure as reported in this work 32 fig 4 a presents the evolution of inorganic compounds concentration during single and catalytic ozonation experiments single ozonation leads to a higher formation of inorganic charge the concentration of nitrates in solution being the most preponderant value 30 mg l nitrate concentration is higher in the presence of milled samples than in the presence of original cnt but no significant differences were observed after 180 min of reaction decreasing the concentration of nitrate in approximately 5 ammonia and nitrite concentration remained low maximum of 0 2 mg l and relatively constant over reaction time an exception was observed in the nitrite concentration during catalytic ozonation in the presence of cnt bm that presented approximately 0 4 mg l along reaction time it is clear from the results displayed that ozonation process leads to a preferential formation of no3 from the balance present in fig 4 b it is possible to observe that the inorganic nitrogen quantified during single and catalytic reactions does not correspond to the total amount of n present in the organic molecule which means that some of the intermediate compounds formed during the oxidative process will have n species in their constitution the final ph values of all after reaction solutions for single and catalytic ozonation reactions were monitored and the recorded values were very similar for all the tests phfinal 3 2 as it is already known single ozonation process usually leads to the formation of saturated compounds such as aldehydes ketones and carboxylic acids this type of by products has low reactivity towards o3 alone so they tend to accumulate in water being the main reason for the decrease of ph after reaction with o3 15 36 this decrease in the ph value in solution after ozonation process proves that in fact some intermediate compounds formed after reaction contribute to the decrease of ph for more acidic values the formation of oxamic and oxalic acids during experiments was monitored and they were not detected in solution under the tested conditions suggesting that species were not released or their concentrations are below the detection limit of the equipment other species with acidic character were formed but they were not detected with the analytical methods available 3 3 cyclic tests cyclic experiments were carried out in the presence of cnt bm to ascertain its durability as well as to find out if the catalyst loses efficiency with successive utilizations five reuse cycles were performed and after each run the catalyst was recovered dried in an oven overnight and used again fig 5 features the results obtained for the cyclic experiments in terms of 4 nba concentration toc removal and inorganic species formed after 180 min of reaction during the several reuses the catalyst presents a slight loss of efficiency that affects the results related to 4 nba removal and organic matter mineralization degree in the case of the parent pollutant removal the catalyst experienced only a loss of about 9 from the first to the fifth utilization however the most significant decrease is registered from the third to the fourth cycle and after that the values of 4 nba removal stabilized regarding the organic matter mineralization degree this loss is a little more evident corresponding to a decrease of approximately 15 from the first to the fifth cycle however the most significant decrease in the efficiency values occurred from the first to the second run and after that the toc removal profiles are very similar these results may suggest that after the second use the catalyst does not suffer any more significant changes that will influence the reaction efficiency inorganic species concentration obtained at the end of each cycle shows a tendency to form higher concentrations of no3 and nh4 species with the increase of reuses of the catalyst the amount of no3 increased along with the cyclic runs and over time observing an increase from 20 ppm in the first run to 30 ppm in the fifth run after 180 min of reaction the range of no2 concentration remained very low however at the end of the fifth run nh4 concentration slightly increase in the case of no2 species they were formed during all first run and only at the beginning of the second cycle and no formation was verified in the fifth cycle the catalysts used in cyclic tests were recovered and characterized to evaluate the effect of ozonation in their properties and understand the associated causes of the eventual deactivation tpd and n2 adsorption isotherms analysis were carried out and the results are shown in table 2 and fig 6 in terms of specific surface area the values obtained for the reused catalyst did not show significant changes the slight decrease regarding specific surface area values was registered after the first cycle and no significant differences were registered for the remaining reutilizations these results suggested that o3 has almost no effect in the surface area of the tested catalyst showing no significant changes in the sbet of fresh and used samples however through tpd results it is possible to verify that ozonation process is responsible for chemical modifications on the catalyst surface fig 6 shows that both co2 and co signals increase for the catalysts that were successively reused in co2 spectra fig 6 a it is possible to observe a signal increase for temperatures around 300 c which are associated with carboxylic acids released from the surface of the catalyst 20 the co and co2 values presented in table 2 indicate a noticeable difference between the fresh catalyst surface and the reused ones the signals with increasing intensity displayed for the reused catalysts prove that their surface is in fact oxidized by the dissolved ozone but not to a great extent since the increase is not that significant when compared with the results obtained for the fresh cnt bm catalyst 19 the most evident signal increase is observed after the first use 1st cycle of the material tending to stabilize for the catalysts successively reused without presenting major differences among them which suggests that oxidation of the catalyst surface tends to saturation after successive reuses these results are important in order to understand the loss of efficiency observed in the experiments previously presented it is known that for catalytic oxidation processes in the presence of carbon nanotubes the presence of acidic groups such as carboxylic acids on the surface of the catalyst strongly decrease the performance of the catalyst due to the negative influence of oxygen containing groups in ozone decomposition 19 during successive reutilizations of the catalyst in ozonation these type of groups tend to accumulate on catalysts surface leading to a loss of efficiency associated with the presence of these species gonçalves et al 19 also reported that the catalyst tends to lose efficiency in the catalytic processes when its surface is oxidized due to successive reuse of the catalyst the decrease on the activity efficiency is assigned to the introduction of oxygenated electron withdrawing groups that are responsible for the reduction of electron density on the carbon surface leading to a decrease of the catalytic activity of the material for ozone decomposition and the ability to form hydroxyl radicals 23 3 4 study of the reaction mechanism to study the degradation reaction mechanism of 4 nba adsorption tests with cnt bm catalyst under o2 gas stream and radical scavenger experiments single and catalytic ozonation in the presence of cnt bm using tert butanol were performed the results obtained for adsorption experiments fig 7 showed that about 50 of 4 nba is adsorbed on the catalyst within the initial 2 min of reaction this result suggests that adsorption is an important step in the mechanism of 4 nba removal during catalytic ozonation contributing to the removal of the pollutant from the solution these results prove and reinforce the results obtained for the different catalysts tested as previously shown the most promising catalyst for 4 nba removal is the milled carbon nanotubes that present the highest bet surface area and pore volume these properties greatly contribute to the adsorption process since there is more available superficial area however the extension of adsorption depends on the shape of the organic molecule 19 33 37 also it is possible to see from the obtained results that 4 nba adsorption occurs very quickly during the first minutes of reaction adsorption experiments carried out with cnt and cnt m bm 4 h results not shown revealed that the contribution of this mechanism for the pollutant removal is of about 50 as it was reported for cnt bm sample previous experiments related to the application of carbon nanotubes as ozonation catalysts for the removal of bezafibrate and sulfamethoxazole reported a contribution of adsorption around 60 and 30 respectively 23 38 as verified in this work gonçalves et al 23 reported that generally adsorption on cnt is faster in the first minutes of reaction due to the lower mass transfer limitations in the mesoporous structure of the material additional characterizations were carried out to the sample recovered from this experiment to evaluate the effect of adsorption in the catalyst properties the bet surface area decreased from 249 to 163 m2 g revealing a significant decrease when compared with the superficial surface area value of the fresh catalyst radical scavenger experiments were performed to analyze the contribution of oh radicals during 4 nba degradation ozone decomposition chain can be interrupted when hydroxyl radical reacts with inhibitors radical scavengers that are capable of consuming these radicals 7 tert butanol is a strong radical scavenger that reacts rapidly with hydroxyl radicals and slowly with ozone 39 40 the results from radical scavenger experiments present in fig 7 shows that for single ozonation the presence of tert butanol leads to a decrease of the pollutant removal rate and total degradation was not verified showing a 4 nba conversion of 60 after 180 min of reaction this result suggested that the mechanism of pollutant degradation by single ozonation comprises a oh radical pathway in the case of catalytic ozonation the influence of oh radicals during 4 nba degradation was not so evident observing only a slight decrease in the first 30 min of the reaction and after that no differences were observed therefore the effect of tert butanol during ozonation of 4 nba is different in the absence and presence of catalyst suggesting that non catalytic and catalytic runs present different reaction mechanism the obtained results allowed to conclude that single ozonation was an efficient alternative to completely degrade 4 nba in solution but the organic matter removal degree was unsatisfactory in the presence of tert butanol a high decrease in pollutant removal rate was observed during single ozonation revealing that oh radicals have a contribution of about 40 for 4 nba degradation when cnt bm catalyst was combined with o3 an increase in the pollutant removal rate and an improvement in mineralization degree were attained no significant importance of oh radicals in solution was observed during catalytic ozonation in the presence of cnt bm but adsorption and reactions on catalyst surface seem to play a key role during 4 nba degradation thus although catalyst presence is important as it has a major contribution to organic molecule adsorption at the beginning of reaction ozonation process is necessary in order to fully degrade the main pollutant 4 conclusions single and catalytic ozonation processes were studied during 4 nba removal in a semi batch reactor carbon nanotubes with different chemical and textural properties were used as ozonation catalysts the modifications performed on the original material through ball milling allowed to synthesize materials with a higher specific surface area and to easily incorporate nitrogen heteroatoms in the cnt structure cnt m bm 4 h single ozonation was able to completely remove the pollutant after 180 min of reaction however the total mineralization degree was not achieved when a catalyst was added 4 nba degradation rate increased and the mineralization degree was improved especially in the first hour of reaction the highest toc removal was verified with ball milled carbon nanotubes cnt bm sample leading to a mineralization degree of approximately 60 after 180 min of reaction cyclic tests showed a slight loss of efficiency after the first run nearly 15 in terms of toc mineralization however with successive reutilizations concentration and toc removal did not significantly change the catalyst cnt m bm 4 h was active for 4 nba degradation however its activity turned out to be very similar to that recorded with the original material not showing great improvements in the mineralization degree of organic matter present in solution the experiments carried out in the presence of radical scavenger suggested that 4 nba degradation by catalytic ozonation is little affected by hydroxyl radicals on the other hand degradation of 4 nba by single ozonation is influenced by the presence of hydroxyl radicals in the solution declaration of competing interest we wish to confirm

13801,4 nitrobenzaldehyde 4 nba degradation pathway was studied during single and catalytic ozonation processes multi walled carbon nanotubes cnt were used as ozonation catalysts and different textural and chemical modifications were performed to obtain samples with enhanced catalytic activity cnt bm and cnt m bm 4 h single ozonation was capable of total pollutant degradation after 180 min of reaction however complete mineralization was not achieved reaching nearly 40 of total organic carbon toc removal catalytic ozonation presented a faster pollutant removal rate and a high content of organic matter was removed in the first 30 min of reaction for this specific case the incorporation of nitrogen heteroatoms in the cnt structure sample cnt m bm 4 h did not actively contribute to increasing the performance of the material achieving a mineralization degree very similar to that obtained with the commercial catalyst cnt at the end of the reaction the most promising catalyst was the ball milled sample cnt bm attaining 60 of mineralization degree after 180 min of reaction the catalyst cnt bm proved to be stable even after several reuses presenting a loss of efficiency of 15 in terms of toc from the first to the fifth cycle radical scavenger experiments revealed that there is a significant contribution of oh radicals during single ozonation whereas for catalytic ozonation process the reaction mechanism is quite different with less involvement of oh radicals in solution and a large contribution of the pathway involving adsorption and surface reactions abbreviations cnt

of available freshwater on a worldwide scale due to population growth and increase of industrialization is one of the major environmental challenges facing our planet to minimize this problem the reuse of water from unconventional sources is necessary and different water treatment techniques have been explored to obtain water suitable for human consumption 1 3 ozone o3 is an effective oxidant that has long been used during water treatment processes o3 presents a high reactivity that is attributed largely to its electronic configuration and it is a very selective molecule that attacks electron rich functional groups like double bonds amines and activated aromatic rings 1 4 7 ozonation process can proceed through direct and indirect routes direct route happens when molecular o3 reacts directly with the organic molecules present in solution indirect pathway is related to o3 decomposition and generation of hydroxyl radicals oh who will actively participate in the organic matter degradation process unlike o3 that reacts selectively with certain molecules oh are non selective with organic compounds and are capable to completely oxidize less reactive organic molecules that were not possible to oxidize with a single ozonation process these free radicals come from reaction mechanisms of o3 decomposition in water that can be accelerated by increasing solution ph or by adding an external factor to the reaction such as uv radiation hydrogen peroxide or a solid catalyst 7 9 taking advantage of the non selective character of oh catalytic ozonation arises as an effective advanced oxidation process aop in the removal of organic compounds from water 1 3 6 8 9 aops are considered as the most innovative and promising technologies applied for water and wastewater treatment this type of technology is based on physicochemical processes that are capable of producing a large amount of chemical reactive species such as oh that will oxidize the organic matter present in solution 8 10 11 the combination of o3 with an appropriate catalyst uv or h2o2 improves the decomposition of o3 and enhances the formation of oh that will react freely with organics present in solution promoting the mineralization of refractory compounds that are difficult to dissociate by single ozonation at ambient temperature and pressure 6 12 16 heterogeneous catalytic ozonation is an attractive alternative where the most used catalysts are metal oxides or metal oxide on supports 1 6 7 17 18 this type of catalysts not only promotes o3 decomposition into more reactive species but also aids the process through adsorption and reaction of the pollutants in solution on the surface of the catalyst 7 19 among all the supports used carbon materials attract growing interest due to their particular characteristics such as high specific surface area high pore volume application in several types of reactions in liquid and or gas medium and the possibility of modifications of their textural and chemical properties furthermore this type of materials has been reported as efficient catalysts for o3 decomposition in water 7 15 19 21 modifications of the surface properties of the carbon materials as the incorporation of different groups on their surface can influence the catalytic activity being an interesting alternative for this application in addition to take advantage of metal free catalyst that will avoid the harmful impact that metals can have in the environment 22 25 4 nba is a synthetic raw material and an important photodegradation product from chloramphenicol which is a widely used broad spectrum antibiotic this product represents a danger to human health due to its genotoxic effect and reported mutagenicity 26 28 as in many cases of organic pollutants degradation in water the possible intermediaries of degradation are more toxic than the main compound there are several studies that report photodegradation processes for the degradation of chloramphenicol and highlight the predominance of 4 nba as a toxic reaction intermediate 26 31 however there are few studies focused on the degradation of 4 nba and taking into account the harmful effect that this pollutant can have on human health it is important to study alternatives to 4 nba degradation in the present work 4 nba was studied in order to understand which is the contribution of single and catalytic ozonation for their removal mineralization of organic matter and formation of inorganic nitrogen species commercial multi walled carbon nanotubes cnt were subjected to different treatments in order to modify their chemical and textural properties and they were used as catalysts for catalytic ozonation of 4 nba 2 materials and methods 2 1 catalysts preparation commercial multi walled carbon nanotubes nanocyl 3100 labelled as cnt were used as starting material according to the supplier the material has a carbon purity higher than 95 in order to obtain catalysts with different chemical and textural properties modified materials were synthesized using the ball millling technique in a retsch mm200 equipment cnt bm sample was obtained through the ball mill of cnt during 2 h and using a frequency of 15 vibrations s for the synthesis of cnt doped with nitrogen melamine 99 fluka was used as nitrogen precursor and was milled together with cnt during 4 h using a frequency of 15 vibrations s after the material was was exposed to a thermal treatment under n2 flow at 600 c for 1 h to ensure that melamine was completely decomposed sample cnt m bm 4 h the application of this methodology allows the incorporation of a considerable number of n groups in carbon nanotubes surface through the rearrangement of electrons allowing to change their properties and resulting in highly active catalyst to be applied in oxidation processes the milling and thermal treatment conditions were optimized in previous works 32 33 2 2 catalysts characterization textural characterization of samples was calculated from the n2 adsorption isotherms determined at 196 c in a quantachrome nova 4200e multistation apparatus samples were previously degassed at 150 c for 3 h temperature programmed desorption tpd analysis was performed to study the surface chemistry of the catalysts co and co2 tpd spectra were obtained with a fully automated ami 300 altamira instruments connected to a dycor dymaxion mass spectrometer the ph at the point of zero charge phpzc was measured through the analysis of ph change of nacl solutions with different initial values of ph when in contact with samples of the synthesized materials during 24 h these experiments were performed for all the studied materials nitrogen content of the doped sample was determined by elemental analysis in a vario micro cube analyser from elemental gmbh more detailed information on the characterization techniques used can be found in references 32 33 2 3 ozonation experiments 4 nba 99 alfa aesar was used as initial pollutant all the experiments were carried out in a semi batch reactor ca 1 l equipped with magnetic stirring ozone o3 was produced from oxygen in a bmt 802x o3 generator and the gas concentration was controlled with a bmt 964 o3 analyzer a series of gas washing bottles filled with a potassium iodide solution was coupled to the system to remove unreacted o3 for each assay 700 ml solution of 4 nba diluted in distilled water was added to the reactor for catalytic ozonation experiments 350 mg of catalyst was added to the volume considered and the experiments were performed at a constant flow rate 150 cm3 min with an inlet ozone concentration of 50 g m3 and stirring 400 rpm 18 tert butanol 99 7 sigma aldrich was used as radical scavenger for some experiments the reactions performed lasted 3 h and all samples were collected using a syringe at selected times the 4 nba concentration was monitored by hplc hitachi elite lachrom hplc equipped with a diode array detector chromatographic separation was carried out in a ymc hydrosphere c18 column 250 mm 4 6 mm i d working at room temperature under isocratic elution mode of 0 1 h3po4 methanol 25 75 v v at a flow rate of 1 0 ml min and with 20 μl of injection volume the detection wavelength was set at 267 nm 27 oxalic and oxamic acids that could result from 4 nba degradation process were analyzed by hplc hitachi elite lachrom hplc with uv detector using an altech ao 1000 column 300 mm 6 5 mm i d operating under isocratic elution of h2so4 5 mm nitrogen inorganic species were monitored by ionic chromatography in a metrohm 881 compact ic pro equipment equipped with a metrosep c4 cationic exchange column 250 mm 4 0 mm for quantification of ammonia nh4 and a metrosep a supp 7 anionic exchange column 250 mm 4 0 mm for quantification of nitrate no3 and nitrite no2 mineralization degree of the parent organic molecule was evaluated through toc analysis in a shimadzu toc l csh analyzer most of the experiments were performed in triplicate and consistent results were obtained with a maximum deviation of 2 5 3 results and discussion 3 1 catalysts characterization table 1 presents the values of surface areas obtained by the bet method and pore volume of the original and modified carbon nanotube catalysts the amounts of co2 and co evolved during tpd analysis are also presented as well as the phpzc for each of the considered catalysts and the nitrogen amount of the n doped catalyst determined by elemental analysis cnt bm is the catalyst that presents the highest surface area the mechanical process applied to the original cnt led to an increase of the superficial surface area from 201 m2 g to 249 m2 g due to the reduction of the entanglement of the carbon nanotubes and formation of shorter cnt by breaking up the tubes 33 besides the catalyst doped with nitrogen cnt m bm 4 h was milled during more time 4 h than the milled catalyst cnt bm the former sample present a lower surface area which must be related to the presence of nitrogen on its surface 1 4 leading to a decrease in the available area and pore volume of the material 32 tpd analysis allowed to characterize the oxygen containing groups on the surface of the carbon materials through their thermal decomposition into co and or co2 19 20 34 tpd profiles not shown revealed that all the catalysts considered for this work do not present significant amounts of oxygenated surface groups since the amounts of co and co2 released are very low and similar among the samples as can be seen from the data present in table 1 these results are in accordance with the phpzc values obtained that all are very similar displaying the neutral character of carbon nanotube samples between 6 5 and 6 7 generally for the modified samples co released was always significantly higher than co2 the mechanical treatment applied to the original cnt to synthesize the ground sample cnt bm does not promote any functionalization of the carbon nanotubes surface since it is a process that leads to physical alterations culminating in a material with higher surface area than the original however for the nitrogen functionalized sample cnt m bm 4 h it is possible to see an increase in the amount of co released during the analysis and a great decrease in the amount of co2 when compared with original cnt with the co increase happening for temperatures higher than 600 c temperature of the thermal treatment applied to the sample it is known that the co signal is related to the groups that were not susceptible of being removed during the thermal treatment such as carbonyl quinone groups that are released at temperatures higher than 600 c and phenol compounds whose decomposition happens for a range of temperatures of 500 700 c co2 signal registered may be strongly associated with the release of lactone groups that decompose to a temperature range between 600 c and 800 c 20 at this point it is expected that carboxyl acid groups were already fully decomposed during the thermal treatment performed not being present in materials surface soares et al 35 reported this behaviour in a previous study on the influence of different methodologies for the incorporation of n heteroatoms in carbon nanotubes structure 3 2 ozonation process single and catalytic ozonation processes were performed to evaluate the catalytic performance of the synthesized materials for the removal of 4 nba in a first stage preliminary experiments were carried out with different initial concentrations of 4 nba natural ph of the solution around 5 4 in order to evaluate the efficiency of the degradation process and the concentration of inorganic species formed during the oxidation of the parent molecule these tests were performed to understand the reaction behaviour of the pollutant only in the presence of ozone and to define the initial conditions to be implemented during catalytic ozonation processes results regarding pollutant degradation toc removal and inorganic species formation during these experiments are present in figs 1 and 2 according with the results obtained for single ozonation experiments with different initial concentrations of pollutant it is possible to conclude that for concentrations higher than 60 mg l both pollutant removal rate and mineralization degree tend to stabilize without no major differences related to the final results obtained for these parameters as can be seen regardless of pollutant initial concentration single ozonation process is able to completely remove the pollutant after 180 min of reaction 4 nba is an organic aromatic compound that is easily degraded by ozonation alone since o3 is capable of selectively attack aromatic moieties and unsaturated bonds such as the ones present in the molecule 15 as it was expected the reaction of ozone with the model organic pollutant occurred more rapidly when it was present in the solution at lower concentrations 40 and 60 mg l however for concentrations above 60 mg l the reaction became slightly slower but allowed the total removal of 4 nba after 180 min of reaction time it is known that the single ozonation process is not capable of completely mineralize the solution for the lowest initial concentration 40 mg l it was possible to achieve a maximum mineralization degree of approximately 62 yet it was registered a decrease in mineralization efficiency of about 16 when initial 4 nba concentration varied from 40 to 60 mg l for higher initial concentrations toc values did not register very significant variations presenting very close mineralization values after 180 min of reaction being possible to observe a trend towards stabilization of the toc values obtained at the end of the reaction as a result of the decomposition of the parent organic molecule organic and inorganic intermediate compounds are formed the intermediate organic compounds formed actively contribute to the toc values registered however the identification and quantification of these species was not possible to perform with the available analytical methods present in the laboratory for this reason and taking into account that the main objective of the present work is related to the evaluation of the selected catalysts in the catalytic ozonation process for the degradation of the main organic molecule it was not possible to trace a possible degradation mechanism of 4 nba and identify the intermediate species presented in the solutions after ozonation treatment the concentration of inorganic species formed during the ozonation process was measured during reaction time fig 2 the control of these species is important taking into account the toxicity associated with n species that can be formed for initial 4 nba concentrations higher than 40 mg l nitrate ions no3 concentration stabilizes at maximum values very close to 30 mg l regardless of the initial pollutant concentration considered nitrite and ammonia concentrations remained low during reaction time without significant differences between reactions although the previously selected concentrations are very high and in real conditions this type of species is detected in a lower order of magnitude high initial concentration will assist to properly evaluate the results obtained regarding the catalytic activity of the synthesized catalyst thus taking into account the results obtained where there is a clear trend towards stabilization of toc values and inorganic species concentration formed during ozonation process an initial concentration of 80 mg l was established for the following tests in the presence of a solid catalyst catalytic ozonation experiments were carried out for the different catalysts synthesized and the results regarding 4 nba degradation and toc removal during reaction time are presented in fig 3 the presence of a solid catalyst during reaction time increased the pollutant degradation rate especially with cnt bm sample making it faster than in single ozonation however the best improvement achieved is related with organic matter mineralization degree the presence of the tested catalysts contributes to increasing the toc removal rate especially at the beginning of the reaction cnt bm was the best catalyst converting about 60 of organic matter after 180 min of reaction previous studies had shown that when carbon nanotube materials were used as ozonation catalysts the larger surface area favours the reaction since there are more available active sites where the reaction can occur and the pollutant can adsorb 19 32 33 thus the ball milling process applied to the cnt was capable of improving the catalytic performance in ozonation reactions because the mechanical treatment promotes changes in the cnt structure breaking the tubes and forming shorter cnts therefore the decrease in the nanotubes entanglement and the break of the tubes allowed to increase the specific surface area creating more active sites for reaction with organic molecules 32 33 previous studies have reported that the introduction of nitrogen on the surface of carbon materials might enhance the catalytic activity of the material 22 however in this particular case the n doped sample did not show the best catalytic activity presenting an organic matter mineralization degree of about 40 this result may be associated with the decrease of surface area in comparison with non doped milled samples due to the introduction of nitrogen on cnt additionally previous studies verified that the effect of n doping is more evident when the reactions were carried out at high temperature and pressure than at ambient temperature and pressure as reported in this work 32 fig 4 a presents the evolution of inorganic compounds concentration during single and catalytic ozonation experiments single ozonation leads to a higher formation of inorganic charge the concentration of nitrates in solution being the most preponderant value 30 mg l nitrate concentration is higher in the presence of milled samples than in the presence of original cnt but no significant differences were observed after 180 min of reaction decreasing the concentration of nitrate in approximately 5 ammonia and nitrite concentration remained low maximum of 0 2 mg l and relatively constant over reaction time an exception was observed in the nitrite concentration during catalytic ozonation in the presence of cnt bm that presented approximately 0 4 mg l along reaction time it is clear from the results displayed that ozonation process leads to a preferential formation of no3 from the balance present in fig 4 b it is possible to observe that the inorganic nitrogen quantified during single and catalytic reactions does not correspond to the total amount of n present in the organic molecule which means that some of the intermediate compounds formed during the oxidative process will have n species in their constitution the final ph values of all after reaction solutions for single and catalytic ozonation reactions were monitored and the recorded values were very similar for all the tests phfinal 3 2 as it is already known single ozonation process usually leads to the formation of saturated compounds such as aldehydes ketones and carboxylic acids this type of by products has low reactivity towards o3 alone so they tend to accumulate in water being the main reason for the decrease of ph after reaction with o3 15 36 this decrease in the ph value in solution after ozonation process proves that in fact some intermediate compounds formed after reaction contribute to the decrease of ph for more acidic values the formation of oxamic and oxalic acids during experiments was monitored and they were not detected in solution under the tested conditions suggesting that species were not released or their concentrations are below the detection limit of the equipment other species with acidic character were formed but they were not detected with the analytical methods available 3 3 cyclic tests cyclic experiments were carried out in the presence of cnt bm to ascertain its durability as well as to find out if the catalyst loses efficiency with successive utilizations five reuse cycles were performed and after each run the catalyst was recovered dried in an oven overnight and used again fig 5 features the results obtained for the cyclic experiments in terms of 4 nba concentration toc removal and inorganic species formed after 180 min of reaction during the several reuses the catalyst presents a slight loss of efficiency that affects the results related to 4 nba removal and organic matter mineralization degree in the case of the parent pollutant removal the catalyst experienced only a loss of about 9 from the first to the fifth utilization however the most significant decrease is registered from the third to the fourth cycle and after that the values of 4 nba removal stabilized regarding the organic matter mineralization degree this loss is a little more evident corresponding to a decrease of approximately 15 from the first to the fifth cycle however the most significant decrease in the efficiency values occurred from the first to the second run and after that the toc removal profiles are very similar these results may suggest that after the second use the catalyst does not suffer any more significant changes that will influence the reaction efficiency inorganic species concentration obtained at the end of each cycle shows a tendency to form higher concentrations of no3 and nh4 species with the increase of reuses of the catalyst the amount of no3 increased along with the cyclic runs and over time observing an increase from 20 ppm in the first run to 30 ppm in the fifth run after 180 min of reaction the range of no2 concentration remained very low however at the end of the fifth run nh4 concentration slightly increase in the case of no2 species they were formed during all first run and only at the beginning of the second cycle and no formation was verified in the fifth cycle the catalysts used in cyclic tests were recovered and characterized to evaluate the effect of ozonation in their properties and understand the associated causes of the eventual deactivation tpd and n2 adsorption isotherms analysis were carried out and the results are shown in table 2 and fig 6 in terms of specific surface area the values obtained for the reused catalyst did not show significant changes the slight decrease regarding specific surface area values was registered after the first cycle and no significant differences were registered for the remaining reutilizations these results suggested that o3 has almost no effect in the surface area of the tested catalyst showing no significant changes in the sbet of fresh and used samples however through tpd results it is possible to verify that ozonation process is responsible for chemical modifications on the catalyst surface fig 6 shows that both co2 and co signals increase for the catalysts that were successively reused in co2 spectra fig 6 a it is possible to observe a signal increase for temperatures around 300 c which are associated with carboxylic acids released from the surface of the catalyst 20 the co and co2 values presented in table 2 indicate a noticeable difference between the fresh catalyst surface and the reused ones the signals with increasing intensity displayed for the reused catalysts prove that their surface is in fact oxidized by the dissolved ozone but not to a great extent since the increase is not that significant when compared with the results obtained for the fresh cnt bm catalyst 19 the most evident signal increase is observed after the first use 1st cycle of the material tending to stabilize for the catalysts successively reused without presenting major differences among them which suggests that oxidation of the catalyst surface tends to saturation after successive reuses these results are important in order to understand the loss of efficiency observed in the experiments previously presented it is known that for catalytic oxidation processes in the presence of carbon nanotubes the presence of acidic groups such as carboxylic acids on the surface of the catalyst strongly decrease the performance of the catalyst due to the negative influence of oxygen containing groups in ozone decomposition 19 during successive reutilizations of the catalyst in ozonation these type of groups tend to accumulate on catalysts surface leading to a loss of efficiency associated with the presence of these species gonçalves et al 19 also reported that the catalyst tends to lose efficiency in the catalytic processes when its surface is oxidized due to successive reuse of the catalyst the decrease on the activity efficiency is assigned to the introduction of oxygenated electron withdrawing groups that are responsible for the reduction of electron density on the carbon surface leading to a decrease of the catalytic activity of the material for ozone decomposition and the ability to form hydroxyl radicals 23 3 4 study of the reaction mechanism to study the degradation reaction mechanism of 4 nba adsorption tests with cnt bm catalyst under o2 gas stream and radical scavenger experiments single and catalytic ozonation in the presence of cnt bm using tert butanol were performed the results obtained for adsorption experiments fig 7 showed that about 50 of 4 nba is adsorbed on the catalyst within the initial 2 min of reaction this result suggests that adsorption is an important step in the mechanism of 4 nba removal during catalytic ozonation contributing to the removal of the pollutant from the solution these results prove and reinforce the results obtained for the different catalysts tested as previously shown the most promising catalyst for 4 nba removal is the milled carbon nanotubes that present the highest bet surface area and pore volume these properties greatly contribute to the adsorption process since there is more available superficial area however the extension of adsorption depends on the shape of the organic molecule 19 33 37 also it is possible to see from the obtained results that 4 nba adsorption occurs very quickly during the first minutes of reaction adsorption experiments carried out with cnt and cnt m bm 4 h results not shown revealed that the contribution of this mechanism for the pollutant removal is of about 50 as it was reported for cnt bm sample previous experiments related to the application of carbon nanotubes as ozonation catalysts for the removal of bezafibrate and sulfamethoxazole reported a contribution of adsorption around 60 and 30 respectively 23 38 as verified in this work gonçalves et al 23 reported that generally adsorption on cnt is faster in the first minutes of reaction due to the lower mass transfer limitations in the mesoporous structure of the material additional characterizations were carried out to the sample recovered from this experiment to evaluate the effect of adsorption in the catalyst properties the bet surface area decreased from 249 to 163 m2 g revealing a significant decrease when compared with the superficial surface area value of the fresh catalyst radical scavenger experiments were performed to analyze the contribution of oh radicals during 4 nba degradation ozone decomposition chain can be interrupted when hydroxyl radical reacts with inhibitors radical scavengers that are capable of consuming these radicals 7 tert butanol is a strong radical scavenger that reacts rapidly with hydroxyl radicals and slowly with ozone 39 40 the results from radical scavenger experiments present in fig 7 shows that for single ozonation the presence of tert butanol leads to a decrease of the pollutant removal rate and total degradation was not verified showing a 4 nba conversion of 60 after 180 min of reaction this result suggested that the mechanism of pollutant degradation by single ozonation comprises a oh radical pathway in the case of catalytic ozonation the influence of oh radicals during 4 nba degradation was not so evident observing only a slight decrease in the first 30 min of the reaction and after that no differences were observed therefore the effect of tert butanol during ozonation of 4 nba is different in the absence and presence of catalyst suggesting that non catalytic and catalytic runs present different reaction mechanism the obtained results allowed to conclude that single ozonation was an efficient alternative to completely degrade 4 nba in solution but the organic matter removal degree was unsatisfactory in the presence of tert butanol a high decrease in pollutant removal rate was observed during single ozonation revealing that oh radicals have a contribution of about 40 for 4 nba degradation when cnt bm catalyst was combined with o3 an increase in the pollutant removal rate and an improvement in mineralization degree were attained no significant importance of oh radicals in solution was observed during catalytic ozonation in the presence of cnt bm but adsorption and reactions on catalyst surface seem to play a key role during 4 nba degradation thus although catalyst presence is important as it has a major contribution to organic molecule adsorption at the beginning of reaction ozonation process is necessary in order to fully degrade the main pollutant 4 conclusions single and catalytic ozonation processes were studied during 4 nba removal in a semi batch reactor carbon nanotubes with different chemical and textural properties were used as ozonation catalysts the modifications performed on the original material through ball milling allowed to synthesize materials with a higher specific surface area and to easily incorporate nitrogen heteroatoms in the cnt structure cnt m bm 4 h single ozonation was able to completely remove the pollutant after 180 min of reaction however the total mineralization degree was not achieved when a catalyst was added 4 nba degradation rate increased and the mineralization degree was improved especially in the first hour of reaction the highest toc removal was verified with ball milled carbon nanotubes cnt bm sample leading to a mineralization degree of approximately 60 after 180 min of reaction cyclic tests showed a slight loss of efficiency after the first run nearly 15 in terms of toc mineralization however with successive reutilizations concentration and toc removal did not significantly change the catalyst cnt m bm 4 h was active for 4 nba degradation however its activity turned out to be very similar to that recorded with the original material not showing great improvements in the mineralization degree of organic matter present in solution the experiments carried out in the presence of radical scavenger suggested that 4 nba degradation by catalytic ozonation is little affected by hydroxyl radicals on the other hand degradation of 4 nba by single ozonation is influenced by the presence of hydroxyl radicals in the solution declaration of competing interest we wish to confirm

involves the use of considerable quantities of water and chemicals which are only partially absorbed in the hide skin resulting in effluent containing a complex mix of pollutants which is difficult to treat in general composite tannery wastewater is characterized by high load of organic matter dissolved and suspended solids organic nitrogen and ammonia originating from the hides skins as well as from the added leather processing chemicals in addition it shows high concentration of sulfide sulfate chloride and chromium 1 due to the complex nature of tannery effluent the general treatment scheme used is primary physico chemical treatment to remove suspended and colloidal solids and subsequently by biological treatment to remove soluble organics and nutrient 2 the current biological treatment of tannery wastewater is being carried out using continuous activated sludge system 3 for the removal of nitrogen along with organic carbon the design and operation of the activated sludge system becomes more complex expensive and process required large reactor volumes sludge bulking issues and are susceptible to shock loadings 4 the other alternative attached growth biological system generally faces blockage mass transfer limitation and scale formation on the media especially due to the presence of hardness in tannery wastewater 5 as the discharge limits imposed by regulators are becoming more stringent a more flexible and less costly treatment option is required in order to overcome these problems sequencing batch reactor system with aerobic granular sludge is an alternative process 3 6 though much progress has been done in the conventional activated sludge process and sequential batch systems in tannery wastewater information on the granulation of flocculent sludge using tannery wastewater is very limited transition from flocculent to granular wastewater treatment is currently more attractive due to the excellent physical properties and removal efficiencies of the system aerobic granules are formed by self immobilization of microbial aggregates and have a strong and compact structure excellent settleability and biomass retention 7 since the discovery of the aerobic granular sludge extensive investigations have been carried out to understand the mechanism of aerobic granulation and effect of different operational parameters such as hydrodynamic shear

such as volume exchange ratio settling time and hydrodynamic shear force affects the granules formation 16 the effect of settling time 17 or hydrodynamic shear force 8 were investigated focusing mainly on the process performance physical and chemical properties of the granules studies also indicated that these parameters could affect the bacteria community in the system 9 it is reported that the aerobic granules has been effective for the organic removal and nutrients from domestic industrial and toxic effluents with high loading rates 18 however low nutrient removal efficiency is reported during the initial period of start up mainly as a result of the harsh wash out condition 19 operation at low sludge retention time srt also resulted in wash out of excessive biomass a condition unfavorable for slow growing ammonia and nitrite oxidizing bacteria aob and nob which subsequently resulted in reduced nitrogen removal efficiency modeling and experimental studies have shown that stepwise decline of settling time is a suitable method for improving biomass release during initial starting period 20 21 however only a few research papers have experimentally demonstrated the effect on granulation and nitrogen removal efficiency therefore in this particular paper the effect of stepwise reduction of settling time on granule formation and nitrogen removal from synthetic tannery wastewater has been investigated 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental set up and operating conditions laboratory scale sequential batch airlift reactor sbar as shown in fig 1 was used for

sludge samples were also sieved using 0 212 mm sieve and the mlss and the mass retained on the sieve was measured to estimate the percentage of granules from the total sludge biomass with diameter greater than 0 212 mm was considered to be granular 26 the morphology of granular sludge was analyzed by a light microscope olympus ch20i the microstructure of the granules was visualized by scanning electron microscopy jeol 1300 lv sem before sample observation the granules sample was taken from the reactor and mildly washed using phosphate buffer the washed granules were settled and treated with a series of fixation and dehydration processes 4 paraformaldehyde for fixing the sample 40 60 80 and 100 ethanol for dehydration the dehydrated granule sample was further dried using freeze dryer then the sample was ready for observation in sem 24 the biomass density biomass concentration in the granules was measured by first taking 100 ml of granules samples and filtering it using 45 μm filter the filtered granules were then added into 20 ml of demineralized water to estimate the granules volume by volumetric displacement method the dry weight of the granules samples was estimated by oven drying for24 h at 105 c based on the volume and dry weight of the granule the density of biomass was then estimated 27 the settling velocity of the granules was analyzed by monitoring the time consumed for an individual granule to settle in a 40 cm long cylinder the settling velocity of the granules could then be calculated by dividing the length of the cylinder by the time taken by the granule to reach the bottom of the cylinder the relationship between cod degradation and eps formation with respect to time was analyzed for one complete cycle time samples were withdrawn from the

the number of cycles essential for the fluorescent signals to cross the threshold level called the ct cycle threshold level the ct levels in the sample is inversely proportional to the targeted nucleic acid i e higher ct values indicate lower quantity of targeted nucleic acid and vice versa 3 results and discussion 3 1 granule formation the reactor operating conditions were maintained as described in table 1 the reactor was operated to study the granule formation and performance using synthetic tannery wastewater the parameter selected for applying pressure for granulation process was stepwise reduction of the settling time fig 2 a describes the operating days versus the operated settling time in the reactor and the figure also clearly shows the stepwise declining of settling time from 30 min to 3 min the reactor sludge was initially flocculent which showed excellent removal for organic carbon and nitrogen the granulation strategy followed was to maintain the simultaneous removal of organic carbon and nitrogen by preventing the excessive washout of slow growing nitrifiers from the system and improve the biomass density and settleability of the sludge the transition from flocculent to granular sludge was achieved in a few days maintaining the required hydrodynamic pressure needed to form granules the granule formation was monitored by visual observation light microscopy and measurement of the svi and settling velocity of the sludge granules at different operating days the results clearly showed that the formation of aerobic granules was achieved with size in the range of 1 8 3 2 mm at svi of 16 20 ml g granular biomass concentration of 6 1 g l and settling velocity in the range of 30 40 m h without affecting the nitrification efficiency the performance of the reactor in terms of cod and nitrogen removal was monitored and the results demonstrated that the selected parameter for applying pressure has resulted in formation of granules without affecting the removal efficiency of the system to prevent severe washout and at the same time to induce granulation an optimized strategy was followed by controlling the biomass discharge ratio and reducing the settling time to a lower value until the end of the experiment the biomass loss during the first 30 days of operation was not significant indicating that the seed biomass had a good settling property the average suspended solids concentration in the effluent during this period was only 0 102 g l fig 2 b after the 30th day the settling time was further reduced sequentially from 10 min down to 5 min until the 40th day where there was significant biomass loss fig 2 b the tss in the effluent increased and reached to 1 024 g l on the 33rd day at the end of the 40th day it was observed that the mlss has further increased to 8853 mg l the settling time was then further reduced to 3 min at the 60th day and maintained until the end of the experiment however the mlss was not much affected and the biomass in the reactor was increased to 10 571 mg l and showed excellent settling property until the end of the experiment the average tss in the effluent after the settling time was decreased to 3 min was only 0 025 g l signifying a higher quality effluent compared to that with flocculent sludge the svi profile fig 3 b also showed that it is significantly reduced from the start of the experiment and reached 16 ml g tss at the end of the experiment in the meantime the mlss increased after the 40th day and reached a maximum of 12 918 mg l on 49th day and thereafter it was maintained in the same range till the end of 95th day the svi result indicated the formation of granules as the value kept on decreasing as the mlss was increasing granulation was happening without severe washout the tss of treated effluent was seen increasing between the 30th and 40th day and it was found to be at a minimum during the remaining experimental periods fig 2 b the sludge discharge ratio during the startup of the granulation process was in the range 0 01 0 05 which is in agreement with the reported result of the modeling and simulation study 20 morphological changes of the sludge and the formation of granules were observed by light microscopy and sem at different operating days of the reactor fig 3 granules were observed at the 10th day of the experiment when the settling time was reduced to 10 min are shown in fig 3 b and fig 3 f additional sampling were carried out on 30th and 90th day of the experiment to study the morphology changes and the images taken at different periods of experiments are shown in fig 3 c fig 3 d fig 3 e and fig 3 g respectively the image showed more dominant granules on the 30th day than the 10th day and granules dominance increase even more on the 90th day the images clearly showed the changes as a result of the applied pressure on the appearance and maturation of granules the results indicated that the strategy followed helped to achieve granules formation from flocculent sludge without seriously affecting the removal efficiency previous works have been dealing with granulation with constant low settling time from the start of the process and this resulted in significant loss of biomass from the reactor recent studies suggested gradually decreasing the settling time to prevent severe washout of biomass during the startup of the granulation process modeling studies suggested an optimized strategy for controlling severe washout of biomass and yet helping granule formation by controlling the biomass discharge rate from the reactor 20 earlier investigation reported that gradually decreasing the settling time over a long time 95 days to reach 5 min helped to improve the settling property of the sludge but failed to form granules 32 however in this study the gradual decrease to 5 min settling time was achieved in 40 days and the granules formed had a settling velocity comparable to reported results in another study the settling time was reduced gradually and resulted in formation of granules and also demonstrated the rate of gradual decline in settling time intensely affects the nitrifiers community 21 therefore reduction in settling time should be optimum to prevent severe washout and at the same time help the granule formation 3 2 biomass yield compared to activated sludge system aerobic granular sludge system are characterized with low biomass sludge production rate the low sludge production rate are the result of relatively high sludge age achieved by aerobic granular biomass 31 the sbar reactor was completely granular after the 60th day and the aerobic granular sludge reached steady state steady state was maintained at 20 days srt the corresponding observed specific biomass growth rate μ obs d 1 the observed biomass yield yobs observed substrate utilization rate of stable granules were calculated and found to be 0 05 d 0 017 mg vss mg cod 0 335 mg cod mg vss d respectively the theoretical yield y and the specific biomass decay rate values were calculated and found to be 0 145 mg vss mg cod 0 05 d the theoretical yield is much higher than the observed yield which clearly indicate that the experimental granular sludge system produce significantly less sludge 3 2 cod removal performance the cod profile for initial mixed liquor and effluent samples are shown in fig 2 c about 70 of the cod was removed during the initial 30 min of aeration the calculated cod removal efficiency the percentage difference between inlet and outlet cod concentrations was very high from the start of the study 98 and the removal efficiency was not significantly affected by the gradual decrease in settling time until the 20th day after the 20th day the settling time was kept at 10 min until the 30th day which resulted in slight reduction of cod removal to 86 on the 23rd day after the 23rd day the cod removal efficiency was restored back to a very high level 97 and maintained until the end of the study the reason for the very high cod removal efficiency even at the steepest and lowest settling time was due to the higher hrt maintained and the improvement of the cod removal efficiency of the sludge biomass due to aggregation and increase in density between the 30th and 40th day the settling time was brought down to 5 min and as a result there was a significant loss in biomass as shown in fig 2 b the overall average cod removal efficiency was 97 6 1 9 which resulted in the effluent cod value in the range of 32 128 mg l 3 3 nitrogen removal performance it has been well reported that nh4 n is mainly removed by assimilation in cells and by autotrophic nitrification nitrification resulted in conversion of ammonium to nitrite and nitrate which are the result of the activity of aob and nob bacteria involved in the process compared to the cod removal efficiency the ammonium removal efficiency was significantly affected due to the reduction in settling time but the stepwise reduction helped to retain the efficiency at some particular days like the 14th 20th 31st 38th 42nd 69th and 70th day the removal was affected as seen from fig 2 c however the calculated nh4 n removal efficiency the percentage difference between inlet and out let nh4 n concentrations reduction was not severe and it was easily recovered nitrification was observed throughout the operating days and as a result nitrate and nitrite was found in the treated effluent fig 2 d the reactor showed an average nh4 n removal efficiency of 87 1 1 2 resulting in effluent having an average nh4 n no3 n and no2 n concentrations of 20 2 22 7 1 4 and 9 7 1 5 mg l respectively sunsequent to the reduction of settling time to 3 min on 60th day the ammonium removal was improved and the reactor showed stable removal efficiency until the end of the experiment table s4 shows the comparison between the overall average ammonium removal and the average after the 60th day the nitrogen species profile can also be correlated with the activity of aob and nob the result showed that both bacteria were actively working but during the time where the settling time was sharply reduced the 30th 40th day the nob activity was reduced due to biomass washout and the effluent showed more of no2 n than no3 n fig 2 d ammonium and nitrate removals showed a linear correlation while nitrite showed parabolic correlation fig 2 e from the fig 2 e it is observed that the nox profile for both no2 n and no3 n showed declining to zero value during the first 2 h of the reactor operation at the same time the nh4 n profile showed declining trend this phenomena indicated that there is nh4 n conversion during this time and in parallel nox species removal also observed the do level during this time was in the range 0 1 0 2 mg l which is more suitable for denitrification and annamox process therefore the simultaneous decline in the nh4 n and nox species is an indication that there is simultaneous nitrification and denitrification during this time of the reactor operation accumulation of nox n started after 2 h when the cod got reduced the no2 n removal picked up after an additional 3 h and declined during the next 3 h of operation whereas no3 n curve showed a linear increase until the end of the cycle time the total nitrogen removal was determined based on the initial total nitrogen tin and the effluent total nitrogen ten which was found to be 74 4 11 7 fig 2 f the total nitrogen removal was even higher when the settling time was decreased to 3 min after the 60th day table s4 in addition to the above observations eps production has also been estimated in the current study as it had significant role on the physiochemical properties of the microbial consortia to form aggregates which includes surface charge ie ionic properties flocculation settling and adsorption ability 33 though there are different schools of thought reported in literature regarding the eps role in granule formation 34 it is evidently tacit that granule formation and its stability is predominantly due to the properties of eps in which hydrophobicity and adhesive tendency plays a major role in aggregating cells together 35 36 the cyclic sbar operation creates feast and famine periods which favours the secretion of eps from the bacteria cells during famine period 37 the hydrodynamic shear force created in the sbar due to mixing could also contribute for the formation of eps 8 eps formation along with the stepwise washout of poorly settling biomass from the reactor could be the main reason for the formation of granules in the sbar table s5 shows the cod degradation and eps over the course of cycle time in sbar the result clearly shows that about 70 of the cod is utilized during the first 2 h and the eps starts to increase after 4 h when the microorganisms get starved due to depletion of available organic matter in the reactor as it was reported that eps can also serve as carbon source for energy production during the time of starvation of nutrient depletion 38 during the treatment period eps production was mainly due to the cell lysis and secretions released by the bacteria it was primarily composed of carbohydrates and proteins whereas humic substances are also one of the key component when biological wastewater treatment reactors are concerned because the components of eps mostly depend on the sludge origins and extraction methods 39 40 33 in the present study the observed levels of carbohydrate content in the range of 50 77 mg l and protein content in the range of 54 110 mg l is comparable with the results reported wherein protein content in the granular sludge is higher when compared to other components of eps and polysaccharide content is comparatively lower 41 above condition was due to the enzymatic activities in the reactor for digestion of the macro molecules where nutrient assimilation takes place 42 also studies reported that sludge which has better settling ability possess tightly bound eps and plays crucial role in the structural stability of aerobic granule 43 which is reflected in the current study with reduction in the settling time from 30 min to 3 min this eps makes the aerobic granular sludge with dense and strong microbial consortium and researcher reported that this aerobic granular sludge is suitable for treating the wastewater with high strength of organic load due the higher biomass retention 44 this could also be correlated with the current study where the high organic cod loading rate of 6 5 kg m3 was treated in sbar 3 5 polymerized chain reaction pcr study this study established the presence of selected bacteria genes involved in the nitrogen cycle during the enhanced nitrogen removal period of the sbar operated at stable performance at the end of the experiment the result of the pcr study after running the gel confirmed the existence of selected genes involved in the nitrogen cycle as shown in fig 4 out of the six different genes selected for testing three were present aob amoa nirk and pla46 amx820 and three were absent aoa amoa nirs and nosz and the details are shown in table 2 the results confirmed the presence of pla46 amx820 gene where a clear band was seen at 820bp the presence of the gene pla46 amx820 which is related to anammox species is an indication that under the operated process condition anammox bacteria existed in the reactor the gel picture fig 4 also confirmed the presence of aob amoa gene with a very clear band at 491bp the aob amoa gene was found alongside a gene responsible in denitrification nirk at 473bp 3 4 gene expression study this study was conducted for selected genes aob amoa and pla46 amx820 which play a major role in the rate limiting step of nitrogen removal 45 the targeted gene expression levels were normalized to the level of housekeeping gene 16 s gene as internal control the ct values of the test samples were calculated and the data was expressed in terms of fold change over control sample the normalized expression level of amoa in the control and sbr was 0 01343 and 0 12892 respectively with a p value 0 05 similarly normalized expression level of pla46 amx820 in the control and sbr was 0 00529 and 0 05830 respectively with a p value 0 05 which is clearly indicated in table 3 the results revealed that the test samples from the reactor showed upregulation of amoa gene by 9 6 folds and pla46 amx820 gene by 11 06 over control sample respectively table 3 the upregulation of targeted gene amoa and pla46 amx820 indicates the increase in population of ammonia oxidizers and anammox bacteria in the sbr during the treatment of synthetic tannery wastewater the result of the ct value ct 29 indicates a strong positive reaction suggesting abundant nucleic acid in the sample 46 4 conclusion the present experimental study confirmed that reducing the settling time sequentially resulted in formation of aerobic granules with excellent settling properties without severely affecting the performance of the reactor it was concluded that complete granulation was obtained at the end of 60th day when the settling time was reduced to 3 min without affecting the nitrification efficiency the observed characteristics of formed aerobic granules showed size svi and settling velocity in the range of 1 8 3 2 mm 16 20 ml g settling velocity of 30 40 m h and biomass density of 6 1 g l respectively from the study it was also concluded that the overall average cod removal efficiency of 97 6 1 9 and the effluent cod value in the range of 32 128 mg l could be achieved in sbar further an average nh4 n removal efficiency of 87 1 1 2 and effluent with average nh4 n no3 n and no2 n concentrations of 20 2 22 7 1 4 and 9 7 1 5 mg l respectively could be obtained the strategy followed also confirmed the retention of slow growing bacteria such as ammonia oxidizers and anammox bacteria in the reactor

involves the use of considerable quantities of water and chemicals which are only partially absorbed in the hide skin resulting in effluent containing a complex mix of pollutants which is difficult to treat in general composite tannery wastewater is characterized by high load of organic matter dissolved and suspended solids organic nitrogen and ammonia originating from the hides skins as well as from the added leather processing chemicals in addition it shows high concentration of sulfide sulfate chloride and chromium 1 due to the complex nature of tannery effluent the general treatment scheme used is primary physico chemical treatment to remove suspended and colloidal solids and subsequently by biological treatment to remove soluble organics and nutrient 2 the current biological treatment of tannery wastewater is being carried out using continuous activated sludge system 3 for the removal of nitrogen along with organic carbon the design and operation of the activated sludge system becomes more complex expensive and process required large reactor volumes sludge bulking issues and are susceptible to shock loadings 4 the other alternative attached growth biological system generally faces blockage mass transfer limitation and scale formation on the media especially due to the presence of hardness in tannery wastewater 5 as the discharge limits imposed by regulators are becoming more stringent a more flexible and less costly treatment option is required in order to overcome these problems sequencing batch reactor system with aerobic granular sludge is an alternative process 3 6 though much progress has been done in the conventional activated sludge process and sequential batch systems in tannery wastewater information on the granulation of flocculent sludge using tannery wastewater is very limited transition from flocculent to granular wastewater treatment is currently more attractive due to the excellent physical properties and removal efficiencies of the system aerobic granules are formed by self immobilization of microbial aggregates and have a strong and compact structure excellent settleability and biomass retention 7 since the discovery of the aerobic granular sludge extensive investigations have been carried out to understand the mechanism of aerobic granulation and effect of different operational parameters such as hydrodynamic shear force 8 settling time 9 organic loading rate 10 hydraulic retention time 11 type of substrate used 12 feast to famine ratio 13 and addition of metal ion mg2 ca2 to enhance granule formation 14 a study also demonstrated the effect of seven operational parameters ph temperature settling time airflow velocity allylthiourea aeration strategy and contaminant load for an optimized start up strategy 15 in the past 20 years of investigations on granulation yet the knowledge is incomplete to explain the phenomenon 16 recent concepts on granulation suggested that the most important operational parameters such as volume exchange ratio settling time and hydrodynamic shear force affects the granules formation 16 the effect of settling time 17 or hydrodynamic shear force 8 were investigated focusing mainly on the process performance physical and chemical properties of the granules studies also indicated that these parameters could affect the bacteria community in the system 9 it is reported that the aerobic granules has been effective for the organic removal and nutrients from domestic industrial and toxic effluents with high loading rates 18 however low nutrient removal efficiency is reported during the initial period of start up mainly as a result of the harsh wash out condition 19 operation at low sludge retention time srt also resulted in wash out of excessive biomass a condition unfavorable for slow growing ammonia and nitrite oxidizing bacteria aob and nob which subsequently resulted in reduced nitrogen removal efficiency modeling and experimental studies have shown that stepwise decline of settling time is a suitable method for improving biomass release during initial starting period 20 21 however only a few research papers have experimentally demonstrated the effect on granulation and nitrogen removal efficiency therefore in this particular paper the effect of stepwise reduction of settling time on granule formation and nitrogen removal from synthetic tannery wastewater has been investigated 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental set up and operating conditions laboratory scale sequential batch airlift reactor sbar as shown in fig 1 was used for the study the reactor was constructed using plexiglass of working volume 5 l diameter 10 cm total height 80 cm effective height 64 cm a head space 16 cm and central draft tube having a depth of 60 5 cm air was supplied at a flowrate of 3 5 l min from the blower 6 controlled by airflow controller 12 the blower was connected to the draft tube in the reactor through plastic pipe the draft tube was made of steel and had perforated openings at the bottom of the reactor where the compressed air was released to aerate and mix the reactor mixture the reactor was equipped with wastewater collection tank 1 influent peristaltic pump 2 alkali feed pump 3 acid feed pump 4 ph do and temperature sensors 5 air blower 6 central draft tube 7 solenoid valve 8 effluent collection tank 9 and drainage port 10 the operation of the reactor was controlled by plc controller 11 the controller was linked with input measurements from ph do and temperature sensors and timer the reactor operating conditions are summarized in table 1 the reactor was operated to start up the granular sludge system by feeding synthetic tannery wastewater and an evaluation of the granulation and reactor performance during the

sludge samples were also sieved using 0 212 mm sieve and the mlss and the mass retained on the sieve was measured to estimate the percentage of granules from the total sludge biomass with diameter greater than 0 212 mm was considered to be granular 26 the morphology of granular sludge was analyzed by a light microscope olympus ch20i the microstructure of the granules was visualized by scanning electron microscopy jeol 1300 lv sem before sample observation the granules sample was taken from the reactor and mildly washed using phosphate buffer the washed granules were settled and treated with a series of fixation and dehydration processes 4 paraformaldehyde for fixing the sample 40 60 80 and 100 ethanol for dehydration the dehydrated granule sample was further dried using freeze dryer then the sample was ready for observation in sem 24 the biomass density biomass concentration in the granules was measured by first taking 100 ml of granules samples and filtering it using 45 μm filter the filtered granules were then added into 20 ml of demineralized water to estimate the granules volume by volumetric displacement method the dry weight of the granules samples was estimated by oven drying for24 h at 105 c based on the volume and dry weight of the granule the density of biomass was then estimated 27 the settling velocity of the granules was analyzed by monitoring the time consumed for an individual granule to settle in a 40 cm long cylinder the settling velocity of the granules could then be calculated by dividing the length of the cylinder by the time taken by the granule to reach the bottom of the cylinder the relationship between cod degradation and eps formation with respect to time was analyzed for one complete cycle time samples were withdrawn from the

ct values of the test samples were estimated and the data was expressed in terms of fold change over control sample the relative quantification and comparison of targeted gene was made by measuring the number of cycles essential for the fluorescent signals to cross the threshold level called the ct cycle threshold level the ct levels in the sample is inversely proportional to the targeted nucleic acid i e higher ct values indicate lower quantity of targeted nucleic acid and vice versa 3 results and discussion 3 1 granule formation the reactor operating conditions were maintained as described in table 1 the reactor was operated to study the granule formation and performance using synthetic tannery wastewater the parameter selected for applying pressure for granulation process was stepwise reduction of the settling time fig 2 a describes the operating days versus the operated settling time in the reactor and the figure also clearly shows the stepwise declining of settling time from 30 min to 3 min the reactor sludge was initially flocculent which showed excellent removal for organic carbon and nitrogen the granulation strategy followed was to maintain the simultaneous removal of organic carbon and nitrogen by preventing the excessive washout of slow growing nitrifiers from the system and improve the biomass density and settleability of the sludge the transition from flocculent to granular sludge was achieved in a few days maintaining the required hydrodynamic pressure needed to form granules the granule formation was monitored by visual observation light microscopy and measurement of the svi and settling velocity of the sludge granules at different operating days the results clearly showed that the formation of aerobic granules was achieved with size in the range of 1 8 3 2 mm at svi of 16 20 ml g granular biomass concentration of 6 1 g l and settling velocity in the range of 30 40 m h without affecting the nitrification efficiency the performance of the reactor in terms of cod and nitrogen removal was monitored and the results demonstrated that the selected parameter for applying pressure has resulted in formation of granules without affecting the removal efficiency of the system to prevent severe washout and at the same time to induce granulation an optimized strategy was followed by controlling the biomass discharge ratio and reducing the settling time to a lower value until the end of the experiment the biomass loss during the first 30 days of operation was not significant indicating that the seed biomass had a good settling property the average suspended solids concentration in the effluent during this period was only 0 102 g l fig 2 b after the 30th day the settling time was further reduced sequentially from 10 min down to 5 min until the 40th day where there was significant biomass loss fig 2 b the tss in the effluent increased and reached to 1 024 g l on the 33rd day at the end of the 40th day it was observed that the mlss has further increased to 8853 mg l the settling time was then further reduced to 3 min at the 60th day and maintained until the end of the experiment however the mlss was not much affected and the biomass in the reactor was increased to 10 571 mg l and showed excellent settling property until the end of the experiment the average tss in the effluent after the settling time was decreased to 3 min was only 0 025 g l signifying a higher quality effluent compared to that with flocculent sludge the svi profile fig 3 b also showed that it is significantly reduced from the start of the experiment and reached 16 ml g tss at the end of the experiment in the meantime the mlss increased after the 40th day and reached a maximum of 12 918 mg l on 49th day and thereafter it was maintained in the same range till the end of 95th day the svi result indicated the formation of granules as the value kept on decreasing as the mlss was increasing granulation was happening without severe washout the tss of treated effluent was seen increasing between the 30th and 40th day and it was found to be at a minimum during the remaining experimental periods fig 2 b the sludge discharge ratio during the startup of the granulation process was in the range 0 01 0 05 which is in agreement with the reported result of the modeling and simulation study 20 morphological changes of the sludge and the formation of granules were observed by light microscopy and sem at different operating days of the reactor fig 3 granules were observed at the 10th day of the experiment when the settling time was reduced to 10 min are shown in fig 3 b and fig 3 f additional sampling were carried out on 30th and 90th day of the experiment to study the morphology changes and the images taken at different periods of experiments are shown in fig 3 c fig 3 d fig 3 e and fig 3 g respectively the image showed more dominant granules on the 30th day than the 10th day and granules dominance increase even more on the 90th day the images clearly showed the changes as a result of the applied pressure on the appearance and maturation of granules the results indicated that the strategy followed helped to achieve granules formation from flocculent sludge without seriously affecting the removal efficiency previous works have been dealing with granulation with constant low settling time from the start of the process and this resulted in significant loss of biomass from the reactor recent studies suggested gradually decreasing the settling time to prevent severe washout of biomass during the startup of the granulation process modeling studies suggested an optimized strategy for controlling severe washout of biomass and yet helping granule formation by controlling the biomass discharge rate from the reactor 20 earlier investigation reported that gradually decreasing the settling time over a long time 95 days to reach 5 min helped to improve the settling property of the sludge but failed to form granules 32 however in this study the gradual decrease to 5 min settling time was achieved in 40 days and the granules formed had a settling velocity comparable to reported results in another study the settling time was reduced gradually and resulted in formation of granules and also demonstrated the rate of gradual decline in settling time intensely affects the nitrifiers community 21 therefore reduction in settling time should be optimum to prevent severe washout and at the same time help the granule formation 3 2 biomass yield compared to activated sludge system aerobic granular sludge system are characterized with low biomass sludge production rate the low sludge production rate are the result of relatively high sludge age achieved by aerobic granular biomass 31 the sbar reactor was completely granular after the 60th day and the aerobic granular sludge reached steady state steady state was maintained at 20 days srt the corresponding observed specific biomass growth rate μ obs d 1 the observed biomass yield yobs observed substrate utilization rate of stable granules were calculated and found to be 0 05 d 0 017 mg vss mg cod 0 335 mg cod mg vss d respectively the theoretical yield y and the specific biomass decay rate values were calculated and found to be 0 145 mg vss mg cod 0 05 d the theoretical yield is much higher than the observed yield which clearly indicate that the experimental granular sludge system produce significantly less sludge 3 2 cod removal performance the cod profile for initial mixed liquor and effluent samples are shown in fig 2 c about 70 of the cod was removed during the initial 30 min of aeration the calculated cod removal efficiency the percentage difference between inlet and outlet cod concentrations was very high from the start of the study 98 and the removal efficiency was not significantly affected by the gradual decrease in settling time until the 20th day after the 20th day the settling time was kept at 10 min until the 30th day which resulted in slight reduction of cod removal to 86 on the 23rd day after the 23rd day the cod removal efficiency was restored back to a very high level 97 and maintained until the end of the study the reason for the very high cod removal efficiency even at the steepest and lowest settling time was due to the higher hrt maintained and the improvement of the cod removal efficiency of the sludge biomass due to aggregation and increase in density between the 30th and 40th day the settling time was brought down to 5 min and as a result there was a significant loss in biomass as shown in fig 2 b the overall average cod removal efficiency was 97 6 1 9 which resulted in the effluent cod value in the range of 32 128 mg l 3 3 nitrogen removal performance it has been well reported that nh4 n is mainly removed by assimilation in cells and by autotrophic nitrification nitrification resulted in conversion of ammonium to nitrite and nitrate which are the result of the activity of aob and nob bacteria involved in the process compared to the cod removal efficiency the ammonium removal efficiency was significantly affected due to the reduction in settling time but the stepwise reduction helped to retain the efficiency at some particular days like the 14th 20th 31st 38th 42nd 69th and 70th day the removal was affected as seen from fig 2 c however the calculated nh4 n removal efficiency the percentage difference between inlet and out let nh4 n concentrations reduction was not severe and it was easily recovered nitrification was observed throughout the operating days and as a result nitrate and nitrite was found in the treated effluent fig 2 d the reactor showed an average nh4 n removal efficiency of 87 1 1 2 resulting in effluent having an average nh4 n no3 n and no2 n concentrations of 20 2 22 7 1 4 and 9 7 1 5 mg l respectively sunsequent to the reduction of settling time to 3 min on 60th day the ammonium removal was improved and the reactor showed stable removal efficiency until the end of the experiment table s4 shows the comparison between the overall average ammonium removal and the average after the 60th day the nitrogen species profile can also be correlated with the activity of aob and nob the result showed that both bacteria were actively working but during the time where the settling time was sharply reduced the 30th 40th day the nob activity was reduced due to biomass washout and the effluent showed more of no2 n than no3 n fig 2 d ammonium and nitrate removals showed a linear correlation while nitrite showed parabolic correlation fig 2 e from the fig 2 e it is observed that the nox profile for both no2 n and no3 n showed declining to zero value during the first 2 h of the reactor operation at the same time the nh4 n profile showed declining trend this phenomena indicated that there is nh4 n conversion during this time and in parallel nox species removal also observed the do level during this time was in the range 0 1 0 2 mg l which is more suitable for denitrification and annamox process therefore the simultaneous decline in the nh4 n and nox species is an indication that there is simultaneous nitrification and denitrification during this time of the reactor operation accumulation of nox n started after 2 h when the cod got reduced the no2 n removal picked up after an additional 3 h and declined during the next 3 h of operation whereas no3 n curve showed a linear increase until the end of the cycle time the total nitrogen removal was determined based on the initial total nitrogen tin and the effluent total nitrogen ten which was found to be 74 4 11 7 fig 2 f the total nitrogen removal was even higher when the settling time was decreased to 3 min after the 60th day table s4 in addition to the above observations eps production has also been estimated in the current study as it had significant role on the physiochemical properties of the microbial consortia to form aggregates which includes surface charge ie ionic properties flocculation settling and adsorption ability 33 though there are different schools of thought reported in literature regarding the eps role in granule formation 34 it is evidently tacit that granule formation and its stability is predominantly due to the properties of eps in which hydrophobicity and adhesive tendency plays a major role in aggregating cells together 35 36 the cyclic sbar operation creates feast and famine periods which favours the secretion of eps from the bacteria cells during famine period 37 the hydrodynamic shear force created in the sbar due to mixing could also contribute for the formation of eps 8 eps formation along with the stepwise washout of poorly settling biomass from the reactor could be the main reason for the formation of granules in the sbar table s5 shows the cod degradation and eps over the course of cycle time in sbar the result clearly shows that about 70 of the cod is utilized during the first 2 h and the eps starts to increase after 4 h when the microorganisms get starved due to depletion of available organic matter in the reactor as it was reported that eps can also serve as carbon source for energy production during the time of starvation of nutrient depletion 38 during the treatment period eps production was mainly due to the cell lysis and secretions released by the bacteria it was primarily composed of carbohydrates and proteins whereas humic substances are also one of the key component when biological wastewater treatment reactors are concerned because the components of eps mostly depend on the sludge origins and extraction methods 39 40 33 in the present study the observed levels of carbohydrate content in the range of 50 77 mg l and protein content in the range of 54 110 mg l is comparable with the results reported wherein protein content in the granular sludge is higher when compared to other components of eps and polysaccharide content is comparatively lower 41 above condition was due to the enzymatic activities in the reactor for digestion of the macro molecules where nutrient assimilation takes place 42 also studies reported that sludge which has better settling ability possess tightly bound eps and plays crucial role in the structural stability of aerobic granule 43 which is reflected in the current study with reduction in the settling time from 30 min to 3 min this eps makes the aerobic granular sludge with dense and strong microbial consortium and researcher reported that this aerobic granular sludge is suitable for treating the wastewater with high strength of organic load due the higher biomass retention 44 this could also be correlated with the current study where the high organic cod loading rate of 6 5 kg m3 was treated in sbar 3 5 polymerized chain reaction pcr study this study established the presence of selected bacteria genes involved in the nitrogen cycle during the enhanced nitrogen removal period of the sbar operated at stable performance at the end of the experiment the result of the pcr study after running the gel confirmed the existence of selected genes involved in the nitrogen cycle as shown in fig 4 out of the six different genes selected for testing three were present aob amoa nirk and pla46 amx820 and three were absent aoa amoa nirs and nosz and the details are shown in table 2 the results confirmed the presence of pla46 amx820 gene where a clear band was seen at 820bp the presence of the gene pla46 amx820 which is related to anammox species is an indication that under the operated process condition anammox bacteria existed in the reactor the gel picture fig 4 also confirmed the presence of aob amoa gene with a very clear band at 491bp the aob amoa gene was found alongside a gene responsible in denitrification nirk at 473bp 3 4 gene expression study this study was conducted for selected genes aob amoa and pla46 amx820 which play a major role in the rate limiting step of nitrogen removal 45 the targeted gene expression levels were normalized to the level of housekeeping gene 16 s gene as internal control the ct values of the test samples were calculated and the data was expressed in terms of fold change over control sample the normalized expression level of amoa in the control and sbr was 0 01343 and 0 12892 respectively with a p value 0 05 similarly normalized expression level of pla46 amx820 in the control and sbr was 0 00529 and 0 05830 respectively with a p value 0 05 which is clearly indicated in table 3 the results revealed that the test samples from the reactor showed upregulation of amoa gene by 9 6 folds and pla46 amx820 gene by 11 06 over control sample respectively table 3 the upregulation of targeted gene amoa and pla46 amx820 indicates the increase in population of ammonia oxidizers and anammox bacteria in the sbr during the treatment of synthetic tannery wastewater the result of the ct value ct 29 indicates a strong positive reaction suggesting abundant nucleic acid in the sample 46 4 conclusion the present experimental study confirmed that reducing the settling time sequentially resulted in formation of aerobic granules with excellent settling properties without severely affecting the performance of the reactor it was concluded that complete granulation was obtained at the end of 60th day when the settling time was reduced to 3 min without affecting the nitrification efficiency the observed characteristics of formed aerobic granules showed size svi and settling velocity in the range of 1 8 3 2 mm 16 20 ml g settling velocity of 30 40 m h and biomass density of 6 1 g l respectively from the study it was also concluded that the overall average cod removal efficiency of 97 6 1 9 and the effluent cod value in the range of 32 128 mg l could be achieved in sbar further an average nh4 n removal efficiency of 87 1 1 2 and effluent with average nh4 n no3 n and no2 n concentrations of 20 2 22 7 1 4 and 9 7 1 5 mg l respectively could be obtained the strategy followed also confirmed the retention of slow growing bacteria such as ammonia oxidizers and anammox bacteria in the reactor

13803,beads of alginate immobilised algae can be used to remove nutrients from wastewater in a compact reactor and to facilitate algal biomass collection for resource recovery fluidised bed reactors containing entrapped chlorella vulgaris or scenedesmus abundans were fed secondary effluent containing tp 8 9 0 45 mg l tn 18 3 0 7 mg l n no3 5 3 0 4 mg l and n nh4 9 4 0 2 mg l at 12 h hydraulic retention time these conditions mimicked reduced aeration of the activated sludge process to decrease energy consumption and fugitive gas emissions the s abundans reactor operated for 30 days before biomass harvest and bead regeneration was required longer than the reactor with c vulgaris 8 days s abundans grew at 3 3 0 6 106 cells ml d and removed tp to 0 90 0 26 mg l and tn to 9 8 1 1 mg l on average it completely removed nh4 but did not remove n no3 this demonstrated that the algal system could be used to treat the effluent to 1 mg l tp l and 10 mg tn l co digestion of s abundans biomass with and without enzymatic pre treatment with wastewater sludge showed that the untreated biomass generated more biomethane 248 10 ml ch4 g vs than the pre treated biomass 178 13 ml ch4 g vs this indicated that the algal biomass could be directly added to an existing anaerobic digestion process to improve biomethane production and subsequent energy recovery and the digestate used as fertiliser integration of the immobilised algae system into wastewater treatment trains is discussed based on these results keywords microalgae algal biomass anaerobic digestion resource recovery immobilised algae wastewater treatment 1 introduction the removal of the nutrients nitrogen n and phosphorus p from wastewater is important to prevent damage to the environment through eutrophication and to improve the quality of the treated wastewater for reuse increasing population and urbanisation is leading to greater loads on wastewater treatment plants meaning future compliance with nutrient level discharge limits will become more difficult furthermore there is pressure for wastewater treatment plants to reduce their emissions and become carbon neutral algal systems can simultaneously remove phosphorus to 0 1 mg l ammonia to 1 mg l and nitrate to 10 mg l 1 and have shown potential to remove micropollutants 2 algae take up n for various essential structural and functional components in particular proteins peptides enzymes chlorophyll adp and atp which are used for energy transport and rna and dna which are genetic materials 3 p is predominantly used in rna dna adp atp and cell membranes it can also be stored in algae as phospholipids 4 during wastewater treatment the n is predominantly sourced from ammonium nh4 and nitrate no3 and p from orthophosphate po4 3 due to their greater abundance in wastewater the energy required for assimilation and utilisation of these inorganic chemicals is sourced via photosynthesis when sufficient irradiance is provided to the algal cells conventional bacterial processes require significant energy for aeration particularly to achieve very low n concentrations and they generate the greenhouse gas n2o as a by product it is difficult to tailor bacterial processes to consistently achieve p removal to achieve low p concentrations a second bacterial stage involving the addition of an organic carbon source or chemical precipitation of p may be needed rather than requiring the addition of chemicals or aeration for growth algal systems fix co2 through photosynthesis during the nutrient removal process while also producing a value added product of algal biomass the algal biomass can be used for the recovery of carbon via the production of liquid biofuels or digested to generate biogas to offset any energy used during nutrient removal and the digestate applied to crops as a source of n and p 3 4 conventional algal treatment involves the use of algal suspensions in high rate ponds the algae are in relatively low concentrations comprise uncontrolled mixtures of species need long residence times up to 4 days to enable sufficient treatment and the effluent quality can be highly variable 5 for algal product recovery and to prevent contaminated treated discharge the algae must be removed from the treated water which can incur high energy and or chemical costs 6 7 immobilisation of algae in 3 4 mm spherical beads of alginate can lead to compact algal photobioreactor systems that have short hydraulic retention times hrts and these beads can be rapidly settled from the wastewater 8 9 in this way immobilisation can help overcome the biomass recovery and land use footprint shortcomings of conventional open pond systems there is fairly limited literature on reactors utilising alginate immobilised algae in a practical configuration for continuous operation some examples include 1 l erlenmeyer flasks containing scenedesmus obliquus inoculated beads operated at 3 24 h hrt for 9 23 days 10 2 5 l air lift reactors containing chlamydomonas reinhardtii inoculated beads operated at 9 1 33 h hrt for 5 days 11 and stirred 4 l tanks containing chlorella vulgaris inoculated beads operated at 6 5 12 h hrt for 2 days 8 thus it is desirable to demonstrate continuous operation of immobilised algae technology in a configuration reflective of full scale reactor design the wastewater to be treated will have a higher phosphorus p and ammonium nh4 concentration than these examples to represent conditions that occur at other municipal treatment plants the algal biomass produced during the treatment process can be collected for conversion to a useful product in particular anaerobic digestion of the biomass can generate biomethane ch4 for energy recovery digestion involves the conversion of the organic macromolecules such as proteins polysaccharides and lipids in the biomass to methane carbon dioxide and water consortia of bacteria and archaea perform this process via four stages under anaerobic conditions the initial stage of hydrolysis involves breakdown of the complex molecules into sugars amino acids and fatty acids as well as some acetate and carbon dioxide the larger molecules are further broken down by acidogenic bacteria to volatile fatty acids which are then converted via acetogenic bacteria to largely acetate carbon dioxide and hydrogen these products are then converted to methane carbon dioxide and water by the methanogenic archaea in the final stage of methanogenesis 12 13 for alginate immobilised algae the exhausted alginate beads can first be dissolved and up to 70 of the alginate recycled in the preparation of new algal beads 14 the algal biomass collected as a product co digestion of the algal biomass with wastewater sludge can take advantage of established infrastructure by supplementation of existing anaerobic digestion processes although digestion of the algal biomass alone is also possible 15 16 in this study the contribution that algal biomass makes to biomethane production when co digested with wastewater sludge was determined by a biomethane potential bmp test pre treatment can help break down the algal cell walls so the biomass is more readily degraded by the bacteria for methane production in this study enzymatic pre treatment was chosen to avoid energy intensive methods such as thermal thermal hydrolysis and ultrasonic methods ometto et al 17 found it was the only method that led to net energy benefit so in this study it was tested as a low energy method of breaking down algal cell walls to increase methane generation operation of immobilised algae in continuous reactors and biomethane production from algal biomass demonstrates the potential of immobilised algae technology to extract resources from wastewater as an advanced treatment option this work enables a quantitative assessment of application of the algal system and increases understanding of how it can best be integrated into a wastewater treatment train to maximise the dual benefit of treatment and resource recovery these results provide the basis for detailed economic and environmental assessment which will depend on the treatment plant to which the system is to be applied 2 materials and methods 2 1 algal species algal cultures were purchased from the australian national algae supply service anass csiro and maintained in mla medium under 16 8 h light dark illumination at 23 c with constant aeration 40 ml min unicellular members of the chlorophyta have been the main algal species tested for immobilisation by entrapment in gel beads and previous work has shown that within this phylum not all species adapt well to that constricted growth environment 18 scenedesmus abundans cs 935 was selected due to superior performance 18 and the successful application of an alginate immobilised scenedesmus species 10 chlorella vulgaris cs 41 has also been a commonly used species and so was selected to facilitate comparison with s abundans and the literature 2 2 bead preparation the algae were collected by centrifugation 3000 x g for 10 min after 7 days of cultivation in mla medium to be in exponential growth phase the algal pellet was collected and redispersed in milli q water and mixed with 2 5 na alginate melbourne food ingredient depot to make a final concentration of 2 na alginate the alginate algae mixture was dripped through an 18g needle into stirred 2 cacl2 to form ca alginate beads of entrapped algae to make the shape of the solidified alginate droplets spherical the needle was placed 30 cm above the cacl2 solution which was stirred at 80 rpm the beads were left to harden overnight and rinsed twice with stirring for 20 min in milli q water before inoculation of wastewater this alginate product was selected as after four weeks exposure to wastewater beads lost little strength 13 loss of resistance to compression and did not significantly disintegrate no change in bead diameter of 4 mm 19 2 3 wastewater municipal secondary effluent was sourced from the outlet of an activated sludge process of a local wastewater treatment plant victoria australia and stored at 4 c until use the wastewater which initially had negligible nh4 was supplemented with nh4cl to give 10 mg l n nh4 or 20 mg l n nh4 these levels were chosen based on findings using alginate immobilised algae to treat various wastewaters 18 and to provide an indication of the capacity of the algal reactor for removal of nh4 the wastewater characteristics are shown in table 1 2 4 fluidised bed reactors alginate beads containing the immobilised algal cells were used as the fluidised bed in 1 25 l pvc column reactors 68 mm i d wrapped with a 12 w daylight 5000 k led light strip sal

2 7 105 cells bead fluidisation to 30 of the bed height was achieved by a recirculation pump to ensure gentle mixing of the beads to assist nutrient diffusion and light access to the cells wastewater was supplied at 1 74 ml min to give a 12 h hrt equivalent to 6 h active bed hrt the reactors were stopped once the effluent quality deteriorated three conditions were used in the reactors c10 c

with 20 mg l of n nh4 2 5 biomethane potential test cells without alginate were digested to reflect the scenario of post wastewater treatment separation of alginate from the generated biomass for alginate recovery the algae used in the biomethane potential bmp tests were cultivated in mla to generate sufficient biomass to provide enough substrate compared with the inoculum the sludge used as inoculum for the test was supplied from an anaerobic digestor that operates at 37 c at the same treatment plant from which the wastewater was sourced the bmp tests were carried out in triplicate 100 ml flasks incubated at 37 c in a reciprocal shaking water bath 150 rpm with a 1 2 volatile solids vs substrate inoculum ratio table 2 to provide enough bacteria and algal biomass to generate sufficient methane compared with the control for measurement these conditions were based on the guidelines of filer et al 12 and chosen to enable comparison with literature bmp values s abundans biomass that had undergone enzymatic or no pre treatment was used for the bmp tests the controls comprised the enzymes used for the pre treatment of the algae in buffer and milli q water for the digestion of biomass without pre treatment the controls were incubated with the inoculum at equivalent volumes and concentrations as for the algal samples the volume of ch4 produced from each biomass sample was normalised based on the volume of ch4 produced from the respective control enzymatic pre treatment was carried out on s abundans biomass grown in mla medium the optimal dosage of enzymes

and bead stability there was a lag phase of 4 5 days in algal growth for the s abundans regardless of the nh4 concentration in the wastewater feed fig 1 a after the lag phase for s10 the algae grew at 3 3 0 6 106 cells ml d reaching a maximum of 8 60 0 72 107 cells ml on day 28 and for s20 they grew at 4 2 0 7 106 cells ml d reaching 1 17 0 12 108 cells ml on day 30 the production of algae in s20 was only 27 faster than for s10 despite being fed twice the concentration of nh4 indicating that n was not limiting growth growth was more rapid for c vulgaris 1 66 0 33 107 cells ml d peaking at 8 57 0 32 107 cells ml on day 6 after which cell number began to decline the c10 and s10 reactors reached a similar maximum cell concentration thus the shorter operating period of c10 before bead decline may have been a result of the rapid exponential growth of c vulgaris the longer algal growth period for s abundans 28 30 days than c vulgaris 6 days enables longer reactor operation and means the beads would need to be collected and replenished less frequently when the beads of concentrated algal culture are collected at the end of the treatment run value is added by resource recovery however cost is incurred by the need to generate fresh beads inoculated with algae to begin a new treatment cycle operating each treatment cycle for a longer period thus demonstrates that less cost would be incurred with the s abundans system whitton et al 10 reported specific growth rates of 0 22 0 44 d 1 for immobilised s obliquus higher than 0 087 0 096 d 1 for the s abundans systems in the current study possibly due to the use of a different reactor configuration wastewater composition and algal species algae in the c10 reactor grew at 0 68 d 1 within the range 0 38 1 44 d 1 reported by filippino et al 8 for immobilised c vulgaris the highest rate obtained by those authors occurred when co2 supplementation was used which may explain why it was greater than in the present study cells that grew in suspension represented 1 7 0 3 c10 9 5 1 8 s10 and 10 1 1 7 s20 of the cell increase within the beads before the beads began to deteriorate at the end of the treatment cycle hence immobilisation retained the algae within the ca alginate matrix and the greater proportion of the treatment occurred due to growth within the beads increasing the active volume compared with the total reactor volume i e increasing the number of beads in the reactor would lead to a shorter start up time leading to a reduction in nutrients available for suspended algal cell growth an increase in turbidity in the effluent discharge from the reactor occurred due to disintegration of algal beads and or leakage of algal cells leading to contamination of the effluent and a decline in reactor performance turbidity increased from 3 4 0 3 ntu to 130 1 ntu fig 2 a on day 8 for c10 which corresponded with an increase of cell concentration in the effluent to 8 7 2 0 106 cells ml compared with 1 2 105 0 4 cells ml for days 0 7 fig 2b the volume of the bead bed visibly decreased showing that the decline in effluent quality was due to bead degradation cell concentration increased in the effluent from an average of 1 3 0 5 105 cells ml days 0 26 to 5 1 0 5 105 cells ml at the end of the run for s10 and from 2 0 0 8 105 cells ml to 1 3 0 1 106 cells ml for s20 corresponding to an increase in effluent turbidity to 11 5 0 2 ntu and 27 5 0 1 ntu respectively the deterioration in effluent quality being an order of magnitude less and at a more gradual rate for s abundans than c vulgaris indicates that s abundans cells were being slowly released from the beads whereas for c vulgaris the beads were undergoing rapid deterioration this is supported by the bead bed for s10 and s20 being in visibly better condition at the end of the run than for c10 with the bead bed of c10 shrinking and individual beads becoming weaker this was despite being exposed to the wastewater for longer and may be partly attributed to the slower growth rate of s abundans the doc increased from 30 2 3 8 mg l in the feed to 44 6 3 9 mg l in the effluent on day 5 for c10 and to 39 5 3 2 mg l and 36 9 3 4 mg l on day 25 for s10 and s20 respectively indicating that algal cells were dying and releasing algal organic matter and or that the ca alginate was dissolving the doc in the effluent before bead decline days 0 24 for s10 32 7 4 3 mg l average and s20 31 0 4 1 mg l was not consistently different from the feed concentration 30 2 3 8 mg l indicating that the system led to no beneficial decrease in organic carbon concentration the dic concentration fig 1c had an inverse relationship with ph fig 1b indicating that increase in ph was a result of algal uptake of dic from the wastewater hence as s10 and s20 had similar dic decrease 20 2 4 0 mg l up to day 26 the effluent ph 10 0 0 3 was consistent between runs the period of less ph increase from day 26 can be attributed to less algal growth corresponding to bead decline the ph for c10 peaked at 9 6 on day 2 and was 7 7 8 5 for the remainder of the run indicating a change in algal activity consistent with the alginate beads degrading earlier than for s10 and s20 as each reactor operated at an elevated ph reaching maximum ph levels of 9 7 10 8 fig 1b sub optimal conditions for algal growth may have been reached this also means that an additional post treatment step of ph adjustment may be required for disposal or re use of the effluent the ph was not controlled in these experiments to determine the performance of the reactors without additional costs such as for aeration or chemical dosing if achieving lower ph on discharge is desired better control of ph could be achieved by cultivation of suspended bacteria within the reactor 21 co immobilisation of bacteria within the beads 22 or by fluidisation of the bed with flue gas as a co2 source 23 3 2 phosphorus removal each system treated the effluent to 2 mg tp l and 1 2 mg p po4 3 l by day 2 from the feed concentration of 8 95 0 43 mg tp l and 8 53 0 44 mg p po4 3 l p removal for c10 declined from this point whereas s10 continued to treat the effluent to 0 90 0 26 mg tp l up to day 29 a rate of 16 1 5 5 mg l d and s20 to 0 90 0 14 mg tp l up to day 26 16 1 3 3 mg l d fig 3 this demonstrates that the discharge limits of 1 mg tp l suitable for inland water bodies in victoria 24 can be met with just the algal reactor and no additional p removal systems the maximum p po4 3 removal rate 16 6 16 7 mg l d for the s abundans reactors was greater than the 6 96 mg l d reported by whitton et al 10 with alginate immobilised s obliquus at the same hrt this may have been due to the lower p po4 3 of the feed 3 97 0 01 mg l used by whitton et al 10 than in the current study 8 53 0 44 mg p po4 3 l tp and po4 3 removal fig 3 decreased at day 4 for c10 despite continued increase in cell number fig 1a and negligible increase in the turbidity and cell concentration in the effluent fig 2 suggesting that the decline in p removal was not from bead deterioration the cells may have released surface adsorbed p 25 which is likely to occur if the cells were under stress alternatively as precipitation of po4 3 with ca2 is promoted as ph increases 26 the decline in ph fig 1b may have reduced this mechanism of p removal at the end of the c10 run day 8 po4 3 was still being removed despite tp removal ceasing fig 3 the c vulgaris beads had reached a maximum cell capacity leading to bead deterioration and rapid increase in cell concentration in the effluent for c10 fig 2 which were still assimilating p by day 30 of the s abundans runs both po4 3 and tp removal markedly decreased the s abundans cells were photosynthesising less as supported by a reduction in dic uptake fig 1c suggesting the cells had reached a maximum uptake capacity and thus were assimilating less p comparing s10 with s20 the wastewater n nh4 concentration had little impact on treatment duration and p removal efficiency this along with the high efficiency of p po4 3 94 9 and tp 89 9 removal for each n nh4 level fig 3 suggests the system was p limited dissolved phosphate and carbonate ions can react with the ca alginate matrix 27 causing the beads to deteriorate and leak algal cells p and dic removal by algal cells would thus reduce this deleterious reaction p and dic removal not being significantly different between s10 and s20 can thus explain the similar durability of the beads in the wastewater 3 3 nitrogen removal tn 18 3 0 7 mg l in the feed was removed to 4 6 0 6 mg l a rate of 27 3 1 3 mg l d by c10 for days 3 7 to 9 8 1 1 mg l 17 0 1 8 mg l d by s10 for days 3 29 and from 27 4 1 1 mg l in the feed to 19 5 2 1 mg l 16 1 3 1 mg l d by s20 for days 3 28 fig 4 increasing the n nh4 level to 20 mg l for s abundans did not lead to increase in tn removal and while c10 achieved the greatest tn removal the short duration of operation was a major drawback thus only the s10 system was able to exhibit consistent tn removal to a level of 15 mg l required for safe discharge into inland water bodies as stipulated by the epa victoria 24 vílchez et al 11 reported a similar n removal rate of 16 5 mg n l d with immobilised c reinhardtii fed with 16 8 mg tn l as n no3 at 14 h hrt and whitton et al 10 reported a higher n removal rate of 51 9 mg n l d with s obliquus fed with 27 5 mg tn l predominantly as n no3 at 12 h hrt the s obliquus removed nutrients at a n p ratio of 7 5 compared with 1 0 1 1 for the s abundans in the present study the higher removal rate and n p ratio for whitton et al 10 may suggest that in the current study there was decreased n uptake that did not impact p uptake tn removal increased from day 27 for s20 and day 30 for s10 fig 4a which coincided with bead deterioration fig 2 the alginate matrix loosening and suspended algal growth fig 2 allowed more n removal at the end of the run suggesting that for s abundans n uptake was reduced as a consequence of growth in the bead environment factors such as light intensity and dic concentration may also have limited n removal tn removal was by nh4 removal for s10 and s20 fig 2b and neither system removed no3 fig 4c this is consistent with assimilation of nh4 in preference to no3 being common for members of the chlorophyceae 28 nh4 removal can be by algal assimilation or volatilisation as nh3 and as nh4 nh3 h has a pka of 9 3 it is promoted as ph increases 29 s10 removing tn and nh4 at a comparable rate to s20 corresponds to there being only small differences in algal growth and ph fig 1 while both c10 and s10 reached 0 05 mg n nh4 l only c vulgaris removed no3 s abundans may have been at maximum growth rate under the reactor conditions and so did not need more n whereas c vulgaris grew faster fig 1a and after nh4 was removed then no3 removal occurred there may also have been a species difference 30 in this case with c vulgaris more prone than s abundans to assimilate no3 3 4 biomethane potential pre treatment of the algal biomass with 500 u g of 1 1 depol 40 lipomod 957 led to greater scod release than for other concentrations fig 5 a and so this concentration was selected to pre treat the algae for the bmp test the scod released from enzymatically pre treated algae 164 9 mg scod g dw was 53 5 greater compared with the scod released from algae without pre treatment 105 2 mg scod g dw however the algal biomass without pre treatment led to greater biomethane production 248 10 ml ch4 g vs than the enzymatically pre treated biomass 178 13 ml ch4 g vs table 3 this demonstrates that there was no benefit in enzymatically pre treating the biomass in this instance the methane yield for the s abundans biomass without pre treatment was greater than that of 210 3 ml ch4 g vs obtained during bmp tests on s obliquus using 1 25 l stoppered flasks at 33 c 31 during bmp tests in 250 ml stoppered flasks at 38 c also with s obliquus a lower yield of 178 6 ml ch4 g vs was achieved this was however the lowest of all algal species tested 32 reviewing methane yields 24 587 ml ch4 g vs from various algae ward et al 33 concluded that biomass from different species needs to be processed differently to maximise ch4 yield due to differences in cell wall structure the bmp test in the current study was conducted under standardised conditions 12 further work could be undertaken to optimise the conditions for maximising methane yield from s abundans comparing the pre treatment results ehimen et al 34 obtained a 8 12 increase in ch4 yield with cellulase and 31 with an enzyme mixture lipase xylanase α amylase protease and cellulase for rhizoclonium suggesting that appropriate selection of enzymes can benefit methane production these gains in ch4 yield need to be balanced against the cost and effort of the pre treatment step the lower generation of ch4 from the pre treated algal biomass in the current study may have been a consequence of a change to the c n ratio 15 or ph 35 which can reduce inoculum activity the enzyme control made a significant contribution of scod 113 4 mg scod g dw and consequently biomethane production 99 6 ml ch4 g vs and so the enzymes may have been preferentially digested over the algal biomass the cumulative ch4 produced from each algal sample fitted the modified gompertz model well r 2 of 0 993 0 996 fig 5b the model was less accurate after the exponential phase approximately day 14 suggesting that the bacteria were generating ch4 from the algae at a slower pace for longer than may be typical for other substrates algal cell walls are difficult to break down 16 which could explain the longer period of biomethane generation there was a lag phase λ for the enzymatically pre treated sample 1 3 d however there was little difference in the rate constant k 19 8 ml ch4 g vs d this indicates that the added enzymes were preferentially digested compared with the algae or they caused initial harm to the bacteria in the inoculum fig 5 the s abundans biomass without pre treatment generated the greatest volume of ch4 had the lowest λ 0 59 d and greatest k 30 5 ml ch4 g vs d indicating the algal biomass could be directly co digested with wastewater sludge in an existing anaerobic digestion process to provide beneficial energy recovery furthermore the concentration of ch4 was independent of whether it was pre treated or not 66 67 and greater than that of the controls containing no algae 57 4 indicating that the algae improved the quality of biogas generated 3 5 practical implications and research perspectives the algal system could be incorporated into existing wastewater treatment trains at the outlet of the activated sludge process the extent of aeration used in the activated sludge process could then be reduced allowing the algal system to remove the consequently higher nh4 concentration this would reduce energy use and fugitive greenhouse gas emissions from the activated sludge process furthermore as simultaneous removal of n and p to low concentrations has been demonstrated this placement would enable the production of good quality water for reuse without the need for additional processes such as chemical precipitation of p there is also potential to treat lagoon effluent as a polishing step prior to discharge to sensitive environments or as a means of resource recovery and increasing the opportunity for water reuse which could help to justify upgrades to lagoon systems and would need significantly smaller land footprint alternatively the algal system could be situated after an initial settling lagoon in addition to the nutrient removal the algal system would lead to increased oxygen content of the treated water to enhance the performance of downstream lagoons without having to provide mechanical aeration another approach could be to initially treat the wastewater anaerobically e g by an upflow anaerobic sludge blanket reactor and then to use algae for nutrient removal and recovery if higher quality water is desired to promote reuse a tertiary treatment step could be added and operated using the energy generated from biomethane this process flowsheet presents a low chemical low energy and low emissions treatment option that enables recovery of resources from the wastewater and provision of high quality water as the final product and thus contributes to the circular economy in process flowsheets such as these where there is digestion on site flue gas from co generation or flaring could be used to fluidise the bed of immobilised algal beads and sequester the co2 by algal growth providing environmental benefit and potentially improving treatment efficiency the reactor in this study utilised led lights wrapped around transparent pvc pipe 68 mm diameter while pilot scale systems trialled in the uk use a grid pattern of rods of led light strips 32 mm apart 36 key aspects of the design of these reactors is the spacing of the lighting to provide optimal light to the culture hence in each scenario the wastewater 1 transmittance and 2 potential to foul surfaces need to be considered considering 1 the bed of algal beads blocks more light than wastewater and so is the limiting factor for spacing of the lighting fluidisation of the bed transports the beads from darker zones further from the lights into brighter zones near the lights further work could be undertaken on the mixing rate of the fluidised bed and the distance between lights as a means of reducing the cost of light provision while providing optimal irradiance levels for algal growth and also on the impact of different light dark cycles considering 2 in this study it was observed that mixing of the fluidised bed provided mechanical cleaning of the pvc surface decreasing biofilm formation and thus preventing a loss of light penetration the surface would still likely require periodic cleaning particularly if treating higher strength wastewaters post treatment the algal biomass can be anaerobically digested for energy generation either on site or the biomass can be dried and trucked to a co generation site as necessary settled algal beads from the immobilised algae reactor can be separated into dissolved alginate and algal cells with the alginate used to generate fresh beads as suggested by murujew et al 14 and the cells co digested with sludge from the treatment steps earlier in the process train methane from co digestion of sludge and algae can be used for generation of electricity the digestate can be used whole or after separation of the liquor which can be spread more easily as n and p rich fertiliser the separated fibre can be used fresh as a soil conditioner or after aerobic composting to stabilise it to be a component of compost products such schemes enable a holistic approach to the recovery of n p and carbonaceous components from wastewater and thus contribution to the circular economy another approach is to extract other high grade products such as liquid biofuel from the harvested microalgae and then anaerobically digest the waste biomass to generate methane as an on site energy source to facilitate the biomass processing and extraction operations 33 the approach of targeting high grade products is particularly appealing for immobilised systems an algal species can be selected that has a high concentration of a certain intracellular product and being within the immobilisation matrix during growth in wastewater means this species will be protected from contamination this could include a high yield of uncommon pigments or fatty acids that provide health benefit a high lipid composition for conversion to bioethanol and higher value fuels a high content of valuable proteins with important nutritional value or contain components that can act as a platform for niche chemicals such as pharmaceuticals 37 39 thus targeting generation of products that have a high value could be a favourable option using an immobilised system 4 conclusion alginate immobilised s abundans and c vulgaris were used to treat secondary effluent with 8 9 mg tp l and supplemented with 10 mg n nh4 l giving 18 3 mg tn l c10 and s10 and 20 mg n nh4 l 27 4 mg tn l s20 in fluidised bed reactors beads of s abundans were more durable when treating the wastewater operating for 30 days compared with c vulgaris 8 days bead durability was independent of the wastewater n concentration however the higher wastewater n concentration contributed to s20 1 17 0 12 108 cells ml producing more cells than s10 8 60 0 72 107 cells ml compared with c vulgaris both the reactors with s abundans achieved greater p removal treating the effluent to 1 mg tp l the s10 and s20 reactors removed tn from the wastewater at a similar rate 16 1 17 0 mg l d reaching 9 8 1 1 mg tn l and 19 5 2 1 mg tn l in the effluent discharge respectively the higher tn concentration did not lead to an increase in tn removal rate indicating a limitation of n uptake by the immobilised cell system greater methane production 248 10 ml ch4 g vs at a higher rate and shorter lag time was obtained from s abundans biomass without pre treatment indicating that addition of the algal biomass to an existing anaerobic sludge digestion process could benefit biomethane production ultimately increasing energy recovery from the wastewater treatment plant and contributing to its becoming carbon neutral application of the digestate to crops as a source of n and p would further enhance the recovery of resources these outcomes indicate the potential of the algal system to provide economic and environmental benefit to the wastewater treatment process this includes reduction in aeration costs energy consumption and fugitive emissions removal of both n and p to concentrations that increase opportunities for water reuse and generation of biomass that increases energy and nutrient

13803,beads of alginate immobilised algae can be used to remove nutrients from wastewater in a compact reactor and to facilitate algal biomass collection for resource recovery fluidised bed reactors containing entrapped chlorella vulgaris or scenedesmus abundans were fed secondary effluent containing tp 8 9 0 45 mg l tn 18 3 0 7 mg l n no3 5 3 0 4 mg l and n nh4 9 4 0 2 mg l at 12 h hydraulic retention time these conditions mimicked reduced aeration of the activated sludge process to decrease energy consumption and fugitive gas emissions the s abundans reactor operated for 30 days before biomass harvest and bead regeneration was required longer than the reactor with c vulgaris 8 days s abundans grew at 3 3 0 6 106 cells ml d and removed tp to 0 90 0 26 mg l and tn to 9 8 1 1 mg l on average it completely removed nh4 but did not remove n no3 this demonstrated that the algal system could be used to treat the effluent to 1 mg l tp l and 10 mg tn l co digestion of s abundans biomass with and without enzymatic pre treatment with wastewater sludge showed that the untreated biomass generated more biomethane 248 10 ml ch4 g vs than the pre treated biomass 178 13 ml ch4 g vs this indicated that the algal biomass could be directly added to an existing anaerobic digestion process to improve biomethane production and subsequent energy recovery and the digestate used as fertiliser integration of the immobilised algae system into wastewater treatment trains is discussed based on these results keywords microalgae algal biomass anaerobic digestion resource recovery immobilised algae wastewater treatment 1 introduction the removal of the nutrients nitrogen n and phosphorus p from wastewater is important to prevent damage to the environment through eutrophication and to improve the quality of the treated wastewater for reuse increasing population and urbanisation is leading to greater loads on wastewater treatment plants meaning future compliance with nutrient level discharge limits will become more difficult furthermore there is pressure for wastewater treatment plants to reduce their emissions and become carbon neutral algal systems can simultaneously remove phosphorus to 0 1 mg l ammonia to 1 mg l and nitrate to 10 mg l 1 and have shown potential to remove micropollutants 2 algae take up n for various essential structural and functional components in particular proteins peptides enzymes chlorophyll adp and atp which are used for energy transport and rna and dna which are genetic materials 3 p is predominantly used in rna dna adp atp and cell membranes it can also be stored in algae as phospholipids 4 during wastewater treatment the n is predominantly sourced from ammonium nh4 and nitrate no3 and p from orthophosphate po4 3 due to their greater abundance in wastewater the energy required for assimilation and utilisation of these inorganic chemicals is sourced via photosynthesis when sufficient irradiance is provided to the algal cells conventional bacterial processes require significant energy for aeration particularly to achieve very low n concentrations and they generate the greenhouse gas n2o as a by product it is difficult to tailor bacterial processes to consistently achieve p removal to achieve low p concentrations a second bacterial stage involving the addition of an organic carbon source or chemical precipitation of p may be needed rather than requiring the addition of chemicals or aeration for growth algal systems fix co2 through photosynthesis during the nutrient removal process while also producing a value added product of algal biomass the algal biomass can be used for the recovery of carbon via the production of liquid biofuels or digested to generate biogas to offset any energy used during nutrient removal and the digestate applied to crops as a source of n and p 3 4 conventional algal treatment involves the use of algal suspensions in high rate ponds the algae are in relatively low concentrations comprise uncontrolled mixtures of species need long residence times up to 4 days to enable sufficient treatment and the effluent quality can be highly variable 5 for algal product recovery and to prevent contaminated treated discharge the algae must be removed from the treated water which can incur high energy and or chemical costs 6 7 immobilisation of algae in 3 4 mm spherical beads of alginate can lead to compact algal photobioreactor systems that have short hydraulic retention times hrts and these beads can be rapidly settled from the wastewater 8 9 in this way immobilisation can help overcome the biomass recovery and land use footprint shortcomings of conventional open pond systems there is fairly limited literature on reactors utilising alginate immobilised algae in a practical configuration for continuous operation some examples include 1 l erlenmeyer flasks containing scenedesmus obliquus inoculated beads operated at 3 24 h hrt for 9 23 days 10 2 5 l air lift reactors containing chlamydomonas reinhardtii inoculated beads operated at 9 1 33 h hrt for 5 days 11 and stirred 4 l tanks containing chlorella vulgaris inoculated beads operated at 6 5 12 h hrt for 2 days 8 thus it is desirable to demonstrate continuous operation of immobilised algae technology in a configuration reflective of full scale reactor design the wastewater to be treated will have a higher phosphorus p and ammonium nh4 concentration than these examples to represent conditions that occur at other municipal treatment plants the algal biomass produced during the treatment process can be collected for conversion to a useful product in particular anaerobic digestion of the biomass can generate biomethane ch4 for energy recovery digestion involves the conversion of the organic macromolecules such as proteins polysaccharides and lipids in the biomass to methane carbon dioxide and water consortia of bacteria and archaea perform this process via four stages under anaerobic conditions the initial stage of hydrolysis involves breakdown of the complex molecules into sugars amino acids and fatty acids as well as some acetate and carbon dioxide the larger molecules are further broken down by acidogenic bacteria to volatile fatty acids which are then converted via acetogenic bacteria to largely acetate carbon dioxide and hydrogen these products are then converted to methane carbon dioxide and water by the methanogenic archaea in the final stage of methanogenesis 12 13 for alginate immobilised algae the exhausted alginate beads can first be dissolved and up to 70 of the alginate recycled in the preparation of new algal beads 14 the algal biomass collected as a product co digestion of the algal biomass with wastewater sludge can take advantage of established infrastructure by supplementation of existing anaerobic digestion processes although digestion of the algal biomass alone is also possible 15 16 in this study the contribution that algal biomass makes to biomethane production when co digested with wastewater sludge was determined by a biomethane potential bmp test pre treatment can help break down the algal cell walls so the biomass is more readily degraded by the bacteria for methane production in this study enzymatic pre treatment was chosen to avoid energy intensive methods such as thermal thermal hydrolysis and ultrasonic methods ometto et al 17 found it was the only method that led to net energy benefit so in this study it was tested as a low energy method of breaking down algal cell walls to increase methane generation operation of immobilised algae in continuous reactors and biomethane production from algal biomass demonstrates the potential of immobilised algae technology to extract resources from wastewater as an advanced treatment option this work enables a quantitative assessment of application of the algal system and increases understanding of how it can best be integrated into a wastewater treatment train to maximise the dual benefit of treatment and resource recovery these results provide the basis for detailed economic and environmental assessment which will depend on the treatment plant to which the system is to be applied 2 materials and methods 2 1 algal species algal cultures were purchased from the australian national algae supply service anass csiro and maintained in mla medium under 16 8 h light dark illumination at 23 c with constant aeration 40 ml min unicellular members of the chlorophyta have been the main algal species tested for immobilisation by entrapment in gel beads and previous work has shown that within this phylum not all species adapt well to that constricted growth environment 18 scenedesmus abundans cs 935 was selected due to superior performance 18 and the successful application of an alginate immobilised scenedesmus species 10 chlorella vulgaris cs 41 has also been a commonly used species and so was selected to facilitate comparison with s abundans and the literature 2 2 bead preparation the algae were collected by centrifugation 3000 x g for 10 min after 7 days of cultivation in mla medium to be in exponential growth phase the algal pellet was collected and redispersed in milli q water and mixed with 2 5 na alginate melbourne food ingredient depot to make a final concentration of 2 na alginate the alginate algae mixture was dripped through an 18g needle into stirred 2 cacl2 to form ca alginate beads of entrapped algae to make the shape of the solidified alginate droplets spherical the needle was placed 30 cm above the cacl2 solution which was stirred at 80 rpm the beads were left to harden overnight and rinsed twice with stirring for 20 min in milli q water before inoculation of wastewater this alginate product was selected as after four weeks exposure to wastewater beads lost little strength 13 loss of resistance to compression and did not significantly disintegrate no change in bead diameter of 4 mm 19 2 3 wastewater municipal secondary effluent was sourced from the outlet of an activated sludge process of a local wastewater treatment plant victoria australia and stored at 4 c until use the wastewater which initially had negligible nh4 was supplemented with nh4cl to give 10 mg l n nh4 or 20 mg l n nh4 these levels were chosen based on findings using alginate immobilised algae to treat various wastewaters 18 and to provide an indication of the capacity of the algal reactor for removal of nh4 the wastewater characteristics are shown in table 1 2 4 fluidised bed reactors alginate beads containing the immobilised algal cells were used as the fluidised bed in 1 25 l pvc column reactors 68 mm i d wrapped with a 12 w daylight 5000 k led light strip sal

2 7 105 cells bead fluidisation to 30 of the bed height was achieved by a recirculation pump to ensure gentle mixing of the beads to assist nutrient diffusion and light access to the cells wastewater was supplied at 1 74 ml min to give a 12 h hrt equivalent to 6 h active bed hrt the reactors were stopped once the effluent quality deteriorated three conditions were used in the reactors c10 c

with 20 mg l of n nh4 2 5 biomethane potential test cells without alginate were digested to reflect the scenario of post wastewater treatment separation of alginate from the generated biomass for alginate recovery the algae used in the biomethane potential bmp tests were cultivated in mla to generate sufficient biomass to provide enough substrate compared with the inoculum the sludge used as inoculum for the test was supplied from an anaerobic digestor that operates at 37 c at the same treatment plant from which the wastewater was sourced the bmp tests were carried out in triplicate 100 ml flasks incubated at 37 c in a reciprocal shaking water bath 150 rpm with a 1 2 volatile solids vs substrate inoculum ratio table 2 to provide enough bacteria and algal biomass to generate sufficient methane compared with the control for measurement these conditions were based on the guidelines of filer et al 12 and chosen to enable comparison with literature bmp values s abundans biomass that had undergone enzymatic or no pre treatment was used for the bmp tests the controls comprised the enzymes used for the pre treatment of the algae in buffer and milli q water for the digestion of biomass without pre treatment the controls were incubated with the inoculum at equivalent volumes and concentrations as for the algal samples the volume of ch4 produced from each biomass sample was normalised based on the volume of ch4 produced from the respective control enzymatic pre treatment was carried out on s abundans biomass grown in mla medium the optimal dosage of enzymes was determined based on the scod released from the algal biomass depol 40 biocatalysts ltd which contains cellulase 1200 u g and endogalactouronase 800 u g and lipomod 957 biocatalysts ltd which contains esterase 3600 u g and protease 90 u g were used following the method of ometto et al 17 the manufacturer s recommendations for ph and temperature were used due to the sensitivity of enzymes to these environmental factors briefly the two enzyme products were mixed at a ratio of 1 1 u u 1 1 3 g g depol 40 lipomod 957 and this solution added to algal biomass 0 47 0 03 g l suspended in 0 1 m

and bead stability there was a lag phase of 4 5 days in algal growth for the s abundans regardless of the nh4 concentration in the wastewater feed fig 1 a after the lag phase for s10 the algae grew at 3 3 0 6 106 cells ml d reaching a maximum of 8 60 0 72 107 cells ml on day 28 and for s20 they grew at 4 2 0 7 106 cells ml d reaching 1 17 0 12 108 cells ml on day 30 the production of algae in s20 was only 27 faster than for s10 despite being fed twice the concentration of nh4 indicating that n was not limiting growth growth was more rapid for c vulgaris 1 66 0 33 107 cells ml d peaking at 8 57 0 32 107 cells ml on day 6 after which cell number began to decline the c10 and s10 reactors reached a similar maximum cell concentration thus the shorter operating period of c10 before bead decline may have been a result of the rapid exponential growth of c vulgaris the longer algal growth period for s abundans 28 30 days than c vulgaris 6 days enables longer reactor operation and means the beads would need to be collected and replenished less frequently when the beads of concentrated algal culture are collected at the end of the treatment run value is added by resource recovery however cost is incurred by the need to generate fresh beads inoculated with algae to begin a new treatment cycle operating each treatment cycle for a longer period thus demonstrates that less cost would be incurred with the s abundans system whitton et al 10 reported specific growth rates of 0 22 0 44 d 1 for immobilised s obliquus higher than 0 087 0 096 d 1 for the s abundans systems in the current study possibly due to the use of a different reactor configuration wastewater composition and algal species algae in the c10 reactor grew at 0 68 d 1 within the range 0 38 1 44 d 1 reported by filippino et al 8 for immobilised c vulgaris the highest rate obtained by those authors occurred when co2 supplementation was used which may explain why it was greater than in the present study cells that grew in suspension represented 1 7 0 3 c10 9 5 1 8 s10 and 10 1 1 7 s20 of the cell increase within the beads before the beads began to deteriorate at the end of the treatment cycle hence immobilisation retained the algae within the ca alginate matrix and the greater proportion of the treatment occurred due to growth within the beads increasing the active volume compared with the total reactor volume i e increasing the number of beads in the reactor would lead to a shorter start up time leading to a reduction in nutrients available for suspended algal cell growth an increase in turbidity in the effluent discharge from the reactor occurred due to disintegration of algal beads and or leakage of algal cells leading to contamination of the effluent and a decline in reactor performance turbidity increased from 3 4 0 3 ntu to 130 1 ntu fig 2 a on day 8 for c10 which corresponded with an increase of cell concentration in the effluent to 8 7 2 0 106 cells ml compared with 1 2 105 0 4 cells ml for days 0 7 fig 2b the volume of the bead bed visibly decreased showing that the decline in effluent quality was due to bead degradation cell concentration increased in the effluent from an average of 1 3 0 5 105 cells ml days 0 26 to 5 1 0 5 105 cells ml at the end of the run for s10 and from 2 0 0 8 105 cells ml to 1 3 0 1 106 cells ml for s20 corresponding to an increase in effluent turbidity to 11 5 0 2 ntu and 27 5 0 1 ntu respectively the deterioration in effluent quality being an order of magnitude less and at a more gradual rate for s abundans than c vulgaris indicates that s abundans cells were being slowly released from the beads whereas for c vulgaris the beads were undergoing rapid deterioration this is supported by the bead bed for s10 and s20 being in visibly better condition at the end of the run than for c10 with the bead bed of c10 shrinking and individual beads becoming weaker this was despite being exposed to the wastewater for longer and may be partly attributed to the slower growth rate of s abundans the doc increased from 30 2 3 8 mg l in the feed to 44 6 3 9 mg l in the effluent on day 5 for c10 and to 39 5 3 2 mg l and 36 9 3 4 mg l on day 25 for s10 and s20 respectively indicating that algal cells were dying and releasing algal organic matter and or that the ca alginate was dissolving the doc in the effluent before bead decline days 0 24 for s10 32 7 4 3 mg l average and s20 31 0 4 1 mg l was not consistently different from the feed concentration 30 2 3 8 mg l indicating that the system led to no beneficial decrease in organic carbon concentration the dic concentration fig 1c had an inverse relationship with ph fig 1b indicating that increase in ph was a result of algal uptake of dic from the wastewater hence as s10 and s20 had similar dic decrease 20 2 4 0 mg l up to day 26 the effluent ph 10 0 0 3 was consistent between runs the period of less ph increase from day 26 can be attributed to less algal growth corresponding to bead decline the ph for c10 peaked at 9 6 on day 2 and was 7 7 8 5 for the remainder of the run indicating a change in algal activity consistent with the alginate beads degrading earlier than for s10 and s20 as each reactor operated at an elevated ph reaching maximum ph levels of 9 7 10 8 fig 1b sub optimal conditions for algal growth may have been reached this also means that an additional post treatment step of ph adjustment may be required for disposal or re use of the effluent the ph was not controlled in these experiments to determine the performance of the reactors without additional costs such as for aeration or chemical dosing if achieving lower ph on discharge is desired better control of ph could be achieved by cultivation of suspended bacteria within the reactor 21 co immobilisation of bacteria within the beads 22 or by fluidisation of the bed with flue gas as a co2 source 23 3 2 phosphorus removal each system treated the effluent to 2 mg tp l and 1 2 mg p po4 3 l by day 2 from the feed concentration of 8 95 0 43 mg tp l and 8 53 0 44 mg p po4 3 l p removal for c10 declined from this point whereas s10 continued to treat the effluent to 0 90 0 26 mg tp l up to day 29 a rate of 16 1 5 5 mg l d and s20 to 0 90 0 14 mg tp l up to day 26 16 1 3 3 mg l d fig 3 this demonstrates that the discharge limits of 1 mg tp l suitable for inland water bodies in victoria 24 can be met with just the algal reactor and no additional p removal systems the maximum p po4 3 removal rate 16 6 16 7 mg l d for the s abundans reactors was greater than the 6 96 mg l d reported by whitton et al 10 with alginate immobilised s obliquus at the same hrt this may have been due to the lower p po4 3 of the feed 3 97 0 01 mg l used by whitton et al 10 than in the current study 8 53 0 44 mg p po4 3 l tp and po4 3 removal fig 3 decreased at day 4 for c10 despite continued increase in cell number fig 1a and negligible increase in the turbidity and cell concentration in the effluent fig 2 suggesting that the decline in p removal was not from bead deterioration the cells may have released surface adsorbed p 25 which is likely to occur if the cells were under stress alternatively as precipitation of po4 3 with ca2 is promoted as ph increases 26 the decline in ph fig 1b may have reduced this mechanism of p removal at the end of the c10 run day 8 po4 3 was still being removed despite tp removal ceasing fig 3 the c vulgaris beads had reached a maximum cell capacity leading to bead deterioration and rapid increase in cell concentration in the effluent for c10 fig 2 which were still assimilating p by day 30 of the s abundans runs both po4 3 and tp removal markedly decreased the s abundans cells were photosynthesising less as supported by a reduction in dic uptake fig 1c suggesting the cells had reached a maximum uptake capacity and thus were assimilating less p comparing s10 with s20 the wastewater n nh4 concentration had little impact on treatment duration and p removal efficiency this along with the high efficiency of p po4 3 94 9 and tp 89 9 removal for each n nh4 level fig 3 suggests the system was p limited dissolved phosphate and carbonate ions can react with the ca alginate matrix 27 causing the beads to deteriorate and leak algal cells p and dic removal by algal cells would thus reduce this deleterious reaction p and dic removal not being significantly different between s10 and s20 can thus explain the similar durability of the beads in the wastewater 3 3 nitrogen removal tn 18 3 0 7 mg l in the feed was removed to 4 6 0 6 mg l a rate of 27 3 1 3 mg l d by c10 for days 3 7 to 9 8 1 1 mg l 17 0 1 8 mg l d by s10 for days 3 29 and from 27 4 1 1 mg l in the feed to 19 5 2 1 mg l 16 1 3 1 mg l d by s20 for days 3 28 fig 4 increasing the n nh4 level to 20 mg l for s abundans did not lead to increase in tn removal and while c10 achieved the greatest tn removal the short duration of operation was a major drawback thus only the s10 system was able to exhibit consistent tn removal to a level of 15 mg l required for safe discharge into inland water bodies as stipulated by the epa victoria 24 vílchez et al 11 reported a similar n removal rate of 16 5 mg n l d with immobilised c reinhardtii fed with 16 8 mg tn l as n no3 at 14 h hrt and whitton et al 10 reported a higher n removal rate of 51 9 mg n l d with s obliquus fed with 27 5 mg tn l predominantly as n no3 at 12 h hrt the s obliquus removed nutrients at a n p ratio of 7 5 compared with 1 0 1 1 for the s abundans in the present study the higher removal rate and n p ratio for whitton et al 10 may suggest that in the current study there was decreased n uptake that did not impact p uptake tn removal increased from day 27 for s20 and day 30 for s10 fig 4a which coincided with bead deterioration fig 2 the alginate matrix loosening and suspended algal growth fig 2 allowed more n removal at the end of the run suggesting that for s abundans n uptake was reduced as a consequence of growth in the bead environment factors such as light intensity and dic concentration may also have limited n removal tn removal was by nh4 removal for s10 and s20 fig 2b and neither system removed no3 fig 4c this is consistent with assimilation of nh4 in preference to no3 being common for members of the chlorophyceae 28 nh4 removal can be by algal assimilation or volatilisation as nh3 and as nh4 nh3 h has a pka of 9 3 it is promoted as ph increases 29 s10 removing tn and nh4 at a comparable rate to s20 corresponds to there being only small differences in algal growth and ph fig 1 while both c10 and s10 reached 0 05 mg n nh4 l only c vulgaris removed no3 s abundans may have been at maximum growth rate under the reactor conditions and so did not need more n whereas c vulgaris grew faster fig 1a and after nh4 was removed then no3 removal occurred there may also have been a species difference 30 in this case with c vulgaris more prone than s abundans to assimilate no3 3 4 biomethane potential pre treatment of the algal biomass with 500 u g of 1 1 depol 40 lipomod 957 led to greater scod release than for other concentrations fig 5 a and so this concentration was selected to pre treat the algae for the bmp test the scod released from enzymatically pre treated algae 164 9 mg scod g dw was 53 5 greater compared with the scod released from algae without pre treatment 105 2 mg scod g dw however the algal biomass without pre treatment led to greater biomethane production 248 10 ml ch4 g vs than the enzymatically pre treated biomass 178 13 ml ch4 g vs table 3 this demonstrates that there was no benefit in enzymatically pre treating the biomass in this instance the methane yield for the s abundans biomass without pre treatment was greater than that of 210 3 ml ch4 g vs obtained during bmp tests on s obliquus using 1 25 l stoppered flasks at 33 c 31 during bmp tests in 250 ml stoppered flasks at 38 c also with s obliquus a lower yield of 178 6 ml ch4 g vs was achieved this was however the lowest of all algal species tested 32 reviewing methane yields 24 587 ml ch4 g vs from various algae ward et al 33 concluded that biomass from different species needs to be processed differently to maximise ch4 yield due to differences in cell wall structure the bmp test in the current study was conducted under standardised conditions 12 further work could be undertaken to optimise the conditions for maximising methane yield from s abundans comparing the pre treatment results ehimen et al 34 obtained a 8 12 increase in ch4 yield with cellulase and 31 with an enzyme mixture lipase xylanase α amylase protease and cellulase for rhizoclonium suggesting that appropriate selection of enzymes can benefit methane production these gains in ch4 yield need to be balanced against the cost and effort of the pre treatment step the lower generation of ch4 from the pre treated algal biomass in the current study may have been a consequence of a change to the c n ratio 15 or ph 35 which can reduce inoculum activity the enzyme control made a significant contribution of scod 113 4 mg scod g dw and consequently biomethane production 99 6 ml ch4 g vs and so the enzymes may have been preferentially digested over the algal biomass the cumulative ch4 produced from each algal sample fitted the modified gompertz model well r 2 of 0 993 0 996 fig 5b the model was less accurate after the exponential phase approximately day 14 suggesting that the bacteria were generating ch4 from the algae at a slower pace for longer than may be typical for other substrates algal cell walls are difficult to break down 16 which could explain the longer period of biomethane generation there was a lag phase λ for the enzymatically pre treated sample 1 3 d however there was little difference in the rate constant k 19 8 ml ch4 g vs d this indicates that the added enzymes were preferentially digested compared with the algae or they caused initial harm to the bacteria in the inoculum fig 5 the s abundans biomass without pre treatment generated the greatest volume of ch4 had the lowest λ 0 59 d and greatest k 30 5 ml ch4 g vs d indicating the algal biomass could be directly co digested with wastewater sludge in an existing anaerobic digestion process to provide beneficial energy recovery furthermore the concentration of ch4 was independent of whether it was pre treated or not 66 67 and greater than that of the controls containing no algae 57 4 indicating that the algae improved the quality of biogas generated 3 5 practical implications and research perspectives the algal system could be incorporated into existing wastewater treatment trains at the outlet of the activated sludge process the extent of aeration used in the activated sludge process could then be reduced allowing the algal system to remove the consequently higher nh4 concentration this would reduce energy use and fugitive greenhouse gas emissions from the activated sludge process furthermore as simultaneous removal of n and p to low concentrations has been demonstrated this placement would enable the production of good quality water for reuse without the need for additional processes such as chemical precipitation of p there is also potential to treat lagoon effluent as a polishing step prior to discharge to sensitive environments or as a means of resource recovery and increasing the opportunity for water reuse which could help to justify upgrades to lagoon systems and would need significantly smaller land footprint alternatively the algal system could be situated after an initial settling lagoon in addition to the nutrient removal the algal system would lead to increased oxygen content of the treated water to enhance the performance of downstream lagoons without having to provide mechanical aeration another approach could be to initially treat the wastewater anaerobically e g by an upflow anaerobic sludge blanket reactor and then to use algae for nutrient removal and recovery if higher quality water is desired to promote reuse a tertiary treatment step could be added and operated using the energy generated from biomethane this process flowsheet presents a low chemical low energy and low emissions treatment option that enables recovery of resources from the wastewater and provision of high quality water as the final product and thus contributes to the circular economy in process flowsheets such as these where there is digestion on site flue gas from co generation or flaring could be used to fluidise the bed of immobilised algal beads and sequester the co2 by algal growth providing environmental benefit and potentially improving treatment efficiency the reactor in this study utilised led lights wrapped around transparent pvc pipe 68 mm diameter while pilot scale systems trialled in the uk use a grid pattern of rods of led light strips 32 mm apart 36 key aspects of the design of these reactors is the spacing of the lighting to provide optimal light to the culture hence in each scenario the wastewater 1 transmittance and 2 potential to foul surfaces need to be considered considering 1 the bed of algal beads blocks more light than wastewater and so is the limiting factor for spacing of the lighting fluidisation of the bed transports the beads from darker zones further from the lights into brighter zones near the lights further work could be undertaken on the mixing rate of the fluidised bed and the distance between lights as a means of reducing the cost of light provision while providing optimal irradiance levels for algal growth and also on the impact of different light dark cycles considering 2 in this study it was observed that mixing of the fluidised bed provided mechanical cleaning of the pvc surface decreasing biofilm formation and thus preventing a loss of light penetration the surface would still likely require periodic cleaning particularly if treating higher strength wastewaters post treatment the algal biomass can be anaerobically digested for energy generation either on site or the biomass can be dried and trucked to a co generation site as necessary settled algal beads from the immobilised algae reactor can be separated into dissolved alginate and algal cells with the alginate used to generate fresh beads as suggested by murujew et al 14 and the cells co digested with sludge from the treatment steps earlier in the process train methane from co digestion of sludge and algae can be used for generation of electricity the digestate can be used whole or after separation of the liquor which can be spread more easily as n and p rich fertiliser the separated fibre can be used fresh as a soil conditioner or after aerobic composting to stabilise it to be a component of compost products such schemes enable a holistic approach to the recovery of n p and carbonaceous components from wastewater and thus contribution to the circular economy another approach is to extract other high grade products such as liquid biofuel from the harvested microalgae and then anaerobically digest the waste biomass to generate methane as an on site energy source to facilitate the biomass processing and extraction operations 33 the approach of targeting high grade products is particularly appealing for immobilised systems an algal species can be selected that has a high concentration of a certain intracellular product and being within the immobilisation matrix during growth in wastewater means this species will be protected from contamination this could include a high yield of uncommon pigments or fatty acids that provide health benefit a high lipid composition for conversion to bioethanol and higher value fuels a high content of valuable proteins with important nutritional value or contain components that can act as a platform for niche chemicals such as pharmaceuticals 37 39 thus targeting generation of products that have a high value could be a favourable option using an immobilised system 4 conclusion alginate immobilised s abundans and c vulgaris were used to treat secondary effluent with 8 9 mg tp l and supplemented with 10 mg n nh4 l giving 18 3 mg tn l c10 and s10 and 20 mg n nh4 l 27 4 mg tn l s20 in fluidised bed reactors beads of s abundans were more durable when treating the wastewater operating for 30 days compared with c vulgaris 8 days bead durability was independent of the wastewater n concentration however the higher wastewater n concentration contributed to s20 1 17 0 12 108 cells ml producing more cells than s10 8 60 0 72 107 cells ml compared with c vulgaris both the reactors with s abundans achieved greater p removal treating the effluent to 1 mg tp l the s10 and s20 reactors removed tn from the wastewater at a similar rate 16 1 17 0 mg l d reaching 9 8 1 1 mg tn l and 19 5 2 1 mg tn l in the effluent discharge respectively the higher tn concentration did not lead to an increase in tn removal rate indicating a limitation of n uptake by the immobilised cell system greater methane production 248 10 ml ch4 g vs at a higher rate and shorter lag time was obtained from s abundans biomass without pre treatment indicating that addition of the algal biomass to an existing anaerobic sludge digestion process could benefit biomethane production ultimately increasing energy recovery from the wastewater treatment plant and contributing to its becoming carbon neutral application of the digestate to crops as a source of n and p would further enhance the recovery of resources these outcomes indicate the potential of the algal system to provide economic and environmental benefit to the wastewater treatment process this includes reduction in aeration costs energy consumption and fugitive emissions removal of both n and p to concentrations that increase opportunities for water reuse and generation of biomass that increases energy and nutrient

contaminated water creating real problems in water resources management removing oil content from produced water is crucial to meet the discharge limits set by governmental legislation nanocomposites have attracted attention as potential adsorbents due to their high ability to remove oil content from produced water in this work iron oxide bentonite nanocomposites fe3o4 bent nc were synthesized using ultrasound assisted co precipitation methods and evaluated them for oil removal from emulsified oil solutions sem eds tem xrd ftir and vsm were used to characterize the synthesized

adsorption isotherm adsorption kinetics 1 introduction water scarcity is a challenge that is faced worldwide to secure sustainable water resources with good quality for domestic and agricultural use this situation is getting worse in the gulf cooperation council gcc countries with less than 1 of the total worldwide available freshwater resources for 6 of the world population produced water is a wastewater that is produced during the exploration and production of gas and oil 1 it represents around 80 of the residuals and wastes produced and its quantity rises significantly to reach up to 98 in depleted fields 2 the composition of produced water varies according to the location and the type of the oil and gas fields but generally it is characterized by high content of oil and dissolved organics 3 strict governmental legislation to limit the amount of oil and grease in discharged produced water were set according to the u s environmental protection agency the allowable produced water on monthly and daily averages are 29 mg l and 42 mg l respectively 4 therefore it is crucial to treat produced water prior to its discharge a large number of technologies are available for wastewater treatment this includes membrane electrodialysis adsorption etc alongside being cost effective and less time consuming adsorption noticeably decreases the concentration of contaminants to a very low concentration making it stand out among the before mentioned technologies 2 5 however one of the most critical drawback of this technology is the high cost of installation and maintenance 2 the utilization of low cost adsorbents can potentially reduce the cost of installation and maintenance besides it is important to consider the recyclability porosity and separation efficiency of the adsorbents for an effective adsorption process 6 chitosan is a type of adsorbent that is known for its good adsorption capacity along with it is low cost and non toxicity 7 however it has low mechanical strength low solubility in acidic solutions and it can be deformed after drying 8 zeolites and biomass have been suggested as adsorbents but their applications are limited due to low adsorption rates 8 clay minerals are known for their excellent adsorption capabilities but their applications are limited because of the high dispersion of clay minerals in aqueous solutions which makes them difficult to recycle and reuse 9 bentonite is a type of clay minerals made essentially of aluminum phyllosilicate and formed by the alteration of volcanic ash and turf 10 it is characterized by several features such as high surface area swelling capacity cation exchange capacity and high bonding strength 11 12 it is expected that reducing bentonite size to nanometer the specific surface area will be significantly enhanced and resultant material will demonstrate a higher adsorption capacity 13 furthermore bentonite can act as a support material to establish various types of metals and metals oxides on its surface to exploit the composite potential towards different applications 11 iron oxide nanoparticles fe3o4 nps are known for their biological adaption magnetic property large surface to volume ratio environmentally friendly nature and their high ability to remove organic contaminates from wastewater 14 15 encapsulating fe3o4 nps in inorganic matrix e g bentonite facilitates the magnetic composite separation from aqueous solution in the presence of external magnetic field due to fe3o4 nps magnetic property besides the fabricated magnetic composite could have exceptional physicochemical properties including large specific surface area enhanced fe3o4 nps chemical stability and availability of a wider range of active sites 16 synthesis of iron oxide bentonite nanocomposite has been reported in a few studies using various methods for inorganic water contaminates removal and it showed excellent adsorption capability 17 20 generally co precipitation method is preferred over other synthesis techniques because it is simplicity cost effectiveness and operates at relatively low temperature and easy to scale up 21 however fe3o4 nps tend to agglomerate due to their high surface energy the use of sonochemical assisted co precipitation could enhance the composite s adsorption capability by preventing fe3o4 nps agglomeration reducing its particle size and allowing a uniform size distribution 21 in this study iron oxide bentonite nanocomposite fe3o4 bent nc was synthesized using ultrasound assisted co precipitation method the composite was employed for oil removal from oil water emulsion as the composite adsorptive behavior towards organic contaminants has not been reported in the literature the effect of fe3o4 bent nc dosage contact time and oil concentration were investigated furthermore the morphology and the adsorption capability of fe3o4 bent nc were compared to fe3o4 nps to elucidate significant differences in addition the adsorption kinetics and isotherms were studied to determine the physiochemical nature of the adsorption process finally a possible adsorption mechanism of oil onto fe3o4 bent nc has been proposed 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals and materials ferric chloride hexahydrate ar fecl3 6h2o 99 purity ferrous chloride tetrahydrate purified fecl2 4h2o 99 purity and ammonia solution 25

from woqod petrol station in doha qatar 2 2 preparation of fe3o4 nps fe3o4 nps were synthesized using the conventional co precipitation method as described by balaji et al 22 briefly 1 72 g of ferric chloride fecl2 4h2o and 4 72 g of ferrous chloride fecl3 6h2o were dissolved in 80 ml of distilled water under nitrogen environment 10 ml of ammonia 25 were added to the final solution and stirred for 1 hr under nitrogen environment at 80 finally the magnetic nanoparticles were dried in a vacuum oven 2 3 preparation of fe3o4 bent nc fe3o4 bent nc was prepared using ultrasound assisted co precipitation method following the procedures reported by khatamian et al 23 solution a was prepared by dissolving 2 5 grams of ferrous chloride fecl2 4h2o and 1 5 grams of ferric chloride fecl3 6h2o in 100 ml distilled water under continuous stirring in nitrogen environment solution b was prepared by dispersing 2 g of raw bentonite in 15 ml of ammonia 25 at a temperature of 50 usually ammonia and sodium hydroxide naoh were used as reducing agents in co precipitation however ammonia is preferred as it is a better stabilizer than sodium hydroxide naoh and help in the growth of nanoparticle unlike naoh 24 then solution a was added gradually to solution b and left under continuous stirring for 1 h the obtained mixture was moved to an ultrasonic bath for 3 h the synthesized composite material was separated using a magnet and washed with distilled water and ethanol this process was repeated 3 5 times finally the magnetic nanocomposite placed in a vacuum oven to dry 2 4 nanocomposite material characterization the surface morphology of synthesized fe3o4 bent nc and elemental distribution were obtained by scanning electron microscopy sem using a nova nano sem 450 field electron and ion usa coupled with an energy dispersive spectrometer eds details of the nanocomposite internal composition were observed using transmission electron microscope tem tecnai g2 tem tf20 x ray diffraction xrd patterns of fe3o4 bent nc were recorded using rigaku miniflex 600 to understand the surface properties of fe3o4 bent nc transform infrared spectroscopy ftir analyses were conducted using perkin elmer spectrum over a range from 4000 to 500 cm 1 vibrating sample magnetometer vsm was employed to measure the saturation magnetization of fe3o4 bent nc 2 5 synthesis of oil produced water emulsion the emulsified oil solution was prepared using diesel obtained from a local qatari petrol station woqod and deionized di water the emulsion was prepared by adding diesel oil droplets to di water and the mixture was homogenized for 15 minutes at 296 k the concentration of diesel in oil water emulsion was varied from 66 to 170 mg l which is close to the oil concentration in real produced wastewater 25 to dissolve diesel in water a non ionic surfactant ethyle enediamine tetrakis tetrol was used the ratio of surfactant to diesel was adjusted accordingly to obtain the required concentration 3 adsorption batch experiments fe3o4 bent nc with variable dosages from 0 05 to 0 2 g were exposed to oil water emulsion with a specified oil concentration and solution ph for a predetermined mixing time the effect of varying the ph oil initial concentration and contact time between oil solution and adsorbent were studied rotational speed of 200 rpm and a temperature of 298 k were used for all batch experiments in this study samples concentration was measured using total organic carbon shimadzu toc 5000 analyzer the adsorption capacity of adsorbent mg of oil g of nanocomposite was evaluated using equation 1 1 q e c o c e m v where c0 and ce are the oil initial and equilibrium concentration mg l respectively m is the mass of the nanocomposite g and v is the solution volume l the removal efficiency re of oil from oil water emulsion by fe3o4 bent nc was calculated using equation 2 2 r e c o c e c o x 100 4 kinetic and isotherm models the kinetic experiments were carried out by measuring the variation in concentration over time from 0 to 180 minutes at neutral ph 6 5 100 mg l oil initial concentration and 0 1 g of fe3o4 bent nc dosage the adsorption isotherm studies were conducted usinginitial oil concentration ranging from 66 to 170 mg l at a ph of 6 5 0 1 g of adsorbent dosage for 180 minutes in order to interpret the experimental data and find the maximum oil uptake using fe3o4 bent nc different kinetics and isotherms models were used in this study 4 1 kinetic models kinetic models are important to determine the oil removal rate and provide insights into the controlling mechanism of adsorption herein three kinetic models were chosen to interpret the kinetics data of oil adsorption on fe3o4 bent nc namely pseudo first order 26 pseudo second order model 27 and intra particle diffusion model 28 pseudo first order model assumes that the adsorption rate is proportional to the number of available sites this model is described by equation 3 in linear form 26 3 l n q e q t ln q e k 1 t where qt mg g corresponds to the adsorption capacity at time t and k1 min 1 is the first order rate constant pseudo second order model is based on the adsorption equilibrium capacity and is described by equation 4 27 4 t q t 1 k 2 2 q e t q e where k2 g mg min is the second order rate constant weber morris intraparticle diffusion ipd model 28 is an important model as it indicates the rate controlling step during the adsorption process the model can be expressed using the following equation 5 q t k i t c where ki mg g min0 5 is the rate constant and c mg g is the intercept 4 2 isotherm models freundlich langmuir and toth isotherm models were employed in order to understand the type of the interaction between the emulsified oil and fe3o4 bent nc furthermore the isotherm models are capable of indicating the maximum adsorption capacity the freundlich isotherm model assumes the adsorbent surface is heterogeneous and can be represented by equation 6 6 q e k f c e 1 n where n is the freundlich empirical constant and it indicates the adsorption efficiency kf ln mg1 n g n is associated with the adsorption capacity equation 6 can be linearized and expressed as 7 ln q e ln k f 1 n ln c e langmuir isotherm indicates a monolayer adsorption of pollutant on a homogenous adsorbent surface that has identical energy sites the langmuir isotherm is expressed by the equation 8 q e q m k l c e 1 k l c e kl l mg and qm mg g represent the langmuir constant and the maximum adsorption capacity respectively equation 8 can be linearized and expressed as 9 c e q e 1 k q m 1 q m c e the toth isotherm model 29 assumes a heterogeneous adsorption processes where a multi layer adsorption occurs and a quasi garussian energy distribution the toth isotherm can be expressed as follows 10 q e q m c e k t h c e t 1 t where kth mg l t is the toth isotherm constant t is the dimensionless constant where it indicates the level system heterogeneity as t deviates from 1 the more heterogeneous is the system 5 results and dissuasion 5 1 characterization of nanomaterials 5 1 1 sem analysis the surface morphology of uncoated and coated bentonite adsorbents can be observed using sem fig 1 shows the sem images of fe3o4 np a and fe3o4 bent nc at different magnification b and c the sem images for fe3o4 bent nc in fig 1 b and c indicate the distribution of fe3o4 np on bentonite clay it can be observed from fig 2 b and c that fe3o4 nps are uniformly distributed on the bentonite clay the use of ultrasonic waves causes the particles to disperse due to cavitation and explosion process of bubbles that results from the high shear stress applied on the particles consequently the process of cavitation can accelerate the sild particles to move with a high speed and the resultant collisions can potentially produce significant changes in the morphology 31 this fact is also confirmed by the images revealed from tem where the uniform distribution of fe3o4 np on bentonite s surface is obvious 5 1 2 edx analysis the elemental weight percent composition of the synthesized fe3o4 np and fe3o4 bent nc obtained from energy dispersive x ray spectroscopy eds are shown in table 1 the eds results confirm the presence of iron fe and oxygen o in fe3o4 nps the formation of fe3o4 bent nc is also confirmed by eds the eds data for fe3o4 bent nc affirms the presence of mainly iron fe and oxygen o carbon c silica si and aluminium al elements with traces of magnesium mg chlore cl and titanium ti the main components were iron fe and oxygen o carbon c with average weight percentage of 49 31 35 and 14 44 respectively the existence of na and absence of ca from the composition reveals that the bentonite is sodium based 5 1 3 tem analysis the obtained tem images are shown in fig 2 a represent fe3o4 nps at 100 nm while b and c represent fe3o4 bent nc at 100 nm scale and 50 nm scale respectively fig 2 a shows the agglomeration of fe3o4 nps similar to what was shown by sem images in fig 1 a this could be attributed to their high surface energy they attain as result of large surface to volume ratio 30 another reason could be due to the strength of the magnetic force between the particles 31 fig 2 b and c show a uniform distribution of iron oxide nanoparticles on the bentonite surface due to the application of ultrasound waves additionally the particle size of iron oxide nanoparticles on bentonite s surface has an average value of 13 55 nm while fe3o4 nps at 100 nm average diameter was 13 65 nm this indicates that ultrasound waves have a slight effect on the particle size yet they significantly affected the distribution of iron oxide on bentonite surface 5 1 4 xrd analysis the crystalline structure and phase purity for the synthesized fe3o4 nanoparticles and their attachment onto the bentonite surface were investigated by the xrd pattern shown in fig 3 the fe3o4 nanoparticles were found to have a face centered cubic lattice fcc crystal structure the diffraction peaks of fe3o4 nanoparticles were found to be in 2theta values 30 24 35 62 43 26 53 s6 57 12 and 62 78 which are in good agreement with planes of 220 311 400 422 511 and 440 as reported previously 32 however the presence of sharper peaks at standard position of 2 theta degree of the xrd pattern reveals the presence of bentonite in pure form which is in agreement with findings reported in other studies 33 35 after loading fe3o4 nanoparticles onto the surface bentonite xrd patterns show only peaks of fe3o4 nanoparticles 30 24 35 62 43 26 53 s6 57 12 and 62 78 with no other peaks which confirms that fe3o4 nanoparticles cover the entire bentonite surface the xrd pattern confirm successful deposition of fe3o4 nanoparticles onto bentonite surface with a good distribution as already shown in tem analysis results 5 1 5 ftir analysis the ftir spectrum presented in fig 4 a shows the functional groups on the surface of fe3o4 bent nc the absorption peak at approximately 598 cm 1 can be ascribed to fe o vibrational mode of fe3o4 nanoparticles the absorption peaks at 3604 cm 1 and 1692 cm 1 correspond to stretching vibration of oh water and feoo 36 additionally the other broad absorption peak at 1038 cm 1 can be attributed to si o si while 609 cm 1 can be ascribed to the bending vibration of si o al group 37 these results show the successful decoration of bentonite surface by fe3o4 as confirmed by xrd and tem analyses results the ftir spectra of fe3o4 bent nc after diesel oil adsorption is represented in fig 2b the figure clearly shows the appearance of new peaks at 1057 cm 1 and 2922 cm 1 which is attributed to the stretching vibration of c o and c h respectively 38 in addition the peak sharpness intensity was increased at 1038 cm 1 1429 cm 1 and 3604 cm 1 and this confirms the interaction between fe3o4 bent nc with the hydrocarbon chain presented in the emulsified diesel oil 5 1 6 vsm analysis the magnetization behavior of fe3o4 bent nc at room temperature is presented in fig 5 the figure shows that the saturation magnetization value of fe3o4 bent nc is 72 0 emu g moreover the pattern suggests that fe3o4 bent nc exhibits a superparamagnetic properties as no remanence was observed in their hysteresis loop the particle size and cation distribution are correlated to the magnetization which explains the high saturation magnetism value the nanocomposite attains 23 5 2 adsorption study 5 2 1 effect of adsorbent dosage the impact of varying fe3o4 nps and fe3o4 bent nc dosage from 0 05 grams to 0 2 grams on oil removal is represented in fig 6 all other experimental parameters were maintained constant this includes oil initial concentration of 100 ppm contact time of 90 minutes and ph 6 5 the figure clearly indicates the significant difference between fe3o4 nps and fe3o4 bent nc on oil removal capability which proves the composite s excellent performance over fe3o4 nps initially a removal percentage of 18 was achieved using 0 05 g of fe3o4 nps followed by an increase up to 28 24 when the dosage was increased to 0 10 g after that no further increase in the removal percentage was observed furthermore the figure demonstrates a remarkable increase in oil removal percentage as the fe3o4 bent nc dosage was increased from 0 05 g to 0 1 g which is attributed to the increase in the unoccupied adsorption sites and functional groups on the fe3o4 bent nc surface however for the dosage increase from 0 1 g to 0 2 g the change in the removal percentage was not significant this could be due to the agglomeration of the nanocomposite which potentially reduced the surface area available for adsorption 39 this suggests that 0 1 g contains the required number of active sites to attain the maximum removal thus a determined optimum mass of 0 1 g was then used to carry out the rest of the experiments 5 2 2 effect of ph the surface charge adsorbent stability and pollutant structure are greatly affected by the changes in ph 40 therefore the emulsified oil ph effect on fe3o4 bentonite nc adsorption capability was studied by varying the ph from 3 0 to 9 0 using 0 1 g of adsorbent and 100 ppm oil concentration for 90 min contact time as shown in fig 7 the oil removal increased by increasing ph up to a maximum ph of 6 5 which is the neutral ph of the emulsified oil water solution then the removal decreased to reach a minimum removal percentage at ph 9 generally the removal percentage in acidic or alkaline conditions are lower than the neutral condition this behavior could be due to the partial dissociation of the surface functional groups in acidic or alkaline emulsified oil water solution which results in electrostatic repulsion between the oil droplets and fe3o4 bentonite nc 41 the poor performance in alkaline conditions compared to neutral and acidic condition could attributed to the higher electrostatic repulsion between the fe3o4 bentonite nc and the oil deports 42 5 2 3 effect of contact time fig 8 shows the effect of varying the contact time between the fe3o4 bent nc and the emulsified oil solution on the oil removal initially the adsorption of oil increased due to the availability of active sites the equilibrium was reached after 90 minutes with a maximum removal of 67 after that no remarkable change in the emulsified oil concentration was observed which indicates the saturation of adsorption sites 7 5 2 4 effect of initial concentration the effect of initial oil concentration on the removal performance of emulsified oil by fe3o4 bent nc was carried out by changing the initial oil concentration from 66 to 170 mg l at ph 6 5 adsorbent concentration of 0 1 g and contact time of 180 min the equilibrium adsorption amount and the removal percentage are represented in fig 9 the figure indicates a negative correlation between removal percentage and initial oil concentration this could be due to the reduction in the saturation concentration value with a higher initial concentration which cause the removal percentage to decrease 43 6 adsorption isotherms the equilibrium isotherms models are important to describe the interactive behavior between the solution and the adsorbents in which either physical or chemical mechanism dominates the adsorption process 44 furthermore the equilibrium adsorption capacity of adsorbents can be determined from isotherm models which is a crucial parameter in the design of adsorption contactors the experimental equilibrium data obtained were fitted using langmuir equation 8 freundlich equation 6 and toth equation 10 models based on fig 10 a and b langmuir and freundlich parameters were determined from the slope and the intercept of each equilibrium graph langmuir model is based on the assumption that the adsorption is a monolayer and occurs on a uniform adsorbent surface with the same sites energy without any interaction between the adsorbed ions 45 46 freundlich and toth models assumes a heterogeneous surface where a multi layer adsorption occurs 47 the numerical values of isotherms coefficient are shown in table 2 respectively langmuir model indicates that qm was found to be 54 05 mg g from freundlich model n was found to be 2 37 which proves an effective adsorption process 48 the constant t in toth model indicates the degree of the heterogeneity as it deviates from 1 6 toth model was attained by non linear regression 49 the model parameter values obtained were optimized using solver add on in excel comparing the langmuir freundlich and toth models parameters in table 2 the langmuir isotherm best fitted the equilibrium data as its correlation coefficient r2 attained a value of 0 9828 while freundlich and toth models corresponded to r2 value of 0 8994 and 0 9264 respectively based on these values the experimental data best fit langmuir isotherm model which indicates a monolayer distribution of oil on identical and homogenous active sites of fe3o4 bent nc one of the most important features of langmuir isotherm is a constant called separation factor which is expressed as follows 50 11 r l 1 1 k l c 0 the separation factor rl indicates the type of the adsorption according to the rl value compared to 1 in which 1 unfavorable when rl 1 2 linear when rl 1 3 favorable when 0 rl 1 3 irreversible when rl 0 fig 11 shows the values of rl for adsorption of emulsified oil onto fe3o4 bent nc which indicates that the adsorption is favorable as rl lies within the favorable limit 51 7 adsorption kinetics the adsorption of oil kinetics using fe3o4 bent nc was investigated using the three different kinetics models which are pseudo first order pseudo second order and intraparticle diffusion models fig 12 shows the linearized results for the three kinetics models additionally the kinetics parameters of the fitted models are presented in table 3 it is clear from fig 12 a that the kinetics experimental data do not fit well the pseudo first order kinetic model since the correlation constant r2 attained a value of 0 6709 however pseudo second order kinetic model fig 12 b shows a better fitting to the experimental data as r2 attained a value of 0 9868 this indicates that adsorption kinetics of oil onto fe3o4 bent nc is best described by pseudo second order kinetic model fig 12 c for the intra particle diffusion model shows the involvement of three stages of complex steps in the adsorption process two linear and one curved transition portion the first linear part is associated with the surface adsorption in which the oil particles diffuse to the external surface of fe3o4 bent nc adsorbent with a diffusion rate constant of ki1 the second intermediate stage curved portion represents the external boundary layer diffusion the last linear stage corresponds to the diffusion through interior surface of fe3o4 bent nc with a diffusion rate constant ki2 as shown in table 3 the value of ki1 is greater than ki2 which indicates that the interior pore diffusion is the rate limiting step 43 the influence of the boundary layer is represented by the intercept c the numerical values of c1 and c2 shown in table 3 reveal that the intra particle diffusion is not the only rate limiting step since c does not pass through the zero point 43 in addition the larger the value of c the greater the influence of the boundary layer on the diffusion process 51 8 adsorption mechanism diesel oil consists of hydrocarbons as a major constituent and it does not dissolve in water due to its hydrophobic characteristics the adsorption of oil onto fe3o4 bent nc cannot be brought out without adding a surfactant that dissolves oil in water the surfactant consist of hydrophobic tail and hydrophilic head that are orientated towards oil and water phase respectively based on the adsorption data the adsorption process is best described by pseudo second order kinetic model that indicates a chemisorption process the ftir spectra confirm that the adsorption is a chemisorption process as it shows by the formation of new peaks c o and c h furthermore the increase in o h si oh and si o si peak intensity sharpness implies a strong interaction between the diesel oil and the nanocomposite moreover the nanocomposite could have a hydrophobic interaction with oil and tends to adsorb oil molecules due to the hydrophobic nature of bentonite and iron oxide 52 53 in addition the ftir spectra show no shift in fe3o4 bent nc peaks after oil adsorption which indicates that the hydrophobicity interaction has an important role in the adsorption process 54 fig 13 illustrates the feasible mechanism of oil removal using fe3o4 bent nc 9 conclusion in this study fe3o4 bent nc were successfully synthesized using ultrasound assisted co precipitation method the characteristics of the fe3o4 bent nc were tested with various characterization techniques including sem edx tem ftir xrd and vsm the tem results showed that the fe3o4 nps synthesized by conventional co precipitation attained a particle size 3 65 nm and tends to agglomerate while fe3o4 nps in the fabricated composite were uniformly distributed over bentonite surface with a particle size of 3 55 nm this suggests that ultrasonic waves had a negligible effect on fe3o4 nps size but a significant effect on their distribution over bentonite surface furthermore the vsm results indicated that fe3o4 bent nc exhibits a superparamagnetic properties with a sufficient magnetization synthesized fe3o4 bent nc were employed as nano adsorbent to remove oil content from a water oil emulsion the assessment of nano adsorbent dosage oil initial concentration adsorption time and solution ph on the adsorption efficiency of oil was carried out in batch experiments a removal percentage of 67 after 90 minutes using only 0 1 grams at 100 ppm oil concentration was obtained the experimental data were best represented by langmuir isotherm model which suggests a monolayer adsorption of oil onto synthesized fe3o4 bent nc the kinetics data were best described using pseudo second order kinetics model the adsorption of oil onto fe3o4 bent nc is mostly through chemical bonding and hydrophobic interaction overall these findings prove that the prepared composite is a promising and effective adsorbent for

overall this study confirms the applicability of fe3o4 bent nc as a feasible adsorbent for oil removal from produced water keywords fe3o4 bentonite nanocomposite ultrasound oil water emulsion adsorption isotherm adsorption kinetics 1 introduction water scarcity is a challenge that is faced worldwide to secure sustainable water resources with good quality for domestic and agricultural use this situation is getting worse in the gulf cooperation council gcc countries with less than 1 of the total worldwide available freshwater resources for 6 of the world population produced water is a wastewater that is produced during the exploration and production of gas and oil 1 it represents around 80 of the residuals and wastes produced and its quantity rises significantly to reach up to 98 in depleted fields 2 the composition of produced water varies according to the location and the type of the oil and gas fields but generally it is characterized by high content of oil and dissolved organics 3 strict governmental legislation to limit the amount of oil and grease in discharged produced water were set according to the u s environmental protection agency the allowable produced water on monthly and daily averages are 29 mg l and 42 mg l respectively 4 therefore it is crucial to treat produced water prior to its discharge a large number of technologies are available for wastewater treatment this includes membrane electrodialysis adsorption etc alongside being cost effective and less time consuming adsorption noticeably decreases the concentration of contaminants to a very low concentration making it stand out among the before mentioned technologies 2 5 however one of the most critical drawback of this technology is the high cost of installation and maintenance 2 the utilization of low cost adsorbents can potentially reduce the cost of installation and maintenance besides it is important to consider the recyclability porosity and separation efficiency of the adsorbents for an effective adsorption process 6 chitosan is a type of adsorbent that is known for its good adsorption capacity along with it is low cost and non toxicity 7 however it has low mechanical strength low solubility in acidic solutions and it can be deformed after drying 8 zeolites and biomass have been suggested as adsorbents but their applications are limited due to low adsorption rates 8 clay minerals are known for their excellent adsorption capabilities but their applications are limited because of the high dispersion of clay minerals in aqueous solutions which makes them difficult to recycle and reuse 9 bentonite is a type of clay minerals made essentially of aluminum phyllosilicate and formed by the alteration of volcanic ash and turf 10 it is characterized by several features such as high surface area swelling capacity cation exchange capacity and high bonding strength 11 12 it is expected that reducing bentonite size to nanometer the specific surface area will be significantly enhanced and resultant material will demonstrate a higher adsorption capacity 13 furthermore bentonite can act as a support material to establish various types of metals and metals oxides on its surface to exploit the composite potential towards different applications 11 iron oxide nanoparticles fe3o4 nps are known for their biological adaption magnetic property large surface to volume ratio environmentally friendly nature and their high ability to remove organic contaminates from wastewater 14 15 encapsulating fe3o4 nps in inorganic matrix e g bentonite facilitates the magnetic composite separation from aqueous solution in the presence of external magnetic field due to fe3o4 nps magnetic property besides the fabricated magnetic composite could have exceptional physicochemical properties including large specific surface area enhanced fe3o4 nps chemical stability and availability of a wider range of active sites 16 synthesis of iron oxide bentonite nanocomposite has been reported in a few studies using various methods for inorganic water contaminates removal and it showed excellent adsorption capability 17 20 generally co precipitation method is preferred over other synthesis techniques because it is simplicity cost effectiveness and operates at relatively low temperature and easy to scale up 21 however fe3o4 nps tend to agglomerate due to their high surface energy the use of sonochemical assisted co precipitation could enhance the composite s adsorption capability by preventing fe3o4 nps agglomeration reducing its particle size and allowing a uniform size distribution 21 in this study iron oxide bentonite nanocomposite fe3o4 bent nc was synthesized using ultrasound assisted co precipitation method the composite was employed for oil removal from oil water emulsion as the composite adsorptive behavior towards organic contaminants has not been reported in the literature the effect of fe3o4 bent nc dosage contact time and oil concentration were investigated furthermore the morphology and the adsorption capability of fe3o4 bent nc were compared to fe3o4 nps to elucidate significant differences in addition the adsorption kinetics and isotherms were studied to determine the physiochemical nature of the adsorption process finally a possible adsorption mechanism of oil onto fe3o4 bent nc has been proposed 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals and materials ferric chloride hexahydrate ar fecl3 6h2o 99 purity ferrous chloride tetrahydrate purified fecl2 4h2o 99 purity and ammonia solution 25

using perkin elmer spectrum over a range from 4000 to 500 cm 1 vibrating sample magnetometer vsm was employed to measure the saturation magnetization of fe3o4 bent nc 2 5 synthesis of oil produced water emulsion the emulsified oil solution was prepared using diesel obtained from a local qatari petrol station woqod and deionized di water the emulsion was prepared by adding diesel oil droplets to di water and the mixture was homogenized for 15 minutes at 296 k the concentration of diesel in oil water emulsion was varied from 66 to 170 mg l which is close to the oil concentration in real produced wastewater 25 to dissolve diesel in water a non ionic surfactant ethyle enediamine tetrakis tetrol was used the ratio of surfactant to diesel was adjusted accordingly to obtain the required concentration 3 adsorption batch experiments fe3o4 bent nc with variable dosages from 0 05 to 0 2 g were exposed to oil water emulsion with a specified oil concentration and solution ph for a predetermined mixing time the effect of varying the ph oil initial concentration and contact time between oil solution and adsorbent were studied rotational speed of 200 rpm and a temperature of 298 k were used for all batch experiments in this study samples concentration was measured using total organic carbon shimadzu toc 5000 analyzer the adsorption capacity of adsorbent mg of oil g of nanocomposite was evaluated using equation 1 1 q e c o c e m v where c0 and ce are the oil initial and equilibrium concentration mg l respectively m is the mass of the nanocomposite g and v is the solution volume l the removal efficiency re of oil from oil water emulsion by fe3o4 bent nc was calculated using equation 2 2 r e c o c e c o x 100 4 kinetic and isotherm models the kinetic experiments were carried out by measuring the variation in concentration over time from 0 to 180 minutes at neutral ph 6 5 100 mg l oil initial concentration and 0 1 g of fe3o4 bent nc dosage the adsorption isotherm studies were conducted usinginitial oil concentration ranging from 66 to 170 mg l at a ph of 6 5 0 1 g of adsorbent dosage for 180 minutes in order to interpret the experimental data and find the maximum oil uptake using fe3o4 bent nc different kinetics and isotherms models were used in this study 4 1 kinetic models kinetic models are important to determine the oil removal rate and provide insights into the controlling mechanism of adsorption herein three kinetic models were chosen to interpret the kinetics data of oil adsorption on fe3o4 bent nc namely pseudo first order 26 pseudo second order model 27 and intra particle diffusion model 28 pseudo first order model assumes that the adsorption rate is proportional to the number of available sites this model is described by equation 3 in linear form 26 3 l n q e q t ln q e k 1 t where qt mg g corresponds to the adsorption capacity at time t and k1 min 1 is the first order rate constant pseudo second order model is based on the adsorption equilibrium capacity and is described by equation 4 27 4 t q t 1 k 2 2 q e t q e where k2 g mg min is the second order rate constant weber morris intraparticle diffusion ipd model 28 is an important model as it indicates the rate controlling step during the adsorption process the model can be expressed using the following equation 5 q t k i t c where ki mg g min0 5 is the rate constant and c mg g is the intercept 4 2 isotherm models freundlich langmuir and toth isotherm models were employed in order to understand the type of the interaction between the emulsified oil and fe3o4 bent nc furthermore the isotherm models are capable of indicating the maximum adsorption capacity the freundlich isotherm model assumes the adsorbent surface is heterogeneous and can be represented by equation 6 6 q e k f c e 1 n where n is the freundlich empirical constant and it indicates the adsorption efficiency kf ln mg1 n g n is associated with the adsorption capacity equation 6 can be linearized and expressed as 7 ln q e ln k f 1 n ln c e langmuir isotherm indicates a monolayer adsorption of pollutant on a homogenous adsorbent surface that has identical energy sites the langmuir isotherm is expressed by the equation 8 q e q m k l c e 1 k l c e kl l mg and qm mg g represent the langmuir constant and the maximum adsorption capacity respectively equation 8 can be linearized and expressed as 9 c e q e 1 k q m 1 q m c e the toth isotherm model 29 assumes a heterogeneous adsorption processes where a multi layer adsorption occurs and a quasi garussian energy distribution the toth isotherm can be expressed as follows 10 q e q m c e k t h c e t 1 t where kth mg l t is the toth isotherm constant t is the dimensionless constant where it indicates the level system heterogeneity as t deviates from 1 the more heterogeneous is the system 5 results and dissuasion 5 1 characterization of nanomaterials 5 1 1 sem analysis the surface morphology of uncoated and coated bentonite adsorbents can be observed using sem fig 1 shows the sem images of fe3o4 np a and fe3o4 bent nc at different magnification b and c the sem images for fe3o4 bent nc in fig 1 b and c indicate the distribution of fe3o4 np on bentonite clay it can be observed from fig 2 b and c that fe3o4 nps are uniformly distributed on the bentonite clay the use of ultrasonic waves causes the particles to disperse due to cavitation and explosion process of bubbles that results from the high shear stress applied on the particles consequently the process of cavitation can accelerate the sild particles to move with a high speed and the resultant collisions can potentially produce significant changes in the morphology 31 this fact is also confirmed by the images revealed from tem where the uniform distribution of fe3o4 np on bentonite s surface is obvious 5 1 2 edx analysis the elemental weight percent composition of the synthesized fe3o4 np and fe3o4 bent nc obtained from energy dispersive x ray spectroscopy eds are shown in table 1 the eds results confirm the presence of iron fe and oxygen o in fe3o4 nps the formation of fe3o4 bent nc is also confirmed by eds the eds data for fe3o4 bent nc affirms the presence of mainly iron fe and oxygen o carbon c silica si and aluminium al elements with traces of magnesium mg chlore cl and titanium ti the main components were iron fe and oxygen o carbon c with average weight percentage of 49 31 35 and 14 44 respectively the existence of na and absence of ca from the composition reveals that the bentonite is sodium based 5 1 3 tem analysis the obtained tem images are shown in fig 2 a represent fe3o4 nps at 100 nm while b and c represent fe3o4 bent nc at 100 nm scale and 50 nm scale respectively fig 2 a shows the agglomeration of fe3o4 nps similar to what was shown by sem images in fig 1 a this could be attributed to their high surface energy they attain as result of large surface to volume ratio 30 another reason could be due to the strength of the magnetic force between the particles 31 fig 2 b and c show a uniform distribution of iron oxide nanoparticles on the bentonite surface due to the application of ultrasound waves additionally the particle size of iron oxide nanoparticles on bentonite s surface has an average value of 13 55 nm while fe3o4 nps at 100 nm average diameter was 13 65 nm this indicates that ultrasound waves have a slight effect on the particle size yet they significantly affected the distribution of iron oxide on bentonite surface 5 1 4 xrd analysis the crystalline structure and phase purity for the synthesized fe3o4 nanoparticles and their attachment onto the bentonite surface were investigated by the xrd pattern shown in fig 3 the fe3o4 nanoparticles were found to have a face centered cubic lattice fcc crystal structure the diffraction peaks of fe3o4 nanoparticles were found to be in 2theta values 30 24 35 62 43 26 53 s6 57 12 and 62 78 which are in good agreement with planes of 220 311 400 422 511 and 440 as reported previously 32 however the presence of sharper peaks at standard position of 2 theta degree of the xrd pattern reveals the presence of bentonite in pure form which is in agreement with findings reported in other studies 33 35 after loading fe3o4 nanoparticles onto the surface bentonite xrd patterns show only peaks of fe3o4 nanoparticles 30 24 35 62 43 26 53 s6 57 12 and 62 78 with no other peaks which confirms that fe3o4 nanoparticles cover the entire bentonite surface the xrd pattern confirm successful deposition of fe3o4 nanoparticles onto bentonite surface with a good distribution as already shown in tem analysis results 5 1 5 ftir analysis the ftir spectrum presented in fig 4 a shows the functional groups on the surface of fe3o4 bent nc the absorption peak at approximately 598 cm 1 can be ascribed to fe o vibrational mode of fe3o4 nanoparticles the absorption peaks at 3604 cm 1 and 1692 cm 1 correspond to stretching vibration of oh water and feoo 36 additionally the other broad absorption peak at 1038 cm 1 can be attributed to si o si while 609 cm 1 can be ascribed to the bending vibration of si o al group 37 these results show the successful decoration of bentonite surface by fe3o4 as confirmed by xrd and tem analyses results the ftir spectra of fe3o4 bent nc after diesel oil adsorption is represented in fig 2b the figure clearly shows the appearance of new peaks at 1057 cm 1 and 2922 cm 1 which is attributed to the stretching vibration of c o and c h respectively 38 in addition the peak sharpness intensity was increased at 1038 cm 1 1429 cm 1 and 3604 cm 1 and this confirms the interaction between fe3o4 bent nc with the hydrocarbon chain presented in the emulsified diesel oil 5 1 6 vsm analysis the magnetization behavior of fe3o4 bent nc at room temperature is presented in fig 5 the figure shows that the saturation magnetization value of fe3o4 bent nc is 72 0 emu g moreover the pattern suggests that fe3o4 bent nc exhibits a superparamagnetic properties as no remanence was observed in their hysteresis loop the particle size and cation distribution are correlated to the magnetization which explains the high saturation magnetism value the nanocomposite attains 23 5 2 adsorption study 5 2 1 effect of adsorbent dosage the impact of varying fe3o4 nps and fe3o4 bent nc dosage from 0 05 grams to 0 2 grams on oil removal is represented in fig 6 all other experimental parameters were maintained constant this includes oil initial concentration of 100 ppm contact time of 90 minutes and ph 6 5 the figure clearly indicates the significant difference between fe3o4 nps and fe3o4 bent nc on oil removal capability which proves the composite s excellent performance over fe3o4 nps initially a removal percentage of 18 was achieved using 0 05 g of fe3o4 nps followed by an increase up to 28 24 when the dosage was increased to 0 10 g after that no further increase in the removal percentage was observed furthermore the figure demonstrates a remarkable increase in oil removal percentage as the fe3o4 bent nc dosage was increased from 0 05 g to 0 1 g which is attributed to the increase in the unoccupied adsorption sites and functional groups on the fe3o4 bent nc surface however for the dosage increase from 0 1 g to 0 2 g the change in the removal percentage was not significant this could be due to the agglomeration of the nanocomposite which potentially reduced the surface area available for adsorption 39 this suggests that 0 1 g contains the required number of active sites to attain the maximum removal thus a determined optimum mass of 0 1 g was then used to carry out the rest of the experiments 5 2 2 effect of ph the surface charge adsorbent stability and pollutant structure are greatly affected by the changes in ph 40 therefore the emulsified oil ph effect on fe3o4 bentonite nc adsorption capability was studied by varying the ph from 3 0 to 9 0 using 0 1 g of adsorbent and 100 ppm oil concentration for 90 min contact time as shown in fig 7 the oil removal increased by increasing ph up to a maximum ph of 6 5 which is the neutral ph of the emulsified oil water solution then the removal decreased to reach a minimum removal percentage at ph 9 generally the removal percentage in acidic or alkaline conditions are lower than the neutral condition this behavior could be due to the partial dissociation of the surface functional groups in acidic or alkaline emulsified oil water solution which results in electrostatic repulsion between the oil droplets and fe3o4 bentonite nc 41 the poor performance in alkaline conditions compared to neutral and acidic condition could attributed to the higher electrostatic repulsion between the fe3o4 bentonite nc and the oil deports 42 5 2 3 effect of contact time fig 8 shows the effect of varying the contact time between the fe3o4 bent nc and the emulsified oil solution on the oil removal initially the adsorption of oil increased due to the availability of active sites the equilibrium was reached after 90 minutes with a maximum removal of 67 after that no remarkable change in the emulsified oil concentration was observed which indicates the saturation of adsorption sites 7 5 2 4 effect of initial concentration the effect of initial oil concentration on the removal performance of emulsified oil by fe3o4 bent nc was carried out by changing the initial oil concentration from 66 to 170 mg l at ph 6 5 adsorbent concentration of 0 1 g and contact time of 180 min the equilibrium adsorption amount and the removal percentage are represented in fig 9 the figure indicates a negative correlation between removal percentage and initial oil concentration this could be due to the reduction in the saturation concentration value with a higher initial concentration which cause the removal percentage to decrease 43 6 adsorption isotherms the equilibrium isotherms models are important to describe the interactive behavior between the solution and the adsorbents in which either physical or chemical mechanism dominates the adsorption process 44 furthermore the equilibrium adsorption capacity of adsorbents can be determined from isotherm models which is a crucial parameter in the design of adsorption contactors the experimental equilibrium data obtained were fitted using langmuir equation 8 freundlich equation 6 and toth equation 10 models based on fig 10 a and b langmuir and freundlich parameters were determined from the slope and the intercept of each equilibrium graph langmuir model is based on the assumption that the adsorption is a monolayer and occurs on a uniform adsorbent surface with the same sites energy without any interaction between the adsorbed ions 45 46 freundlich and toth models assumes a heterogeneous surface where a multi layer adsorption occurs 47 the numerical values of isotherms coefficient are shown in table 2 respectively langmuir model indicates that qm was found to be 54 05 mg g from freundlich model n was found to be 2 37 which proves an effective adsorption process 48 the constant t in toth model indicates the degree of the heterogeneity as it deviates from 1 6 toth model was attained by non linear regression 49 the model parameter values obtained were optimized using solver add on in excel comparing the langmuir freundlich and toth models parameters in table 2 the langmuir isotherm best fitted the equilibrium data as its correlation coefficient r2 attained a value of 0 9828 while freundlich and toth models corresponded to r2 value of 0 8994 and 0 9264 respectively based on these values the experimental data best fit langmuir isotherm model which indicates a monolayer distribution of oil on identical and homogenous active sites of fe3o4 bent nc one of the most important features of langmuir isotherm is a constant called separation factor which is expressed as follows 50 11 r l 1 1 k l c 0 the separation factor rl indicates the type of the adsorption according to the rl value compared to 1 in which 1 unfavorable when rl 1 2 linear when rl 1 3 favorable when 0 rl 1 3 irreversible when rl 0 fig 11 shows the values of rl for adsorption of emulsified oil onto fe3o4 bent nc which indicates that the adsorption is favorable as rl lies within the favorable limit 51 7 adsorption kinetics the adsorption of oil kinetics using fe3o4 bent nc was investigated using the three different kinetics models which are pseudo first order pseudo second order and intraparticle diffusion models fig 12 shows the linearized results for the three kinetics models additionally the kinetics parameters of the fitted models are presented in table 3 it is clear from fig 12 a that the kinetics experimental data do not fit well the pseudo first order kinetic model since the correlation constant r2 attained a value of 0 6709 however pseudo second order kinetic model fig 12 b shows a better fitting to the experimental data as r2 attained a value of 0 9868 this indicates that adsorption kinetics of oil onto fe3o4 bent nc is best described by pseudo second order kinetic model fig 12 c for the intra particle diffusion model shows the involvement of three stages of complex steps in the adsorption process two linear and one curved transition portion the first linear part is associated with the surface adsorption in which the oil particles diffuse to the external surface of fe3o4 bent nc adsorbent with a diffusion rate constant of ki1 the second intermediate stage curved portion represents the external boundary layer diffusion the last linear stage corresponds to the diffusion through interior surface of fe3o4 bent nc with a diffusion rate constant ki2 as shown in table 3 the value of ki1 is greater than ki2 which indicates that the interior pore diffusion is the rate limiting step 43 the influence of the boundary layer is represented by the intercept c the numerical values of c1 and c2 shown in table 3 reveal that the intra particle diffusion is not the only rate limiting step since c does not pass through the zero point 43 in addition the larger the value of c the greater the influence of the boundary layer on the diffusion process 51 8 adsorption mechanism diesel oil consists of hydrocarbons as a major constituent and it does not dissolve in water due to its hydrophobic characteristics the adsorption of oil onto fe3o4 bent nc cannot be brought out without adding a surfactant that dissolves oil in water the surfactant consist of hydrophobic tail and hydrophilic head that are orientated towards oil and water phase respectively based on the adsorption data the adsorption process is best described by pseudo second order kinetic model that indicates a chemisorption process the ftir spectra confirm that the adsorption is a chemisorption process as it shows by the formation of new peaks c o and c h furthermore the increase in o h si oh and si o si peak intensity sharpness implies a strong interaction between the diesel oil and the nanocomposite moreover the nanocomposite could have a hydrophobic interaction with oil and tends to adsorb oil molecules due to the hydrophobic nature of bentonite and iron oxide 52 53 in addition the ftir spectra show no shift in fe3o4 bent nc peaks after oil adsorption which indicates that the hydrophobicity interaction has an important role in the adsorption process 54 fig 13 illustrates the feasible mechanism of oil removal using fe3o4 bent nc 9 conclusion in this study fe3o4 bent nc were successfully synthesized using ultrasound assisted co precipitation method the characteristics of the fe3o4 bent nc were tested with various characterization techniques including sem edx tem ftir xrd and vsm the tem results showed that the fe3o4 nps synthesized by conventional co precipitation attained a particle size 3 65 nm and tends to agglomerate while fe3o4 nps in the fabricated composite were uniformly distributed over bentonite surface with a particle size of 3 55 nm this suggests that ultrasonic waves had a negligible effect on fe3o4 nps size but a significant effect on their distribution over bentonite surface furthermore the vsm results indicated that fe3o4 bent nc exhibits a superparamagnetic properties with a sufficient magnetization synthesized fe3o4 bent nc were employed as nano adsorbent to remove oil content from a water oil emulsion the assessment of nano adsorbent dosage oil initial concentration adsorption time and solution ph on the adsorption efficiency of oil was carried out in batch experiments a removal percentage of 67 after 90 minutes using only 0 1 grams at 100 ppm oil concentration was obtained the experimental data were best represented by langmuir isotherm model which suggests a monolayer adsorption of oil onto synthesized fe3o4 bent nc the kinetics data were best described using pseudo second order kinetics model the adsorption of oil onto fe3o4 bent nc is mostly through chemical bonding and hydrophobic interaction overall these findings prove that the prepared composite is a promising and effective adsorbent for
