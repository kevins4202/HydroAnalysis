17095,organic micropollutants mps are increasingly detected in water resources which can be a concern for human health and the aquatic environment ultraviolet uv radiation based advanced oxidation processes aop such as low pressure mercury vapor arc lamp uv h2o2 can be applied to abate these mps during uv h2o2 treatment mps are abated primarily by photolysis and reactions with hydroxyl radicals oh which are produced in situ from h2o2 photolysis here a model is presented that calculates the applied uv fluence h calc and the oh exposure c t oh calc from the abatement of two selected mps which act as internal probe compounds quantification of the uv fluence and hydroxyl radical exposure was generally accurate when a uv susceptible and a uv resistant probe compound were selected and both were abated at least by 50 e g iopamidol and 5 methyl 1h benzotriazole based on these key parameters a model was developed to predict the abatement of other mps the prediction of abatement was verified in various waters sand filtrates of rivers rhine and wiese and a tertiary wastewater effluent and at different scales laboratory experiments pilot plant the accuracy to predict the abatement of other mps was typically within 20 of the respective measured abatement the model was further assessed for its ability to estimate unknown rate constants for direct photolysis k uv mp and reactions with oh k oh mp in most cases the estimated rate constants agreed well with published values considering the uncertainty of kinetic data determined in laboratory experiments a sensitivity analysis revealed that in typical water treatment applications the precision of kinetic parameters k uv mp for uv susceptible and k oh mp for uv resistant probe compounds have the strongest impact on the model

production kruithof et al 2007 scheideler et al 2011 stefan 2018 von gunten 2018 or in direct potable water reuse roback et al 2019 stefan 2018 trussell et al 2019 aops are based on in situ generation of highly reactive radicals e g oh so4 that react almost diffusion controlled with many constituents in water lee et al 2020 von gunten 2018 despite the many options for radical generation aops deployed in full scale drinking water treatment are currently either ozone based o3 o3 h2o2 or ultraviolet uv radiation based uv h2o2 uv cl2 miklos et al 2018b ozone based processes can form the possibly carcinogenic bromate bro3 if bromide br is present in the raw water von gunten 2003 strategies exist for the mitigation of bromate formation however for waters containing high concentrations of bromide in the water 100 μg l 1 von gunten 2003 the uv h2o2 process is often preferred because there is no bromate formation von gunten and oliveras 1998 in addition other considerations can lead to the selection of a uv based aop if e g the targeted mps are more efficiently abated by direct photolysis as in the case of n nitrosodimethylamine ndma or most x ray contrast media scheideler et al 2011 1 1 the uv h2o2 process the abatement of mps in the uv h2o2 process is based on a combination of the direct photolysis of the mp and reactions with oh that are formed upon photolysis of h2o2 rosenfeldt et al 2006 stefan 2018 the abatement can be described as follows 1 ln c 0 mp c mp h k uv mp c t oh k oh mp c 0 mp and c mp mol l 1 m describe the concentrations of a mp before and after the uv h2o2 treatment respectively h is the uv fluence j m 2 c t oh is the oh exposure m s k oh mp m 1 s 1 is the second order rate constant for the reaction of a mp with oh k uv mp is the fluence based rate constant for direct photolysis of the mp m2 j 1 which can be calculated from eq 2 bolton and stefan 2002 2 k uv mp ln 10 10 λ hc n a ε φ λ denotes the wavelength i e 254 nm h planck s constant 6

respectively for some selected mps k oh mp ε and φ are summarized in table 1 for reported ph dependent values for ε the values at the actual ph can be calculated by eq 3 canonica et al 2008 3 ε ε 1 ε 2 ε 1 α 2 ε 1 and ε 2 are the decadic molar absorption coefficients of the protonated and deprotonated form of a mp respectively the fraction of the deprotonated form of the mp at a given ph α 2 is calculated by eq 4 and employing the p k a of the mp s protonated form 4 α 2 1 1 10 p k a ph the ph dependent quantum yield is calculated analogously canonica et al 2008 second order rate constants for the reactions of a large number of mps with oh are compiled in a database national institute of standards and technology 2002 or can be deduced theoretically minakata et al 2009 possible temperature effects on the rate constants are discussed in section 3 1 2 molar absorption coefficients and photolysis quantum yields are also reported in literature bahnmüller et al 2015 canonica et al 2008 wols et al 2013 wols and hofman caris 2012 however for these parameters no simple estimations are possible 1 2 approaches to assess uv fluence and oh exposure commonly a uv fluence rate e w m 2 is measured either by chemical actinometry e g potassium iodide iodate bolton et al 2011 rahn 1997 or by previously calibrated radiometers chemical actinometers are based on a known photochemical reaction with a known quantum yield the hydroxyl radical exposure c t oh m s is commonly determined indirectly by measurement of the abatement of an oh probe compound such as para chlorobenzoic acid pcba haag and hoigné 1985 hoigné 1997 rosenfeldt and linden 2007 or a dye such as methylene blue donham et al 2014 keen et al 2014 wang et al 2020 rhodamine b kwon et al 2014 or fluorescein donham et al 2014 alternatively it can be estimated as c t oh c oh ss t where t s is the reaction time and c oh ss m is the pseudo steady state concentration of oh obtained from given initial water quality parameters the average h2o2 concentration c h 2 o 2 m and the uv fluence rate bolton and stefan 2002 lee et al 2016 wols and hofman caris 2012 5 c oh ss e ln 10 10 λ hc n a ε h 2 o 2 φ h 2 o 2 c h 2 o

first order oh scavenging rate constant of the background water matrix s s 1 can be measured directly wang et al 2020 or calculated from the individual contributions of the main oh scavengers i which are essentially dissolved organic carbon carbonate and bicarbonate for surface waters 6 s i c i k oh i 1 3 approaches to predict micropollutant abatement current a priori approaches to predict the abatement of mps in uv h2o2 systems are often based on the above described theories which may be coupled for sophisticated assessments with computational fluid dynamics methods crittenden et al 1999 minakata et al 2017 wols et al 2015a 2015b 2014 alternatively empirical correlations with online measurements of optical water matrix parameters such as uv absorbance or fluorescence were suggested for indirect monitoring of the mp abatement by the uv h2o2 process gerrity et al 2016 yu et al 2015 for ozonation and ozone based aops an a posteriori approach was suggested in which the measured abatement of mps with known second order rate constants for the reactions with o3 and oh was used to predict the abatement of other mps acero et al 2000 huber et al 2003 hübner et al 2013 lee et al 2013 zucker et al 2016 the abatement of mps by ozonation and o3 h2o2 treatment in ultrapure and drinking water was successfully modelled using the aforementioned approach and oxidant exposures were determined from the abatement of an ozone resistant and an ozone reactive compound acero et al 2000 huber et al 2003 also for wastewater ozonation the oh exposure could be well determined by back calculation from ozone resistant compounds such as iopromide clofibric acid ibuprofen ketoprofen or primidone hübner et al 2013 lee et al 2013 zucker et al 2016 in contrast the use of prevalent mps as internal probe compounds to determine the ozone exposure in wastewater and subsequently model the abatement of other mps was not successful hübner et al 2013 lee et al 2014 zucker et al 2016 a mass transfer limitation related to mixing at low ozone dosages is assumed to probably be the cause for similar removal of mps despite several orders of magnitude difference in some second order rate constants hübner et al 2013 lester et al 2014 proposed sucralose as an internal probe compound to monitor full scale uv aop treatments they suggested to predict the abatement of other mps based on empirical water specific correlation factors here a model is presented that can be applied without prior water specific calibration as it is based on widely accepted fundamental photo chemical reaction theories while this approach does not provide a real time control option it is useful i to predict the abatement of mps with known second order rate constants for their reactions with oh k oh mp molar absorption coefficients at 254 nm ε and quantum yields at 254 nm φ that were not monitored by this ii the model allows to extrapolate from indicator compounds during performance validation tests to any other compound that might appear in the source water further iii the model allows to check the plausibility of experimental results data consistency in this paper a model based on the measured abatement of two mps is developed for low pressure uv h2o2 processes two main potential applications of the model are presented i the assessment of uv fluence and oh exposure and ii the prediction of abatement of mps with known photo chemical reactivity the applications are verified with data from own experiments and literature representing different treatment systems laboratory and pilot scale and water matrices surface waters and a wastewater effluent finally the sensitivity of the model is assessed to elucidate the most relevant experimental parameters for accurate predictions 2 materials and methods 2 1 water samples water samples were taken from two river water rapid sand filtrates i e rhine and wiese in northwestern switzerland the production of the rapid sand filtrates is described in the supporting information si text s1 sand filtrate water grab samples of the rivers rhine and wiese were collected for laboratory experiments in annealed glassware at different time points may 2016 january 2019 samples were stored at 4 c until use and the uv h2o2 experiments were conducted within seven days after sampling a summary of characteristic water quality parameters and mp concentrations of the sand filtrates of rivers rhine and wiese is provided in table 1 the mps were selected because of their presence in the raw waters and relevance for drinking water treatment as well as reported specific photo chemical and physical data i e k oh mp ε and φ see table 1 2 2 experimental setup 2 2 1 laboratory experiments laboratory experiments were conducted on a collimated beam device cbd bolton and stefan 2002 at room temperature 20 c to verify the model under well defined conditions experiments were conducted with varying h2o2 concentrations 0 8 mg l 1 and uv fluences 1 900 8 000 j m 2 low pressure mercury uv lamps irradiating almost monochromatically at 254 nm supplied by xylem services to assess the model under process conditions relevant for realistic water treatment applications a description of the cbd experimental procedure is provided in text s2 si details on the experimental set points in the laboratory experiments are described in table s3 si for river rhine sand filtrate and table s4 si for river wiese sand filtrate in some laboratory experiments with river rhine sand filtrate selected mps were spiked for a better quantification of the abatement at elevated h2o2 concentrations and uv fluences therefore a mix stock solution was prepared in ultrapure water with concentrations of 1 mg l 1 acesulfame ace diatrizoic acid dta iohexol ihx iopamidol ipa iopromide ipr and metformin met and 0 5 mg l 1 5 methyl 1h benzotriazole 5btz as described in text s3 si prior to the experiment 25 µl of this stock solution were spiked into a 250 ml water sample thus achieving final concentrations of 100 ng l 1 for these mps exception 50 ng l 1 for 5btz all chemicals were of the highest available quality and used without further purification table s2 si 2 2 2 pilot plant experiments pilot plant experiments were conducted to validate the model under operational conditions and at different times throughout the year a detailed description of the pilot plant is provided in text s4 si including a scheme of the continuously operated pilot plant average volume flow 0 5 m3 h 1 figure s3 si sand filtrates from the rivers rhine and wiese were treated in two parallel uv h2o2 units operated at 4 mg h2o2 l 1 and a uv fluence of 6 000 j m 2 600 mj cm 2 low pressure mercury uv lamp irradiating almost monochromatically at 254 nm supplied by xylem services this set point was selected because the results of cbd experiments indicated that under these conditions x ray contrast media occurring in the river rhine sand filtrate were abated by 80 furthermore such a treatment constitutes some additional broad band barrier for mps due to the oh generation plattner et al 2017 in an additional set of experiments the operational set points were varied 0 10 000 j m 2 0 10 mg h2o2 l 1 to verify the model at other set points relevant for water treatment water temperatures during the pilot trials varied in the range of 5 0 to 24 5 c details on the sampling dates and operational set points are described in table s5 si for river rhine sand filtrate and table s6 si for river wiese sand filtrate the pilot plant data of the uv h2o2 treatment of the river rhine sand filtrate data set numbers 31 42 and 48 table s5 si have been presented elsewhere wünsch et al 2019 but they are re evaluated here to test the proposed model a csv file with all measured micropollutant concentrations is provided in the si 2 3 analytical methods residual h2o2 in all samples was quenched by addition of 2 mol sodium thiosulfate from a stock solution per mol h2o2 the sodium thiosulfate stock solution was prepared by dissolving 1 7 g na2s2o3 in 50 ml ultrapure water even though h2o2 quenching was not complete under these conditions wünsch et al 2019 possible fenton like reactions of residual h2o2 with fe iii and cu ii present in the surface water filtrates were shown to be irrelevant in a dark experiment no uv fluence with 4 mg h2o2 l 1 at pilot scale with river rhine and wiese sand filtrates figure s4 si analytical methods for the measurements of the mps are described in text s3 si in brief 5 methyl 1h benzotriazole 5btz 1h benzotriazole btz carbamazepine cbz metformin met metoprolol mpl sulfamethoxazole smx and sotalol stl were measured on an hplc ms ms system after direct injection acesulfame ace diatrizoic acid dta iohexol ihx iopamidol ipa and iopromide ipr were measured on the same system after 10 fold pre concentration but employing a different set of separation columns details on the analytical measurement uncertainties of the mps are provided in table s7 si respective values for theoretical limits of quantification and a list of the suppliers of the chemicals in table s2 si 2 4 model for prediction of micropollutant abatement the proposed model is based on the assumption that the abatement of mps during the uv h2o2 process can be described by direct photolysis at 254 nm and reactions with oh reactions with other reactive species e g carbonate radicals co3 are neglected note that these reactions can become more important than reactions with oh e g if the ratio of the steady state concentrations of co3 to oh exceeds two to three orders of magnitude and second order rate constants for reactions of mps with co3 are 1 107 m 1 s 1 canonica et al 2005 wols et al 2014 in addition it is assumed that all mps face the same reaction conditions e g no competition for oh or uv photons between the mps this is justified by the high pseudo first order oh scavenging rate constant for the water matrix 5 7 104 s 1 and 4 0 104 s 1 for average sand filtrates of river rhine and river wiese respectively as compared to the mps 25 s 1 and 23 s 1 based on average measured concentrations of all mps in sand filtrates of river rhine and river wiese respectively calculated with eq 6 respectively mps are assumed not to be re formed during or after the uv h2o2 treatment in the water matrix furthermore it is assumed that the analyzed probe compounds represent average concentrations of the whole uv h2o2 feed and effluent fundamentally it is assumed that rate constants reported from experiments elsewhere are transferable to real water systems i e no water matrix interactions alter the observed rate constants finally it is assumed that the uv fluence has a narrow distribution i e h in eqs 1 and 7 is assumed to be relatively constant throughout the entire flow travelling across the uv reactor which should be valid for laboratory experiments conducted on collimated beam devices and for typical water treatment systems with well designed uv reactors under these conditions the abatement of mps can be described by eq 1 to predict the abatement of mps in one experimental data set two mps denoted by the subscripts 1 and 2 in the following equations are selected as internal probe compounds their abatements are inserted into eq 1 to obtain the calculated uv fluence h calc and the calculated oh exposure c t oh calc solving the corresponding system of two linear equations for h calc and c t oh calc yields 7 h calc ln c 0 1 c 1 ln c 0 2 c 2 k oh 1 k oh 2 k uv 1 k uv 2 k oh 1 k oh 2 8 c t oh calc ln c 0 2 c 2 ln c 0 1 c 1 k uv 2 k uv 1 k oh 2 k oh 1 k uv 2 k uv 1 where c 0 1 and c 0 2 are the initial and c 1 and c 2 the transient concentrations of mp1 and mp2 respectively k oh 1 and k oh 2 the respective second order rate constants for the reactions of the mps with oh and k uv 1 and k uv 2 the respective rate constants for direct photolysis of the mps the internal probe compounds should be selected based on different predominant abatement mechanisms mathematically this corresponds to the condition that k oh 1 k uv 1 has to be clearly different from k oh 2 k uv 2 which prevents the denominators of eqs 7 and 8 to be close to zero this increases the robustness of the method against analytical uncertainty ideally mp 1 the uv susceptible probe compound is abated predominantly by uv irradiation whereas mp 2 the uv resistant c t oh probe compound predominantly by reactions with oh knowing h calc and c t oh calc the expected abatement of all other mps with known k oh mp ε mp and φ mp can be calculated by eq 1 to estimate the confidence intervals of h calc c t oh calc and the predicted abatements the uncertainties of all relevant influencing factors i e ph photochemical parameters second order rate constants for reactions with oh analytical measurement uncertainties are accounted for in a monte carlo simulation by repeated calculations of h calc c t oh calc and predicted abatements with each experimental data set 104 times according to morgan et al 1990 this is sufficient to have 95 confidence that the actual 50th percentile is within the estimated 49th and 51st percentiles for any distribution in each repeated calculation the input parameters were assigned a random value around the measured value within the respective uncertainty as described in table s8 si the confidence intervals were evaluated after the repeated calculations by evaluating the 2 5 and 97 5 percentile values of h calc c t oh calc and the predicted abatements respectively h calc and c t oh calc could also be obtained by linear regression analysis using eq 1 and the abatement data of more than two probe compounds this approach can potentially make the determination of these key parameters more robust against inaccuracies of kinetic parameters and analytical errors of single substances but was not tested within this study 2 5 sensitivity analysis the sensitivities of the model outputs h calc and c t oh calc were assessed by the gaussian error propagation for a model output y as a function g of i 1 2 3 n non correlated input variables x 1 x 2 x 3 x n 9 y g x 1 x 2 x 3 x n the combined variance u c 2 y can be approximated by eq 10 neglecting higher order terms in a taylor series expansion iso iec 2008 10 u c 2 y i 1 n g x i 2 u 2 x i u 2 x i is the estimated standard uncertainty of an input variable x i the partial derivatives g x i for h calc and c t oh calc were computed by an online software wolfram alpha llc 2020 and are given in tables s9 and s10 si respectively standard uncertainties of second order rate constants are assumed to be uniformly distributed wherefore u 2 x i becomes iso iec 2008 11 u 2 x i a a 2 12 where a and a denote the upper and lower limits of the interval of uncertainty for the sensitivity analysis u 2 x i of all kinetic constants was calculated with eq 11 with the assumption that kinetic constants are certain within a factor 2 i e a as 2 the kinetic constant and a as 0 5 the kinetic constant respectively a comparison of the estimated combined standard uncertainty u c y u c 2 y from the gaussian error propagation with the results obtained from the monte carlo simulation section 2 4 validated that higher order terms of the taylor series expansion were of minor importance 3 results and discussion 3 1 prediction of abatement of micropollutants 3 1 1 laboratory experiments proof of concept with sand filtrate waters of rivers rhine and wiese fig 1 shows the predicted and measured relative abatements of the selected mps based on the model described with ipa and 5btz as internal probe compounds for river rhine sand filtrate the presented data are based on 24 cbd experiments including six experiments without h2o2 addition h set 1 900 8 000 j m 2 h2o2 dose 0 8 mg l 1 data sets 1 24 table s3 si h set is the uv fluence intended to be transferred to the sample the combination of ipa and 5btz was selected because it was found to reproduce well the set uv fluence h set in laboratory experiments fig 2 could be applied in many cases due to high detection frequencies in the river rhine sand filtrate table 1 and has the lowest median value of the difference between predicted and measured abatement δ 0 8 fig 3 of all investigated combinations of probe compounds overall the ipa 5btz model predicts abatements with a δ within 20 for 170 out of 175 data points 97 fig 3 five data points are outside this range i e the two predictions for sotalol and three for acesulfame these compounds are discussed later in the manuscript the accuracy of predictions is constant over the investigated range of uv fluences and h2o2 concentrations especially the δ values of btz ipr and met are mostly very small 5 with median values of 1 4 3 2 and 1 0 respectively for btz and ipr this might be explained by their similar k oh and k uv compared to the applied probe compounds met mainly reacted with oh and was hardly abated under the investigated treatment conditions 25 hence small values of δ are expected predictions of stl concentrations were unsatisfactory not only with the ipa 5btz model but also with all other combinations of probe compounds fig 3 stl was present only at very low concentrations in the filtrates i e 7 ng l 1 and 4 ng l 1 in rhine and wiese respectively this is above the theoretical limit of quantification 1 6 ng l 1 table s7 si but outside the lower measurement range 10 ng l 1 table s7 si for this reason analytical difficulties likely contribute to the unsatisfactory predictions however the observed under predictions of stl abatement by the model could also result from disregarded reactions with co3 which were reported to react with stl with a second order rate constant of 2 2 1 7 108 m 1 s 1 wols et al 2014 assuming that the co3 exposure is about two to three orders of magnitude higher than the oh exposure canonica et al 2005 the expected ln abatement by reactions with co3 is about 3 to 30 fold higher than the abatement via oh the cbd experiments with sand filtrates of rivers rhine and wiese were used to assess the significance of h calc h calc and h set correlated well in the laboratory experiments as expected fig 2 combination of ipa and 5btz from 24 assessed data sets 95 confidence intervals of h calc of only four data sets did not include h set i e data sets 1 2 3 and 24 table s3 si the first three data sets were all conducted with the same water sample which might indicate a systematic experimental error for this series of experiments this showcases the potential application of the model to check the consistency of experimental data depending on the choice of the photo sensitive probe compound h calc was found either higher or lower than h set table s11 si small differences between h calc and h set were found for all combinations of probe compounds that used dta ihx ipa or ipr as uv probe compound except when stl was selected as the c t oh probe compound it can be concluded that h calc can reproduce h set if a suitable combination of probe compounds is selected fig 3 provides an overview of the prediction quality of all investigated combinations of internal probe compounds in laboratory experiments with sand filtrate of the river rhine for example δ of all models with ace as a probe compound are grouped in the first block far left of fig 3 the second probe compound is indicated in vertical text above the ace label the first boxplot shows results based on ace and 5btz as probe compounds like the boxplot on the far right of fig 1 one boxplot summarizes the prediction accuracy for the abatement of all other mps i e ace and 5btz excluded discussed in this paper the number of distinct experiments and prediction results in each boxplot is indicated in vertical at the lower x axis the boxplot for ace and 5btz as probe compounds represents 175 prediction results of dta ihx ipa ipr smx btz cbz met mpl and stl from 24 distinct laboratory experiments at the upper x axis median values of δ are indicated and the percentage of δ inside the 20 boundaries for most combinations of probe compounds the prediction quality of the model was satisfactory i e the predicted abatement of mps was mostly within 20 of the measured abatement similar results were obtained for river wiese sand filtrate figure s5 si therefore it can be concluded that the model generally works well in surface water sand filtrates to predict the abatement of other substances based on the measured abatement of two probe compounds and the available kinetic information k uv and k oh a statistical assessment of the percentage of δ inside the 20 boundaries of all probe compounds in both filtrates showed that the average of all predictions is in the range of 68 to 80 with 95 confidence regardless of the choice of probe compounds table s12 si however stl performed significantly p 0 05 worse than the others likely for the reasons discussed above also met and smx both showed a poorer average prediction performance when used as probe compounds respectively although statistically not significant p 0 05 excluding met smx and stl as probe compounds from the statistical evaluation the average percentage of δ inside the 20 boundaries was in the range of 87 to 92 with 95 confidence only predictions with ace as probe compound were poorer on average but not statistically significant p 0 05 in the later evaluation ipa and ipr performed significantly better p 0 05 than the average the uv resistant c t oh probe compounds 5btz btz cbz and mpl performed equally well met was not well suited as probe compound under the treatment conditions investigated due to low abatement measured in the range of 8 to 22 only at low values of abatement the model is very sensitive for analytical errors as further discussed below section 3 3 negative values for measured abatement are explained by analytical measurement uncertainties which are relatively high for met i e standard uncertainty is 19 table s7 si in these cases it can happen that predicted abatements are negative which causes an increase of the predicted mp concentration in some cases at the same time the measured abatement was strongly positive which explains results even below 100 difference in fig 3 when smx was used as uv probe compound abatement predictions tended to be lower than the abatement measured comparing h set and h calc in cbd experiments the calculated uv fluence was constantly below the set value i e in the range of 48 to 34 combination with stl excluded table s11 si it is hypothesized that the literature value for k uv smx used in this study was too high see also table 2 this concurs with the previously observed reduction in k uv smx in real river water matrices compared to ultrapure water solutions canonica et al 2008 and might indicate that dissolved organic matter partly inhibits the photochemical transformation of smx by reduction of transformation intermediates back to the parent compound wenk et al 2011 of note smx was reported to react with co3 with a second order rate constant of 1 2 0 7 108 m 1 s 1 wols et al 2014 which implies that the expected ln abatement by reactions with co3 is about 2 to 20 fold higher than the abatement via oh in contrast to stl predictions of smx abatement are typically found within 20 of the measured abatement this is explained by the rapid abatement of smx by photolysis which is of higher importance than the abatement via radical species similarly when using ace as a probe compound h calc in cbd experiments was systematically higher than h set table s11 si suggesting that k uv ace from the literature is too low see also table 2 this explains why the abatement of ace was often under estimated fig 1 and consequently when using ace as uv probe compound abatements of uv susceptible compounds tended to be over predicted fig 3 3 1 2 pilot plant application of the model to river rhine and river wiese sand filtrates the model was applied to predict the abatement of mps in pilot plant experiments a comparison of the δ values for the investigated combinations of probe compounds is provided in figure s6 si for river rhine sand filtrate and in figure s7 si for river wiese sand filtrate an assessment of the percentage of δ within the 20 boundaries of all probe compounds in both filtrates showed no statistical differences between the mean values of the experiments performed in laboratory and pilot scale i e the average value is in the range of 74 to 81 with 95 confidence table s13 si therefore it can be concluded that the model is also applicable to sand filtrates at pilot scale with a similar prediction performance however some differences exist for single mps e g stl better prediction performance or met lower prediction performance this might be due to effects of varying concentrations during the pilot trials another reason for the observed shifts in the prediction performance could be the influence of the water temperature on k uv mp and k oh mp water temperature 6 2 to 24 5 c table s5 si is not included as an input parameter in the proposed model possible temperature effects i e activation energies likely differ between the investigated mps wols et al 2015b which could explain the described discrepancies between laboratory and pilot scale experiments however overall it is concluded that the differences are not very large because the average values of δ inside the 20 boundaries at both scales are statistically indifferent in principle temperature effects on the rate constants k could be accounted for by the arrhenius equation 12 k t a exp e a rt t k is the absolute temperature r 8 314 j k 1 mol 1 is the ideal gas constant a is the pre exponential factor e a j mol 1 is the activation energy however activation energies for the relevant reaction rate constants of the selected mps are not available in the published literature note that second order rate constants for reactions of all water matrix constituents with oh including oh scavengers may also be impacted by the water temperature which might lead to a net effect on mp abatement lower than expected in addition the implementation of temperature dependent values for k oh mp and k uv mp is expected to improve the prediction quality of the model only moderately this assumption is based on estimated activation energies for k oh mp and k uv mp in the range of 5 22 kj mol 1 christensen et al 1982 elliot and simsons 1984 wols et al 2015b which leads to a variation within a factor of 1 2 to 2 0 for the rate constants in the observed temperature range this is in the range of uncertainty of experimentally determined kinetic parameters therefore it is concluded that a temperature independent model can be used for predictions within an accuracy of 20 for the water temperature ranges in this study 3 1 3 assessment of published data from wastewater treatment with uv h2o2 published data from uv h2o2 treatment of a wastewater effluent in laboratory experiments miklos et al 2019 and in a pilot plant miklos et al 2018a were assessed with the model to test its applicability in advanced wastewater treatment fig 4 laboratory experiments were conducted on a cbd with tertiary wastewater effluent h2o2 0 to 12 8 mg l 1 uv fluences 400 to 20 000 j m 2 miklos et al 2019 2018a a pilot plant was continuously operated with tertiary wastewater effluent at a target dose of 10 mg h2o2 l 1 and a uv fluence of 8 000 j m 2 results include data from continuous monitoring over one week at dry weather conditions and another week during a rain event miklos et al 2018a although the publication included the abatement of a large set of mps only the mps selected in the current study were evaluated table 1 fig 4 shows the results for the probe compound combination ipr btz for the prediction of cbz mpl smx and stl the other mps discussed here were not included in the measurements of miklos et al 2019 and miklos et al 2018a ipr and btz were selected as probe compounds because this combination had the highest share of δ inside the 20 boundaries in the experiments with river rhine sand filtrate overall the 95 confidence intervals for the share of δ within the 20 boundaries of all possible combinations of probe compounds are in the range of 66 to 82 for cbd experiments and 68 to 84 for pilot plant experiments respectively fig 4 b this means that there is no statistical evidence that the measured mps abatement within 20 in wastewater is predicted with a worse performance than in experiments with surface water both on laboratory and pilot scale in addition there is no statistical difference between the share of δ inside the 20 boundaries at dry weather or during a rain event evaluating the eight possible combinations of probe compounds therefore it can be concluded that the model can be applied in a wide range of water matrices and at least at laboratory and pilot scale to predict the abatement of mps based on the measured abatement of two mps as internal probe compounds the prediction performance of the ipr btz model for stl is much better in the wastewater than in the river sand filtrates stl was present in the wastewater in the range of 32 ng l 1 to 83 ng l 1 which was well above the limit of quantification this contributes to the overall better results for stl compared to the experiments with the river sand filtrates where the influent concentrations of stl were often near the limit of quantification note that on the pilot plant stl abatement tended to be overpredicted even though carbonate radicals not considered in the model should add to the predicted abatement by photolysis and oh the reason for this result is currently unclear and further research is necessary to fully explain this observation 3 2 estimation of kinetic data for micropollutants the model was also tested for its applicability to obtain kinetic data this can be an interesting application as a rough estimate of kinetic data that is not yet reported in literature in a first step the model is applied to back calculate h calc and c t oh calc with eqs 7 and 8 in a second step k uv mp and k oh mp are determined by linear regression analysis with eq 1 which is in principle possible if at least two experimental data points are available as a proof of concept this approach was applied for well described mps from laboratory experiments with river rhine sand filtrate with ipa and 5btz as internal probe compounds only positive i e physically reasonable results for mean values of h calc and c t oh calc were used for the linear regression data sets used 1 7 10 12 14 18 21 24 uv fluences 1 900 8 000 j m 2 h2o2 0 8 mg l 1 table s3 si in table 2 the fitting results of the model are compared with literature values derived from table 1 the proposed approach leads to an agreement of predicted values for k uv mp and k oh mp and those from literature within a factor 2 except for one outlier k uv cbz this is well within the range of accuracy that can be expected for kinetic parameters which are determined experimentally by different groups wols and hofman caris 2012 for some mps rate constants were determined with high uncertainties k uv mp of cbz met and mpl or k oh mp of dta and ihx accurate estimates of rate constants are difficult to be obtained for substances that are either hardly abated by direct photolysis cbz met mpl or have very low values for k oh mp dta table 1 nevertheless the corresponding rate constants for the main pathway i e the reaction with oh cbz met mpl or direct photolysis dta can still be determined with good agreement with the literature for ihx the experiments with h set 8 000 j m 2 were excluded for fitting because their inclusion led to physically impossible negative values for k oh ihx likely due to analytical measurement errors at very low concentrations the remaining data had a narrow range of c t oh calc 5 3 10 12 to 4 7 10 11 m s this explains the large confidence interval of the estimated k oh ihx value furthermore low abatement such as for met 2 to 22 also leads to wide confidence intervals therefore the suggested approach is only feasible if the target mp is abated to a sufficiently high extent to minimize uncertainties e g from analytical measurements note that in principle it is also possible to estimate the pseudo first order oh scavenging rate constant of the water matrix s from h calc c t calc and eq 5 but the discussed limitations are also valid for this approach overall these results show some benefits to estimate rate constants but also serious limitations kinetic data are typically obtained by measurements of the abatement of a selected mp under controlled laboratory conditions at concentration levels that are high enough to reduce analytical errors and for optimized reaction times whenever possible such an approach should be adopted to determine rate constants for individual micropollutants 3 3 sensitivity analysis of the model this section provides an assessment of the role of experimental parameters on the quality of the modelling results first the impact of the measured abatement of the probe compounds on the combined standard uncertainties u c of h calc and c t oh calc is assessed in a second step strategies to reduce the uncertainties of h calc and c t oh calc are discussed which would lead to model outputs with increased confidence both assessments are based on the gaussian error propagation described before section 2 5 h calc and c t oh calc depend on all parameters described in eqs 7 and 8 i e concentrations of both probe compounds before and after uv h2o2 treatment and their respective kinetic parameters to reduce the complexity only the probe compound combination ipa 5btz is discussed here because it was the main combination applied in this study analytical measurement uncertainties for both probe compounds were 13 in this study table s7 si the uncertainty of the rate constants was assumed within a factor 2 fig 5 shows u c of h calc and c t oh calc at different levels of abatement of the probe compounds scenarios with a higher removal of 5btz compared to ipa are not of relevance for typical water treatment applications and therefore not discussed for low relative abatements of the probe compounds 50 the application of the model is not very useful because u c of h calc and c t oh calc can exceed 100 in such a case if possible a different pair of probe compounds has to be selected with a higher extent of abatement when both probe compounds are abated by at least 50 uncertainties of the rate constants dominate the calculations of h calc and c t oh calc independent of the operational conditions u c of h calc and c t oh calc cannot be reduced below 43 even disregarding analytical uncertainties due to the defined uncertainty for the rate constants within a factor 2 impacts of several strategies to improve the model outputs i e replicate measurements improvement of analytical measurements or precision of the rate constants are shown in fig 6 for ipa and 5btz as probe compounds calculations were conducted for a relatively high abatement of the probe compounds i e 93 and 68 for ipa and 5btz respectively these abatements result in h calc 6 200 j m 2 and c t oh calc 1 1 10 10 m s which corresponds to 4 1 mg h2o2 l 1 rearranging the oh steady state assumption eq 5 and using the assumed s of an average river rhine sand filtrate i e 5 7 104 s 1 these treatment conditions are similar to those for the long term pilot plant study under these conditions single measurements of ipa and 5btz with analytical uncertainties of 13 and rate constants uniformly distributed within a factor 2 result in u c of 47 and 49 for h calc and c t oh calc respectively while for h calc the uncertainty of k uv ipa has the highest importance 91 of u c 2 of h calc k oh 5 btz contributes the most to the combined variance of c t oh calc 68 consequently the improvement of analytical accuracy or replicate measurements do not significantly enhance the model outputs therefore an optimization can only be achieved by more precise values for the rate constants kinetic parameters can be estimated within a factor 1 2 by reviewing published rate constants of several independent research groups as done e g by buxton et al 1988 or by using relative rate constants from one lab determined under the same treatment conditions by this uncertainties of rate constants limit u c of h calc and c t oh calc to 11 under these conditions six replicate measurements can lower u c of h calc from 14 to 12 and u c of c t oh calc from 22 to 14 respectively hence replicate measurements or improved analytical methods can improve the predictions to some extent especially hydroxyl radical exposure but a considerable effort is required at this level of precision kinetic parameters should include temperature dependencies activation energies eq 12 if the model is applied at other temperatures than 20 c otherwise the temperature impact on kinetic parameters can again increase the uncertainty of kinetic parameters section 3 1 2 for u c of h calc analytical uncertainties only play a significant role when the uncertainty of k uv ipa is extremely low i e accurate within a factor 1 05 with less accuracy for this rate constant efforts to minimize analytical errors by repeated measurements or improved analytical methods are of minor relevance for h calc 4 conclusions a novel modeling tool based on the abatement of micropollutants acting as internal probe compounds was developed to determine the applied uv fluence and the hydroxyl radical exposure during laboratory and pilot scale uv h2o2 treatment this modeling approach has the advantage that water matrix parameters affecting the abatement of micropollutants e g scavenging rate by background matrix transmissivity of the water etc as well as hydrodynamics and non ideal characteristics of the uv reactor are implicitly considered by the model the following conclusions can be drawn the model was proven to satisfactorily predict the abatement of compounds at laboratory and pilot scale both for surface water sand filtrates and tertiary treated wastewater the difference between measured and predicted abatements was typically within 20 for most combinations of probe compounds even though water temperatures varied in the range of 5 0 to 24 5 c during the pilot plant experiments high reactivity of substances with other radical species than oh might limit the application of the model for certain micropollutants especially if they are at least moderately resistant against photolysis e g sotalol for such substances the results should be interpreted with caution specifically in a water matrix with low contents of dissolved organic carbon or high carbonate concentrations i e high ratio of co3 to oh concentrations vice versa if the model largely underpredicts the abatement of a substance based on photolysis and reactions with oh and the rate constants of the predicted substance were obtained from careful measurements in the laboratory results might indicate significant contributions of other radical species to its abatement this approach is suitable to monitor the absolute values of the uv fluence and hydroxyl radical exposure with reasonable confidence when the relative abatement of both probe compounds is at least 50 and all rate constants are known with good precision factor 1 2 furthermore concentrations of both probe compounds must be measured before and after the treatment by state of the art analytical methods when the used probe compounds are abated to a sufficiently high degree e g when iopamidol and 5 methyl 1h benzotriazole are abated by 93 and 68 respectively replicate measurements or improved analytical methods do not significantly improve the model results calculated uv fluences and hydroxyl radical exposures can be used to estimate unknown rate constants second order rate constant for the reaction with hydroxyl radicals fluence based rate constant for direct photolysis the estimated rate constants were in most cases within the common range of accuracy of published kinetic data factor 2 however the accuracy of this approach strongly decreases when specific reactions are very slow thus this approach provides a good first estimate of rate constants but cannot substitute careful measurement of rate

act as internal probe compounds quantification of the uv fluence and hydroxyl radical exposure was generally accurate when a uv susceptible and a uv resistant probe compound were selected and both

of highly reactive radicals e g oh so4 that react almost diffusion controlled with many constituents in water lee et al 2020 von gunten 2018 despite the many options for radical generation aops deployed in full scale drinking water treatment are currently either ozone based o3 o3 h2o2 or ultraviolet uv radiation based uv h2o2 uv cl2 miklos et al 2018b ozone based processes can form the possibly carcinogenic bromate bro3 if bromide br is present in the raw water von gunten 2003 strategies exist for the mitigation of bromate formation however for waters containing high concentrations of bromide in the water 100 μg l 1 von gunten 2003 the uv h2o2 process is often preferred because there is no bromate formation von gunten and oliveras 1998 in addition other considerations can lead to the selection of a uv based aop if e g the targeted mps are more efficiently abated by direct photolysis as in the case of n nitrosodimethylamine ndma or most x ray contrast media scheideler et al 2011 1 1 the uv h2o2 process the abatement of mps in the uv h2o2 process is based on a combination of the direct photolysis of the mp and reactions with oh that are formed upon photolysis of h2o2 rosenfeldt et al 2006 stefan 2018 the abatement can be described as follows 1 ln c 0 mp c mp h k uv mp c t oh k oh mp c 0 mp and c mp mol l 1 m describe the concentrations of a mp before and after the

for the reactions of a large number of mps with oh are compiled in a database national institute of standards and technology 2002 or can be deduced theoretically minakata et al 2009 possible temperature effects on the rate constants are discussed in section 3 1 2 molar absorption coefficients and photolysis quantum yields are also reported in literature bahnmüller et al 2015 canonica et al 2008 wols et al 2013 wols and hofman caris 2012 however for these parameters no simple estimations are possible 1 2 approaches to assess uv fluence and oh exposure commonly a uv fluence rate e w m 2 is measured either by chemical actinometry e g potassium iodide iodate bolton et al 2011 rahn 1997 or by previously calibrated radiometers chemical actinometers are based on a known photochemical reaction with a known quantum yield the hydroxyl radical exposure c t oh m s is commonly determined indirectly by measurement of the abatement of an oh probe compound such as para chlorobenzoic acid pcba haag and hoigné 1985 hoigné 1997 rosenfeldt and linden 2007 or a dye such as methylene blue donham et al 2014 keen et al 2014 wang et al 2020 rhodamine b kwon et al 2014 or fluorescein donham et al 2014 alternatively it can be estimated as c t oh c oh ss t where t s is the reaction time and c oh ss m is the pseudo steady state concentration of oh obtained from given initial water quality

abatement of mps in uv h2o2 systems are often based on the above described theories which may be coupled for sophisticated assessments with computational fluid dynamics methods crittenden et al 1999 minakata et al 2017 wols et al 2015a 2015b 2014 alternatively empirical correlations with online measurements of optical water matrix parameters such as uv absorbance or fluorescence were suggested for indirect monitoring of the mp abatement by the uv h2o2 process gerrity et al 2016 yu et al 2015 for ozonation and ozone based aops an a posteriori approach was suggested in which the measured abatement of mps with known second order rate constants for the reactions with o3 and oh was used to predict the abatement of other mps acero et al 2000 huber et al 2003 hübner et al 2013 lee et al 2013 zucker et al 2016 the abatement of mps by ozonation and o3 h2o2 treatment in ultrapure and drinking water was successfully modelled using the aforementioned approach and oxidant exposures were determined from the abatement of an ozone resistant and an ozone reactive compound acero et al 2000 huber et al 2003 also for wastewater ozonation the oh exposure could be well determined by back calculation from ozone resistant compounds such as iopromide clofibric acid ibuprofen ketoprofen or primidone hübner et al 2013 lee et al 2013 zucker et al 2016 in contrast the use of prevalent mps as internal probe compounds to determine the ozone exposure in wastewater and subsequently model the abatement of other mps was not successful hübner et al 2013 lee et al 2014 zucker et al 2016 a mass transfer limitation related to mixing at low ozone dosages is assumed to probably be the cause for similar removal of mps despite several orders of magnitude difference in some second order rate constants hübner et al 2013 lester et al 2014 proposed sucralose as an internal probe compound to monitor full scale uv aop treatments they suggested to predict the abatement of other mps based on empirical water specific correlation factors here a model is presented that can be applied without prior water specific calibration as it is based on widely accepted fundamental photo chemical reaction theories while this approach does not provide a real time control option it is useful i to predict the abatement of mps with known second order rate constants for their reactions with oh k oh mp molar absorption coefficients at 254 nm ε and quantum yields at 254 nm φ that were not monitored by this ii the model allows to extrapolate from indicator compounds during performance validation tests to any other compound that might appear in the source water further iii the model allows to check the plausibility of experimental results data consistency in this paper a model based on the measured abatement of two mps is developed for low pressure uv h2o2 processes two main potential applications of the model are presented i the assessment of uv fluence and oh exposure and ii the prediction of abatement of mps with known photo chemical reactivity the applications are verified with data from own experiments and literature representing different treatment systems laboratory and pilot scale and water matrices surface waters and a wastewater effluent finally the sensitivity of the model is assessed to elucidate the most relevant experimental parameters for accurate predictions

is described in the supporting information si text s1 sand filtrate water grab samples of the rivers rhine and wiese were collected for laboratory experiments in annealed glassware at different time points may 2016 january 2019 samples were stored at 4 c until use and the uv h2o2 experiments were conducted within seven days after sampling a summary of characteristic water quality parameters and mp concentrations of the sand filtrates of rivers rhine and wiese is provided in table 1 the mps were selected because of their presence in the raw waters and relevance for drinking water treatment as well as reported specific photo chemical and physical data i e k oh mp ε and φ see table 1 2 2 experimental setup 2 2 1 laboratory experiments laboratory experiments were conducted on a collimated beam device cbd bolton and stefan 2002 at room temperature 20 c to verify the model under well defined conditions experiments were conducted with varying h2o2 concentrations 0 8 mg l 1 and uv fluences 1 900 8 000 j m 2 low pressure mercury uv lamps irradiating almost monochromatically at 254 nm supplied by xylem services to assess the model under process conditions relevant for realistic water treatment applications a description of the cbd experimental procedure is provided in text s2 si details on the experimental set points in the laboratory experiments are described in table s3 si for river rhine sand filtrate and table s4 si for river wiese sand filtrate in some laboratory experiments with river rhine sand filtrate selected mps were spiked for a better quantification of the abatement at elevated h2o2 concentrations and uv fluences therefore a mix stock solution was prepared in ultrapure water with concentrations of 1 mg l 1 acesulfame ace diatrizoic acid dta iohexol ihx iopamidol ipa iopromide ipr and metformin met and 0 5 mg l 1 5 methyl 1h benzotriazole 5btz as described in text s3 si prior to the experiment 25 µl of this stock solution were spiked into a 250 ml water sample thus achieving final concentrations of 100 ng l 1 for these mps exception 50 ng l 1 for 5btz all chemicals were of the highest available quality and used without further purification table s2 si 2 2 2 pilot plant experiments pilot plant experiments were conducted to validate the model under operational conditions and at different times throughout the year a detailed description of the pilot plant is provided in text s4 si including a scheme of the continuously operated pilot plant average volume flow 0 5 m3 h 1 figure s3 si sand filtrates from the rivers rhine and wiese were treated in two parallel uv h2o2 units operated at 4 mg h2o2 l 1 and a uv fluence of 6 000 j m 2 600 mj cm 2 low pressure mercury uv lamp irradiating almost monochromatically at 254 nm supplied by xylem services this set point was selected because the results of cbd experiments indicated that under these conditions x ray contrast media occurring in the river rhine sand filtrate were abated by 80 furthermore such a treatment constitutes some additional broad band barrier for mps due to the oh generation plattner et al 2017 in an additional set of experiments the operational set points were varied 0 10 000 j m 2 0 10 mg h2o2 l 1 to verify the model at other set points relevant for water treatment water temperatures during the pilot trials varied in the range of 5 0 to 24 5 c details on

abatement the proposed model is based on the assumption that the abatement of mps during the uv h2o2 process can be described by direct photolysis at 254 nm and reactions with oh reactions with other reactive species e g carbonate radicals co3 are neglected note that these reactions can become more important than reactions with oh e g if the ratio of the steady state concentrations of co3 to oh exceeds two to three orders of magnitude and second order rate constants for reactions of mps with co3 are 1 107 m 1 s 1 canonica et al 2005 wols et al 2014 in addition it is assumed that all mps face the same reaction conditions e g no competition for oh or uv photons between the mps this is justified by the high pseudo first order oh scavenging rate constant for the water matrix 5 7 104 s 1 and 4 0 104 s 1 for average sand filtrates of river rhine and river wiese respectively as compared to the mps 25 s 1 and 23 s 1 based on average measured concentrations of all mps in sand filtrates of river rhine and river wiese respectively calculated with eq 6 respectively mps are assumed not to be re formed during or after the uv h2o2 treatment in the water matrix furthermore it is assumed that the analyzed probe compounds represent average concentrations of the whole uv h2o2 feed and effluent fundamentally it is assumed that rate constants reported from experiments elsewhere are transferable to real water systems i e no water matrix interactions alter the observed rate constants finally it is assumed that the uv fluence has a narrow distribution i e h in eqs 1 and 7 is assumed to be relatively constant throughout the entire flow travelling across the uv reactor which should be valid for laboratory experiments conducted on collimated beam devices and for typical water treatment systems with well designed uv reactors under these conditions the abatement of mps can be described by eq 1 to predict the abatement of mps in one experimental data set two mps denoted by the subscripts 1 and 2 in the following equations are selected as internal probe compounds their abatements are inserted into eq 1 to obtain the calculated uv fluence h calc and the calculated oh exposure c t oh calc solving the corresponding system of two linear equations for h calc and c t oh calc yields 7 h calc ln c 0 1 c 1 ln c 0 2 c 2 k oh 1 k oh 2 k uv 1 k uv 2 k oh 1 k oh 2 8 c t oh calc ln c 0 2 c 2 ln c 0 1 c 1 k uv 2 k uv 1 k oh 2 k oh 1 k uv 2 k uv 1 where c 0 1 and c 0 2 are the initial and c 1 and c 2 the transient concentrations of mp1 and mp2 respectively k oh 1 and k oh 2 the respective second order rate constants for the reactions of the mps with oh and k uv 1 and k uv 2 the respective rate constants for direct photolysis of the mps the internal probe compounds should be selected based on different predominant abatement mechanisms mathematically this corresponds to the condition that k oh 1 k uv 1 has to be clearly different from k oh 2 k uv 2 which prevents the denominators of eqs 7 and 8 to be close to zero this increases the robustness of the method against analytical uncertainty ideally mp 1 the uv susceptible probe compound is abated predominantly by uv irradiation whereas mp 2 the uv resistant c t oh probe compound predominantly by reactions with oh knowing h calc and c t oh calc the expected abatement of all other mps with known k oh mp ε mp and φ mp can be calculated by eq 1 to estimate the confidence intervals of h calc c t oh calc and the predicted abatements the uncertainties of all relevant influencing factors i e ph photochemical parameters second order rate constants for reactions with oh analytical measurement uncertainties are accounted for in a monte carlo simulation by repeated calculations of h calc c t oh calc and predicted abatements with each experimental data set 104 times according to morgan et al 1990 this is sufficient to have 95 confidence that the actual 50th percentile is within the estimated 49th and 51st percentiles for any distribution in each repeated calculation the input parameters were assigned a random value around the measured value within the respective uncertainty as described in table s8 si the confidence intervals were evaluated after the repeated calculations by evaluating the 2 5 and 97 5 percentile values of h calc c t oh calc and the predicted abatements respectively h calc and c t oh calc could also be obtained by linear regression analysis using eq 1 and the abatement data of more than two probe compounds this approach can potentially make the determination of these key parameters more robust against inaccuracies of kinetic parameters and analytical errors of single substances but was not tested within this study 2 5 sensitivity analysis the sensitivities of the model outputs h calc and c t oh calc were assessed by the gaussian error propagation for a model output y as a function g of i 1 2 3 n non correlated input variables x 1 x 2 x 3 x n 9 y g x 1 x 2 x 3 x n the combined variance u c 2 y can be approximated by eq 10 neglecting higher order terms in a taylor series expansion iso iec 2008 10 u c 2 y i 1 n g x i 2 u 2 x i u 2 x i is the estimated standard uncertainty of an input variable x i the partial derivatives g x i for h calc and c t oh calc were computed by an online software wolfram alpha llc 2020 and are given in tables s9 and s10 si respectively standard uncertainties of second order rate constants are assumed to be uniformly distributed wherefore u 2 x i becomes iso iec 2008 11 u 2 x i a a 2 12 where a and a denote the upper and lower limits of the interval of uncertainty for the sensitivity analysis u 2 x i of all kinetic constants was calculated with eq 11 with the assumption that kinetic constants are certain within a factor 2 i e a as 2 the kinetic constant and a as 0 5 the kinetic constant respectively a comparison of the estimated combined standard uncertainty u c y u c 2 y from the gaussian error propagation with the results obtained from the monte carlo simulation section 2 4 validated that higher order terms of the taylor series expansion were of minor importance 3 results and discussion 3 1 prediction of abatement of micropollutants 3 1 1 laboratory experiments proof of concept with sand filtrate waters of rivers rhine and wiese fig 1 shows the predicted and measured relative abatements of the selected mps based on the model described with ipa and 5btz as internal probe compounds for river rhine sand filtrate the presented data are based on 24 cbd experiments including six experiments without h2o2 addition h set 1 900 8 000 j m 2 h2o2 dose 0 8 mg l 1 data sets 1 24 table s3 si h set is the uv fluence intended to be transferred to the sample the combination of ipa and 5btz was selected because it was found to reproduce well the set uv fluence h set in laboratory experiments fig 2 could be applied in many cases due to high detection frequencies in the river rhine sand filtrate table 1 and has the lowest median value of the difference between predicted and measured abatement δ 0 8 fig 3 of all investigated combinations of probe compounds overall the ipa 5btz model predicts abatements with a δ within 20 for 170 out of 175 data points 97 fig 3 five data points are outside this range i e the two predictions for sotalol and three for acesulfame these compounds are discussed later in the manuscript the accuracy of predictions is constant over the investigated range of uv fluences and h2o2 concentrations especially the δ values of btz ipr and met are mostly very small 5 with median values of 1 4 3 2 and 1 0 respectively for btz and ipr this might be explained by their similar k oh and k uv compared to the applied probe compounds met mainly reacted with oh and was hardly abated under the investigated treatment conditions 25 hence small values of δ are expected predictions of stl concentrations were unsatisfactory not only with the ipa 5btz model but also with all other combinations of probe compounds fig 3 stl was present only at very low concentrations in the filtrates i e 7 ng l 1 and 4 ng l 1 in rhine and wiese respectively this is above the theoretical limit of quantification 1 6 ng l 1 table s7 si but outside the lower measurement range 10 ng l 1 table s7 si for this reason analytical difficulties likely contribute to the unsatisfactory predictions however the observed under predictions of stl abatement by the model could also result from disregarded reactions with co3 which were reported to react with stl with a second order rate constant of 2 2 1 7 108 m 1 s 1 wols et al 2014 assuming that the co3 exposure is about two to three orders of magnitude higher than the oh exposure canonica et al 2005 the expected ln abatement by reactions with co3 is about 3 to 30 fold higher than the abatement via oh the cbd experiments with sand filtrates of rivers rhine and wiese were used to assess the significance of h calc h calc and h set correlated well in the laboratory experiments as expected fig 2 combination of ipa and 5btz from 24 assessed data sets 95 confidence intervals of h calc of only four data sets did not include h set i e data sets 1 2 3 and 24 table s3 si the first three data sets were all conducted with the same water sample which might indicate a systematic experimental error for this series of experiments this showcases the potential application of the model to check the consistency of experimental data depending on the choice of the photo sensitive probe compound h calc was found either higher or lower than h set table s11 si small differences between h calc and h set were found for all combinations of probe compounds that used dta ihx ipa or ipr as uv probe compound except when stl was selected as the c t oh probe compound it can be concluded that h calc can reproduce h set if a suitable combination of probe compounds is selected fig 3 provides an overview of the prediction quality of all investigated combinations of internal probe compounds in laboratory experiments with sand filtrate of the river rhine for example δ of all models with ace as a probe compound are grouped in the first block far left of fig 3 the second probe compound is indicated in vertical text above the ace label the first boxplot shows results based on ace and 5btz as probe compounds like the boxplot on the far right of fig 1 one boxplot summarizes the prediction accuracy for the abatement of all other mps i e ace and 5btz excluded discussed in this paper the number of distinct experiments and prediction results in each boxplot is indicated in vertical at the lower x axis the boxplot for ace and 5btz as probe compounds represents 175 prediction results of dta ihx ipa ipr smx btz cbz met mpl and stl from 24 distinct laboratory experiments at the upper x axis median values of δ are indicated and the percentage of δ inside the 20 boundaries for most combinations of probe compounds the prediction quality of the model was satisfactory i e the predicted abatement of mps was mostly within 20 of the measured abatement similar results were obtained for river wiese sand filtrate figure s5 si therefore it can be concluded that the model generally works well in surface water sand filtrates to predict the abatement of other substances based on the measured abatement of two probe compounds and the available kinetic information k uv and k oh a statistical assessment of the percentage of δ inside the 20 boundaries of all probe compounds in both filtrates showed that the average of all predictions is in the range of 68 to 80 with 95 confidence regardless of the choice of probe compounds table s12 si however stl performed significantly p 0 05 worse than the others likely for the reasons discussed above also met and smx both showed a poorer average prediction performance when used as probe compounds respectively although statistically not significant p 0 05 excluding met smx and stl as probe compounds from the statistical evaluation the average percentage of δ inside the 20 boundaries was in the range of 87 to 92 with 95 confidence only predictions with ace as probe compound were poorer on average but not statistically significant p 0 05 in the later evaluation ipa and ipr performed significantly better p 0 05 than the average the uv resistant c t oh probe compounds 5btz btz cbz and mpl performed equally well met was not well suited as probe compound under the treatment conditions investigated due to low abatement measured in the range of 8 to 22 only at low values of abatement the model is very sensitive for analytical errors as further discussed below section 3 3 negative values for measured abatement are explained by analytical measurement uncertainties which are relatively high for met i e standard uncertainty is 19 table s7 si in these cases it can happen that predicted abatements are negative which causes an increase of the predicted mp concentration in some cases at the same time the measured abatement was strongly positive which explains results even below 100 difference in fig 3 when smx was used as uv probe compound abatement predictions tended to be lower than the abatement measured comparing h set and h calc in cbd experiments the calculated uv fluence was constantly below the set value i e in the range of 48 to 34 combination with stl excluded table s11 si it is hypothesized that the literature value for k uv smx used in this study was too high see also table 2 this concurs with the previously observed reduction in k uv smx in real river water matrices compared to ultrapure water solutions canonica et al 2008 and might indicate that dissolved organic matter partly inhibits the photochemical transformation of smx by reduction of transformation intermediates back to the parent compound wenk et al 2011 of note smx was reported to react with co3 with a second order rate constant of 1 2 0 7 108 m 1 s 1 wols et al 2014 which implies that the expected ln abatement by reactions with co3 is about 2 to 20 fold higher than the abatement via oh in contrast to stl predictions of smx abatement are typically found within 20 of the measured abatement this is explained by the rapid abatement of smx by photolysis which is of higher importance than the abatement via radical species similarly when using ace as a probe compound h calc in cbd experiments was systematically higher than h set table s11 si suggesting that k uv ace from the literature is too low see also table 2 this explains why the abatement of ace was often under estimated fig 1 and consequently when using ace as uv probe compound abatements of uv susceptible compounds tended to be over predicted fig 3 3 1 2 pilot plant application of the model to river rhine and river wiese sand filtrates the model was applied to predict the abatement of mps in pilot plant experiments a comparison of the δ values for the investigated combinations of probe compounds is provided in figure s6 si for river rhine sand filtrate and in figure s7 si for river wiese sand filtrate an assessment of the percentage of δ within the 20 boundaries of all probe compounds in both filtrates showed no statistical differences between the mean values of the experiments performed in laboratory and pilot scale i e the average value is in the range of 74 to 81 with 95 confidence table s13 si therefore it can be concluded that the model is also applicable to sand filtrates at pilot scale with a similar prediction performance however some differences exist for single mps e g stl better prediction performance or met lower prediction performance this might be due to effects of varying concentrations during the pilot trials another reason for the observed shifts in the prediction performance could be the influence of the water temperature on k uv mp and k oh mp water temperature 6 2 to 24 5 c table s5 si is not included as an input parameter in the proposed model possible temperature effects i e activation energies likely differ between the investigated mps wols et al 2015b which could explain the described discrepancies between laboratory and pilot scale experiments however overall it is concluded that the differences are not very large because the average values of δ inside the 20 boundaries at both scales are statistically indifferent in principle temperature effects on the rate constants k could be accounted for by the arrhenius equation 12 k t a exp e a rt t k is the absolute temperature r 8 314 j k 1 mol 1 is the ideal gas constant a is the pre exponential factor e a j mol 1 is the activation energy however activation energies for the relevant reaction rate constants of the selected mps are not available in the published literature note that second order rate constants for reactions of all water matrix constituents with oh including oh scavengers may also be impacted by the water temperature which might lead to a net effect on mp abatement lower than expected in addition the implementation of temperature dependent values for k oh mp and k uv mp is expected to improve the prediction quality of the model only moderately this assumption is based on estimated activation energies for k oh mp and k uv mp in the range of 5 22 kj mol 1 christensen et al 1982 elliot and simsons 1984 wols et al 2015b which leads to a variation within a factor of 1 2 to 2 0 for the rate constants in the observed temperature range this is in the range of uncertainty of experimentally determined kinetic parameters therefore it is concluded that a temperature independent model can be used for predictions within an accuracy of 20 for the water temperature ranges in this study 3 1 3 assessment of published data from wastewater treatment with uv h2o2 published data from uv h2o2 treatment of a wastewater effluent in laboratory experiments miklos et al 2019 and in a pilot plant miklos et al 2018a were assessed with the model to test its applicability in advanced wastewater treatment fig 4 laboratory experiments were conducted on a cbd with tertiary wastewater effluent h2o2 0 to 12 8 mg l 1 uv fluences 400 to 20 000 j m 2 miklos et al 2019 2018a a pilot plant was continuously operated with tertiary wastewater effluent at a target dose of 10 mg h2o2 l 1 and a uv fluence of 8 000 j m 2 results include data from continuous monitoring over one week at dry weather conditions and another week during a rain event miklos et al 2018a although the publication included the abatement of a large set of mps only the mps selected in the current study were evaluated table 1 fig 4 shows the results for the probe compound combination ipr btz for the prediction of cbz mpl smx and stl the other mps discussed here were not included in the measurements of miklos et al 2019 and miklos et al 2018a ipr and btz were selected as probe compounds because this combination had the highest share of δ inside the 20 boundaries in the experiments with river rhine sand filtrate overall the 95 confidence intervals for the share of δ within the 20 boundaries of all possible combinations of probe compounds are in the range of 66 to 82 for cbd experiments and 68 to 84 for pilot plant experiments respectively fig 4 b this means that there is no statistical evidence that the measured mps abatement within 20 in wastewater is predicted with a worse performance than in experiments with surface water both on laboratory and pilot scale in addition there is no statistical difference between the share of δ inside the 20 boundaries at dry weather or during a rain event evaluating the eight possible combinations of probe compounds therefore it can be concluded that the model can be applied in a wide range of water matrices and at least at laboratory and pilot scale to predict the abatement of mps based on the measured abatement of two mps as internal probe compounds the prediction performance of the ipr btz model for stl is much better in the wastewater than in the river sand filtrates stl was present in the wastewater in the range of 32 ng l 1 to 83 ng l 1 which was well above the limit of quantification this contributes to the overall better results for stl compared to the experiments with the river sand filtrates where the influent concentrations of stl were often near the limit of quantification note that on the pilot plant stl abatement tended to be overpredicted even though carbonate radicals not considered in the model should add to the predicted abatement by photolysis and oh the reason for this result is currently unclear and further research is necessary to fully explain this observation 3 2 estimation of kinetic data for micropollutants the model was also tested for its applicability to obtain kinetic data this can be an interesting application as a rough estimate of kinetic data that is not yet reported in literature in a first step the model is applied to back calculate h calc and c t oh calc with eqs 7 and 8 in a second step k uv mp and k oh mp are determined by linear regression analysis with eq 1 which is in principle possible if at least two experimental data points are available as a proof of concept this approach was applied for well described mps from laboratory experiments with river rhine sand filtrate with ipa and 5btz as internal probe compounds only positive i e physically reasonable results for mean values of h calc and c t oh calc were used for the linear regression data sets used 1 7 10 12 14 18 21 24 uv fluences 1 900 8 000 j m 2 h2o2 0 8 mg l 1 table s3 si in table 2 the fitting results of the model are compared with literature values derived from table 1 the proposed approach leads to an agreement of predicted values for k uv mp and k oh mp and those from literature within a factor 2 except for one outlier k uv cbz this is well within the range of accuracy that can be expected for kinetic parameters which are determined experimentally by different groups wols and hofman caris 2012 for some mps rate constants were determined with high uncertainties k uv mp of cbz met and mpl or k oh mp of dta and ihx accurate estimates of rate constants are difficult to be obtained for substances that are either hardly abated by direct photolysis cbz met mpl or have very low values for k oh mp dta table 1 nevertheless the corresponding rate constants for the main pathway i e the reaction with oh cbz met mpl or direct photolysis dta can still be determined with good agreement with the literature for ihx the experiments with h set 8 000 j m 2 were excluded for fitting because their inclusion led to physically impossible negative values for k oh ihx likely due to analytical measurement errors at very low concentrations the remaining data had a narrow range of c t oh calc 5 3 10 12 to 4 7 10 11 m s this explains the large confidence interval of the estimated k oh ihx value furthermore low abatement such as for met 2 to 22 also leads to wide confidence intervals therefore the suggested approach is only feasible if the target mp is abated to a sufficiently high extent to minimize uncertainties e g from analytical measurements note that in principle it is also possible to estimate the pseudo first order oh scavenging rate constant of the water matrix s from h calc c t calc and eq 5 but the discussed limitations are also valid for this approach overall these results show some benefits to estimate rate constants but also serious limitations kinetic data are typically obtained by measurements of the abatement of a selected mp under controlled laboratory conditions at concentration levels that are high enough to reduce analytical errors and for optimized reaction times whenever possible such an approach should be adopted to determine rate constants for individual micropollutants 3 3 sensitivity analysis of the model this section provides an assessment of the role of experimental parameters on the quality of the modelling results first the impact of the measured abatement of the probe compounds on the combined standard uncertainties u c of h calc and c t oh calc is assessed in a second step strategies to reduce the uncertainties of h calc and c t oh calc are discussed which would lead to model outputs with increased confidence both assessments are based on the gaussian error propagation described before section 2 5 h calc and c t oh calc depend on all parameters described in eqs 7 and 8 i e concentrations of both probe compounds before and after uv h2o2 treatment and their respective kinetic parameters to reduce the complexity only the probe compound combination ipa 5btz is discussed here because it was the main combination applied in this study analytical measurement uncertainties for both probe compounds were 13 in this study table s7 si the uncertainty of the rate constants was assumed within a factor 2 fig 5 shows u c of h calc and c t oh calc at different levels of abatement of the probe compounds scenarios with a higher removal of 5btz compared to ipa are not of relevance for typical water treatment applications and therefore not discussed for low relative abatements of the probe compounds 50 the application of the model is not very useful because u c of h calc and c t oh calc can exceed 100 in such a case if possible a different pair of probe compounds has to be selected with a higher extent of abatement when both probe compounds are abated by at least 50 uncertainties of the rate constants dominate the calculations of h calc and c t oh calc independent of the operational conditions u c of h calc and c t oh calc cannot be reduced below 43 even disregarding analytical uncertainties due to the defined uncertainty for the rate constants within a factor 2 impacts of several strategies to improve the model outputs i e replicate measurements improvement of analytical measurements or precision of the rate constants are shown in fig 6 for ipa and 5btz as probe compounds calculations were conducted for a relatively high abatement of the probe compounds i e 93 and 68 for ipa and 5btz respectively these abatements result in h calc 6 200 j m 2 and c t oh calc 1 1 10 10 m s which corresponds to 4 1 mg h2o2 l 1 rearranging the oh steady state assumption eq 5 and using the assumed s of an average river rhine sand filtrate i e 5 7 104 s 1 these treatment conditions are similar to those for the long term pilot plant study under these conditions single measurements of ipa and 5btz with analytical uncertainties of 13 and rate constants uniformly distributed within a factor 2 result in u c of 47 and 49 for h calc and c t oh calc respectively while for h calc the uncertainty of k uv ipa has the highest importance 91 of u c 2 of h calc k oh 5 btz contributes the most to the combined variance of c t oh calc 68 consequently the improvement of analytical accuracy or replicate measurements do not significantly enhance the model outputs therefore an optimization can only be achieved by more precise values for the rate constants kinetic parameters can be estimated within a factor 1 2 by reviewing published rate constants of several independent research groups as done e g by buxton et al 1988 or by using relative rate constants from one lab determined under the same treatment conditions by this uncertainties of rate constants limit u c of h calc and c t oh calc to 11 under these conditions six replicate measurements can lower u c of h calc from 14 to 12 and u c of c t oh calc from 22 to 14 respectively hence replicate measurements or improved analytical methods can improve the predictions to some extent especially hydroxyl radical exposure but a considerable effort is required at this level of precision kinetic parameters should include temperature dependencies activation energies eq 12 if the model is applied at other temperatures than 20 c otherwise the temperature impact on kinetic parameters can again increase the uncertainty of kinetic parameters section 3 1 2 for u c of h calc analytical uncertainties only play a significant role when the uncertainty of k uv ipa is extremely low i e accurate within a factor 1 05 with less accuracy for this rate constant efforts to minimize analytical errors by repeated measurements or improved analytical methods are of minor relevance for h calc 4 conclusions a novel modeling tool based on the abatement of micropollutants acting as internal probe compounds was developed to determine the applied uv fluence and the hydroxyl radical exposure during laboratory and pilot scale uv h2o2 treatment this modeling approach has the advantage that water matrix parameters affecting the abatement of micropollutants e g scavenging rate by background matrix transmissivity of the water etc as well as hydrodynamics and non ideal characteristics of the uv reactor are implicitly considered by the model the following conclusions can be drawn the model was proven to satisfactorily predict the abatement of compounds at laboratory and pilot scale both for surface water sand filtrates and tertiary treated wastewater the difference between measured and predicted abatements was typically within 20 for most combinations of probe compounds even though water temperatures varied in the range of 5 0 to 24 5 c during the pilot plant experiments high reactivity of substances with other radical species than oh might limit the application of the model for certain micropollutants especially if they are at least moderately resistant against photolysis e g sotalol for such substances the results should be interpreted with caution specifically in a water matrix with low contents of dissolved organic carbon or high carbonate concentrations i e high ratio of co3 to oh concentrations vice versa if the model largely underpredicts the abatement of a substance based on photolysis and reactions with oh and the rate constants of the predicted substance were obtained from careful measurements in the laboratory results might indicate significant contributions of other radical species to its abatement this approach is suitable to monitor the absolute values of the uv fluence and hydroxyl radical exposure with reasonable confidence when the relative abatement of both probe compounds is at least 50 and all rate constants are known with good precision factor 1 2 furthermore concentrations of both probe compounds must be measured before and after the treatment by state of the art analytical methods when the used probe compounds are abated to a sufficiently high degree e g when iopamidol and 5 methyl 1h benzotriazole are abated by 93 and 68 respectively replicate measurements or improved analytical methods do not significantly improve the model results calculated uv fluences and hydroxyl radical exposures can be used to estimate unknown rate constants second order rate constant for the reaction with hydroxyl radicals fluence based rate constant for direct photolysis the estimated rate constants were in most cases within the common range of accuracy of published kinetic data factor 2 however the accuracy of this approach strongly decreases when specific reactions are very slow thus this approach provides a good first estimate of rate constants but cannot substitute careful measurement of rate

spring vegetable soup evaporated milk carrots in brine were quite high 80 to 100 of total bpa present in coating during sealing and sterilization process at 121 c for 90 min goodson et al 2004 as an endocrine disrupting compound bpa may have adverse effects on developmental reproductive neurological immune system and endocrine system even triggering cancer lin et al 2017 zhang et al 2020a baby bottles containing bpa have been banned in 2011 by the european union nowadays many field studies have explored the mechanism about the interaction between mps and bpa but the information on the interaction between aged mps and bpa in water is still limited currently simulated aging condition are limited to thermal activated persulfate oxidation liu et al 2019a ozone oxidation liu et al 2019b and ultraviolet radiation combined with air seawater h2o2 cai et al 2018 hüffer et al 2018 there are few studies on aging of mps by chlorination which is commonly used to disinfect drinking water and treat sewage actually mps in wastewater are discharged into natural water body through sewage treatment plants li et al 2018 ziajahromi et al 2017 as a powerful means of oxidation chlorination will change the physiochemical properties and the sorption capacity of mps furthermore c cl bonds which enhance ecological toxicity will be introduced on the surfaces of mps after chlorination el shahawi et al 2010 previous studies mainly focus on environmental distribution and abundance bergmann et al 2017 ding et al 2021 rillig 2012 sorption desorption behavior and toxicity of mps hodson et al 2017 turner et al 2020 zhang et al 2020b however there is insufficient works on the structural changes and aging mechanisms of mps especially about chlorination of mps in water environment therefore we exposed pc and ldpe to three artificial accelerated aging processes uv h2o uv h2o2 uv cl2 with the irradiation of uv light bpa monomer participates in the polycondensation of pc as a reaction unit while bpa only acts as an additive to change the structural properties of ldpe thus our work mainly deals with i the structural changes of ldpe and pc mps under three types of aging processes ii bpa binding mode within plastic matrix affecting the bpa sorption behaviors on aged mps iii the sorption and leaching behaviors of bpa by aged mps in various water chemistry conditions ph salinity co existing e2 and different water matrices it would provide a new insight on the environmental behaviors of pc and ldpe mps and their impact on bpa migration in natural conditions 2 materials and methods 2 1 aging of mps the chemicals used in this work were shown in the supporting information si the pc and ldpe mps particles were aged artificially in three different simulated environments i e h2o 10 h2o2 and cl2 solution under uv irradiation for aging experiment 8 g of mps particles were placed into cylindrical borosilicate dish 100 ml specific solution was added every 24 h and the samples were exposed to uv irradiation 100 w mercury lamps with main wavelength of 365 nm and continuously stirred for 8 days the aged particles were then washed repeatedly with ultrapure water to remove the intermediates during aging process then dried at 60 c and the final products were referred to mps uv h2o mps uv h2o2 and mps uv cl2 respectively the extent of surface oxidation specific surface area bet static water contact angles and crystallinity of mps were characterized which can be referred to the si 2 2 sorption of bpa on aged mps the borosilicate glass experimental apparatus used in this work was immersed in dilute hydrochloric acid solution rinsed with absolute methanol and ultrapure water dried before use and sealed with teflon caps in order to inhibit microbial activity add 25 mg l 1 nan3 to all solutions aim to assess the loss of bpa caused by volatilization and adsorption on glass surface the blank samples were conducted without mps and with the same initial bpa concentration all of the experiments were performed in triplicate to ensure the repeatability of the experiments the sorption kinetics experiments were performed using 40 ml of 50 μg l 1 bpa solution and 1 0 g virgin or aged mps particles and then the samples were placed in an air bathing thermostatic oscillator cha s china at 25 1 c and shaken continuously at 160 rpm for 15 days the samples were taken after 1 5 10 24 72 168 240 and 360 h after centrifugation of the supernatant at 10 000 rpm kaida tg16g china the concentration of bpa was detected with a waters acquity ultrahigh performance liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometer uhplc ms ms liu et al 2019c the data obtained by kinetics experiments showed that the adsorption reached equilibrium within 5 days and this equilibrium time was used in the subsequent sorption experiments the sorption isotherm experiments were carried out by adding 0 5 g of virgin or aged mps samples into 30 ml bottles containing 20 ml bpa solutions with concentrations of 0 50 100 200 and 500 μg l 1 the impacts of solution salinity and different water environment factors on the sorption capacity of aged mps were studied in 20 ml samples of bpa solutions with concentration of 500 μg l 1 the salinity of the solution selected in the experiment was 0 12 24 and 35 respectively and the different water bodies included ultrapure water yangtze river water and seawater the compositions and properties of the used different water matrices are listed in table s5 in addition the experiments concerning the effects of coexisting compounds were conducted using 500 μg l 1 bpa solutions coexisting with 10 100 and 200 μg l 1 17β estradiol e2 respectively all of the experiments were performed in accordance with the procedures that of sorption kinetics 2 3 leaching experiments 1 0 g of the mps particles used in releasing kinetics experiments were mixed with 40 ml ultrapure water and shaken over 45 days continuously to explore the release equilibrium time and the leaching samples were taken out at specific time intervals after the first leaching experiment the mps were separated from liquid and re put into 40 ml ultrapure water for the second leaching experiment and then the third leaching experiment was carried out successively bpa released from mps was quantified and the effects of ph salinity coexisting compounds e2 and water matrix on the leaching of bpa from aged mps were explored in accordance with the procedures that of sorption kinetics the ph values of the solution were 3 0 6 9 9 0 and 10 0 with adjusting with 0 1 m hcl and naoh and the salinity was 0 12 24 and 35 respectively in three consecutive leaching cycles the procedures of sample treatment and detection were the same with that of sorption kinetics experiments 2 4 statistical analysis the carbonyl index ci derived from atr ftir data can be used to describe the degree of surface oxidation of mps hirsch et al 2019 song et al 2017 the ci values can be calculated as 1 ci a c o a icb where a c o and a icb represent sorption intensity of carbonyl group around 1870 1650 cm 1 and an internal constant band at 1375 cm 1 attributed to methyl group bending vibration respectively the equilibrium sorption capacity and the equilibrium leaching capacity are calculated as 2 q e c 0 c e v where q e μg g 1 is the sorption or leaching capacity of bpa after equilibrium c 0 and c e represent initial and equilibrium bpa concentrations respectively and v l is the volume of the bpa solution the distribution coefficient k d l g 1 of bpa on mps was calculated using equilibrium concentrations on the mps and in water liu et al 2019d respectively 3 k d q e c e at c e 0 005 s w where s w represents the water solubility of bpa mg l 1 by means of regression analysis the correlation includes the sorption capacities q e and the physiochemical characteristics of mps particle size specific surface area crystallinity and hydrophobicity the correlation is significant at p 0 05 the t test is used to evaluate the significance of adsorption capacity and physiochemical characteristics of mps and the significance of threshold at p 0 05 a dual mode polymer sorption model including partition and adsorption mechanisms is used to describe the sorption of bpa onto mps fig 5 table s4 in high elastic amorphous regions of ldpe the sorption mechanism of bpa is better identified using a partition model the adsorption and pore filling are suitable to describe the interaction in crystalline regions of ldpe xing and pignatello 1997 the total sorption capacity of bpa on ldpe is sum of partition and adsorption which can be quantitatively described as 4 q t q p q a where q t is the total sorption capacity q p represents the partition capacity and q a represents the adsorption capacity zhu and chen 2000 zhu et al 2000 the freundlich isotherm model can be used to investigate the sorption isotherm of bpa on ldpe the total sorption capacity q t the sorption contribution through partition q p and the adsorption capacity q a can be calculated liu et al 2019c as 5 q t ac e n 6 q p m c e 7 q a ac e n m c e where a n and m are constants 3 results and discussion 3 1 characterization of aged mps one of the common features of ldpe and pc used in this work can be served as continuous bpa release sources bpa exists in the form of additives in ldpe while serves as monomers to form the skeletons of pc previous reports have been proved that the natural atmospheric exposure aging and artificial accelerated aging of pe plastics experience roughly the same aging mechanism except for different aging rates fan et al 2021 therefore the virgin ldpe and pc mps were aged in three kinds of artificial accelerated aging processes for 8 days which would be essential to understand the long term natural aging behaviors of mps in water environments usually the hydrocarbon polymer skeleton with o or n heteroatoms is more easily degraded than polymers made of carbon skeletons alone such as crystalline polyethylene plastics made from aliphatic chains ldpe mps is difficult to be decomposed by oxidation however polyester or polyamide are much easier to be oxidized carraher 2017 ultraviolet uv light is generally considered to be the main cause of plastic aging as can be seen from the microscopic images shown in fig 1 a and b there is no significant change in surface color morphology and size of aged ldpe particles while the surface color of aged pc particles has changed from white to pale yellow owing to the addition of oxygen functional groups chromophores on the surface of aged pc the specific surface areas of ldpe or pc mps were ldpe uv cl2 1 810 m2 g ldpe uv h2o2 1 630 m2 g ldpe uv h2o 1 519 m2 g ldpe 1 185 m2 g and pc uv cl2 0 938 m2 g pc uv h2o2 0 629 m2 g pc uv h2o 0 552 m2 g pc 0 319 m2 g respectively the specific surface areas of aged ldpe or aged pc increased obviously compared with that of virgin ones suggesting the formation of cracks on the surface of aged mps caused by oxidation processes or aging processes according to atr ftir spectra shown in fig 2 a new emerging absorption peak of aged ldpe can be observed at 1735 cm 1 due to the tensile vibration of carbonyl groups c o fig 2a and b while the intensity of c o peak at 1765 cm 1 of aged pc changed significantly due to different oxidation processes the degree of surface oxidation of mps can be quantified through carbonyl index ci with the increase of ci values the degree of surface oxidation and surface polarity are enhanced the ci values of aged ldpe ldpe uv h2o2 0 10 ldpe uv cl2 0 07 ldpe uv h2o 0 05 are slightly bigger than that of virgin ldpe 0 007 suggesting that the oxidation degree of virgin ldpe is relatively low to verify the oxidation degree of aged ldpe particles xps measurements of aged ldpe particles were conducted shown in fig 3 the oxygen element existed in virgin ldpe 2 58 maybe due to the oxygen in air and o was introduced to the surface of all aged ldpe mps with atomic percentage of 9 29 10 05 9 82 respectively for ldpe uv h2o ldpe uv h2o2 and ldpe uv cl2 in terms of the previous ft ir analysis it can be concluded that the increased xps peak appearing in the o 1s region can be assign to c o in fig 3e f and h respectively strikingly element cl was introduced to the surface of ldpe uv cl2 with atomic percentage of 4 07 the cl 2p peak can be deconvoluted into two peaks at 200 1 and 201 7 ev which can be ascribed to cl 2p3 2 and cl 2p1 2 spin orbital splitting photoelectrons in fig 3i respectively the peak at 284 6 ev in the c 1s region can be ascribed to c c and the peak at 285 4 ev can be ascribed to c c of virgin or aged ldep mps in fig 3a b c and g besides the c 1s peak was observed shift to higher binding energy positions 288 9 and 290 1 ev indicating that some c atoms were bonded to elements with larger electronegativity such as cl and o in this study generally element o is more electronegative than cl whereas the surface oxygen containing groups on aged ldpe usually contains hydrogen or hydroxyl group resulting in the reduced electron drawing ability of o atom therefore the peak at 288 3 ev can be attributed to the formation of c o on the surface of aged ldpe mps and the peak of higher binding energy position 290 1 ev can be attributed to c cl bond besides the ci value of virgin pc 3 21 is mainly attributed to the c o bonds in the existing molecular chain of ester groups and the ci values of pc uv h2o 3 25 pc uv cl2 3 20 are apparently approximate with that of the virgin pc while the ci value of pc uv h2o2 4 72 is significantly increased it turns out that no obvious surface oxidation phenomenon of pc occurred in the uv h2o and uv cl2 aging systems based on ci values while a notable oxidation phenomenon of pc was found in the uv h2o2 oxidation system reflecting in the characteristic absorption peak generating in region of 3100 3600 cm 1 due to oh groups stretching vibration further demonstrating the strong oxidation or change of pc in uv h2o2 system furthermore the hydrophobicity of aged ldpe is described by the static water contact angle shown in fig 1c a larger contact angle indicates greater hydrophobicity lee et al 2014 wu et al 2016 the hydrophobicity of aged ldpe decreases slightly which is attributable to the addition of oxygen containing functional groups on the surface of aged ldpe the aging processes enhance the hydrophilicity of ldpe and surface polarity slightly the reason for the marginal impact on hydrophobicity is due to the low amounts of oxygen containing functional groups on aged ldpe surface which is consistent with the phenomenon that the ci values of aged ldpe mps increased slightly for the aged pc mps still leached bpa rather than sorption so it s no need to discuss the relationship between water contact angles and bpasorption behaviors of aged pc mps in addition the crystallinity xc of aged ldpe or pc mps was characterized by xrd and dsc shown in fig 2d and e respectively the increased crystallinity of aged ldpe calculated by xrd results is ascribed to the destruction of high elastic amorphous regions attacked by reactive oxygen radicals and then the secondary crystallization of local regions caused by chain rearrangement in the oxidation process the aggregation structures of mps involve crystalline region and amorphous region according to the order degree of molecular chain arrangement the molecular chains are closely arranged and highly ordered in the crystalline region while arrangement of the molecular chains is loose and disorder in the amorphous region with a large number of free volumes and pores structure carraher 2017 so the amorphous regions in aged ldpe mps are the effective region for the sorption of organic pollutants hale et al 2011 in the case of serious oxidation degradation the crystallinity of ldpe increased significantly so the crystallinity of ldpe under different simulated aged conditions are determined to be in the order of ldpe uv h2o 44 2 ldpe uv cl2 43 9 ldpe uv h2o2 37 9 on the contrary the crystallinity of aged pc decreased slightly calculated by dsc results compared with that of virgin pc therefore the environmental behavior of aged pc would be expected completely different from that of aged ldpe according to our aforementioned structural differences table 1 3 2 sorption behaviors of bpa with aged ldpe 3 2 1 sorption of bpa on aged ldpe the sorption isotherms and kinetics of bpa on virgin and aged ldpe mps were investigated and presented in fig 4 the negative sorption capacity of bpa was noticed on virgin ldpe at different initial bpa concentrations in fig 4a or reaction time in fig 4b suggesting that bpa was released from virgin ldpe matrix into the water environment the presence of bpa additives in ldpe is reconfirmed by the atr ftir spectra in fig s1 comparing with the atr ftir spectra of standard ldpe it is found that the emerging new absorption peak at wavelength from 500 to 2000 cm 1 of virgin ldpe can be attributed to the presence of bpa additives meanwhile the intensity of the absorption peak at wavelength from 500 to 2000 cm 1 of aged ldpe shown in fig 2b decreased indicating the leakage of bpa from aged ldpe surfaces during the aging processes contrary to that of virgin ldpe the positively sorption capacity of bpa was obtained on aged ldpe mps and no bpa leakage was noticed on the surface of aged ldpe mps in ultrapure water the sorption capacities of aged ldpe mps towards bpa are listed in the order of ldpe uv h2o2 ldpe uv cl2 ldpe uv h2o and the according distribution coefficients kd at c e 0 005 s w are 22 2 8 57 and 7 60 l kg respectively those differences in solid liquid distribution of bpa can be attributed to the diverse structural properties of aged ldpe mps previous studies have shown that sorption of bpa on virgin ldpe mainly depended on hydrophobic interaction and the existence of high elastic amorphous domain in ldpe rochman et al 2013a zhu et al 2000 in this study aged ldpe mps remain the same state of highly elastic amorphous region due to the glass transition temperature of pe 125 c below room temperature so the main factors affecting bpa sorption capacity on ldpe mps are probably the content of high elastic amorphous region and hydrophobic interaction after aging the change of physiochemical properties of aged ldpe will inevitably affect the interaction with bpa the correlation analysis on bpa sorption capacity and structural properties of aged ldpe was presented in table s1 it shows that bpa sorption capacity has no correlation with the hydrophobicity or the specific surface area of aged ldpe p 0 05 the hydrophobicity is not the main reason to affect bpa sorption on aged ldpe mps and so does the influence of specific surface area s area on bpa sorption was also negligible compared with that of crystallinity of aged ldpe mps sorption capacity of aged ldpe mps was negatively correlated with their crystallinity p 0 05 r 0 999 usually an increase of crystallinity would lead to less content of high elastic amorphous regions which are the main effective region of bpa sorption carraher 2017 therefore the oxidation of high elastic amorphous regions of virgin ldpe will inevitably weaken the bpa sorption capacity guo et al studied the sorption behavior of seven types of pe particles with different physiochemical properties with four hydrophobic organic compounds i e phenanthrene naphthalene lindane and 1 naphthol and found that pe with low crystallinity has a strong sorption ability guo et al 2012 in conclusion the variation of crystallinity of aged ldpe under different aged conditions is probably the main determinant of the difference of bpa sorption capacity the sorption kinetics of bpa on aged ldpe mps reached equilibrium within 5 days shown in fig 4b pseudo first order kinetic model and pseudo second order kinetic model shown in table s2 were used to fit the sorption kinetics and the results were shown in table s3 it can be known that the pseudo second order kinetic model is more suitable to describe the bpa sorption behaviors on aged ldpe mps the sorption rate of bpa on aged ldpe can be influenced by 1 surface sorption depending on hydrophobicity and specific surface area based on the characterization of aged ldpe mps no significant differences in the hydrophobicity and specific surface area of aged ldpe are found therefore different aging conditions have no effect on surface adsorption of bpa on aged ldpe mps 2 the molecular structural changes increased crystallinity of the polymer plastics will lead to an increase in pollutants internal diffusion path length which will slow down the internal diffusion rate of pollutants bpa diffuses fastest on ldpe aged in ldpe uv h2o2 system due to the lowest crystallinity of the polymer however the internal structure has an obvious effect on the diffusion rate of pollutants when the crystallinity of the polymer is greater than 60 d aniello et al 2000 to sum up the difference in sorption and diffusion rates of bpa on diverse aged ldpe mps can be negligible in this work 3 2 2 sorption mechanism the contributions of partition q p and adsorption q a are largely dependent on the structural characteristics of aged ldpe and bpa concentrations shown in fig 5 and table s4 the sorption mechanisms of different aged ldpe with bpa were different velzeboer velzeboer et al 2014 and rochman rochman et al 2013a rochman et al 2013b found that the sorption of polychlorinated biphenyls pcbs and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons pahs on high elastic pe was mainly dominated by partition within the studied bpa concentrations ranged from 0 to 500 μg l 1 in this work the bpa sorption on aged ldpe mps in ldpe uv h2o2 and ldpe uv cl2 systems is dominated by adsorption mechanism while the bpa sorption mechanism on aged ldpe in ldpe uv h2o system is adsorption dominated at bpa concentrations below 300 μg l 1 and partition dominated at high enough bpa concentrations over 300 μg l 1 the contribution of adsorption in interaction between bpa and three aged ldpe is as follows ldpe uv h2o2 ldpe uv cl2 ldpe uv h2o at low crystallinity the contribution of adsorption of bpa increases and the proportions of partition reduce it indicates that the oxidation of high elastic amorphous regions in virgin ldpe results in the reduction of bpa partition on aged ldpe mps thus reducing the total sorption capacity 3 2 3 water chemistry effects different water environments may have various implications for interactions between mps and bpa bpa sorption capacity was considerably influenced by ph values shown in fig 4c the sorption capacity for bpa on aged ldpe mps decreased with increase of ph values from 3 0 to 11 0 probably due to hydrophobicity at low ph and greater solubility of bpa at high ph values while the increased electrostatic repulsion between bpa and negatively charged mps at high ph values the phpzc of ldpe ldpe uv h2o ldpe uv h2o2 and ldpe uv cl2 are 4 39 5 67 5 47 5 68 respectively shown in fig s2 decreased the bpa sorption capacity because bpa existed partially as an anion at high ph values pka values of 9 6 and 10 2 choi and lee 2017 tizaoui s work had also shown that the sorption of endocrine disrupting chemicals estrone 17α ethinylestradiol and 17β estradiol on pa 6 decrease drastically with increasing ph varied from 2 to 12 especially at ph 10 5 the pka of endocrine disrupting compounds tizaoui et al 2017 effects of salinity on the sorption of bpa on aged ldpe were shown in fig 4d with the increase of salinity from 0 to 35 the change of sorption capacity was not evident it is probably that the bpa solubility was not affected by the inorganic salts in water due to the low bpa concentration used in this study furthermore the polarity of aged ldpe in saline solutions has no obvious influence on bpa sorption due to the weak surface oxidation and slight change of the polarity hydrophobic organic contaminants hocs are likely to compete for sorption sites of mps in the water environment bpa sorption capacity on aged ldpe mps decreased significantly when e2 concentrations increased from 10 to 200 μg l 1 shown in fig 4e the competition for sorption sites on surface of aged ldpe mps between e2 and bpa can be the main reason due to their similar octyl alcohol water distribution coefficient compared with other aged ldpe the competition between e2 and bpa on ldpe aged in uv h2o2 system was more obvious indicating that surface adsorption contributed more for bpa interaction with ldpe uv h2o2 the interaction between aged ldpe and bpa is little affected by different water environmental matrix shown in fig 4f different water bodies had no significant effects on the adsorption of bpa by aged ldpe the combination of bpa and dissolved organic matter dom improve the solubility of bpa in water however the adsorption capacity of bpa by aged ldpe kept constant mainly because the pore structure of aged ldpe is more abundant and flexible in high elastic amorphous regions and bpa dom combination may be diffused into pore structures as well furthermore the bpa adsorption on aged ldpe in the high elastic amorphous regions contributes more to the total sorption capacity 3 3 leaching behaviors of bpa from aged pc 3 3 1 bpa leaching from aged pc bpa used as monomer makes up pc skeleton through condensation polymerization so the physiochemical properties and subsequent environmental behaviors of aged pc may be quite different from that of aged ldpe containing bpa additives due to a large amount of bpa contained in pc matrix a small amount of leakage would not cause significant changes in intensity of bpa absorption peak shown in the ftir spectra in fig 2c unlike rubbery state ldpe pc is an amorphous polymer in glassy state and the deformation and skeleton vibration of its molecular chain are restricted organics are mainly sorbed on the surface of pc rochman et al 2013b velzeboer et al 2014 the bpa is released either from virgin pc or aged pc continuously shown in fig 6 a and this leakage of bpa from virgin pc can reach equilibrium within 3 days while the leakage rate of bpa from aged pc becomes extremely slower and persistent eventually reaching equilibrium within 30 days the reason for this phenomenon is that bpa mainly released from the surface of virgin pc particles in a fast manner while bpa can further release from internal structure of aged pc particles in a relatively slower manner because more cracks are generated on the surface and extended into the interior of aged pc particles during ageing process in addition the molecular chains of aged pc mps may be broken by ultraviolet irradiated oxidation leading to the reduction of the polymer s crystallinity shown in fig 2e thus the large quantities of bpa monomers were produced and leaked from aged pc into water environment the leakage of bpa from virgin pc is 14 68 μg g bpa leakage from pc uv h2o 7 34 μg g and pc uv h2o2 7 34 μg g is reduced by 50 obviously and bpa leakage from pc uv cl2 53 02 μg g is 3 6 times that of virgin pc in fig 6a the release degree of bpa from pc uv cl2 with the ci value similar with virgin pc is the most serious probably due to extensive rupture of molecular chains of pc and the large amount of bpa generated from the matrix of pc uv cl2 mps and leaked into the solution in subsequent experiments however the leaked amounts of bpa from pc uv h2o2 with much larger ci value than virgin pc and uv h2o with the ci value similar with virgin pc are similar with the leakage of virgin pc the degree of oxidation of pc uv cl2 was analyzed through xps shown in fig 6h j and table s6 in order to find the true reason of the highest bpa leaking amount no element cl was found to be introduced on the surface of aged pc uv cl2 it means only oxidation occurred on the surface of pc rather than chlorine substitution in uv cl2 aging system based on the highest bpa leakage from pc uv cl2 in fig 6a we can deduce that the degree of oxidation of pc is the greatest in uv cl2 rather than in uv h2o2 or uv h2o system it is worth to note that just using ci values alone to determine the oxidation degree of pc plastics is flawed three cycles of bpa leakage experiments from aged pc mps shown in fig 6b proved that aged pc can be served as a continuous bpa releasing source bpa leakage from aged pc is significantly higher than that of virgin pc demonstrating the high eco environmental risks of pc mps in the real environment the effect of initial bpa concentrations on leakage of bpa monomers from aged pc can be seen in fig 6c with the increasing concentrations of bpa from 100 to 500 μg l 1 the bpa leakage from pc pc uv h2o and pc uv h2o2 increased 0 39 1 1 1 0 times while bpa leakage from pc uv cl2 increased about a half respectively the increase of background bpa concentrations significantly promoted the bpa leakage from virgin pc surface and aged pc in uv h2o and uv h2o2 systems besides compared with virgin pc the bpa leakage from pc uv cl2 with background concentrations from 0 to 100 μg l 1 was inhibited which may be ascribed to the competition from the presence of large amounts of bpa in solution in summary the presence of pollutants in actual water environment may stimulate release of monomer or additive from mps 3 3 2 water chemistry effects as can be seen from fig 6d bpa leakage slightly enhanced when ph increased from 3 0 to 9 0 when ph increased to 10 0 obvious bpa leakage was noticed mainly caused by the ionization of bpa which resulted in partial hydrolysis of surface molecular structure of pc under alkaline condition compared with virgin pc the ph factor had less effect on the leakage of bpa from aged pc which might result from degradation of bpa presented on pc surface in aged process in fig 6e the increased salinity inhibited the bpa leakage significantly from pc mainly because the salting out effect decreased the solubility of bpa in water solution the inhibition of salinity on bpa leakage of pc uv cl2 was very obvious suggesting that the strong inhibition of salinity on bpa diffusion behavior within the aged pc matrix in fig 6f with increasing concentrations of e2 from 0 to 300 μg l 1 the bpa leaching capacity from virgin pc pc uv h2o and pc uv h2o2 slightly increased while bpa leaching from pc uv cl2 remarkably inhibited the effects of different water environmental matrix on bpa leakage are shown in fig 6g the bpa leakage is various depending on actual water environmental matrix with different ph value and dom content among them bpa leakage either from virgin pc particles or from aged pc particles is clearly inhibited in simulated sea water due to the salting out effects bpa leakage from aged pc mps in uv cl2 system can be remarkably inhibited by any kind of water matrix generally speaking the aging behaviors of mps are closely related to the aging or surrounding environment under the light irradiation the molecular chain of polyethylene is broken to form free radicals which are easy to be oxidized to produce peroxide and carbonyl groups the aging process of polyethylene pe plastics is facilitated by repeated chain breaking and oxygenation the competitive reaction of crosslinking and degradation of pe in different aging process will lead to different microstructure and macroscopic properties pagès et al 1996 stark and matuana 2004 in this work the artificial accelerated aging of ldpe containing bpa additives exhibit different structural properties and bpa sorption behaviors especially ldpe uv h2o2 has the highest bpa sorption affinity c cl bonds formed in ldpe uv cl2 mps wu et al 2019 however it hasn t made significant contribution to the bpa partition on the surface of aged ldpe pc mps containing bpa monomers have flexible carbonate groups and rigid benzene rings on the molecular structure comparing with pe the structural ester bond of pc is easy to be hydrolyzed so pc is also prone to light heat and oxidation aging pc will undergo photo fries rearrangement and oxidative degradation under photooxidation especially in humid environment hydrolysis and aging of pc are easier to occur nagai et al 2003 in this work the artificial accelerated aging of pc mps containing bpa monomers show different structural properties and bpa leaching behaviors especially uv cl2 system cause more defects in inner structure of pc and leading to more bpa leakage 4 conclusions with vast amount of plastic debris entering into the environment the aging processes would have great impact on the structural properties of mps the environmental behaviors of hocs and relevant potential eco environmental risks in this study the ldpe and pc mps with different bpa binding modes were aged under three artificial accelerated aging conditions of uv h2o uv h2o2 and uv cl2 respectively the obvious variation in physiochemical properties and bpa sorption desorption leaching behaviors of aged ldpe and pc mps were noticed the virgin ldpe obviously released bpa additives however the aged ldpe released no bpa additives while had strong affinity to sorb bpa from water environment a significant bpa leakage from virgin or aged pc was found due to a large number of bpa monomers condensed within pc matrix virgin ldpe and pc mps used in this work can be regarded as continuous bpa release sources in the environment this study compares the aging behavior and potential environmental risks of mps containing additives or monomers from a new perspective and provides scientific basis for people to better understand the aging behaviors of plastics in real aquatic environment this work also shows that the same mps will exhibit different aging behaviors under various environmental conditions not to mention different types of mps especially the aging behaviors of mps with different monomer or additives would be even more complex meanwhile some associated influence factor of actual environment should not be ignored such as the influence of other additives within mps the formation of biofilm and bacteria on the mps gall and thompson 2015 in the near future there are still a lot of works on the aging of mps worth exploring

17096,due to the hydrophobicity and large specific surface area microplastics mps have become the vector for the migration of environmental organic pollutants environmental aging process affects the physiochemical structure of mps and their corresponding environmental behaviors in which the effect of bisphenol a bpa binding mode within plastic matrix on aging behaviors of mps is not reported in this work the structural properties and bpa sorption behaviors of low density polyethylene ldpe mps with bpa additives and polycarbonate pc mps with bpa monomers exposed to three types of artificial accelerated aging processes including uv h2o uv h2o2 and uv cl2 systems were comparatively investigated virgin ldpe and pc exhibited obvious leakage of bpa additives or monomers aged ldpe had stronger sorption ability towards bpa in water environment with no observed leakage of bpa additives while aged pc had extremely high leakage of bpa monomers which is similar to virgin pcs and was proved to be a persistent source of bpa release the bpa sorption on aged ldpe or leaching from aged pc was influenced by aging processes water ph salinity co existing estradiol e2 and water sources this study

structural properties and sorption behaviors of bpa on aged ldpe and pc mps with different bpa binding mode were investigated keywords microplastics aging bpa monomer or additive sorption leaching 1 introduction with the increasing use of one off plastic product the plastic debris pollution has become more and more serious owing to the mismanagement of plastic waste microplastics mps plastics with particle size less than 5 mm a worldwide emerging contaminants threat the growth and reproduction of aquatic organisms and numerous marine industries e g fishing shipping energy production aquaculture barnes 2002 cole et al 2011 in addition to being physical contaminants mps are manmade organic polymers consisting of plastic resins and a range of toxic chemicals additives gassel and rochman 2019 moreover it is possible that the plastic product contains either polymerized monomers or residual monomers because the monomer compositions can t be completely polymerized during plastic production under the action of ultraviolet radiation chemical oxidation mechanical wear and biological forces these toxic chemical monomers additives might be released from aged mps noumenon ateia et al 2020 auta et al 2017 bandow et al 2017 mao et al 2020 the aging process causes structural changes in the plastic such as oxygen content molecular weight surface morphology then affects interfacial sorption behaviors of mps gardette et al 2013 li et al 2020 lv et al 2017 previous studies have shown that the aging of mps leads to an arrangement of molecular chains breaks the relatively vulnerable bonds in the molecular chain and has a lasting effect on the properties of mps redjala et al 2019 senden et al 2012 gardette s work has shown that a c h bond breaks and forms free radicals during aging process of mps which reacts with oxygen to form oxygen free radicals leading to the formation of alcohols aldehydes acids and unsaturated groups gardette et al 2013 fan s work found that the adsorption capacity of aged polylactic acid pla towards tetracycline tc and ciprofloxacin cip increased due to the changes of its surface structure the increased intensity of oxygen containing functional groups and hydrophilicity fan et al 2021 antunes s work indicated that aged mps contained high concentration of polychlorinated biphenyls pcbs owing to the increase of the specific surface area of mps and had a long reaction time with pollutants antunes et al 2013 by contrast endo s results demonstrated that aging of pe and pp mps had no effect on interaction with pcbs weathering and crystallinity may have no clear relationship with pcbs sorption endo et al 2005 at present there is no consensus of the relationship between the structural properties of aged plastics and their sorption behaviors there is still a lot of important work to be explored on the aging of mps bisphenol a bpa is one of the highest production of industrial chemicals globally and is the most representative chemicals of the common additives contained in some mps chen et al 2016 jalal et al 2018 in general different types of additives are added initially in the production to improve specific properties of plastic for example phthalates are added to make plastic more flexible manoli and voutsa 2019 vandenberg et al 2007 yu et al 2008 in almost all cases additives are not chemically bound to the plastic polymer these additives may be released from plastics into the air water and soil at all stages of the commercial product life cycle and may undesirably migrate and lead to human exposure through packaging materials for food hahladakis et al 2018 li et al noticed that dibutyl phthalate dbp and di 2 ethylhexyl phthalate dehp were migrated from disposable tableware to drinking water samples 10 13 ng ml and 5 83 ng ml respectively li et al 2016 begley et al investigated the leaching of caprolactam and oligomers from nylon 6 and nylon 6 66 polymer into oil almost oven heating conditions 176 c for 30 min they demonstrated that the total amount of the migrated nylon 6 66 oligomers 15 5 μg g 1 was equivalent to almost 43 of the total oligomers presented in the packaging polymers begley et al 1995 and several studies had confirmed that bpa released from commercial plastics into food such as can linings pc bottles and baby bottles goodson et al 2004 kubwabo et al 2009 bpa is widely used in the manufacture of canned food and beverage food packages infant pacifiers water bottles sealants for dental fillings eyeglasses and hundreds of other commodities in order to enhance the durability elasticity transparency lightweight and outstanding impact resistance during the manufacture of plastic products bpa is the primary intermediate of polycarbonate plastics and epoxy resin yu et al 2008 during use of those commercial plastic products bpa can be released under high temperature or acidic alkaline environments threatening the health of human body lin et al 2017 wang et al 2015 wang s work had shown that ten brands of pc bottled waters were detected to contain bpa with high concentrations from 111 8 to 6452 8 ng l which would significantly increase human bpa daily intake and health risks wang et al 2020 goodson s work indicated that total amounts of migrated bpa from can coating into 4 different food media products minced beef in gravy spring vegetable soup evaporated milk carrots in brine were quite high 80 to 100 of total bpa present in coating during sealing and sterilization process at 121 c for 90 min goodson et al 2004 as an endocrine disrupting compound bpa may have adverse effects on developmental reproductive neurological immune system and endocrine system even triggering cancer lin et al 2017 zhang et al 2020a baby bottles containing bpa have been banned in 2011 by the european union nowadays many field studies have explored the mechanism about the interaction between mps and bpa but the information on the interaction between aged mps and bpa in water is still limited currently simulated aging condition are limited to thermal activated persulfate oxidation liu et al 2019a ozone oxidation liu et al 2019b and ultraviolet radiation combined with air seawater h2o2 cai et al 2018 hüffer et al 2018 there are few studies on aging of mps by chlorination which is commonly used to disinfect drinking water and treat sewage actually mps in wastewater are discharged into natural water body through sewage treatment plants li et al 2018 ziajahromi et al 2017 as a powerful means of oxidation chlorination will change the physiochemical properties and the sorption capacity of mps furthermore c cl bonds which enhance ecological toxicity will be introduced on the surfaces of mps after chlorination el shahawi et al 2010 previous studies mainly focus on environmental distribution and abundance bergmann et al 2017 ding et al 2021 rillig 2012 sorption desorption behavior and toxicity of mps hodson et al 2017 turner et al 2020 zhang et al 2020b however there is insufficient works on the structural changes and aging mechanisms of mps especially about chlorination of mps in water environment therefore we exposed pc and ldpe to three artificial accelerated aging processes uv h2o uv h2o2 uv cl2 with the irradiation of uv light bpa monomer participates in the polycondensation of pc as a reaction unit while bpa only acts as an additive to change the structural properties of ldpe thus our work mainly deals with i the structural changes of ldpe and pc mps under three types of aging processes ii bpa binding mode within plastic matrix affecting the bpa sorption behaviors on aged mps iii the sorption and leaching behaviors of bpa by aged mps in various water chemistry conditions ph salinity co existing e2 and different water matrices it would provide a new insight on the environmental behaviors of pc and ldpe mps and their impact on bpa migration in natural conditions 2 materials and methods 2 1 aging of mps the chemicals used in this work were shown in the supporting information si the pc and ldpe mps particles were aged artificially in three different simulated environments i e h2o 10 h2o2 and cl2 solution under uv irradiation for aging experiment 8 g of mps particles were placed into cylindrical borosilicate dish 100 ml specific solution was added every 24 h and the samples were exposed to uv irradiation 100 w mercury lamps with main wavelength of 365 nm and continuously stirred for 8 days the aged particles were then washed repeatedly with ultrapure water to remove the intermediates during aging process then dried at 60 c and the final products were referred to mps uv h2o mps uv h2o2 and mps uv cl2 respectively the extent of surface oxidation specific surface area bet static water contact angles and crystallinity of mps were characterized which can be referred to the si 2 2 sorption of bpa on aged mps the borosilicate glass experimental apparatus used in this work was immersed in dilute hydrochloric acid solution rinsed with absolute methanol and ultrapure water dried before use and sealed with teflon caps in order to inhibit microbial activity add 25 mg l 1 nan3 to all solutions aim to assess the loss of bpa caused by volatilization and adsorption on glass surface the blank samples were conducted without mps and with the same initial bpa concentration all of the experiments were performed in triplicate to ensure the repeatability of the experiments the sorption kinetics experiments were performed using 40 ml of 50 μg l 1 bpa solution and 1 0 g virgin or aged mps particles and then the samples were placed in an air bathing thermostatic oscillator cha s china at 25 1 c and shaken continuously at 160 rpm for 15 days the samples were taken after 1 5 10 24 72 168 240 and 360 h after centrifugation of the supernatant at 10 000 rpm kaida tg16g china the concentration of bpa was detected with a waters acquity ultrahigh performance liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometer uhplc ms ms liu et al 2019c the data obtained by kinetics experiments showed that the adsorption reached equilibrium within 5 days and this equilibrium time was used in the subsequent sorption experiments the sorption isotherm experiments were carried out by adding 0 5 g of virgin or aged mps samples into 30 ml bottles containing 20 ml bpa solutions with concentrations of 0 50 100 200 and 500 μg l 1 the impacts of solution salinity and different water environment factors on the sorption capacity of aged mps were studied in 20 ml samples of bpa solutions with concentration of 500 μg l 1 the salinity of the solution selected in the experiment was 0 12 24 and 35 respectively and the different water bodies included ultrapure water yangtze river water and seawater the compositions and properties of the used different water matrices are listed in table s5 in addition the experiments concerning the effects of coexisting compounds were conducted using 500 μg l 1 bpa solutions coexisting with 10 100 and 200 μg l 1 17β estradiol e2 respectively all of the experiments were performed in accordance with the procedures that of sorption kinetics 2 3 leaching experiments 1 0 g of the mps particles used in releasing kinetics experiments were mixed with 40 ml ultrapure water and shaken over 45 days continuously to explore the release equilibrium time and the leaching samples were taken out at specific time intervals after the first leaching experiment the mps were separated from liquid and re put into 40 ml ultrapure water for the second leaching experiment and then the third leaching experiment was carried out successively bpa released from mps was quantified and the effects of ph salinity coexisting compounds e2 and water matrix on the leaching of bpa from aged mps were explored in accordance with the procedures that of sorption kinetics the ph values of the solution were 3 0 6 9 9 0 and 10 0 with adjusting with 0 1 m hcl and naoh and the salinity was 0 12 24 and 35 respectively in three consecutive leaching cycles the procedures of sample treatment and detection were the same with that of sorption kinetics experiments 2 4 statistical analysis the carbonyl index ci derived from atr ftir data can be used to describe the degree of surface oxidation of mps hirsch et al 2019 song et al 2017 the ci values can be calculated as 1 ci a c o a icb where a c o and a icb represent sorption intensity of carbonyl group around 1870 1650 cm 1 and an internal constant band at 1375 cm 1 attributed to methyl group bending vibration respectively the equilibrium sorption capacity and the equilibrium leaching capacity are calculated as 2 q e c 0 c e v where q e μg g 1 is the sorption or leaching capacity of bpa after equilibrium c 0 and c e represent initial and equilibrium bpa concentrations respectively and v l is the volume of the bpa solution the distribution coefficient k d l g 1 of bpa on mps was calculated using equilibrium concentrations on the mps and in water liu et al 2019d respectively 3 k d q e c e at c e 0 005 s w where s w represents the water solubility of bpa mg l 1 by means of regression analysis the correlation includes the sorption capacities q e and the physiochemical characteristics of mps particle size specific surface area crystallinity and hydrophobicity the correlation is significant at p 0 05 the t test is used to evaluate the significance of adsorption capacity and physiochemical characteristics of mps and the significance of threshold at p 0 05 a dual mode polymer sorption model including partition and adsorption mechanisms is used to describe the sorption of bpa onto mps fig 5 table s4 in high elastic amorphous regions of ldpe the sorption mechanism of bpa is better identified using a partition model the adsorption and pore filling are suitable to describe the interaction in crystalline regions of ldpe xing and pignatello 1997 the total sorption capacity of bpa on ldpe is sum of partition and adsorption which can be quantitatively described as 4 q t q p q a where q t is the total sorption capacity q p represents the partition capacity and q a represents the adsorption capacity zhu and chen 2000 zhu et al 2000 the freundlich isotherm model can be used to investigate the sorption isotherm of bpa on ldpe the total sorption capacity q t the sorption contribution through partition q p and the adsorption capacity q a can be calculated liu et al 2019c as 5 q t ac e n 6 q p m c e 7 q a ac e n m c e where a n and m are constants 3 results and discussion 3 1 characterization of aged mps one of the common features of ldpe and pc used in this work can be served as continuous bpa release sources bpa exists in the form of additives in ldpe while serves as monomers to form the skeletons of pc previous reports have been proved that the natural atmospheric exposure aging and artificial accelerated aging of pe plastics experience roughly the same aging mechanism except for different aging rates fan et al 2021 therefore the virgin ldpe and pc mps were aged in three kinds of artificial accelerated aging processes for 8 days which would be essential to understand the long term natural aging behaviors of mps in water environments usually the hydrocarbon polymer skeleton with o or n heteroatoms is more easily degraded than polymers made of carbon skeletons alone such as crystalline polyethylene plastics made from aliphatic chains ldpe mps is difficult to be decomposed by oxidation however polyester or polyamide are much easier to be oxidized carraher 2017 ultraviolet uv light is generally considered to be the main cause of plastic aging as can be seen from the microscopic images shown in fig 1 a and b there is no significant change in surface color morphology and size of aged ldpe particles while the surface color of aged pc particles has changed from white to pale yellow owing to the addition of oxygen functional groups chromophores on the surface of aged pc the specific surface areas of ldpe or pc mps were ldpe uv cl2 1 810 m2 g ldpe uv h2o2 1 630 m2 g ldpe uv h2o 1 519 m2 g ldpe 1 185 m2 g and pc uv cl2 0 938 m2 g pc uv h2o2 0 629 m2 g pc uv h2o 0 552 m2 g pc 0 319 m2 g respectively the specific surface areas of aged ldpe or aged pc increased obviously compared with that of virgin ones suggesting the formation of cracks on the surface of aged mps caused by oxidation processes or aging processes according to atr ftir spectra shown in fig 2 a new emerging absorption peak of aged ldpe can be observed at 1735 cm 1 due to the tensile vibration of carbonyl groups c o fig 2a and b while the intensity of c o peak at 1765 cm 1 of aged pc changed significantly due to different oxidation processes the degree of surface oxidation of mps can be quantified through carbonyl index ci with the increase of ci values the degree of surface oxidation and surface polarity are enhanced the ci values of aged ldpe ldpe uv h2o2 0 10 ldpe uv cl2 0 07 ldpe uv h2o 0 05 are slightly bigger than that of virgin ldpe 0 007 suggesting that the oxidation degree of virgin ldpe is relatively low to verify the oxidation degree of aged ldpe particles xps measurements of aged ldpe particles were conducted shown in fig 3 the oxygen element existed in virgin ldpe 2 58 maybe due to the oxygen in air and o was introduced to the surface of all aged ldpe mps with atomic percentage of 9 29 10 05 9 82 respectively for ldpe uv h2o ldpe uv h2o2 and ldpe uv cl2 in terms of the previous ft ir analysis it can be concluded that the increased xps peak appearing in the o 1s region can be assign to c o in fig 3e f and h respectively strikingly element cl was introduced to the surface of ldpe uv cl2 with atomic percentage of 4 07 the cl 2p peak can be deconvoluted into two peaks at 200 1 and 201 7 ev which can be ascribed to cl 2p3 2 and cl 2p1 2 spin orbital splitting photoelectrons in fig 3i respectively the peak at 284 6 ev in the c 1s region can be ascribed to c c and the peak at 285 4 ev can be ascribed to c c of virgin or aged ldep mps in fig 3a b c and g besides the c 1s peak was observed shift to higher binding energy positions 288 9 and 290 1 ev indicating that some c atoms were bonded to elements with larger electronegativity such as cl and o in this study generally element o is more electronegative than cl whereas the surface oxygen containing groups on aged ldpe usually contains hydrogen or hydroxyl group resulting in the reduced electron drawing ability of o atom therefore the peak at 288 3 ev can be attributed to the formation of c o on the surface of aged ldpe mps and the peak of higher binding energy position 290 1 ev can be attributed to c cl bond besides the ci value of virgin pc 3 21 is mainly attributed to the c o bonds in the existing molecular chain of ester groups and the ci values of pc uv h2o 3 25 pc uv cl2 3 20 are apparently approximate with that of the virgin pc while the ci value of pc uv h2o2 4 72 is significantly increased it turns out that no obvious surface oxidation phenomenon of pc occurred in the uv h2o and uv cl2 aging systems based on ci values while a notable oxidation phenomenon of pc was found in the uv h2o2 oxidation system reflecting in the characteristic absorption peak generating in region of 3100 3600 cm 1 due to oh groups stretching vibration further demonstrating the strong oxidation or change of pc in uv h2o2 system furthermore the hydrophobicity of aged ldpe is described by the static water contact angle shown in fig 1c a larger contact angle indicates greater hydrophobicity lee et al 2014 wu et al 2016 the hydrophobicity of aged ldpe decreases slightly which is attributable to the addition of oxygen containing functional groups on the surface of aged ldpe the aging processes enhance the hydrophilicity of ldpe and surface polarity slightly the reason for the marginal impact on hydrophobicity is due to the low amounts of oxygen containing functional groups on aged ldpe surface which is consistent with the phenomenon that the ci values of aged ldpe mps increased slightly for the aged pc mps still leached bpa rather than sorption so it s no need to discuss the relationship between water contact angles and bpasorption behaviors of aged pc mps in addition the crystallinity xc of aged ldpe or pc mps was characterized by xrd and dsc shown in fig 2d and e respectively the increased crystallinity of aged ldpe calculated by xrd results is ascribed to the destruction of high elastic amorphous regions attacked by reactive oxygen radicals and then the secondary crystallization of local regions caused by chain rearrangement in the oxidation process the aggregation structures of mps involve crystalline region and amorphous region according to the order degree of molecular chain arrangement the molecular chains are closely arranged and highly ordered in the crystalline region while arrangement of the molecular chains is loose and disorder in the amorphous region with a large number of free volumes and pores structure carraher 2017 so the amorphous regions in aged ldpe mps are the effective region for the sorption of organic pollutants hale et al 2011 in the case of serious oxidation degradation the crystallinity of ldpe increased significantly so the crystallinity of ldpe under different simulated aged conditions are determined to be in the order of ldpe uv h2o 44 2 ldpe uv cl2 43 9 ldpe uv h2o2 37 9 on the contrary the crystallinity of aged pc decreased slightly calculated by dsc results compared with that of virgin pc therefore the environmental behavior of aged pc would be expected completely different from that of aged ldpe according to our aforementioned structural differences table 1 3 2 sorption behaviors of bpa with aged ldpe 3 2 1 sorption of bpa on aged ldpe the sorption isotherms and kinetics of bpa on virgin and aged ldpe mps were investigated and presented in fig 4 the negative sorption capacity of bpa was noticed on virgin ldpe at different initial bpa concentrations in fig 4a or reaction time in fig 4b suggesting that bpa was released from virgin ldpe matrix into the water environment the presence of bpa additives in ldpe is reconfirmed by the atr ftir spectra in fig s1 comparing with the atr ftir spectra of standard ldpe it is found that the emerging new absorption peak at wavelength from 500 to 2000 cm 1 of virgin ldpe can be attributed to the presence of bpa additives meanwhile the intensity of the absorption peak at wavelength from 500 to 2000 cm 1 of aged ldpe shown in fig 2b decreased indicating the leakage of bpa from aged ldpe surfaces during the aging processes contrary to that of virgin ldpe the positively sorption capacity of bpa was obtained on aged ldpe mps and no bpa leakage was noticed on the surface of aged ldpe mps in ultrapure water the sorption capacities of aged ldpe mps towards bpa are listed in the order of ldpe uv h2o2 ldpe uv cl2 ldpe uv h2o and the according distribution coefficients kd at c e 0 005 s w are 22 2 8 57 and 7 60 l kg respectively those differences in solid liquid distribution of bpa can be attributed to the diverse structural properties of aged ldpe mps previous studies have shown that sorption of bpa on virgin ldpe mainly depended on hydrophobic interaction and the existence of high elastic amorphous domain in ldpe rochman et al 2013a zhu et al 2000 in this study aged ldpe mps remain the same state of highly elastic amorphous region due to the glass transition temperature of pe 125 c below room temperature so the main factors affecting bpa sorption capacity on ldpe mps are probably the content of high elastic amorphous region and hydrophobic interaction after aging the change of physiochemical properties of aged ldpe will inevitably affect the interaction with bpa the correlation analysis on bpa sorption capacity and structural properties of aged ldpe was presented in table s1 it shows that bpa sorption capacity has no correlation with the hydrophobicity or the specific surface area of aged ldpe p 0 05 the hydrophobicity is not the main reason to affect bpa sorption on aged ldpe mps and so does the influence of specific surface area s area on bpa sorption was also negligible compared with that of crystallinity of aged ldpe mps sorption capacity of aged ldpe mps was negatively correlated with their crystallinity p 0 05 r 0 999 usually an increase of crystallinity would lead to less content of high elastic amorphous regions which are the main effective region of bpa sorption carraher 2017 therefore the oxidation of high elastic amorphous regions of virgin ldpe will inevitably weaken the bpa sorption capacity guo et al studied the sorption behavior of seven types of pe particles with different physiochemical properties with four hydrophobic organic compounds i e phenanthrene naphthalene lindane and 1 naphthol and found that pe with low crystallinity has a strong sorption ability guo et al 2012 in conclusion the variation of crystallinity of aged ldpe under different aged conditions is probably the main determinant of the difference of bpa sorption capacity the sorption kinetics of bpa on aged ldpe mps reached equilibrium within 5 days shown in fig 4b pseudo first order kinetic model and pseudo second order kinetic model shown in table s2 were used to fit the sorption kinetics and the results were shown in table s3 it can be known that the pseudo second order kinetic model is more suitable to describe the bpa sorption behaviors on aged ldpe mps the sorption rate of bpa on aged ldpe can be influenced by 1 surface sorption depending on hydrophobicity and specific surface area based on the characterization of aged ldpe mps no significant differences in the hydrophobicity and specific surface area of aged ldpe are found therefore different aging conditions have no effect on surface adsorption of bpa on aged ldpe mps 2 the molecular structural changes increased crystallinity of the polymer plastics will lead to an increase in pollutants internal diffusion path length which will slow down the internal diffusion rate of pollutants bpa diffuses fastest on ldpe aged in ldpe uv h2o2 system due to the lowest crystallinity of the polymer however the internal structure has an obvious effect on the diffusion rate of pollutants when the crystallinity of the polymer is greater than 60 d aniello et al 2000 to sum up the difference in sorption and diffusion rates of bpa on diverse aged ldpe mps can be negligible in this work 3 2 2 sorption mechanism the contributions of partition q p and adsorption q a are largely dependent on the structural characteristics of aged ldpe and bpa concentrations shown in fig 5 and table s4 the sorption mechanisms of different aged ldpe with bpa were different velzeboer velzeboer et al 2014 and rochman rochman et al 2013a rochman et al 2013b found that the sorption of polychlorinated biphenyls pcbs and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons pahs on high elastic pe was mainly dominated by partition within the studied bpa concentrations ranged from 0 to 500 μg l 1 in this work the bpa sorption on aged ldpe mps in ldpe uv h2o2 and ldpe uv cl2 systems is dominated by adsorption mechanism while the bpa sorption mechanism on aged ldpe in ldpe uv h2o system is adsorption dominated at bpa concentrations below 300 μg l 1 and partition dominated at high enough bpa concentrations over 300 μg l 1 the contribution of adsorption in interaction between bpa and three aged ldpe is as follows ldpe uv h2o2 ldpe uv cl2 ldpe uv h2o at low crystallinity the contribution of adsorption of bpa increases and the proportions of partition reduce it indicates that the oxidation of high elastic amorphous regions in virgin ldpe results in the reduction of bpa partition on aged ldpe mps thus reducing the total sorption capacity 3 2 3 water chemistry effects different water environments may have various implications for interactions between mps and bpa bpa sorption capacity was considerably influenced by ph values shown in fig 4c the sorption capacity for bpa on aged ldpe mps decreased with increase of ph values from 3 0 to 11 0 probably due to hydrophobicity at low ph and greater solubility of bpa at high ph values while the increased electrostatic repulsion between bpa and negatively charged mps at high ph values the phpzc of ldpe ldpe uv h2o ldpe uv h2o2 and ldpe uv cl2 are 4 39 5 67 5 47 5 68 respectively shown in fig s2 decreased the bpa sorption capacity because bpa existed partially as an anion at high ph values pka values of 9 6 and 10 2 choi and lee 2017 tizaoui s work had also shown that the sorption of endocrine disrupting chemicals estrone 17α ethinylestradiol and 17β estradiol on pa 6 decrease drastically with increasing ph varied from 2 to 12 especially at ph 10 5 the pka of endocrine disrupting compounds tizaoui et al 2017 effects of salinity on the sorption of bpa on aged ldpe were shown in fig 4d with the increase of salinity from 0 to 35 the change of sorption capacity was not evident it is probably that the bpa solubility was not affected by the inorganic salts in water due to the low bpa concentration used in this study furthermore the polarity of aged ldpe in saline solutions has no obvious influence on bpa sorption due to the weak surface oxidation and slight change of the polarity hydrophobic organic contaminants hocs are likely to compete for sorption sites of mps in the water environment bpa sorption capacity on aged ldpe mps decreased significantly when e2 concentrations increased from 10 to 200 μg l 1 shown in fig 4e the competition for sorption sites on surface of aged ldpe mps between e2 and bpa can be the main reason due to their similar octyl alcohol water distribution coefficient compared with other aged ldpe the competition between e2 and bpa on ldpe aged in uv h2o2 system was more obvious indicating that surface adsorption contributed more for bpa interaction with ldpe uv h2o2 the interaction between aged ldpe and bpa is little affected by different water environmental matrix shown in fig 4f different water bodies had no significant effects on the adsorption of bpa by aged ldpe the combination of bpa and dissolved organic matter dom improve the solubility of bpa in water however the adsorption capacity of bpa by aged ldpe kept constant mainly because the pore structure of aged ldpe is more abundant and flexible in high elastic amorphous regions and bpa dom combination may be diffused into pore structures as well furthermore the bpa adsorption on aged ldpe in the high elastic amorphous regions contributes more to the total sorption capacity 3 3 leaching behaviors of bpa from aged pc 3 3 1 bpa leaching from aged pc bpa used as monomer makes up pc skeleton through condensation polymerization so the physiochemical properties and subsequent environmental behaviors of aged pc may be quite different from that of aged ldpe containing bpa additives due to a large amount of bpa contained in pc matrix a small amount of leakage would not cause significant changes in intensity of bpa absorption peak shown in the ftir spectra in fig 2c unlike rubbery state ldpe pc is an amorphous polymer in glassy state and the deformation and skeleton vibration of its molecular chain are restricted organics are mainly sorbed on the surface of pc rochman et al 2013b velzeboer et al 2014 the bpa is released either from virgin pc or aged pc continuously shown in fig 6 a and this leakage of bpa from virgin pc can reach equilibrium within 3 days while the leakage rate of bpa from aged pc becomes extremely slower and persistent eventually reaching equilibrium within 30 days the reason for this phenomenon is that bpa mainly released from the surface of virgin pc particles in a fast manner while bpa can further release from internal structure of aged pc particles in a relatively slower manner because more cracks are generated on the surface and extended into the interior of aged pc particles during ageing process in addition the molecular chains of aged pc mps may be broken by ultraviolet irradiated oxidation leading to the reduction of the polymer s crystallinity shown in fig 2e thus the large quantities of bpa monomers were produced and leaked from aged pc into water environment the leakage of bpa from virgin pc is 14 68 μg g bpa leakage from pc uv h2o 7 34 μg g and pc uv h2o2 7 34 μg g is reduced by 50 obviously and bpa leakage from pc uv cl2 53 02 μg g is 3 6 times that of virgin pc in fig 6a the release degree of bpa from pc uv cl2 with the ci value similar with virgin pc is the most serious probably due to extensive rupture of molecular chains of pc and the large amount of bpa generated from the matrix of pc uv cl2 mps and leaked into the solution in subsequent experiments however the leaked amounts of bpa from pc uv h2o2 with much larger ci value than virgin pc and uv h2o with the ci value similar with virgin pc are similar with the leakage of virgin pc the degree of oxidation of pc uv cl2 was analyzed through xps shown in fig 6h j and table s6 in order to find the true reason of the highest bpa leaking amount no element cl was found to be introduced on the surface of aged pc uv cl2 it means only oxidation occurred on the surface of pc rather than chlorine substitution in uv cl2 aging system based on the highest bpa leakage from pc uv cl2 in fig 6a we can deduce that the degree of oxidation of pc is the greatest in uv cl2 rather than in uv h2o2 or uv h2o system it is worth to note that just using ci values alone to determine the oxidation degree of pc plastics is flawed three cycles of bpa leakage experiments from aged pc mps shown in fig 6b proved that aged pc can be served as a continuous bpa releasing source bpa leakage from aged pc is significantly higher than that of virgin pc demonstrating the high eco environmental risks of pc mps in the real environment the effect of initial bpa concentrations on leakage of bpa monomers from aged pc can be seen in fig 6c with the increasing concentrations of bpa from 100 to 500 μg l 1 the bpa leakage from pc pc uv h2o and pc uv h2o2 increased 0 39 1 1 1 0 times while bpa leakage from pc uv cl2 increased about a half respectively the increase of background bpa concentrations significantly promoted the bpa leakage from virgin pc surface and aged pc in uv h2o and uv h2o2 systems besides compared with virgin pc the bpa leakage from pc uv cl2 with background concentrations from 0 to 100 μg l 1 was inhibited which may be ascribed to the competition from the presence of large amounts of bpa in solution in summary the presence of pollutants in actual water environment may stimulate release of monomer or additive from mps 3 3 2 water chemistry effects as can be seen from fig 6d bpa leakage slightly enhanced when ph increased from 3 0 to 9 0 when ph increased to 10 0 obvious bpa leakage was noticed mainly caused by the ionization of bpa which resulted in partial hydrolysis of surface molecular structure of pc under alkaline condition compared with virgin pc the ph factor had less effect on the leakage of bpa from aged pc which might result from degradation of bpa presented on pc surface in aged process in fig 6e the increased salinity inhibited the bpa leakage significantly from pc mainly because the salting out effect decreased the solubility of bpa in water solution the inhibition of salinity on bpa leakage of pc uv cl2 was very obvious suggesting that the strong inhibition of salinity on bpa diffusion behavior within the aged pc matrix in fig 6f with increasing concentrations of e2 from 0 to 300 μg l 1 the bpa leaching capacity from virgin pc pc uv h2o and pc uv h2o2 slightly increased while bpa leaching from pc uv cl2 remarkably inhibited the effects of different water environmental matrix on bpa leakage are shown in fig 6g the bpa leakage is various depending on actual water environmental matrix with different ph value and dom content among them bpa leakage either from virgin pc particles or from aged pc particles is clearly inhibited in simulated sea water due to the salting out effects bpa leakage from aged pc mps in uv cl2 system can be remarkably inhibited by any kind of water matrix generally speaking the aging behaviors of mps are closely related to the aging or surrounding environment under the light irradiation the molecular chain of polyethylene is broken to form free radicals which are easy to be oxidized to produce peroxide and carbonyl groups the aging process of polyethylene pe plastics is facilitated by repeated chain breaking and oxygenation the competitive reaction of crosslinking and degradation of pe in different aging process will lead to different microstructure and macroscopic properties pagès et al 1996 stark and matuana 2004 in this work the artificial accelerated aging of ldpe containing bpa additives exhibit different structural properties and bpa sorption behaviors especially ldpe uv h2o2 has the highest bpa sorption affinity c cl bonds formed in ldpe uv cl2 mps wu et al 2019 however it hasn t made significant contribution to the bpa partition on the surface of aged ldpe pc mps containing bpa monomers have flexible carbonate groups and rigid benzene rings on the molecular structure comparing with pe the structural ester bond of pc is easy to be hydrolyzed so pc is also prone to light heat and oxidation aging pc will undergo photo fries rearrangement and oxidative degradation under photooxidation especially in humid environment hydrolysis and aging of pc are easier to occur nagai et al 2003 in this work the artificial accelerated aging of pc mps containing bpa monomers show different structural properties and bpa leaching behaviors especially uv cl2 system cause more defects in inner structure of pc and leading to more bpa leakage 4 conclusions with vast amount of plastic debris entering into the environment the aging processes would have great impact on the structural properties of mps the environmental behaviors of hocs and relevant potential eco environmental risks in this study the ldpe and pc mps with different bpa binding modes were aged under three artificial accelerated aging conditions of uv h2o uv h2o2 and uv cl2 respectively the obvious variation in physiochemical properties and bpa sorption desorption leaching behaviors of aged ldpe and pc mps were noticed the virgin ldpe obviously released bpa additives however the aged ldpe released no bpa additives while had strong affinity to sorb bpa from water environment a significant bpa leakage from virgin or aged pc was found due to a large number of bpa monomers condensed within pc matrix virgin ldpe and pc mps used in this work can be regarded as continuous bpa release sources in the environment this study compares the aging behavior and potential environmental risks of mps containing additives or monomers from a new perspective and provides scientific basis for people to better understand the aging behaviors of plastics in real aquatic environment this work also shows that the same mps will exhibit different aging behaviors under various environmental conditions not to mention different types of mps especially the aging behaviors of mps with different monomer or additives would be even more complex meanwhile some associated influence factor of actual environment should not be ignored such as the influence of other additives within mps the formation of biofilm and bacteria on the mps gall and thompson 2015 in the near future there are still a lot of works on the aging of mps worth exploring

17097,though hydroxylamine nh2oh is effective for accelerating pollutants degradation in fenton and fenton like systems the effect of anions simultaneously introduced by the hydroxylamine salts have always been ignored herein effect of two commonly used hydroxylamine salts hydroxylamine hydrochloride nh2oh hcl and hydroxylamine sulfate nh2oh 2 h2so4 for the degradation of dimethyl phthalate dmp in peroxymonosulfate pms fe ii system was comparatively investigated degradation efficiency of dmp with nh2oh hcl was 1 6 times of that with same dosages of nh2oh 2 h2so4 so4 fe iv and oh formed in the pms fe ii nh2oh system but oh was the major species for dmp degradation addition of cl significantly improved the production of oh and cl and the exposure dose of oh ct oh was more than 10 times that of ctcl as the concentration of cl increased to 1 mm calculations based on branching ratios of cl and oh indicated that the reactions of cl with so4 and cl with h2o were not the only production sources of oh in the system further experiments with methyl phenyl sulfoxide pmso as the probe indicated that cl would facilitate the shift of reactive species from fe iv to radicals so4 or oh in the system both hydroxylation and nitration intermediate products were detected in the oxidation of dmp cl promoted the formation of hydroxylation intermediates and reduced the formation of nitration intermediates this study revealed for the first time that cl could shift reactive species from fe iv to radicals in pms fe ii system raising attention to the influence of the coexisting anions especially cl for pollutants oxidation in iron related oxidation processes graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords hydroxylamine peroxymonosulfate chloride ion reactive species 1 introduction oxidative species such as oh and so4 formed in advanced oxidation processes aops are effective for the degradation of recalcitrant organic pollutants in water and wastewater treatment oh et al 2016 pignatello et al 2006 in recent years so4 based aops have drawn increasing attention for the high reactivity towards persistent organic compounds e g perfluorooctanoic acid and longer half life than oh rastogi et al 2009 activation methods such as heat uv radiation alkaline treatment ozonation and transition metal catalysis have been developed for the activation of peroxymonosulfate pms to produce so4 anipsitakis and dionysiou 2004b kim et al 2016 wang and wang 2018 yang et al 2015 due to the low cost high catalytic activity and environmentally friendly properties fe ii species are considered as suitable electron donors to stimulate the formation of so4 in activation of pms however insoluble fe iii oxides would form in the reaction and the reactivity of fe iii on activating pms is low anipsitakis and dionysiou 2004a accumulation of fe iii results in the decrease of available catalyst and the increase of iron sludge chen et al 2011 pignatello et al 2006 this dilemma commonly exists in aops with fe ii as homogenous activator such as fenton reactions and catalytic ozonation thus exploring methods to enhance the transformation of fe iii to fe ii in ambient conditions has critical implications for improving the efficiency of iron related aops previous studies have shown that hydroxylamine nh2oh a common reductant had intense effects on the reduction of fe iii to fe ii and could significantly improve the oxidation efficiency of pms fe ii and h2o2 fe ii systems chen et al 2011 zou et al 2013 in follow up research nh2oh was further shown to promote the degradation of organic pollutants in other transition metals catalyzed aops i e cu i h2o2 α feooh h2o2 and fe ii nta s2o8 2 hou et al 2017 jin et al 2018 lee et al 2016 despite these significant enhancement effects of nh2oh on iron species activated aops an overlooked phenomenon was that hydroxylamine salts especially nh2oh hcl were actually used in the majority of studies chen et al 2011 feng et al 2017 han et al 2014 jin et al 2018 li et al 2019a li et al 2019b liu et al 2017 xiang et al 2019 yan et al 2018 yang et al 2016 yang et al 2017 zhang et al 2019 zou et al 2013 considering that nh2oh is unstable and easily decomposes in the case of collision shaking and heating which might cause damage during transportation iwata and koseki 2003 liu et al 2009 hydroxylamine salts such as nh2oh hcl nh2oh 2 h2so4 and nh2oh 3 h3po4 are commercially available and suitable for industrial production as well as scientific investigations however the topic of whether the types of hydroxylamine salts affected the acceleration effects on pms fe ii system was rarely discussed anions such as cl and so4 2 would be simultaneously introduced into the system with the addition of hydroxylamine salts but their effects on the degradation of pollutants were often ignored as nh2oh hcl was largely used to accelerate the iron activated aops in previous research cl was introduced to reaction system simultaneously the influence of cl on pollutants degradation was reported in many researches of aops without hydroxylamine cl was found to scavenge so4 and oh resulting in the inhibition of pollutants degradation huang et al 2018 luo et al 2016 zhang et al 2018 besides chlorine species e g hclo cl2 cl and cl2 would form during the reactions of cl with so4 or oh fang et al 2014 yang et al 2014 some chlorine species e g cl and cl2 have high selectivity towards certain organic pollutants causing a variation of degradation efficiency and oxidation intermediates compared with oh and so4 yang et al 2018 zhang et al 2018 moreover in fenton or fenton like systems with persulfates fe iv has been found as the reactive species besides so4 and oh with sulfoxides as the probe lee et al 2018 cl could coordinate with transition metal ions but whether this process influences the activation process and the produced reactive species is rarely discussed in nh2oh accelerated fenton like systems transition metal species would also react with hydroxylamine besides oxidants our previous research indicated that the formation of fe iii nh2oh intermediates was the crucial step for fe ii restoration and pollutants degradation in persulfate fe ii system li et al 2020 however the influence of complexation between transition metal ions and cl from nh2oh hcl was never discussed thus it is important to explore the effects of hydroxylamine salts types and coexisting anions especially cl on pollutants degradation in pms fe ii nh2oh system to reveal the real acceleration effect of hydroxylamine based on the type of hydroxylamine salts used herein two commonly used hydroxylamine salts nh2oh hcl and nh2oh 2 h2so4 were comparatively investigated for their effect on accelerating organic pollutant abatement in pms fe ii system dimethyl phthalate dmp a widespread refractory phthalic pollutant was used as the model compound the effect of cl introduced by nh2oh hcl on the degradation of dmp was examined together with the production of oxidation intermediates finally the possible mechanism of cl on influencing the major reactive species production in pms fe ii nh2oh system was revealed 2 material and methods 2 1 material chemicals were at least of analytical grade and used as received without further purification detailed information on chemicals is listed in text s1 2 2 experimental procedures batch scale experiments were conducted at the volume of 50 ml in 100 ml erlenmeyer flasks with ultra pure water a magnetic stirrer with 15 points for stirring 385 270 mm was used for experiments and the stirring rate was set at 600 r min the temperature was kept at 25 0 5 c reactions were initiated by adding 0 96 mm of pms into the solution containing a desired concentration of target compounds dmp pmso or nitrobenzene fe ii 10 µm nh2oh hcl 0 8 mm or nh2oh 2 h2so4 0 4 mm and nacl up to 10 mm for alcohol scavenging experiments tertbutyl alcohol tba or methanol meoh were also added before starting the experiment solutions were not buffered and initial values of ph were adjusted to 3 0 by hclo4 just before starting the reaction during the whole reaction processes for 30 min the values of ph dropped by less than 0 5 units figure s1 samples were withdrawn at predetermined time intervals and quenched by a measured excess of methanol before hplc or lc ms ms analysis electron spin resonance esr experiments were conducted with the addition of 5 5 dimethyl 1 pyrolin n oxide dmpo in reaction system and samples were withdrawn with a capillary tube after reacting for 1 5 min and detected by esr spectrometer bruker a200 all experiments were conducted in duplicate or triplicate average values along with one standard deviation are reported in this work 2 3 analytical methods the concentrations of dmp pmso and methyl phenyl sulfone pmso2 were measured by high performance liquid chromatography hplc waters 2695 with a reversed phase c18 column 4 6 mm 150 mm 5 µm waters and a photo diode array detector pda waters 2998 dmp was detected at 227 nm with methanol and water 1 acetic acid mixed at a ratio of 45 55 v v while pmso and produced pmso2 were detected with acetonitrile and water 1 acetic acid mixed at a ratio of 80 20 v v at the wavelengths of 230 nm and 215 nm respectively the concentration of nh2oh was measured by ultra performance liquid chromatography uplc waters at 220 nm after reacting with acetone to produce acetone oxime the mobile phase consisted of methanol and water 0 2 formic acid at a ratio of 30 70 v v with a flow rate of 0 2 ml min 1 oxidation intermediates of dmp with or without cl were analyzed by hplc esi ms ms agilent 1260 hplc coupled with an ab sciex qtrap 5500 ms at full scan enhanced product ion epi and multi reaction monitor mrm modes dmp was detected in positive ion mode while oxidation intermediates were detected in both positive and negative ion modes the hplc was equipped with a waters xbridge c18 column 3 0 100 mm 2 5 μm particle size and a gradient mobile phase program was used for separation detailed separation conditions for hplc and operating parameters for ms are provided in text s2 the concentration of ferric iron with the presence of hydroxylamine was measured at 300 nm with a uv vis spectrometer hatch zou et al 2013 concentrations of no2 and no3 were detected by an ion chromatograph dionex 3000 the value of total nitrogen tn was measured by a multi n c 3100 analyzer with a total nitrogen detector jena tnm 1 germany 2 4 ecosar prediction and dft calculation the acute and chronic toxicity of dmp and its oxidation intermediates were assessed with ecosar ecological structure activity relationship v 2 0 based on qsar 96 h lc50 for fish 48 h lc50 for daphnid and 96h ec50 for green algae were used for acute toxicity assessment and the chronic value i e the geometric mean of the no observed effect concentration and the lowest observed effect concentration of fish daphnid and green algae were used for chronic toxicity assessment in ecosar program the density functional theory dft method was carried out with gaussian 09 software package frisch et al 2013 3 results and discussion 3 1 oxidation of dmp in pms fe ii system with nh2oh 2 h2so4 and nh2oh hcl oxidation of dmp by pms fe ii with nh2oh 2 h2so4 and nh2oh hcl was initially examined with the addition of 0 4 mm nh2oh 2 h2so4 the degradation efficiency of dmp was improved from 10 to 30 within 15 min fig 1 a however only 50 of dmp could be oxidized when extending the reaction time to 30 min further increasing the dosage of nh2oh 2 h2so4 pms and fe ii could only improve the degradation efficiency of dmp to 60 in 30 min figure s2 in comparison with the addition of nh2oh hcl into pms fe ii system the oxidation efficiency of dmp surprisingly increased to 87 within 30 min 33 higher than that provided by nh2oh 2 h2so4 at equal nh2oh fig 1b when same amount of cl as contained in nh2oh hcl was added into the pms fe ii nh2oh 2 h2so4 system the oxidation efficiency of dmp increased to 88 and the oxidation profile of dmp coincided with that observed in the pms fe ii nh2oh hcl system these results reveal that the higher degradation efficiency of dmp in the pms fe ii nh2oh hcl system could be attributed to the occurrence of cl thus the type of hydroxylamine salts may significantly influence the pollutants degradation effect in pms fe ii system in previous research the effect of cl was always ignored when nh2oh hcl was used in the relevant aops this may lead to an overestimation of the actual enhancement effect of nh2oh on the degradation of organic pollutants to investigate the detailed acceleration effects of cl for dmp oxidation in the pms fe ii nh2oh system nh2oh 2 h2so4 was used in subsequent experiments if not specifically mentioned as the initial concentration of cl increased from 0 to 100 µm the oxidation efficiency of dmp improved from 53 3 to 90 8 within 30 min and then dropped slightly to 87 3 with cl increasing to 1 mm fig 1c however when the concentration of cl further increased to 10 mm the degradation efficiency of dmp dropped to 23 8 within 30 min even lower than that without cl fig 1c these results were different from the overall inhibition effects for the oxidation of maleic acid in pms fe ii system with cl from 0 to 300 mm huang et al 2018 in pms co ii system adverse effects on the oxidation of azo dyes were also found with cl 0 10 mm wang et al 2011 explanations of these two studies were the formation of chlorine species e g cl cl2 hclo and cl2 through reactions of so4 and oh with cl compared with so4 and oh cl2 was more selective in electron transfer reactions with organic compounds yang et al 2018 though cl showed high reactivity with plenty of organic pollutants it was usually formed at low ph conditions lutze et al 2015 thus the effect of cl could vary based on the types of target compounds as well as experimental conditions whether chlorine species formed and participated in the degradation of dmp in pms fe ii nh2oh 2 h2so4 cl system was further investigated 3 2 identifying the major reactive species for dmp degradation 3 2 1 contribution of oh to explore whether chlorine species especially cl and cl2 are involved in dmp degradation process radical scavenging experiments were conducted methanol meoh reacts fast with so4 oh and cl with second order reaction rate constants of 2 5 107 m 1 s 1 neta et al 1988 9 7 108 m 1 s 1 buxton et al 1988 and 5 7 109 m 1 s 1 chateauneuf 1990 respectively in comparison tertbutyl alcohol tba is more reactive with oh 6 108 m 1 s 1 buxton et al 1988 and cl 3 108 m 1 s 1 mertens and von sonntag 1995 than with so4 8 105 m 1 s 1 neta et al 1988 with second order reaction rate constants of dmp with so4 4 9 108 m 1 s 1 lei et al 2020 oh 3 7 109 m 1 s 1 lei et al 2020 and cl 1 8 1010 m 1 s 1 lei et al 2020 the values of ck i e products of concentrations and second order reaction rate constants which represent the reactive capacity of target compounds towards certain reactive species zou et al 2014 were calculated for dmp and scavengers towards so4 oh and cl with 10 µm of dmp and 1 mm of each scavengers ck meoh so4 was 5 times higher than ck dmp so4 while ck tba so4 was 16 of ck dmp so4 for cl ck meoh cl and ck tba cl was 32 and 2 times of ck dmp cl respectively and both ck meoh oh and ck tba oh were more than 10 times of ck dmp oh thus so4 could only be effectively scavenged by meoh while oh could be completely consumed by both scavengers under our experimental conditions about 63 and nearly 100 of cl could be scavenged by tba and meoh respectively detailed values of ck in table s1 table 1 with the addition of meoh and tba oxidation of dmp was inhibited by both scavengers regardless of the presence of cl fig 2 a and 2b based on the calculated ck reaction with so4 could be excluded from dmp degradation process with the addition of tba besides the reaction with cl might be little important because cl could only be partly captured by tba while more than 90 of the degradation of dmp was inhibited in the presence of tba thus the major reactive species for the degradation of dmp should be oh both with and without the presence of cl to further identify the presence of oh nitrobenzene was used as oh probe because it has higher reaction rate constant 3 9 109 m 1 s 1 buxton et al 1988 with oh than with so4 less than 106 m 1 s 1 neta et al 1988 and negligibly reacts with cl frøsig et al 2000 similar with the oxidation of dmp degradation efficiency of nitrobenzene improved by 1 2 times with the addition of nh2oh 2 hcl compared to nh2oh 2 h2so4 and the degradation efficiency improved with the addition of cl in nh2oh 2 h2so4 system fig 2c this result supported the presence of oh in pms fe ii nh2oh 2 h2so4 system and the addition of cl could promote the production of oh to improve the oxidation of nitrobenzene and dmp 3 2 2 changes of oh and cl concentrations by varying amount of cl though oh was the dominant reactive specie for the oxidation of dmp in the pms fe ii nh2oh system the role of cl was not clearly elucidated since both meoh and tba only partly captured cl to further determine the contributions of oh and cl for dmp degradation nitrobenzene was simultaneously added into the system with dmp as the probe of oh the concentration of nitrobenzene was chosen to slightly influence the degradation efficiency of dmp less than 10 in figure s3 degradation of nitrobenzene and dmp could be expressed as follows 1 d dmp dt k d m p o h dmp oh k d m p c l dmp cl 2 d nitrobenzene dt k nitrobenzene o h nitrobenzene oh where k d m p o h k d m p c l and k nitrobenzene o h are the second order reaction rate constants of dmp and nitrobenzene with oh or cl respectively the addition of nh2oh would improve the restoration of fe ii through reactions between fe iii and nh2oh zou et al 2013 our previous research indicated that the restoration process would slow down and the concentration of fe ii would gradually decrease with nh2oh consumption which resulted in the oxidation kinetics of benzoic acid deviating from a pseudo first order kinetics in s2o8 2 fe ii nh2oh system li et al 2020 similarly the oxidation profile of dmp deviated from a pseudo first order reaction in this study figure s4 thus the exposure dose ct was used to analyze the changes of oh and cl during dmp degradation process as follows 3 c t oh oh dt ln nitrobenzene nitrobenzene 0 k n b o h 4 c t cl cl dt 1 k d m p c l k d m p o h k nitrobenzene o h ln nitrobenzene nitrobenzene 0 ln dmp dmp 0 the values of c t oh and c t cl during dmp degradation were calculated with varying cl concentrations both c t oh and c t cl increased when the concentration of cl increased to 100 μm and dropped when the concentration of cl further increased to 1 mm fig 3 a and 3b with 1 mm cl addition c t cl increased fast in the initial 3 min but for the whole reaction time of 30 min the overall value of c t cl decreased by more than 50 compared with the case of 100 μm cl addition this was probably due to the production of cl2 through the reaction between cl and cl compared with oh cl2 is less reactive dmp 1 4 107 m 1 s 1 lei et al 2020 besides cl could capture oh as well resulting in the decrease of c t oh for 30 min with 1 mm cl moreover the values of c t oh were more than 10 times of c t cl under all concentrations of cl added considering the reaction rate constant between dmp and cl 1 8 1010 m 1 s 1 was less than 5 times higher than that with oh 3 7 109 m 1 s 1 lei et al 2020 more than 50 of the degradation of dmp was accounted for oh and the contribution of oh increased with increasing of cl concentrations figure s5 3 3 possible acceleration mechanisms of cl the above results suggest that oh mainly contributed to the degradation of dmp in pms fe ii nh2oh system while both so4 and oh were found to participate in the organic pollutants degradation process in previous studies zou et al 2013 considering the reaction rate constant of dmp with oh 3 7 109 m 1 s 1 is nearly 10 times higher than that with so4 4 9 108 m 1 s 1 lei et al 2020 dmp would be largely consumed by oh unless the concentration of so4 was 10 times higher in acidic conditions without cl so4 would be formed by the single electron transfer reaction between pms and fe ii and oh was the secondary radical produced from reactions of so4 with h2o wacławek et al 2017 which would not predominate 60 m 1 s 1 neta et al 1988 over other consumption pathways of so4 by reactants such us nh2oh 1 5 107 m 1 s 1 neta et al 1988 thus no significant promotion was achieved for dmp oxidation with changes of reagent dosages without cl as aforementioned figure s2 with the addition of cl production of oh was promoted and the degradation of dmp was accelerated since cl may react with radicals and complex with iron species in pms fe ii nh2oh system at ph 3 the mechanism of cl for the promotion of oh production was explored 3 3 1 interaction between cl and radicals with the presence of cl oh could be produced from a series of reactions between so4 and chlorine species cl would initially react with so4 to form cl and cl would further react with h2o to form cloh which could transform into oh as eq 5 8 shown below though cl2 could transform back to cl or cloh through reverse reactions of eq 9 and 10 the degradation of dmp was inhibited with the production of cl2 as concentrations of cl increased to above 1 mm as shown in fig 1c thus reverse reactions of eq 9 and 10 were ignored in the following calculation process for a sake of simplicity at the same time the reverse reaction of eq 6 would transform cloh back to cl the consumption of radicals by other reactants i e dmp h2o iron species nh2oh and pms also influenced the steady concentrations of so4 and cl and impacted the production of oh to clearly analyze the production of oh by reactions between radicals and cl the branching ratio of cl br cl was used to evaluate the fate of cl transformed to cloh and oh br cl was defined as the rate of cl reacting with h2o or oh divided by the rate of cl reacting with all components in the water matrix as eq 11 11 b r cl k 6 cl k 7 o h cl k 6 clo h h cl cl k i s i k 6 cl k 7 o h cl k 6 clo h h where cl k i s i k 9 c l k f e i i cl fe ii k p m s cl pms k n h 2 o h cl n h 2 oh k d m p cl dmp the value of br cl was less than 1 and the larger values mean that more cl was consumed to produce cloh based on the steady state assumption for cloh oh and cl one gets 12 r cloh k 6 cl k 7 cl o h k 8 oh c l k 6 clo h h k 8 clo h k 10 clo h c l 0 13 r oh k h 2 o so 4 so 4 k 8 clo h k 8 oh c l oh oh k i s i 0 14 r cl k 5 c l so 4 k 6 clo h h k 6 cl k 7 cl o h cl cl k i s i 0 where oh k i s i k f e i i oh fe ii k p m s oh pms k n h 2 o h oh n h 2 oh k d m p oh dmp thus the concentration of oh was obtained as eq 15 by substituting eq 12 14 to eq 11 detailed calculation in text s3 15 oh k 8 k 6 h k 5 c l b r cl k h 2 o so 4 cl k i s i k 6 k 10 k 5 c l 2 1 b r cl cl 1 b r cl k 5 k 8 k 6 h c l oh k i s i k 10 k 8 c l 2 at ph 3 the value of k 6 h was around 2 1 107 m 1 s 1 less than 1 of k 8 indicating the produced cloh would fast go through eq 8 to produce oh instead of shifting back through the reverse reaction of eq 6 besides the value of k 10 was far lower than k 8 as well thus eq 10 would not be the major consumption route of cloh compared to eq 8 with cl less than 1 mm to obtain the largest production ratio of oh from cloh an extreme condition was considered that all produced cloh went through eq 8 to form oh eq 10 as well as the reverse reaction eq 6 were ignored thus the concentration of oh eq 15 and the value of b r cl eq 11 could be simplified as follows 16 oh k 5 c l b r cl k h 2 o so 4 cl cl k i s i 1 b r cl k 5 c l oh k i s i 17 b r cl k 6 cl k i s i k 6 substituting eq 17 into eq 16 the concentration relationship of oh and cl was obtained as eq 18 18 oh k 5 c l k 6 k h 2 o so 4 cl k i s i k 6 cl k 5 c l oh k i s i the second order reaction rate constants of oh and cl with other reactants i e pms fe ii nh2oh and dmp were obtained from literature listed in table s2 based on fig 3 oh and cl accumulated fast at the initial stage of the reaction process and the value of cl k i s i and oh k i s i could be obtained with initial concentrations of all components and the corresponding reaction rate constants thus with the concentration of cl changing from 10 μm to 1 mm the variation of concentration ratios of oh to cl from eq 18 decreased from 1 75 to 0 6 when using the value of k h 2 o so 4 as 660 s 1 herrmann et al 1995 however the concentrations of oh and cl could also be calculated from the values of ct in the initial 3 min of experimental results shown in fig 3 the degradation of dmp 35 when the concentration of cl was 10 μm 100 μm and 1 mm the concentration of oh in the initial 3 min was 4 02 10 13 m 5 60 10 13 m and 4 48 10 13 m while the concentration of cl was 4 63 10 15 m 7 57 10 15 m and 1 05 10 14 m respectively thus concentration ratios of oh to cl based on experiments decreased from 87 0 to 42 6 with cl changing from 10 μm to 1 mm which were significantly larger than those obtained from calculations based on eq 18 concentration ratios of oh to cl could also be roughly estimated with the branching ratio of cloh br cloh and the largest value was 2 9 under the condition of 10 μm cl detailed calculation in text s4 still less than the experimental results in fact with the ph slightly decreasing from the initial value of 3 the reverse reaction of eq 6 might be strengthened during the reaction process and could not be ignored in calculation indicating the concentration ratio calculated based on eq 18 would actually be smaller thus the interaction of so4 with cl and h2o was not the only production pathway of oh 3 3 2 interaction between cl and iron species besides the interaction with radicals interactions between cl and iron species for oh production were investigated as well in pms fe ii nh2oh system the cycle of iron species mainly involves two reactions the activation of pms by fe ii to produce fe iii and so4 and the reduction of fe iii by nh2oh for fe ii restoration these two reactions are the rate limiting steps for the production of radicals and fe ii directly influencing the degradation rate of dmp with the addition of cl the speciation of both fe ii and fe iii changed in the system by coordination via eq 19 21 de laat and le 2006 whether these complex reactions changed the reactivity of iron species towards pms and nh2oh was studied 19 f e 2 c l fec l 2 88 m 1 20 f e 3 c l fec l 2 6 61 m 1 21 f e 3 2 c l fec l 2 10 5 m 2 the effect of cl on the fe iii reduction process was studied first with the concentration of cl increasing from 0 to 10 mm fecl2 increased up to 3 6 of the total fe iii but the major specie of fe iii was always feoh2 figure s6 the reduction rate between fe iii and nh2oh without pms remained the same regardless of cl concentrations figure s7 indicating fecl2 slightly impacted the reaction rate of nh2oh with fe iii in pms fe ii nh2oh system the major specie of fe iii was also feoh2 and only less than 2 of fe iii existed as fecl2 with concentrations of cl up to 10 mm figure s8 thus fecl2 had negligible influence on the reduction of fe iii by nh2oh in pms fe ii nh2oh system indicating the addition of cl impacted little on the regeneration of fe ii during the activation process of persulfate with fe ii recent research found fe iv was also produced and usually showed lower reactivity to organic compounds than so4 wang et al 2019b the presence of organic chelators could promote the transformation of major reactive species from fe iv to so4 in fe ii pds system wang et al 2019a as aforementioned cl could coordinate with fe ii to form fecl whether this complexation process influenced the production of reactive species and the degradation of dmp was then investigated esr experiments were conducted to identify the primary reactive species in pms fe ii nh2oh system both with and without cl dmpo was used as the spin trapping agent two kinds of adducts signals were found regardless of cl fig 4 a and 4b the weak signals were likely to represent dmpo so4 adducts αn 13 8 g αh 10 2 g αh 1 44 g αh 0 8 g all 0 5 g zou et al 2013 indicating the presence of so4 in pms fe ii nh2oh system the strong signals were compatible with dmpo oh adducts αn αh 14 9 g liang et al 2020 besides oh fe iv could also produce dmpo oh signal by metal catalyzed nucleophilic addition of water or direct oxidation of dmpo by fe iv liang et al 2020 wang et al 2018 thus tba and dimethyl sulfoxide dmso were used to distinguish fe iv and oh because the reaction rate constant of fe iv with dmso 1 4 105 m 1 s 1 is significantly higher than that with tba 6 0 101 m 1 s 1 in acidic medium hajem bataineh et al 2012 pestovsky et al 2006 without cl addition the dmpo oh signals slightly changed with tba but were significantly inhibited by dmso indicating the signals were mainly formed by reactions of dmpo with fe iv with the presence of cl the intensity of dmpo oh signals decreased by 30 with tba and 70 with dmso indicating the coexistence of fe iv and oh in the system thus the addition of cl enhanced the production of oh to further explore the production of fe iv and oh with changing of cl concentrations sulfoxides are chosen as the probe because the two electron transformation products sulfones form when sulfoxides are oxidized by fe iv while hydroxylated or dimeric products form when reacting with oh or so4 pestovsky and bakac 2006 wang et al 2019b in previous research sulfoxides were largely used to identify the presence of fe iv in fe ii o3 pestovsky and bakac 2006 fe ii h2o2 pang et al 2011 fe ii hclo liang et al 2020 and fe vi caso3 shao et al 2019 systems and were also used to identify the presence of other high valent metal oxo species such as mn v gao et al 2019 and cr v dong et al 2020b in our experiments phenyl methyl sulfoxide pmso which has been used for fe iv identification in fe ii pds wang et al 2018 wang et al 2019a and fe ii pms wang et al 2019b systems was chosen as the target compound the degradation of pmso and the production of the two electron transformation product pmso2 were monitored in pms fe ii nh2oh system with different cl concentrations to exclude the influence of o2 on the production of pmso2 n2 was purged to remove dissolved o2 prior to the reaction the degradation of pmso and the production of pmso2 slightly changed with and without deoxygenation indicating that pmso2 was mainly produced through oxidation by fe iv rather than o2 in our system figure s9 the yield of pmso2 i e the pmso2 produced divided by the pmso consumed was 60 in pms fe ii nh2oh system without cl fig 5 c indicating that both fe iv and radicals were produced during pmso degradation process this was in accordance with esr results when cl was added the production of pmso2 decreased with increasing of cl concentrations fig 5b indicating the production of fe iv was inhibited with the addition of cl however the degradation of pmso was promoted fig 5a and the yield of pmso2 decreased fig 5c with concentrations of cl increasing which represented the production of radicals and their contribution to pmso degradation were promoted combined with esr results it could be deduced that so4 fe iv and oh were all produced in pms fe ii nh2oh system and the addition of cl promoted the production of oh but inhibited the formation of fe iv as aforementioned dmp has higher reaction rate constant with oh than so4 and fe iv thus the addition of cl significantly promoted the degradation of dmp the interaction of fe ii and pms with or without cl was also investigated through density functional theory dft calculations based on previous study at least one coordination site should be available for fe ii catalysis in fenton or fenton like reactions graf et al 1984 the degradation of dmp was not influenced by changes of ionic strength figure s10 thus an inner sphere coordinated transitional intermediate fe hso5 was supposed to form at first during the activation of pms by fe ii which was similar with the iron species fe h2o2 2 or fe s2o8 2 previously proposed in fe ii h2o2 or fe ii pds systems dong et al 2020a lu et al 2018 petit et al 2014 wiegand et al 2017 the optimized structure of mono coordinated intermediates between fe2 and hso5 could not be found based on dft calculation because the mono coordination was not stable and fe2 was likely to coordinate with two oxygen atoms of hso5 without the addition of cl detailed discussion in figure s11 under this condition fe iv was more likely to form in the following peroxy bond breaking process of the intermediates and radicals were less likely to be released because of the double coordination compared with so4 2 cl has smaller ionic radius and is more likely to coordinate with fe2 with smaller steric hindrance thus intermediate iron species containing coordinated cl clfe hso5 might form during pms activation process with the addition of cl the dft calculation indicated that the optimized structure of the mono coordinated intermediates between fe2 and pms could be found with the presence of cl in which fe2 could coordinate with either of the two oxygen atoms of the peroxy bond figure s12 and the two optimized geometries had similar energy of 2803 hartree thus radicals so4 or oh rather than fe iv were possibly released in the following heterolysis of the peroxy bond the dft calculation provided a reference to deduce the possible decomposition pathway of fe2 pms intermediates however detailed reaction schemes of the decomposition process of iron intermediates required further investigation based on above analysis the addition of cl inhibited the production of fe iv and promoted the production of radicals so4 and oh by altering the formation of iron intermediates during the fe ii activated pms process the produced so4 could further transform into oh as aforementioned eventually resulting in the increase of oh concentrations fig 6 for pollutants with less reactivity towards so4 than oh like dmp increasing concentrations of oh significantly accelerated their degradation efficiency and improved the use ratio of so4 at the same time 3 4 effects of cl on changes and toxicity of degradation intermediates six postulated degradation intermediates of dmp including isomers were found in pms fe ii nh2oh system both with and without cl table s3 figure s13 s15 the hydroxylation and nitration of the aromatic ring were found as two possible parallel reaction pathways for dmp degradation the hydroxylation pathway i in fig 7 a and the three hydroxylated intermediates of dmp p 210 p 226 and p 242 have been reported previously in oh based aops with oxidants like h2o2 and o3 an et al 2014 xu et al 2019 xu et al 2015 with the presence of cl formation of the three hydroxylation intermediates was significantly promoted and the largest mass peak areas were 6 7 times higher than those observed without cl addition fig 7b to 7d moreover p 210 approached its maximum concentration in the initial 3 min and then decreased as the reaction progressed fig 7b while p 226 and p 242 kept accumulating through the overall reaction 30 min in the presence of cl fig 7c and 7d another possible parallel mechanism for dmp degradation was the nitration of the aromatic ring ii in fig 7a three possible nitration intermediates p 239 p 271 and p 255 were found p 239 was once reported in uv no2 system through reactions of dmp and no2 xu et al 2019 with the presence of cl the signals of all three nitration intermediates decreased in contrast to the trend of hydroxylated products fig 7e to 7g this indicated that the presence of cl attenuated the nitration of dmp and promoted the hydroxylation of the aromatic ring at the same time the red pathway in fig 7a the acute and chronic toxicity of dmp and the six possible degradation intermediates were assessed by ecosar v 2 0 based on qsar under the class of esters table s4 among the six degradation intermediates only p 255 showed higher toxicity than dmp and one of its isomers showed strong chronic toxicity to fish with the addition of cl formation of p 255 decreased and mainly accumulated in the initial 20 min fig 7f while hydroxylated products p 226 and p 242 with less toxicity than dmp significantly increased as aforementioned the absolute decomposition efficiency of nh2oh decreased by 10 with the addition cl figure s16 indicating that cl promoted the degradation of dmp and reduced the consumption of nh2oh simultaneously the major transformation product of nh2oh was considered as n2 figure s16 and text s5 thus the addition of cl could decrease the required dosage of nh2oh and attenuated the production of higher toxic intermediates in pms fe ii nh2oh system 4 conclusions in this article nh2oh hcl was found to have significantly higher accelerating effects on dmp degradation than the same dosages of nh2oh 2 h2so4 in pms fe ii system the reason was a collaborating enhancement by cl and nh2oh cl would change the chemistry of fe ii pms intermediates formed during pms activation process resulting in the shift of major reactive species from fe iv to free radicals so4 or oh besides cl also reacted with so4 and h2o ultimately increasing the production of oh though the interaction of cl with iron species and radicals also promoted the degradation of dmp in fe ii pms system figure s17 the promotion effect was amplified in pms fe ii nh2oh system because fe ii kept restoring with the addition of nh2oh thus in research of fenton like systems with other reactants to promote fe iii fe ii circle the effect of cl should also be paid attention in future studies declaration of competing interest the

17097,though hydroxylamine nh2oh is effective for accelerating pollutants degradation in fenton and fenton like systems the effect of anions simultaneously introduced by the hydroxylamine salts have always been ignored herein effect of two commonly used hydroxylamine salts hydroxylamine hydrochloride nh2oh hcl and hydroxylamine sulfate nh2oh 2 h2so4 for the degradation of dimethyl phthalate dmp in peroxymonosulfate pms fe ii system was comparatively investigated degradation efficiency of dmp with nh2oh hcl was 1 6 times of that with same dosages of nh2oh 2 h2so4 so4 fe iv and oh formed in the pms fe ii nh2oh system but oh was the major species for dmp degradation addition of cl significantly improved the production of oh and cl and the exposure dose of oh ct oh was more than 10 times that of ctcl as the concentration of cl increased to 1 mm calculations based on branching ratios of cl and oh indicated that the reactions of cl with so4 and cl with h2o were not the only production sources of oh in the system further experiments with methyl phenyl sulfoxide pmso as the probe indicated that cl would facilitate the shift of reactive species from fe iv to radicals so4 or oh in the system both hydroxylation and nitration intermediate products were detected in the oxidation of dmp cl promoted the formation of hydroxylation intermediates and reduced the formation of nitration intermediates this study revealed for the first time that cl could shift reactive species from fe iv to radicals in pms fe ii system raising attention to the influence of the coexisting anions especially cl for pollutants oxidation in iron related oxidation processes graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords hydroxylamine peroxymonosulfate chloride ion reactive species 1 introduction oxidative species such as oh and so4 formed in advanced oxidation processes aops are effective for the degradation of recalcitrant organic pollutants in water and wastewater treatment oh et al 2016 pignatello et al 2006 in recent years so4 based aops have drawn increasing attention for the high reactivity towards persistent organic compounds e g perfluorooctanoic acid and longer half life than oh rastogi et al 2009 activation methods such as heat uv radiation alkaline treatment ozonation and transition metal catalysis have been developed for the activation of peroxymonosulfate pms to produce so4 anipsitakis and dionysiou 2004b kim et al 2016 wang and wang 2018 yang et al 2015 due to the low cost high catalytic activity and environmentally friendly properties fe ii species are considered as suitable electron donors to stimulate the formation of so4 in activation of pms however insoluble fe iii oxides would form in the reaction and the reactivity of fe iii on activating pms is low anipsitakis and dionysiou 2004a accumulation of fe iii results in the decrease of available catalyst and the increase of iron sludge chen et al 2011 pignatello et al 2006 this dilemma commonly exists in aops with fe ii as homogenous activator such as fenton reactions and catalytic ozonation thus exploring methods to enhance the transformation of fe iii to fe ii in ambient conditions has critical implications for improving the efficiency of iron related aops previous studies have shown that hydroxylamine nh2oh a common reductant had intense effects on the reduction of fe iii to fe ii and could significantly improve the oxidation efficiency of pms fe ii and h2o2 fe ii systems chen et al 2011 zou et al 2013 in follow up research nh2oh was further shown to promote the degradation of organic pollutants in other transition metals catalyzed aops i e cu i h2o2 α feooh h2o2 and fe ii nta s2o8 2 hou et al 2017 jin et al 2018 lee et al 2016 despite these significant enhancement effects of nh2oh on iron species activated aops an overlooked phenomenon was that hydroxylamine salts especially nh2oh hcl were actually used in the majority of studies chen et al 2011 feng et al 2017 han et al 2014 jin et al 2018 li et al 2019a li et al 2019b liu et al 2017 xiang et al 2019 yan et al 2018 yang et al 2016 yang et al 2017 zhang et al 2019 zou et al 2013 considering that nh2oh is unstable and easily decomposes in the case of collision shaking and heating which might cause damage during transportation iwata and koseki 2003 liu et al 2009 hydroxylamine salts such as nh2oh hcl nh2oh 2 h2so4 and nh2oh 3 h3po4 are commercially available and suitable for industrial production as well as scientific investigations however the topic of whether the types of hydroxylamine salts affected the acceleration effects on pms fe ii system was rarely discussed anions such as cl and so4 2 would be simultaneously introduced into the system with the addition of hydroxylamine salts but their effects on the degradation of pollutants were often ignored as nh2oh hcl was largely used to accelerate the iron activated aops in previous research cl was introduced to reaction system simultaneously the influence of cl on pollutants degradation was reported in many researches of aops without hydroxylamine cl was found to scavenge so4 and oh resulting in the inhibition of pollutants degradation huang et al 2018 luo et al 2016 zhang et al 2018 besides chlorine species e g hclo cl2 cl and cl2 would form during the reactions of cl with so4 or oh fang et al 2014 yang et al 2014 some chlorine species e g cl and cl2 have high selectivity towards certain organic pollutants causing a variation of degradation efficiency and oxidation intermediates compared with oh and so4 yang et al 2018 zhang et al 2018 moreover in fenton or fenton like systems with persulfates fe iv has been found as the reactive species besides so4 and oh with sulfoxides as the probe lee et al 2018 cl could coordinate with transition metal ions but whether this process influences the activation process and the produced reactive species is rarely discussed in nh2oh accelerated fenton like systems transition metal species would also react with hydroxylamine besides oxidants our previous research indicated that the formation of fe iii nh2oh intermediates was the crucial step for fe ii restoration and pollutants degradation in persulfate fe ii system li et al 2020 however the influence of complexation between transition metal ions and cl from nh2oh hcl was never discussed thus it is important to explore the effects of hydroxylamine salts types and coexisting anions especially cl on pollutants degradation in pms fe ii nh2oh system to reveal the real acceleration effect of hydroxylamine based on the type of hydroxylamine salts used herein two commonly used hydroxylamine salts nh2oh hcl and nh2oh 2 h2so4 were comparatively investigated for their effect on accelerating organic pollutant abatement in pms fe ii system dimethyl phthalate dmp a widespread refractory phthalic pollutant was used as the model compound the effect of cl introduced by nh2oh hcl on the degradation of dmp was examined together with the production of oxidation intermediates finally the possible mechanism of cl on influencing the major reactive species production in pms fe ii nh2oh system was revealed 2 material and methods 2 1 material chemicals were at least of analytical grade and used as received without further purification detailed information on chemicals is listed in text s1 2 2 experimental procedures batch scale experiments were conducted at the volume of 50 ml in 100 ml erlenmeyer flasks with ultra pure water a magnetic stirrer with 15 points for stirring 385 270 mm was used for experiments and the stirring rate was set at 600 r min the temperature was kept at 25 0 5 c reactions were initiated by adding 0 96 mm of pms into the solution containing a desired concentration of target compounds dmp pmso or nitrobenzene fe ii 10 µm nh2oh hcl 0 8 mm or nh2oh 2 h2so4 0 4 mm and nacl up to 10 mm for alcohol scavenging experiments tertbutyl alcohol tba or methanol meoh were also added before starting the experiment solutions were not buffered and initial values of ph were adjusted to 3 0 by hclo4 just before starting the reaction during the whole reaction processes for 30 min the values of ph dropped by less than 0 5 units figure s1 samples were withdrawn at predetermined time intervals and quenched by a measured excess of methanol before hplc or lc ms ms analysis electron spin resonance esr experiments were conducted with the addition of 5 5 dimethyl 1 pyrolin n oxide dmpo in reaction system and samples were withdrawn with a capillary tube after reacting for 1 5 min and detected by esr spectrometer bruker a200 all experiments were conducted in duplicate or triplicate average values along with one standard deviation are reported in this work 2 3 analytical methods the concentrations of dmp pmso and methyl phenyl sulfone pmso2 were measured by high performance liquid chromatography hplc waters 2695 with a reversed phase c18 column 4 6 mm 150 mm 5 µm waters and a photo diode array detector pda waters 2998 dmp was detected at 227 nm with methanol and water 1 acetic acid mixed at a ratio of 45 55 v v while pmso and produced pmso2 were detected with acetonitrile and water 1 acetic acid mixed at a ratio of 80 20 v v at the wavelengths of 230 nm and 215 nm respectively the concentration of nh2oh was measured by ultra performance liquid chromatography uplc waters at 220 nm after reacting with acetone to produce acetone oxime the mobile phase consisted of methanol and water 0 2 formic acid at a ratio of 30 70 v v with a flow rate of 0 2 ml min 1 oxidation intermediates of dmp

in positive ion mode while oxidation intermediates were detected in both positive and negative ion modes the hplc was equipped with a waters xbridge c18 column 3 0 100 mm 2 5 μm particle size and a gradient mobile phase program was used for separation detailed separation conditions for hplc and operating parameters for ms are provided in text s2 the concentration of ferric iron with the presence of hydroxylamine was measured at 300 nm with a uv vis spectrometer hatch zou et al 2013 concentrations of no2 and no3 were detected by an ion chromatograph dionex 3000 the value of total nitrogen tn was measured by a multi n c 3100 analyzer with a total nitrogen detector jena tnm 1 germany 2 4 ecosar prediction and dft calculation the acute and chronic toxicity of dmp and its oxidation intermediates were assessed with ecosar ecological structure activity relationship v 2 0 based on qsar 96 h lc50 for fish 48 h lc50 for daphnid and 96h ec50 for green algae were used for acute toxicity assessment and the chronic value i e the geometric mean of the no observed effect concentration and the lowest observed effect concentration of fish daphnid and green algae were used for chronic toxicity assessment in ecosar program the density functional theory dft method was carried out with gaussian 09 software package frisch et al 2013 3 results and discussion 3 1 oxidation of dmp in pms fe ii system with nh2oh 2 h2so4 and nh2oh hcl oxidation of dmp by pms fe ii with nh2oh 2 h2so4 and nh2oh hcl was initially examined with the addition of 0 4 mm nh2oh 2 h2so4 the degradation efficiency of dmp was improved from 10 to 30 within 15 min fig 1 a however only 50 of dmp could be oxidized when extending the reaction time to 30 min further increasing the dosage of nh2oh 2 h2so4 pms and fe ii could only improve the degradation efficiency of dmp to 60 in 30 min figure s2 in comparison with the addition of nh2oh hcl into pms fe ii system the oxidation efficiency of dmp surprisingly increased to 87 within 30 min 33 higher than that provided by nh2oh 2 h2so4 at equal nh2oh fig 1b when same amount of cl as contained in nh2oh hcl was added into the pms fe ii nh2oh 2 h2so4 system the oxidation efficiency of dmp increased to 88 and the oxidation profile of dmp coincided with that observed in the pms fe ii nh2oh hcl system these results reveal that the higher degradation efficiency of dmp in the pms fe ii nh2oh hcl system could be attributed to the occurrence of cl thus the type of hydroxylamine salts may significantly influence the pollutants degradation effect in pms fe ii system in previous research the effect of cl was always ignored when nh2oh hcl was used in the relevant aops this may lead to an overestimation of the actual enhancement effect of nh2oh on the degradation of organic pollutants to investigate the detailed acceleration effects of cl for dmp oxidation in the pms fe ii nh2oh system nh2oh 2 h2so4 was used in subsequent experiments if not specifically mentioned as the initial concentration of cl increased from 0 to 100 µm the oxidation efficiency of dmp improved from 53 3 to 90 8 within 30 min and then dropped slightly to 87 3 with cl increasing to 1 mm fig 1c however when the concentration of cl further increased to 10 mm the degradation efficiency of dmp dropped to 23 8 within 30 min even lower than that without cl fig 1c these results were different from the overall inhibition effects for the oxidation of maleic acid in pms fe ii system with cl from 0 to 300 mm huang et al 2018 in pms co ii system adverse effects on the oxidation of azo dyes were also found with cl 0 10 mm wang et al 2011 explanations of these two studies were the formation of chlorine species e g cl cl2 hclo and cl2 through reactions of so4 and oh with cl compared with so4 and oh cl2 was more selective in electron transfer reactions with organic compounds yang et al 2018 though cl showed high reactivity with plenty of organic pollutants it was usually formed at low ph conditions lutze et al 2015 thus the effect of cl could vary based on the types of target compounds as well as experimental conditions whether chlorine species formed and participated in the degradation of dmp in pms fe ii nh2oh 2 h2so4 cl system was further investigated 3 2 identifying the major reactive species for dmp degradation 3 2 1 contribution of oh to explore whether chlorine species especially cl and cl2 are involved in dmp degradation process radical scavenging experiments were conducted methanol meoh reacts fast with so4 oh and cl with second order reaction rate constants of 2 5 107 m 1 s 1 neta et al 1988 9 7 108 m 1 s 1 buxton et al 1988 and 5 7 109 m 1 s 1 chateauneuf 1990 respectively in comparison tertbutyl alcohol tba is more reactive with oh 6 108 m 1 s 1 buxton et al 1988 and cl 3 108 m 1 s 1 mertens and von sonntag 1995 than with so4 8 105 m 1 s 1 neta et al 1988 with second order reaction rate constants of dmp with so4 4 9 108 m 1 s 1 lei et al 2020 oh 3 7 109 m 1 s 1 lei et al 2020 and cl 1 8 1010 m 1 s 1 lei et al 2020 the values of ck i e products of concentrations and second order reaction rate constants which represent the reactive capacity of target compounds towards certain reactive species zou et al 2014 were calculated for dmp and scavengers towards so4 oh and cl with 10 µm of dmp and 1 mm of each scavengers ck meoh so4 was 5 times higher than ck dmp so4 while ck tba so4 was 16 of ck dmp so4 for cl ck meoh cl and ck tba cl was 32 and 2 times of ck dmp cl respectively and both ck meoh oh and ck tba oh were more than 10 times of ck dmp oh thus so4 could only be effectively scavenged by meoh while oh could be completely consumed by both scavengers under our experimental conditions about 63 and nearly 100 of cl could be scavenged by tba and meoh respectively detailed values of ck in table s1 table 1 with the addition of meoh and tba oxidation of dmp was inhibited by both scavengers regardless of the presence of cl fig 2 a and 2b based on the calculated ck reaction with so4 could be excluded from dmp degradation process with the addition of tba besides the reaction with cl might be little important because cl could only be partly captured by tba while more than 90 of the degradation of dmp was inhibited in the presence of tba thus the major reactive species for the degradation of dmp should be oh both with and without the presence of cl to further identify the presence of oh nitrobenzene was used as oh probe because it has higher reaction rate constant 3 9 109 m 1 s 1 buxton et al 1988 with oh than with so4 less than 106 m 1 s 1 neta et al 1988 and negligibly reacts with cl frøsig et al 2000 similar with the oxidation of dmp degradation efficiency of nitrobenzene improved by 1 2 times with the addition of nh2oh 2 hcl compared to nh2oh 2 h2so4 and the degradation efficiency improved with the addition of cl in nh2oh 2 h2so4 system fig 2c this result supported the presence of oh in pms fe ii nh2oh 2 h2so4 system and the addition of cl could promote the production of oh to improve the oxidation of nitrobenzene and dmp 3 2 2 changes of oh and cl concentrations by varying amount of cl though oh was the dominant reactive specie for the oxidation of dmp in the pms fe ii nh2oh system the role of cl was not clearly elucidated since both meoh and tba only partly captured cl to further determine the contributions of oh and cl for dmp degradation nitrobenzene was simultaneously added into the system with dmp as the probe of oh the concentration of nitrobenzene was chosen to slightly influence the degradation efficiency of dmp less than 10 in figure s3 degradation of nitrobenzene and dmp could be expressed as follows 1 d dmp dt k d m p o h dmp oh k d m p c l dmp cl 2 d nitrobenzene dt k nitrobenzene o h nitrobenzene oh where k d m p o h k d m p c l and k nitrobenzene o h are the second order reaction rate constants of dmp and nitrobenzene with oh or cl respectively the addition of nh2oh would improve the restoration of fe ii through reactions between fe iii and nh2oh zou et al 2013 our previous research indicated that the restoration process would slow down and the concentration of fe ii would gradually decrease with nh2oh consumption which resulted in the oxidation kinetics of benzoic acid deviating from a pseudo first order kinetics in s2o8 2 fe ii nh2oh system li et al 2020 similarly the oxidation profile of dmp deviated from a pseudo first order reaction in this study figure s4 thus the exposure dose ct was used to analyze the changes of oh and cl during dmp degradation process as follows 3 c t oh oh dt ln nitrobenzene nitrobenzene 0 k n b o h 4 c t cl cl dt 1 k d m p c l k d m p o h k nitrobenzene o h ln nitrobenzene nitrobenzene 0 ln dmp dmp 0 the values of c t oh and c t cl during dmp degradation were calculated with varying cl concentrations both c t oh and c t cl increased when the concentration of cl increased to 100 μm and dropped when the concentration of cl further increased to 1 mm fig 3 a and 3b with 1 mm cl addition c t cl increased fast in the initial 3 min but for the whole reaction time of 30 min the overall value of c t cl decreased by more than 50 compared with the case of 100 μm cl addition this was probably due to the production of cl2 through the reaction between cl and cl compared with oh cl2 is less reactive dmp 1 4 107 m 1 s 1 lei et al 2020 besides cl could capture oh as well resulting in the decrease of c t oh for 30 min with 1 mm cl moreover the values of c t oh were more than 10 times of c t cl under all concentrations of cl added considering the reaction rate constant between dmp and cl 1 8 1010 m 1 s 1 was less than 5 times higher than that with oh 3 7 109 m 1 s 1 lei et al 2020 more than 50 of the degradation of dmp was accounted for oh and the contribution of oh increased with increasing of cl concentrations figure s5 3 3 possible acceleration mechanisms of cl the above results suggest that oh mainly contributed to the degradation of dmp in pms fe ii nh2oh system while both so4 and oh were found to participate in the organic pollutants degradation process in previous studies zou et al 2013 considering the reaction rate constant of dmp with oh 3 7 109 m 1 s 1 is nearly 10 times higher than that with so4 4 9 108 m 1 s 1 lei et al 2020 dmp would be largely consumed by oh unless the concentration of so4 was 10 times higher in acidic conditions without cl so4 would be formed by the single electron transfer reaction between pms and fe ii and oh was the secondary radical produced from reactions of so4 with h2o wacławek et al 2017 which would not predominate 60 m 1 s 1 neta et al 1988 over other consumption pathways of so4 by reactants such us nh2oh 1 5 107 m 1 s 1 neta et al 1988 thus no significant promotion was achieved for dmp oxidation with changes of reagent dosages without cl as aforementioned figure s2 with the addition of cl production of oh was promoted and the degradation of dmp was accelerated since cl may react with radicals and complex with iron species in pms fe ii nh2oh system at ph 3 the mechanism of cl for the promotion of oh production was explored 3 3 1 interaction between cl and radicals with the presence of cl oh could be produced from a series of reactions between so4 and chlorine species cl would initially react with so4 to form cl and cl would further react with h2o to form cloh which could transform into oh as eq 5 8 shown below though cl2 could transform back to cl or cloh through reverse reactions of eq 9 and 10 the degradation of dmp was inhibited with the production of cl2 as concentrations of cl increased to above 1 mm as shown in fig 1c thus reverse reactions of eq 9 and 10 were ignored in the following calculation process for a sake of simplicity at the same time the reverse reaction of eq 6 would transform cloh back to cl the consumption of radicals by other reactants i e dmp h2o iron species nh2oh and pms also influenced the steady concentrations of so4 and cl and impacted the production of oh to clearly analyze the production of oh by reactions between radicals and cl the branching ratio of cl br cl was used to evaluate the fate of cl transformed to cloh and oh br cl was defined as the rate of cl reacting with h2o or oh divided by the rate of cl reacting with all components in the water matrix as eq 11 11 b r cl k 6 cl k 7 o h cl k 6 clo h h cl cl k i s i k 6 cl k 7 o h cl k 6 clo h h where cl k i s i k 9 c l k f e i i cl fe ii k p m s cl pms k n h 2 o h cl n h 2 oh k d m p cl dmp the value of br cl was less than 1 and the larger values mean that more cl was consumed to produce cloh based on the steady state assumption for cloh oh and cl one gets 12 r cloh k 6 cl k 7 cl o h k 8 oh c l k 6 clo h h k 8 clo h k 10 clo h c l 0 13 r oh k h 2 o so 4 so 4 k 8 clo h k 8 oh c l oh oh k i s i 0 14 r cl k 5 c l so 4 k 6 clo h h k 6 cl k 7 cl o h cl cl k i s i 0 where oh k i s i k f e i i oh fe ii k p m s oh pms k n h 2 o h oh n h 2 oh k d m p oh dmp thus the concentration of oh was obtained as eq 15 by substituting eq 12 14 to eq 11 detailed calculation in text s3 15 oh k 8 k 6 h k 5 c l b r cl k h 2 o so 4 cl k i s i k 6 k 10 k 5 c l 2 1 b r cl cl 1 b r cl k 5 k 8 k 6 h c l oh k i s i k 10 k 8 c l 2 at ph 3 the value of k 6 h was around 2 1 107 m 1 s 1 less than 1 of k 8 indicating the produced cloh would fast go through eq 8 to produce oh instead of shifting back through the reverse reaction of eq 6 besides the value of k 10 was far lower than k 8 as well thus eq 10 would not be the major consumption route of cloh compared to eq 8 with cl less than 1 mm to obtain the largest production ratio of oh from cloh an extreme condition was considered that all produced cloh went through eq 8 to form oh eq 10 as well as the reverse reaction eq 6 were ignored thus the concentration of oh eq 15 and the value of b r cl eq 11 could be simplified as follows 16 oh k 5 c l b r cl k h 2 o so 4 cl cl k i s i 1 b r cl k 5 c l oh k i s i 17 b r cl k 6 cl k i s i k 6 substituting eq 17 into eq 16 the concentration relationship of oh and cl was obtained as eq 18 18 oh k 5 c l k 6 k h 2 o so 4 cl k i s i k 6 cl k 5 c l oh k i s i the second order reaction rate constants of oh and cl with other reactants i e pms fe ii nh2oh and dmp were obtained from literature listed in table s2 based on fig 3 oh and cl accumulated fast at the initial stage of the reaction process and the value of cl k i s i and oh k i s i could be obtained with initial concentrations of all components and the corresponding reaction rate constants thus with the concentration of cl changing from 10 μm to 1 mm the variation of concentration ratios of oh to cl from eq 18 decreased from 1 75 to 0 6 when using the value of k h 2 o so 4 as 660 s 1 herrmann et al 1995 however the concentrations of oh and cl could also be calculated from the values of ct in the initial 3 min of experimental results shown in fig 3 the degradation of dmp 35 when the concentration of cl was 10 μm 100 μm and 1 mm the concentration of oh in the initial 3 min was 4 02 10 13 m 5 60 10 13 m and 4 48 10 13 m while the concentration of cl was 4 63 10 15 m 7 57 10 15 m and 1 05 10 14 m respectively thus concentration ratios of oh to cl based on experiments decreased from 87 0 to 42 6 with cl changing from 10 μm to 1 mm which were significantly larger than those obtained from calculations based on eq 18 concentration ratios of oh to cl could also be roughly estimated with the branching ratio of cloh br cloh and the largest value was 2 9 under the condition of 10 μm cl detailed calculation in text s4 still less than the experimental results in fact with the ph slightly decreasing from the initial value of 3 the reverse reaction of eq 6 might be strengthened during the reaction process and could not be ignored in calculation indicating the concentration ratio calculated based on eq 18 would actually be smaller thus the interaction of so4 with cl and h2o was not the only production pathway of oh 3 3 2 interaction between cl and iron species besides the interaction with radicals interactions between cl and iron species for oh production were investigated as well in pms fe ii nh2oh system the cycle of iron species mainly involves two reactions the activation of pms by fe ii to produce fe iii and so4 and the reduction of fe iii by nh2oh for fe ii restoration these two reactions are the rate limiting steps for the production of radicals and fe ii directly influencing the degradation rate of dmp with the addition of cl the speciation of both fe ii and fe iii changed in the system by coordination via eq 19 21 de laat and le 2006 whether these complex reactions changed the reactivity of iron species towards pms and nh2oh was studied 19 f e 2 c l fec l 2 88 m 1 20 f e 3 c l fec l 2 6 61 m 1 21 f e 3 2 c l fec l 2 10 5 m 2 the effect of cl on the fe iii reduction process was studied first with the concentration of cl increasing from 0 to 10 mm fecl2 increased up to 3 6 of the total fe iii but the major specie of fe iii was always feoh2 figure s6 the reduction rate between fe iii and nh2oh without pms remained the same regardless of cl concentrations figure s7 indicating fecl2 slightly impacted the reaction rate of nh2oh with fe iii in pms fe ii nh2oh system the major specie of fe iii was also feoh2 and only less than 2 of fe iii existed as fecl2 with concentrations of cl up to 10 mm figure s8 thus fecl2 had negligible influence on the reduction of fe iii by nh2oh in pms fe ii nh2oh system indicating the addition of cl impacted little on the regeneration of fe ii during the activation process of persulfate with fe ii recent research found fe iv was also produced and usually showed lower reactivity to organic compounds than so4 wang et al 2019b the presence of organic chelators could promote the transformation of major reactive species from fe iv to so4 in fe ii pds system wang et al 2019a as aforementioned cl could coordinate with fe ii to form fecl whether this complexation process influenced the production of reactive species and the degradation of dmp was then investigated esr experiments were conducted to identify the primary reactive species in pms fe ii nh2oh system both with and without cl dmpo was used as the spin trapping agent two kinds of adducts signals were found regardless of cl fig 4 a and 4b the weak signals were likely to represent dmpo so4 adducts αn 13 8 g αh 10 2 g αh 1 44 g αh 0 8 g all 0 5 g zou et al 2013 indicating the presence of so4 in pms fe ii nh2oh system the strong signals were compatible with dmpo oh adducts αn αh 14 9 g liang et al 2020 besides oh fe iv could also produce dmpo oh signal by metal catalyzed nucleophilic addition of water or direct oxidation of dmpo by fe iv liang et al 2020 wang et al 2018 thus tba and dimethyl sulfoxide dmso were used to distinguish fe iv and oh because the reaction rate constant of fe iv with dmso 1 4 105 m 1 s 1 is significantly higher than that with tba 6 0 101 m 1 s 1 in acidic medium hajem bataineh et al 2012 pestovsky et al 2006 without cl addition the dmpo oh signals slightly changed with tba but were significantly inhibited by dmso indicating the signals were mainly formed by reactions of dmpo with fe iv with the presence of cl the intensity of dmpo oh signals decreased by 30 with tba and 70 with dmso indicating the coexistence of fe iv and oh in the system thus the addition of cl enhanced the production of oh to further explore the production of fe iv and oh with changing of cl concentrations sulfoxides are chosen as the probe because the two electron transformation products sulfones form when sulfoxides are oxidized by fe iv while hydroxylated or dimeric products form when reacting with oh or so4 pestovsky and bakac 2006 wang et al 2019b in previous research sulfoxides were largely used to identify the presence of fe iv in fe ii o3 pestovsky and bakac 2006 fe ii h2o2 pang et al 2011 fe ii hclo liang et al 2020 and fe vi caso3 shao et al 2019 systems and were also used to identify the presence of other high valent metal oxo species such as mn v gao et al 2019 and cr v dong et al 2020b in our experiments phenyl methyl sulfoxide pmso which has been used for fe iv identification in fe ii pds wang et al 2018 wang et al 2019a and fe ii pms wang et al 2019b systems was chosen as the target compound the degradation of pmso and the production of the two electron transformation product pmso2 were monitored in pms fe ii nh2oh system with different cl concentrations to exclude the influence of o2 on the production of pmso2 n2 was purged to remove dissolved o2 prior to the reaction the degradation of pmso and the production of pmso2 slightly changed with and without deoxygenation indicating that pmso2 was mainly produced through oxidation by fe iv rather than o2 in our system figure s9 the yield of pmso2 i e the pmso2 produced divided by the pmso consumed was 60 in pms fe ii nh2oh system without cl fig 5 c indicating that both fe iv and radicals were produced during pmso degradation process this was in accordance with esr results when cl was added the production of pmso2 decreased with increasing of cl concentrations fig 5b indicating the production of fe iv was inhibited with the addition of cl however the degradation of pmso was promoted fig 5a and the yield of pmso2 decreased fig 5c with concentrations of cl increasing which represented the production of radicals and their contribution to pmso degradation were promoted combined with esr results it could be deduced that so4 fe iv and oh were all produced in pms fe ii nh2oh system and the addition of cl promoted the production of oh but inhibited the formation of fe iv as aforementioned dmp has higher reaction rate constant with oh than so4 and fe iv thus the addition of cl significantly promoted the degradation of dmp the interaction of fe ii and pms with or without cl was also investigated through density functional theory dft calculations based on previous study at least one coordination site should be available for fe ii catalysis in fenton or fenton like reactions graf et al 1984 the degradation of dmp was not influenced by changes of ionic strength figure s10 thus an inner sphere coordinated transitional intermediate fe hso5 was supposed to form at first during the activation of pms by fe ii which was similar with the iron species fe h2o2 2 or fe s2o8 2 previously proposed in fe ii h2o2 or fe ii pds systems dong et al 2020a lu et al 2018 petit et al 2014 wiegand et al 2017 the optimized structure of mono coordinated intermediates between fe2 and hso5 could not be found based on dft calculation because the mono coordination was not stable and fe2 was likely to coordinate with two oxygen atoms of hso5 without the addition of cl detailed discussion in figure s11 under this condition fe iv was more likely to form in the following peroxy bond breaking process of the intermediates and radicals were less likely to be released because of the double coordination compared with so4 2 cl has smaller ionic radius and is more likely to coordinate with fe2 with smaller steric hindrance thus intermediate iron species containing coordinated cl clfe hso5 might form during pms activation process with the addition of cl the dft calculation indicated that the optimized structure of the mono coordinated intermediates between fe2 and pms could be found with the presence of cl in which fe2 could coordinate with either of the two oxygen atoms of the peroxy bond figure s12 and the two optimized geometries had similar energy of 2803 hartree thus radicals so4 or oh rather than fe iv were possibly released in the following heterolysis of the peroxy bond the dft calculation provided a reference to deduce the possible decomposition pathway of fe2 pms intermediates however detailed reaction schemes of the decomposition process of iron intermediates required further investigation based on above analysis the addition of cl inhibited the production of fe iv and promoted the production of radicals so4 and oh by altering the formation of iron intermediates during the fe ii activated pms process the produced so4 could further transform into oh as aforementioned eventually resulting in the increase of oh concentrations fig 6 for pollutants with less reactivity towards so4 than oh like dmp increasing concentrations of oh significantly accelerated their degradation efficiency and improved the use ratio of so4 at the same time 3 4 effects of cl on changes and toxicity of degradation intermediates six postulated degradation intermediates of dmp including isomers were found in pms fe ii nh2oh system both with and without cl table s3 figure s13 s15 the hydroxylation and nitration of the aromatic ring were found as two possible parallel reaction pathways for dmp degradation the hydroxylation pathway i in fig 7 a and the three hydroxylated intermediates of dmp p 210 p 226 and p 242 have been reported previously in oh based aops with oxidants like h2o2 and o3 an et al 2014 xu et al 2019 xu et al 2015 with the presence of cl formation of the three hydroxylation intermediates was significantly promoted and the largest mass peak areas were 6 7 times higher than those observed without cl addition fig 7b to 7d moreover p 210 approached its maximum concentration in the initial 3 min and then decreased as the reaction progressed fig 7b while p 226 and p 242 kept accumulating through the overall reaction 30 min in the presence of cl fig 7c and 7d another possible parallel mechanism for dmp degradation was the nitration of the aromatic ring ii in fig 7a three possible nitration intermediates p 239 p 271 and p 255 were found p 239 was once reported in uv no2 system through reactions of dmp and no2 xu et al 2019 with the presence of cl the signals of all three nitration intermediates decreased in contrast to the trend of hydroxylated products fig 7e to 7g this indicated that the presence of cl attenuated the nitration of dmp and promoted the hydroxylation of the aromatic ring at the same time the red pathway in fig 7a the acute and chronic toxicity of dmp and the six possible degradation intermediates were assessed by ecosar v 2 0 based on qsar under the class of esters table s4 among the six degradation intermediates only p 255 showed higher toxicity than dmp and one of its isomers showed strong chronic toxicity to fish with the addition of cl formation of p 255 decreased and mainly accumulated in the initial 20 min fig 7f while hydroxylated products p 226 and p 242 with less toxicity than dmp significantly increased as aforementioned the absolute decomposition efficiency of nh2oh decreased by 10 with the addition cl figure s16 indicating that cl promoted the degradation of dmp and reduced the consumption of nh2oh simultaneously the major transformation product of nh2oh was considered as n2 figure s16 and text s5 thus the addition of cl could decrease the required dosage of nh2oh and attenuated the production of higher toxic intermediates in pms fe ii nh2oh system 4 conclusions in this article nh2oh hcl was found to have significantly higher accelerating effects on dmp degradation than the same dosages of nh2oh 2 h2so4 in pms fe ii system the reason was a collaborating enhancement by cl and nh2oh cl would change the chemistry of fe ii pms intermediates formed during pms activation process resulting in the shift of major reactive species from fe iv to free radicals so4 or oh besides cl also reacted with so4 and h2o ultimately increasing the production of oh though the interaction of cl with iron species and radicals also promoted the degradation of dmp in fe ii pms system figure s17 the promotion effect was amplified in pms fe ii nh2oh system because fe ii kept restoring with the addition of nh2oh thus in research of fenton like systems with other reactants to promote fe iii fe ii circle the effect of cl should also be paid attention in future studies declaration of competing interest the

17098,at sites where aqueous film forming foams afffs are used for fire suppression or training activities interactions between dissolved foam constituents and organic liquids could alter contaminant migration in the subsurface in this study batch reactor and column experiments were conducted to investigate the potential for afff solutions to enhance the solubility and mobility of three representative non aqueous phase liquid napls jp 4 jet fuel trichloroethene tce and tetrachloroethene pce for afff concentrations up to 5 wt 50 000 mg l aqueous solubilities of tce and pce increased by less than 50 indicating the absence of micellar solubilization however napl water interfacial tensions were reduced to less than 1 5 mn m and resulted in accumulation of up to 2 25 mg m2 of afff at the napl water interface to assess the potential for afff to mobilize residual entrapped napl at a field application rate of 3 wt 30 000 mg l columns were packed with two size fractions of ottawa sands 20 30 mesh and 60 80 mesh that yielded residual napl saturations ranging from 11 7 to 17 6 following injection of 3 pore volumes of the 3 wt afff solution partial mobilization of residual napl was observed for pce tce and jp 4 with saturation reductions of 0 7 to 2 in 20 30 mesh and 0 3 to 1 3 in 60 80 mesh ottawa sand the columns were then flushed with an ultralow ift surfactant solution consisting of 4 wt 1 1 aerosol ay ot which resulted in nearly complete mobilization of the remaining residual napl when napl desaturation curves were expressed in terms of the total trapping number nt the threshold value of nt required for napl mobilization by 3 wt afff was approximately 2 10 5 consistent with previous studies these findings demonstrate that afff solutions can lead to partial mobilization of residual napl and that the total trapping number concept can be used to predict such behavior a priori in addition the observed ift reductions are sufficient to alter napl accumulation

abstract keywords pfas afff napl mobilization solubility interfacial tension 1 introduction aqueous film forming foams afffs have been widely used to extinguish fuel based fires and for firefighter training activities since they were developed in 1960 s moody and field 1999 the active components in afff include hydrocarbon and fluorocarbon surface active agents or surfactants which form a two layer film between the gas air and organic liquid phases moody and field 2000 the long chain fluorocarbon surfactants used in legacy afff formulations such as perfluorooctane sulfonate pfos are persistent in the environment barzen hanson et al 2017 houtz et al 2013 and several studies have shown that extensive use of afff can result in soil and groundwater contamination by per and polyfluoroalkyl substances pfas braunig et al 2017 guelfo and higgins 2013 houtz et al 2016 the presence of non aqueous phase liquids napls has been observed at afff impacted sites which is expected since afffs were designed for use on fuel based fires for example a 20 cm layer of jp 4 jet fuel was observed above the groundwater table at a firefighting training area bugna et al 2005 residual trichloroethene tce was also reported at an afff contaminated site due to its historical use for both waste disposal and fire training exercises kao and prosser 1999 at former burn pit training areas which are widespread at military bases including approximately 600 sites categorized as fire crash training areas by the defense environmental restoration program both petroleum hydrocarbons and chlorinated solvents were commonly used as the fuel resulting in complex napl distributions mcguire et al 2014 moody et al 2003 since afff contains a mixture of surfactants that can reduce the napl water interfacial tension ift and enhance aqueous solubilities it is possible that napls could be mobilized and redistributed in the subsurface at field applied concentrations of afff e g 3 or 6 wt for example levine et al 1997 measured up to 3 feet of jp 4 jet fuel at tyndall air force base in florida associated with firefighting exercises and afff use the distribution of afff and jp 4 was found outside the expected zone of influence of the petroleum hydrocarbon plume costanza et al 2020 reported that ifts between jp 4 jet fuel dodecane and tetrachloroethene pce and 3m fc 303cf light water afff solutions were reduced to as low as 3 mn m at a 3 wt concentration 30 000 mg l suggesting the potential for afff to alter napl distribution and migration at afff impacted sites when released to the subsurface napls are retained in soil pores as immobile droplets or ganglia due to capillary forces and may also accumulate as pools above layers of low permeability porous media soga et al 2004 the retained napl can slowly dissolve into infiltrating surface water or flowing groundwater thereby serving as a long term source of aquifer contamination fortin et al 1997 longino and kueper 1999 singh et al 2011 traditional surfactants which have been used to recover napls from the subsurface have the capacity to increase the aqueous solubility of napls due to micellar solubilization and mobilize entrapped napl due to reductions in the napl water ift martel and gelinas 1996 oostrom et al 1999 pennell et al 1996 rathfelder et al 2001 therefore the application of afff for fire training and fire suppression activities could increase the solubility and migration of napls thereby altering the fate and transport of groundwater contaminants at afff impacted sites recently kostarelos et al 2020 reported the formation of viscous microemulsions in columns containing residual jet a kerosene that were flushed with a 3 wt afff solution and suggested that this process could contribute to the persistence of pfas in source zones the objectives of this study were to assess the potential for afff solutions to alter the aqueous solubility and migration of three representative napls jp 4 tce and pce in two well characterized quartz sands batch reactor experiments were conducted to a measure napl water ift reductions as a function of afff concentration b determine relevant solution properties i e density and viscosity and c assess the effect of afff on the aqueous solubility of the napls column experiments were then performed to establish residual napl saturations and measure the extent of napl mobilization in 20 30 mesh and 60 80 mesh ottawa sand by a 3 wt afff solution for comparison purposes a low ift anionic surfactant formulation commonly used in enhanced oil recovery 4 wt aerosol ay ot was also used as a displacing fluid the observed napl desaturation curves were expressed as a function of the total trapping number nt which accounts for the effects of viscous and density forces on entrapped napls and were used to obtain critical nt values corresponding to onset and complete napl mobilization 2 methods 2 1 materials two size

middleboro ma with cpa 40z cone spindle all samples were tested as 0 5 ml aliquots and daily calibration checks were performed with purified water to confirm accuracy the solubilities of pce and tce

624sil ms fused silica column and an electron capture detector ecd the precolumn trap was installed to prevent fouling of the gc inlet column and detector samples were prepared for analysis by adding approximately 0 04 ml of the aqueous sample to 1 96 ml of isopropanol in glass autosampler vials leaving minimal headspace to avoid volatilization and sealed with teflon backed screw caps a minimum of

the interfacial tensions between the napls and afff solutions at room temperature 22 1 c briefly a drop of jp 4 tce or pce was slowly dispensed into a quartz cuvette starna cells inc atascadero ca that contained afff solution until the maximum drop volume was obtained without dislodging the drop from the stainless steel needle the drop shape was then analyzed using a goniometer model 190 ramé

equipped with a micro roughened surface platinum wilhelmy plate part no t107 the system can determine interfacial tensions in the range of 1 to 2000 mn m with a resolution of 0 001 mn m prior to napl water interfacial tension measurements the balance was calibrated using a 1761 7 mg certified mass and the interfacial tension of freshly dispensed purified water was determined to verify accuracy 2 4 column mobilization studies to evaluate the mobilization of residual napl by the afff and aerosol ay ot solutions a series of multiphase column experiments was conducted following the procedure described by pennell et al 1996 briefly a borosilicate glass column 5 cm dia 15 cm length was packed with air dried 20 30 mesh or 60 80 mesh ottawa sand in 1 cm increments under gentle vibration the packed column was purged with co2 gas for at least 2 h to facilitate dissolution of the gas phase during the water imbibition and saturation process to fully saturate the column with water at least 5 pore volumes pvs of degassed background electrolyte solution 500 mg l cacl2 were introduced to the column the pv of the column was then determined by the difference of column weight before and after water saturation to establish a uniform residual napl saturation approximately 100 ml of jp 4 pce or tce dyed with oil red o were injected into the column using a high pressure syringe pump chemyx fusion 100 stafford tx at a flow rate of 10 ml min in a down flow mode for jp 4 or an up flow mode for pce and tce to displace water from the pore space the flow direction was then reversed and at least 3 pvs of background electrolyte solution were injected at a flow rate of 10 ml min to displace mobile napl or free product from the column a non reactive tracer nabr test was conducted after establishment of residual napl to determine the saturation see supplementary information the relative water permeabilities krw of the packed columns ranged from 0 37 to 0 43 after establishment of residual napl following the first non reactive tracer test approximately 3 pvs 300 ml of 3 wt afff solution were introduced into the column at a darcy velocity of approximately 6 5 cm h followed by 3 pvs background electrolyte solution at the same velocity column effluent samples were collected continuously in graduated glass centrifuge tubes using a fraction collector cf 2 spectrum laboratories ca the volume of napl recovered in the effluent was measured and a second non reactive bromide tracer test was performed to determine the residual saturation of napl the difference in napl saturation based on these two measurements was typically less than 10 in the final phase of the experiment 3 pvs of the 4 wt aerosol ay ot solution were injected to displace the remaining residual napl from the column the final saturation of napl following the 4 wt aerosol ay ot solution flush was determined by a third non reactive tracer test changes in pressure between the column inlet and outlet were measured using a pressure transducer omega px30 030gv norwalk ct connected to a digit multimeter keithley 2110 beaverton or and calibrated using five water column heights 0 to 1 m all column experiments were conducted at room temperature 22 1 c in duplicate or triplicate to confirm reproducibility 3 results and discussion 3 1 napl solubility the solubilities of pce and tce in aqueous solutions of afff over a concentration range of 0 to 5 wt 0 to 50 000 mg l are shown in fig 1 in the case of pce the aqueous solubility in the absence of afff was 177 mg l which is consistent with reported values ranging from 150 to 200 mg l at room temperature 21 25 c broholm and feenstra 1995 ladaa et al 2001 when the afff concentration was increased up to 5 wt 50 000 mg l or 50 g l the measured pce solubilities never exceeded 260 mg l fig 1 b clearly demonstrating that afff has a minimal effect on the aqueous solubility of pce over a wide concentration range similarly the aqueous solubility of tce in the background solution without afff was 1 191 mg l and increased to only 1 401 mg l at 5 wt afff for comparison purposes previously measured solubilities of pce and tce in aqueous solutions of a common nonionic surfactant tween 80 polyoxyethylene 20 sorbitan monooleate are also plotted in fig 1 a the solubilities of pce and tce increased linearly above the critical micelle concentration cmc of tween 80 consistent with a micellar solubilization process and yielded weight solubilization ratios wsrs of 0 91 and 1 74 respectively rathfelder et al 2001 suchomel et al 2007 for a tween 80 concentration of 5 wt the aqueous solubilities of pce and tce were 45 500 mg l and 85 800 mg l respectively which are approximately 175 and 60 times greater than the concentrations of pce and tce measured in 5 wt afff these comparisons suggest that afff does not exhibit traditional surfactant micelle formation and solubilization of hydrophobic organic compounds hocs over the concentration range considered the relatively small increases in solubility observed for pce and tce which have been reported for other hocs at surfactant concentrations below the cmc kile and chiou 1989 are likely due to associations between the dissolved organic species and surfactant monomers or disorganized aggregates 3 2 napl water interfacial tension napl water interfacial tensions measured for ten afff concentrations ranging from 0 0001 wt 1 mg l to 10 wt 100 000 mg l are shown in fig 2 as the afff concentration was increased napl water ift values decreased steadily to less than 1 5 mn m for all three napls showing that the afff formulation was effective at reducing the napl water interfacial tension this observation is consistent with other studies which found that dissolved pfas accumulate at napl water interface and thereby decreases the napl water ift brusseau 2018 silva et al 2019 at an afff field application concentration of 3 wt 30 000 mg l the ifts for jp 4 pce and tce were 3 10 3 00 and 1 98 mn m respectively these values are below a critical ift value of 5 mn m that can potentially lead to mobilization of residual dodecane and pce in unconsolidated porous media pennell et al 1994 pennell et al 1996 the napl water ift data as a function of afff aqueous concentration c were fit to the szyszkowski equation costanza et al 2019 using a nonlinear least square procedure matlab r2020a 1 γ γ 0 1 a ln c b 1 where γ 0 is solute free napl water interfacial tension a is component specific constant and b is surface activity mg l the fit was performed over an afff concentration range of 1 mg l to the inflection point 10 000 mg l above which the change in ift with increasing afff concentration was minimal the fitted parameters including napl water interfacial tension γ component specific constant a and surface activity b are presented in table s2 the maximum surface excess concentration γ m was then calculated as 2 γ m a γ 0 r t where r is the ideal gas constant 8 314 kj mol k and t is the absolute temperature the surface concentration of afff at the napl water interface as a function of the aqueous afff concentration was computed using the langmuir szyszkowski equation lunkenheimer et al 2017 3 γ γ m c c b the resulting surface excess concentration γ as a function of afff concentration is shown in fig 2 c the maximum surface excess of afff at the napl water interface which ranges from approximately 1 7 to 2 3 mg m2 was reached at an afff concentration of approximately 1 wt 10 000 mg l for all three napls accumulation of afff at the pce water interface was 1 2 and 1 3 times greater than that of tce and jp4 respectively 3 3 napl mobilization column experiments were conducted with two size fractions of ottawa sand 20 30 mesh and 60 80 mesh to evaluate the potential of afff to mobilize residual entrapped napls at a field application concentration of 3 wt the columns were flushed with a sequence of three aqueous solutions a background electrolyte 500 mg l cacl2 to establish the initial residual saturation followed by 3 wt afff solution to assess mobilization of the residual napl and finally 4 wt 1 1 aerosol ay ot to achieve near complete mobilization of any remaining napl the density viscosity and ift values for each displacing solution are provided in table 1 following napl imbibition and displacement of free product with the 500 mg l cacl2 solution the entrapped napls were observed visually as discrete droplets or globules in the pore space distributed uniformly along the length of column figure s1 in 20 30 mesh os the non reactive tracer tests yielded initial saturations for jp 4 tce and pce of 13 0 12 9 and 11 4 respectively which are consistent with residual saturation values reported previously pennell et al 1996 the relative water permeabilities krw of the packed columns ranged from 0 37 to 0 43 after establishment of residual napl upon the injection of 3 pvs of 3 wt afff solution all three napls were partially mobilized and a separate organic liquid phase was observed in the column effluent macroemulsion formation was not observed in any of the effluent samples collected during the 3 wt afff flush figure s2 and the pressure remained relatively constant during napl displacement a second non reactive tracer test figure s5 indicated that the residual saturations were reduced by 0 7 for jp4 1 for pce and 2 for tce following the injection of 3 wt afff tce exhibited the greatest reduction in saturation after the afff flush which was attributed to lower interfacial tension 1 98 mn m compared to jp 4 and pce 3 mn m for the 60 80 mesh os the initial napl saturations were 14 9 16 4 17 6 for jp 4 pce and tce respectively these larger values are attributed to the finer grain size of the sand following injection of 3 wt afff the saturations of jp 4 pce and tce were reduced by 0 3 1 3 and 1 2 respectively the observed partial displacement of residual napl by 3 afff is not consistent with the findings of kostarelos et al 2020 who reported the formation of viscous emulsions and column plugging after injecting a 3 wt afff 1 solution into ok 75 sand columns containing jet a fuel at residual saturations of 23 8 and 31 5 this disparity in results could be attributed to several factors including differences in the afff formulation which had a much lower cmc in the kostarelos et al 2020 study 60 mg l versus 3000 mg l higher residual napl saturations and used a lower permeability sand in the final phase of each experiment the columns were flushed with 3 to 4 pvs of the low ift surfactant solution 4 aerosol ay ot which has been shown to achieve nearly complete mobilization of pce from quartz sands pennell et al 1996 consistent with prior experiments the 4 aerosol ay ot flush displaced most of the remaining napl from both the 20 30 mesh and 60 80 mesh os columns figure s3 and s4 with final napl saturations below 1 2 for all cases based on the third and final non reactive tracer test results figure s5 during napl displacement with 4 aerosol ay ot the pressure increased only slightly 9 mbar the initial residual saturation of jp 4 tce and pce and changes after each sequential solution injection are summarized in table 2 3 4 napl desaturation curves in order for mobilization of residual napl to occur the viscous and buoyancy forces must exceed the capillary forces acting to retain the napl droplet in the pore space this balance of forces can be described using the total trapping number nt pennell et al 1996 4 n t n c a 2 2 n c a n b sin α n b 2 where α is the angle of aqueous phase flow relative to the horizontal axis here the capillary number nca and bond number nb are defined as 5 n c a q w μ w γ cos θ n b δ ρ g k k r w γ cos θ where qw is the darcy velocity of the aqueous phase upward direction is taken as positive μw is the dynamic viscosity of the aqueous phase γ is the interfacial tension between the organic and aqueous phases θ is the contact angle between the aqueous and solid phases δρ is the difference between the aqueous and organic phase densities ρw ρo g is the gravitational constant k is the intrinsic permeability of the porous medium and krw is the relative permeability of the aqueous phase for the case of vertical flow α 90 in the direction of the buoyancy gravity force eq 4 reduces to 6 n t n c a n b total trapping number nt values were computed for jp 4 tce and pce using the measured properties of displacing fluids table 1 and porous media here the contact angel θ was assumed to be 0 the napl desaturation curves see supplementary information for details of the curve fitting procedure were then expressed in terms of total trapping number as shown in fig 3 for jp 4 mobilization of residual napl occurred at an nt value of approximately 2 10 5 for both 20 30 mesh and 60 80 mesh os with nearly complete mobilization observed at a value of 1 10 3 similar results were obtained for tce and pce desaturation curves in the case of pce the desaturation curves are consistent with earlier findings in the same porous media which showed that the threshold value of nt required for the onset of pce mobilization was approximately 2 10 5 while nearly complete displacement of pce was observed when nt exceeded 1 10 4 note that consistent with multiphase fluid flow theory if napl and afff are co released to the subsurface the consequent reduction in napl water ift capillary forces would not only reduce entrapped saturations but would be expected to increase the propensity for napl spreading since capillary forces act to counteract the onset of gravity and textural fingering glass and nicholl 1996 held and illangasekare 1995 reduce spreading at the water table miller et al 2004 and limit penetration into lower permeability lenses miller et al 2004 rathfelder et al 2003 enhancement of penetration into finer textured media could be particularly concerning in the context of aquifer remediation for example based on the approach of mcwhorter and kueper 1996 the thickness of a tce dnapl pool necessary for entry into a layer of porous media with a hydraulic conductivity ksat of 0 001 cm s and a porosity n of 0 3 would be reduced from approximately 100 to 6 cm for an interfacial tension reduction of 35 water to 2 mn m 3 wt afff fig 2 a 4 conclusions this study was designed to investigate interactions between afff and three representative napls jp 4 tce and pce and to assess the potential for afff to enhance the solubility and mobility of napls in porous media in this work relatively high concentrations of afff were employed to simulate conditions at or near a fire training facility or fire response where operational concentrations of 3 to 6 wt afff were typically applied batch reactor tests indicated that presence of afff increased the solubility of tce and pce by no more than 50 at concentrations up to 5 wt 50 000 mg l when compared to a representative nonionic surfactant tween 80 which yielded pce and tce solubilities of 45 500 mg l and 85 800 mg l in 5 wt the effects of afff on solubility are relatively minor these findings also suggest that afff does not form traditional surfactant micelles i e oil in water microemulsions in aqueous solution over the concentration range investigated interfacial tension measurements revealed that afff accumulates at the napl water interface and can result in ift reductions below 3 mn m at a field application concentration of 3 wt afff column experiments were then conducted to determine if the observed ift reductions were sufficient to mobilize three napls jp 4 tce and pce at residual entrapped saturation partial mobilization of all three napls was observed following the injection of 3 wt afff solution which resulted in napl saturation reductions of 0 7 2 0 and 0 3 1 3 in 20 30 mesh and 60 80 mesh ottawa sands respectively using the density viscosity and interfacial tension measurements of the displacing solutions and porous media properties the total trapping number nt was used to construct napl desaturation curves which showed that the onset of napl mobilization occurred when the value nt exceeded approximately 1 10 5 and that nearly complete mobilization corresponded to nt values greater than 1 10 4 these results demonstrate that for a field application concentration of afff 3 wt partial mobilization and redistribution of napls may occur and that the total trapping number approach can be used to estimate a priori the extent of napl mobilization that may occur based on site specific conditions given the importance of capillary forces in the migration of napls these ift reductions in the presence of afff would also be expected to alter the accumulation and distribution of napl free product increasing penetration into low permeability media author statement kdp and sl designed the experiments sl and zs conducted the experiments sl and

17098,at sites where aqueous film forming foams afffs are used for fire suppression or training activities interactions between dissolved foam constituents and organic liquids could alter contaminant migration in the subsurface in this study batch reactor and column experiments were conducted to investigate the potential for afff solutions to enhance the solubility and mobility of three representative non aqueous phase liquid napls jp 4 jet fuel trichloroethene tce and tetrachloroethene pce for afff concentrations up to 5 wt 50 000 mg l aqueous solubilities of tce and pce increased by less than 50 indicating the absence of micellar solubilization however napl water interfacial tensions were reduced to less than 1 5 mn m and resulted in accumulation of up to 2 25 mg m2 of afff at the napl water interface to assess the potential for afff to mobilize residual entrapped napl at a field application rate of 3 wt 30 000 mg l columns were packed with two size fractions of ottawa sands 20 30 mesh and 60 80 mesh that yielded residual napl saturations ranging from 11 7 to 17 6 following injection of 3 pore volumes of the 3 wt afff solution partial mobilization of residual napl was observed for pce tce and jp 4 with saturation reductions of 0 7 to 2 in 20 30 mesh and 0 3 to 1 3 in 60 80 mesh ottawa sand the columns were then flushed with an ultralow ift surfactant solution consisting of 4 wt 1 1 aerosol ay ot which resulted in nearly complete mobilization of the remaining residual napl when napl desaturation curves were expressed in terms of the total trapping number nt the threshold value of nt required for napl mobilization by 3 wt afff was approximately 2 10 5 consistent with previous studies these findings demonstrate that afff solutions can lead to partial mobilization of residual napl and that the total trapping number concept can be used to predict such behavior a priori in addition the observed ift reductions are sufficient to alter napl accumulation

abstract keywords pfas afff napl mobilization solubility interfacial tension 1 introduction aqueous film forming foams afffs have been widely used to extinguish fuel based fires and for firefighter training activities since they were developed in 1960 s moody and field 1999 the active components in afff include hydrocarbon and fluorocarbon surface active agents or surfactants which form a two layer film between the gas air and organic liquid phases moody and field 2000 the long chain fluorocarbon surfactants used in legacy afff formulations such as perfluorooctane sulfonate pfos are persistent in the environment barzen hanson et al 2017 houtz et al 2013 and several studies have shown that extensive use of afff can result in soil and groundwater contamination by per and polyfluoroalkyl substances pfas braunig et al 2017 guelfo and higgins 2013 houtz et al 2016 the presence of non aqueous phase liquids napls has been observed at afff impacted sites which is expected since afffs were designed for use on fuel based fires for example a 20 cm layer of jp 4 jet fuel was observed above the groundwater table at a firefighting training area bugna et al 2005 residual trichloroethene tce was also reported at an afff contaminated site due to its historical use for both waste disposal and fire training exercises kao and prosser 1999 at former burn pit training areas which are widespread at military bases including approximately 600 sites categorized as fire crash training areas by the defense environmental restoration program both petroleum hydrocarbons and chlorinated solvents were commonly used as the fuel resulting in complex napl distributions mcguire et al 2014 moody et al 2003 since afff contains a mixture of surfactants that can reduce the napl water interfacial tension ift and enhance aqueous solubilities it is possible that napls could be mobilized and redistributed in the subsurface at field applied concentrations of afff e g 3 or 6 wt for example levine et al 1997 measured up to 3 feet of jp 4 jet fuel at tyndall air force base in florida associated with firefighting exercises and afff use the distribution of afff and jp 4 was found outside the expected zone of influence of the petroleum hydrocarbon plume costanza et al 2020 reported that ifts between jp 4 jet fuel dodecane and tetrachloroethene pce and 3m fc 303cf light water afff solutions were reduced to as low as 3 mn m at a 3 wt concentration 30 000 mg l suggesting the potential for afff to alter napl distribution and migration at afff impacted sites when released to the subsurface napls are retained in soil pores as immobile droplets or ganglia due to capillary forces and may also accumulate as pools above layers of low permeability porous media soga et al 2004 the retained napl can slowly dissolve into infiltrating surface water or flowing groundwater thereby serving as a long term source of aquifer contamination fortin et al 1997 longino and kueper 1999 singh et al 2011 traditional surfactants which have been used to recover napls from the subsurface have the capacity to increase the aqueous solubility of napls due to micellar solubilization and mobilize entrapped napl due to reductions in the napl water ift martel and gelinas 1996 oostrom et al 1999 pennell et al 1996 rathfelder et al 2001 therefore the application of afff for fire training and fire suppression activities could increase the solubility and migration of napls thereby altering the fate and transport of groundwater contaminants at afff impacted sites recently kostarelos et al 2020 reported the formation of viscous microemulsions in columns containing residual jet a kerosene that were flushed with a 3 wt afff solution and suggested that this process could contribute to the persistence of pfas in source zones the objectives of this study were to assess the potential for afff solutions to alter the aqueous solubility and migration of three representative napls jp 4 tce and pce in two well characterized quartz sands batch reactor experiments were conducted to a measure napl water ift reductions as a function of afff concentration b determine relevant solution properties i e density and viscosity and c assess the effect of afff on the aqueous solubility of the napls column experiments were then performed to establish residual napl saturations and measure the extent of napl mobilization in 20 30 mesh and 60 80 mesh ottawa sand by a 3 wt afff solution for comparison purposes a low ift anionic surfactant formulation commonly used in enhanced oil recovery 4 wt aerosol ay ot was also used as a displacing fluid the observed napl desaturation curves were expressed as a function of the total trapping number nt which accounts for the effects of viscous and density forces on entrapped napls and were used to obtain critical nt values corresponding to onset and complete napl mobilization 2 methods 2 1 materials two size

fuel jp 4 was prepared as a 1 1 mixture of unleaded gasoline and kerosene reagent grade tce 99 6 purity and pce 99 purity were purchased from acros organics geel belgium the napls were dyed with 2 10 4 m oil red o fisher scientific pittsburgh pa to allow for visualization of the free product migration prior studies have demonstrated that oil red o at this concentration has negligible effects on interfacial tension and napl mobilization pennell et al 1996 the afff solutions were prepared from a legacy 3m fc 783f afff 3 concentrate lot 607 the critical micelle concentration cmc of the 3m afff is approximately 3000 mg l based on surface tension measurements costanza et al 2020 concentrations of 33 pfas in the 3 concentrate were measured by sgs axys using liquid chromatography quadrupole mass spectrometry lc ms ms with isotope dilution method mla 110 which has been verified and accredited under department of defense dod quality system manual qsm 3 3 see table s1 the low ift surfactant

approximately 2500 mg l brown et al 1999 all aqueous solutions were prepared with 500 mg l cacl2 13 5 mm as the background electrolyte in ultrapure water resistance of 18 2 mω cm that was dispensed through a lc pak point of use polisher from a milli q system millipore sigma burlington ma 2 2 density viscosity and napl solubility measurements liquid densities were determined gravimetrically using a 25 ml borosilicate glass pycnometer chemscience inc canada the viscosity of the 3 wt afff was measured in triplicate using a brookfield dv ii viscometer brookfield engineering laboratories inc middleboro ma with cpa 40z cone spindle all samples were tested as 0 5 ml aliquots and daily calibration checks were performed with purified water to confirm accuracy the solubilities of pce and tce were determined in aqueous solutions of afff at six concentrations ranging from 0 to 5 wt 50 000 mg l briefly 1 ml of neat liquid pce or tce and 15 ml of afff solution were mixed in borosilicate glass centrifuge tubes kimble chase rockwood tn for 48 h on an oscillating shaker fisherbrand waltham ma after which the liquid phases were separated by centrifugation at 2500 rpm for 30 min aqueous concentrations of pce or tce were measured using a 2010 model shimadzu gas chromatograph gc equipped with a precolumn trap consisting of a glass insert with an 3 cm glass wool packing a restek rxi 624sil ms fused silica column and an electron capture detector ecd the precolumn trap was installed to prevent fouling of the gc inlet column and detector samples were prepared for analysis by adding approximately 0 04 ml of the aqueous sample to 1 96 ml of isopropanol in glass autosampler vials leaving minimal headspace to avoid volatilization and sealed with teflon backed screw caps a minimum of six standards prepared using pce or tce isopropanol solutions were analyzed to produce a calibration curve along with daily single point calibration checks the limits of detection lod for pce and tce were determined to be 6 8 and 1 0 µg l respectively based on the method of armbruster and pry 2008 2 3 interfacial tension measurements the pendant drop method berry et al 2015 was used to determine the interfacial tensions between the napls and afff solutions at room temperature 22 1 c briefly a drop of jp 4 tce or pce was slowly dispensed into a quartz cuvette starna cells inc atascadero ca that contained afff solution until the maximum drop volume was obtained without dislodging the drop from the stainless steel needle the drop shape was then analyzed using a goniometer model 190 ramé hart succasunna nj and interfacial tension was calculated in triplicate using dropimage advanced software ramé hart each napl was dispensed from a 2 ml capacity micrometer glass syringe gs 1200 gilmont instruments il through either a straight or inverted 22 gauge stainless steel needle for low ift measurements the pendant drop method is difficult to perform and does not produce reliable results lin and hwang 1994 and thus interfacial tensions between the napls and 4 wt ay ot solution were determined using a force tensiometer sigma 700 precision biolin scientific gothenburg sweden equipped with a micro roughened surface platinum wilhelmy plate part no t107 the system can determine interfacial tensions in the range of 1 to 2000 mn m with a resolution of 0 001 mn m prior to napl water interfacial tension measurements the balance was calibrated using a 1761 7 mg certified mass and the interfacial tension of freshly dispensed purified water was determined to verify accuracy 2 4 column mobilization studies to evaluate the mobilization of residual napl by the afff and aerosol ay ot solutions a series of multiphase column experiments was conducted following the procedure described by pennell et al 1996 briefly a borosilicate glass column 5 cm dia 15 cm length was packed with air dried 20 30 mesh or 60 80 mesh ottawa sand in 1 cm increments under gentle vibration the packed column was purged with co2 gas for at least 2 h to facilitate dissolution of the gas phase during the water imbibition and saturation process to fully saturate the column with water at least 5 pore volumes pvs of degassed background electrolyte solution 500 mg l cacl2 were introduced to the column the pv of the column was then determined by the difference of column weight before and after water saturation to establish a uniform residual napl saturation approximately 100 ml of jp 4 pce or tce dyed with oil red o were injected into the column using a high pressure syringe pump chemyx fusion 100 stafford tx at a flow rate of 10 ml min in a down flow mode for jp 4 or an up flow mode for pce and tce to displace water from the pore space the flow direction was then reversed and at least 3 pvs of background electrolyte solution were injected at a flow rate of 10 ml min to displace mobile napl or free product from the column a non reactive tracer nabr test was conducted after establishment of residual napl to determine the saturation see supplementary information the relative water permeabilities krw of the packed columns ranged from 0 37 to 0 43 after establishment of residual napl following the first non reactive tracer test approximately 3 pvs 300 ml of 3 wt afff solution were introduced into the column at a darcy velocity of approximately 6 5 cm h followed by 3 pvs background electrolyte solution at the same velocity column effluent samples were collected continuously in graduated glass centrifuge tubes using a fraction collector cf 2 spectrum laboratories ca the volume of napl recovered in the effluent was measured and a second non reactive bromide tracer test was performed to determine the residual saturation of napl the difference in napl saturation based on these two measurements was typically less than 10 in the final phase of the experiment 3 pvs of the 4 wt aerosol ay ot solution were injected to displace the remaining residual napl from the column the final saturation of napl following the 4 wt aerosol ay ot solution flush was determined by a third non reactive tracer test changes in pressure between the column inlet and outlet were measured using a pressure transducer omega px30 030gv norwalk ct connected to a digit multimeter keithley 2110 beaverton or and calibrated using five water column heights 0 to 1 m all column experiments were conducted at room temperature 22 1 c in duplicate or triplicate to confirm reproducibility 3 results and discussion 3 1 napl solubility the solubilities of pce and tce in aqueous solutions of afff over a concentration range of 0 to 5 wt 0 to 50 000 mg l are shown in fig 1 in the case of pce the aqueous solubility in the absence of afff was 177 mg l which is consistent with reported values ranging from 150 to 200 mg l at room temperature 21 25 c broholm and feenstra 1995 ladaa et al 2001 when the afff concentration was increased up to 5 wt 50 000 mg l or 50 g l the measured pce solubilities never exceeded 260 mg l fig 1 b clearly demonstrating that afff has a minimal effect on the aqueous solubility of pce over a wide concentration range similarly the aqueous solubility of tce in the background solution without afff was 1 191 mg l and increased to only 1 401 mg l at 5 wt afff for comparison purposes previously measured solubilities of pce and tce in aqueous solutions of a common nonionic surfactant tween 80 polyoxyethylene 20 sorbitan monooleate are also plotted in fig 1 a the solubilities of pce and tce increased linearly above the critical micelle concentration cmc of tween 80 consistent with a micellar solubilization process and yielded weight solubilization ratios wsrs of 0 91 and 1 74 respectively rathfelder et al 2001 suchomel et al 2007 for a tween 80 concentration of 5 wt the aqueous solubilities of pce and tce were 45 500 mg l and 85 800 mg l respectively which are approximately 175 and 60 times greater than the concentrations of pce and tce measured in 5 wt afff these comparisons suggest that afff does not exhibit traditional surfactant micelle formation and solubilization of hydrophobic organic compounds hocs over the concentration range considered the relatively small increases in solubility observed for pce and tce which have been reported for other hocs at surfactant concentrations below the cmc kile and chiou 1989 are likely due to associations between the dissolved organic species and surfactant monomers or disorganized aggregates 3 2 napl water interfacial tension napl water interfacial tensions measured for ten afff concentrations ranging from 0 0001 wt 1 mg l to 10 wt 100 000 mg l are shown in fig 2 as the afff concentration was increased napl water ift values decreased steadily to less than 1 5 mn m for all three napls showing that the afff formulation was effective at reducing the napl water interfacial tension this observation is consistent with other studies which found that dissolved pfas accumulate at napl water interface and thereby decreases the napl water ift brusseau 2018 silva et al 2019 at an afff field application concentration of 3 wt 30 000 mg l the ifts for jp 4 pce and tce were 3 10 3 00 and 1 98 mn m respectively these values are below a critical ift value of 5 mn m that can potentially lead to mobilization of residual dodecane and pce in unconsolidated porous media pennell et al 1994 pennell et al 1996 the napl water ift data as a function of afff aqueous concentration c were fit to the szyszkowski equation costanza et al 2019 using a nonlinear least square procedure matlab r2020a 1 γ γ 0 1 a ln c b 1 where γ 0 is solute free napl water interfacial tension a is component specific constant and b is surface activity mg l the fit was performed over an afff concentration range of 1 mg l to the inflection point 10 000 mg l above which the change in ift with increasing afff concentration was minimal the fitted parameters including napl water interfacial tension γ component specific constant a and surface activity b are presented in table s2 the maximum surface excess concentration γ m was then calculated as 2 γ m a γ 0 r t where r is the ideal gas constant 8 314 kj mol k and t is the absolute temperature the surface concentration of afff at the napl water interface as a function of the aqueous afff concentration was computed using the langmuir szyszkowski equation lunkenheimer et al 2017 3 γ γ m c c b the resulting surface excess concentration γ as a function of afff concentration is shown in fig 2 c the maximum surface excess of afff at the napl water interface which ranges from approximately 1 7 to 2 3 mg m2 was reached at an afff concentration of approximately 1 wt 10 000 mg l for all three napls accumulation of afff at the pce water interface was 1 2 and 1 3 times greater than that of tce and jp4 respectively 3 3 napl mobilization column experiments were conducted with two size fractions of ottawa sand 20 30 mesh and 60 80 mesh to evaluate the potential of afff to mobilize residual entrapped napls at a field application concentration of 3 wt the columns were flushed with a sequence of three aqueous solutions a background electrolyte 500 mg l cacl2 to establish the initial residual saturation followed by 3 wt afff solution to assess mobilization of the residual napl and finally 4 wt 1 1 aerosol ay ot to achieve near complete mobilization of any remaining napl the density viscosity and ift values for each displacing solution are provided in table 1 following napl imbibition and displacement of free product with the 500 mg l cacl2 solution the entrapped napls were observed visually as discrete droplets or globules in the pore space distributed uniformly along the length of column figure s1 in 20 30 mesh os the non reactive tracer tests yielded initial saturations for jp 4 tce and pce of 13 0 12 9 and 11 4 respectively which are consistent with residual saturation values reported previously pennell et al 1996 the relative water permeabilities krw of the packed columns ranged from 0 37 to 0 43 after establishment of residual napl upon the injection of 3 pvs of 3 wt afff solution all three napls were partially mobilized and a separate organic liquid phase was observed in the column effluent macroemulsion formation was not observed in any of the effluent samples collected during the 3 wt afff flush figure s2 and the pressure remained relatively constant during napl displacement a second non reactive tracer test figure s5 indicated that the residual saturations were reduced by 0 7 for jp4 1 for pce and 2 for tce following the injection of 3 wt afff tce exhibited the greatest reduction in saturation after the afff flush which was attributed to lower interfacial tension 1 98 mn m compared to jp 4 and pce 3 mn m for the 60 80 mesh os the initial napl saturations were 14 9 16 4 17 6 for jp 4 pce and tce respectively these larger values are attributed to the finer grain size of the sand following injection of 3 wt afff the saturations of jp 4 pce and tce were reduced by 0 3 1 3 and 1 2 respectively the observed partial displacement of residual napl by 3 afff is not consistent with the findings of kostarelos et al 2020 who reported the formation of viscous emulsions and column plugging after injecting a 3 wt afff 1 solution into ok 75 sand columns containing jet a fuel at residual saturations of 23 8 and 31 5 this disparity in results could be attributed to several factors including differences in the afff formulation which had a much lower cmc in the kostarelos et al 2020 study 60 mg l versus 3000 mg l higher residual napl saturations and used a lower permeability sand in the final phase of each experiment the columns were flushed with 3 to 4 pvs of the low ift surfactant solution 4 aerosol ay ot which has been shown to achieve nearly complete mobilization of pce from quartz sands pennell et al 1996 consistent with prior experiments the 4 aerosol ay ot flush displaced most of the remaining napl from both the 20 30 mesh and 60 80 mesh os columns figure s3 and s4 with final napl saturations below 1 2 for all cases based on the third and final non reactive tracer test results figure s5 during napl displacement with 4 aerosol ay ot the pressure increased only slightly 9 mbar the initial residual saturation of jp 4 tce and pce and changes after each sequential solution injection are summarized in table 2 3 4 napl desaturation curves in order for mobilization of residual napl to occur the viscous and buoyancy forces must exceed the capillary forces acting to retain the napl droplet in the pore space this balance of forces can be described using the total trapping number nt pennell et al 1996 4 n t n c a 2 2 n c a n b sin α n b 2 where α is the angle of aqueous phase flow relative to the horizontal axis here the capillary number nca and bond number nb are defined as 5 n c a q w μ w γ cos θ n b δ ρ g k k r w γ cos θ where qw is the darcy velocity of the aqueous phase upward direction is taken as positive μw is the dynamic viscosity of the aqueous phase γ is the interfacial tension between the organic and aqueous phases θ is the contact angle between the aqueous and solid phases δρ is the difference between the aqueous and organic phase densities ρw ρo g is the gravitational constant k is the intrinsic permeability of the porous medium and krw is the relative permeability of the aqueous phase for the case of vertical flow α 90 in the direction of the buoyancy gravity force eq 4 reduces to 6 n t n c a n b total trapping number nt values were computed for jp 4 tce and pce using the measured properties of displacing fluids table 1 and porous media here the contact angel θ was assumed to be 0 the napl desaturation curves see supplementary information for details of the curve fitting procedure were then expressed in terms of total trapping number as shown in fig 3 for jp 4 mobilization of residual napl occurred at an nt value of approximately 2 10 5 for both 20 30 mesh and 60 80 mesh os with nearly complete mobilization observed at a value of 1 10 3 similar results were obtained for tce and pce desaturation curves in the case of pce the desaturation curves are consistent with earlier findings in the same porous media which showed that the threshold value of nt required for the onset of pce mobilization was approximately 2 10 5 while nearly complete displacement of pce was observed when nt exceeded 1 10 4 note that consistent with multiphase fluid flow theory if napl and afff are co released to the subsurface the consequent reduction in napl water ift capillary forces would not only reduce entrapped saturations but would be expected to increase the propensity for napl spreading since capillary forces act to counteract the onset of gravity and textural fingering glass and nicholl 1996 held and illangasekare 1995 reduce spreading at the water table miller et al 2004 and limit penetration into lower permeability lenses miller et al 2004 rathfelder et al 2003 enhancement of penetration into finer textured media could be particularly concerning in the context of aquifer remediation for example based on the approach of mcwhorter and kueper 1996 the thickness of a tce dnapl pool necessary for entry into a layer of porous media with a hydraulic conductivity ksat of 0 001 cm s and a porosity n of 0 3 would be reduced from approximately 100 to 6 cm for an interfacial tension reduction of 35 water to 2 mn m 3 wt afff fig 2 a 4 conclusions this study was designed to investigate interactions between afff and three representative napls jp 4 tce and pce and to assess the potential for afff to enhance the solubility and mobility of napls in porous media in this work relatively high concentrations of afff were employed to simulate conditions at or near a fire training facility or fire response where operational concentrations of 3 to 6 wt afff were typically applied batch reactor tests indicated that presence of afff increased the solubility of tce and pce by no more than 50 at concentrations up to 5 wt 50 000 mg l when compared to a representative nonionic surfactant tween 80 which yielded pce and tce solubilities of 45 500 mg l and 85 800 mg l in 5 wt the effects of afff on solubility are relatively minor these findings also suggest that afff does not form traditional surfactant micelles i e oil in water microemulsions in aqueous solution over the concentration range investigated interfacial tension measurements revealed that afff accumulates at the napl water interface and can result in ift reductions below 3 mn m at a field application concentration of 3 wt afff column experiments were then conducted to determine if the observed ift reductions were sufficient to mobilize three napls jp 4 tce and pce at residual entrapped saturation partial mobilization of all three napls was observed following the injection of 3 wt afff solution which resulted in napl saturation reductions of 0 7 2 0 and 0 3 1 3 in 20 30 mesh and 60 80 mesh ottawa sands respectively using the density viscosity and interfacial tension measurements of the displacing solutions and porous media properties the total trapping number nt was used to construct napl desaturation curves which showed that the onset of napl mobilization occurred when the value nt exceeded approximately 1 10 5 and that nearly complete mobilization corresponded to nt values greater than 1 10 4 these results demonstrate that for a field application concentration of afff 3 wt partial mobilization and redistribution of napls may occur and that the total trapping number approach can be used to estimate a priori the extent of napl mobilization that may occur based on site specific conditions given the importance of capillary forces in the migration of napls these ift reductions in the presence of afff would also be expected to alter the

17099,woodchip bioreactors have emerged as a viable water management tool to reduce nitrate contamination from agricultural subsurface drainage wastewater and stormwater understanding of denitrification kinetics is critical to the design and application of field woodchip bioreactors the denitrification process in woodchip bioreactors generally obeys a model of michaelis menten type enzyme kinetics the objective of this study was to determine michaelis menten model parameters for nitrate removal in laboratory bioreactors using the fresh composted and aged woodchips the results showed that the maximum nitrate removal rates vmax were 2 09 0 88 and 0 30 mg n l h and the half saturation constants km were 2 60 2 16 and 2 01 mg n l for the composted fresh and aged woodchip bioreactors at 22 c the vmax values decreased to 0 26 and 0 05 mg n l h and the km values decreased to 1 74 and 1 19 mg n l when the composted and fresh woodchip bioreactors were operated at 5 c denitrification in woodchip bioreactors can be operationally defined as a zero order reaction when treating contaminated water with nitrate much higher than the km values the nitrate removal efficiency of the bioreactors followed the order of composted woodchips fresh woodchips aged woodchips the average nitrate load reduction rates were 8 81 21 0 7 36 9 78 and 2 46 3 54 g n m3 d for the composted fresh and aged woodchip bioreactors at influent nitrate concentrations of 10 50 mg n l and 22 c woodchip composting before bioreactor installation can be used as a practical strategy to enhance denitrification performance of bioreactors graphic abstract image graphical abstract keywords woodchips bioreactors denitrification kinetics nitrate removal composting 1 introduction nitrate is an important contaminant in aquatic ecosystems worldwide excessive export of nitrate from anthropogenic activities can accelerate the rate and extent of eutrophication in surface waters which can lead to significant detrimental effects on water resources and public health anderson et al 2002 dodds et al 2008 therefore managing the nitrogen cycle has been identified as one of the major challenges in various environmental systems galloway et al 2003 woodchip bioreactors have emerged as a viable management tool to reduce nitrate export from agricultural drainage urban stormwater and wastewaters schipper et al 2010 peterson et al 2015 lepine et al 2016 lopez ponnada et al 2017 woodchips are used in bioreactors to support the growth of denitrifying bacteria which can convert nitrate to inert nitrogen gas woodchips are widely available and inexpensive materials that can serve as a long persistent organic carbon source for the denitrification process the relatively large particle sizes and physical stability of woodchips allow high permeability such that woodchip bioreactors are well suited for nitrate removal in various sources christianson et al 2010 long term field experiences indicate that woodchip bioreactors can provide consistent nitrate removal for 5 to15 years with little maintenance required robertson et al 2000 schipper et al 2010 nitrate removal efficiencies of woodchip bioreactors can be affected by many factors including water temperatures influent nitrate concentrations hydraulic retention times and woodchip age addy et al 2016 understanding of nitrate removal kinetics is crucial for woodchip bioreactor design and application many field and laboratory woodchip denitrification studies showed that nitrate concentrations typically decreased linearly along the length of reactors suggesting zero order nitrate removal kinetics schipper et al 2005 robertson 2010 warneke et al 2011 a zero order denitrification kinetics indicates that nitrate removal rates in woodchip bioreactors do not change with influent nitrate concentrations other independent parameters such as the release rate of biodegradable organic substrates may control nitrate removal rates a number of studies also used a first order model to describe nitrate removal in woodchip bioreactors chun et al 2009 camilo et al 2013 moorman et al 2015 influent nitrate concentrations become an important factor that limits nitrate removal rates under the first order reaction scenario the variations in the observed woodchip denitrification reaction orders may be explained by a model of michaelis menten type enzyme kinetics schipper et al 2010 halaburka et al 2017 zhao et al 2018 according to the michaelis menten model nitrate removal follows zero order kinetics when nitrate concentrations are much higher than the half saturation constant and switches to first order kinetics when nitrate concentrations are much lower than the half saturation constant hua et al 2016 observed that nitrate removal in a laboratory column reactor followed zero order reaction rate constant k 1 42 mg n l h during the first 12 h and changed to first order reaction k 0 49 h 1 after 12 h when nitrate became limiting 3 3 mg n l hoover et al 2016 reported that nitrate reduction rates increased with influent nitrate concentrations and became saturated when nitrate increased to 30 50 mg n l although it has been recognized that woodchip denitrification generally obeys michaelis menten kinetics few studies have determined key parameters of this kinetic model for nitrate removal in woodchip bioreactors ghane et al 2015 used a forcheimer hydraulic model with michaelis menten kinetics to evaluate nitrate removal rates in a horizontal woodchip reactor bed the model results showed a half saturation constant km of 7 2 mg n l and a maximum removal rate vmax of 7 1 mg n l h this vmax value is equivalent to a load reduction rate of 144 8 g n m3 d which is substantially higher than the nitrate reduction rates 2 22 g n m3 d observed in field woodchip bioreactors schipper et al 2010 nordstrom and herbert 2017 reported vmax of 0 25 1 64 mg n l h and km of 2 3 10 6 mg n l for a series of column tests using a mixture of woodchips and activated sludge at 5 22 c the reported half saturation constants from both studies are somewhat higher than the expectations from several field and laboratory studies that showed nitrate limiting conditions did not occur until the concentrations were below approximately 1 3 mg n l roberston 2010 hua et al 2016 halaburka et al 2017 zhao et al 2018 most of the woodchip denitrification kinetics studies focused on the impact of operating parameters on nitrate removal few studies have evaluated the effect of woodchip quality on denitrification performance in bioreactors several studies have shown that woodchip ageing could reduce the efficiency of bioreactors over time due to the loss of available organic substrates robertson 2010 halaburka et al 2017 woodchip quality can also be changed by natural weathering processes during woodchip storage before bioreactor installation biological degradation of wood by bacteria and fungi during storage could modify chemical and physical properties of organic substrates derived from woodchips thereby affecting the denitrification performance of bioreactors however little is known about the impact of woodchip biodegradation before installation on nitrate removal in bioreactors it is clear that with increased applications of woodchip bioreactors for nitrate control a better understanding of nitrate removal kinetics is needed in order to improve the design and operation of woodchip bioreactors the objective of this study was to determine michaelis menten kinetics model parameters for nitrate removal in bioreactors using the fresh aged and composted woodchips this study focused on the modelling analysis of the effect of woodchip quality and pre treatment on nitrate removal kinetics in bioreactors the aged woodchips were produced by operating a bioreactor for 12 months under saturated hydraulic conditions and the composted woodchips were produced by composting woodchips with soil and moisture for three months to simulate the biological degradation of wood during storage laboratory column bioreactors filled with different woodchips were operated under a wide range of influent nitrate concentrations and temperatures to generate sufficient experimental data to determine nitrate removal kinetics model parameters 2 materials and methods 2 1 woodchips and column reactors woodchips made from cottonwood populus deltoids were obtained from a playground woodchip distributor in sioux falls south dakota the distributor receives woodchips produced from south dakota and minnesota after collection in the spring season woodchips larger than 6 cm were removed manually and woodchips smaller than 4 mm were removed by sieving the woodchips were then gently washed with distilled water to remove dirt and floating fine particles and air dried before use the size distribution of processed woodchips was 0 4 1 cm 11 1 3 cm 53 and 3 6 cm 36 and these woodchips were referred to as the fresh woodchips in this study an up flow column reactor filled with the fresh woodchips was operated at room temperature 22 c and a hydraulic retention time of 12 h for 12 months the column reactor was fed with an artificial runoff solution table s1 that contains nitrate of 50 mg n l after 12 months the reactor effluent dissolved organic carbon concentrations were below 2 mg l the woodchips in the bioreactor after 12 month operation was defined as the aged woodchips a composting process with soil and moisture was used to treat the fresh woodchips and produce the composted woodchips the composting experiments were conducted in 5 gallon plastic buckets approximately 2 5 kg woodchips were mixed with 1 5 kg soil in each bucket the soil sample was collected from the south dakota state university research farm in volga sd each bucket was capped and placed at an open space outside crothers engineering hall at south dakota state university brookings sd a 500 ml of water was added to each bucket weekly to maintain moisture during the composting process the composting experiment were conducted from june to august with daily average temperatures varied between 13 6 and 26 8 c figure s1 shows pictures of the three woodchips used for this study three clear acrylic tubes with a length of 1 2 meters and inside diameter of 8 85 cm were used to construct up flow column reactors each reactor had 12 sampling ports installed along the length of the column at 10 cm intervals approximately 1840 g of each type of woodchips were added to each reactor resulting in an average packing density of 0 25 g cm3 distilled water was added to each column to soak the woodchips for 48 h before the determination of reactor porosity drainable porosity was determined by draining each reactor over 1 h and the resulting porosities were 49 9 49 7 and 44 1 respectively for the fresh aged and composted woodchip bioreactors 2 2 reactor hydraulic retention times hrt after the porosity tests distilled water was pumped to the fresh aged and composted woodchip reactors at flow rates of 5 1 5 1 and 4 5 ml min respectively the flow travel time through each section between two sampling ports was determined based on the rising water level and recorded using a stopwatch the resulting flow travel times of the 36 sampling sections of the three reactors were within a range of 1 0 05 h which were very close to the theoretical flow travel time of 1 h this indicates that the woodchips were well mixed and evenly packed in each column reactor it was determined that theoretical hrts based on drainable porosities were adequate to describe the flow travel times through the column reactors and were used as the reaction times in the calculation of nitrate removal rates in each sampling section 2 3 column reactor experimental conditions variable speed peristaltic pumps masterflex model l s cole parmer vernon hills il were used to pump an artificial runoff water from an influent tank to the column reactors during this study the artificial runoff water was prepared based on a previously published method hua et al 2016 and it was composed of various ionic constituents and trace minerals table s1 to ensure that microbial growth was not limited kno3 was added to the artificial runoff water to achieve different influent nitrate concentrations for the column experiments a gas diffuser was installed at the bottom of the influent tank to continuously bubble nitrogen gas to reduce the dissolved oxygen do concentrations below 3 0 mg l this was done to minimize the potential impact of influent do on the denitrification process all three column rectors were operated at an influent nitrate concentration of 50 mg n l and an hrt of 12 h under room temperature 22 c for 1 month to achieve steady state nitrate removal conditions it was observed that daily variations in reactor effluent nitrate were less than 10 under the steady state conditions after that nitrate removal kinetics experiments were conducted by varying influent nitrate concentrations in the sequence of 50 40 30 20 10 5 and 3 mg n l at an hrt of 12 h the column reactors were operated for 7 days at each concentration the first 4 days were used as the stabilization period to ensure that steady state removal was reached for each concentration and the last 3 days were used as the sampling period two sampling events were conducted during each sampling day and samples were taken at each sample port along the length of the column six replicates were obtained for each sample port at each influent concentration in addition to the 12 h hrt experiments the fresh and composted woodchip bioreactors were also operated at hrts of 24 and 6 h and an influent concentration of 10 mg n l to evaluate the impact of flow variations on reactor performance same sampling procedures were used during the variable hrt experiments after the completion of the above mentioned experiments at 22 c the fresh and composted woodchip bioreactors were moved into a cool room with a controlled temperature of 5 c the two column reactors were allowed to stabilize the nitrate removal efficiency for 1 month at an influent concentration of 50 mg n l and an hrt of 12 h in the cool room the variation in nitrate removal during the one month stabilization period was less than 15 then nitrate removal kinetics experiments at 5 c were conducted by varying influent nitrate concentrations in the sequence of 50 40 30 20 10 5 and 3 mg l samples were taken based on the same procedures used during the room temperature experiments during each sampling event a 40 ml sample was collected at each sampling port following a sequence of the topmost sample port to the bottom sample port the collected samples were filtered using 0 45 μm membrane filters milliporesigma burlington ma and then stored at 4 c before analysis of nitrate and nitrite dissolved organic carbon doc concentrations were also measured for reactor effluent samples after filtration by 0 45 μm membrane filters weekly samples were taken from the influent tank to measure do concentrations 2 4 analytical methods all solutions used in this study were prepared with ultrapure water 18 mω cm produced by a barnstead nanopure system thermo fisher waltham ma the influent solutions were adjusted to ph 7 using sodium hydroxide or sulfuric acid solutions the chemicals used in this study were of american chemical society reagent grade and were purchased from sigma aldrich st luis mo nitrate and nitrite ions

measured using an ysi proobod probe ysi inc yellow springs oh after the bioreactor experiments woodchips from the fresh and composted woodchip bioreactors were air dried under room temperature

model parameters denitrifying bacteria in woodchip bioreactors remove nitrate through a respiration reaction that uses nitrate as an electron acceptor and organic carbon as an electron donor a dual

saturation constant for nitrate mg n l organic carbon released from woodchips is a complex mixture of heterogeneous organic compounds and only a fraction of the doc is biodegradable therefore it is a challenge to implement this dual substrate model to predict nitrate removal rates during this study each nitrate removal kinetics experiment was conducted under short term steady state conditions to limit doc variations we assume that the release rates of biodegradable organic carbon from woodchips remain relatively stable during each kinetics experiment thus a simplified single substrate

the average nitrate concentration ci of the 6 replicates of each sampling port during the nitrate removal kinetics experiments was used as substrate concentration si for the lineweaver burk plot the

considering the generally slow nitrate reduction rates by woodchips the spatial sampling time interval of 1 h was determined to be sufficient to produce nitrate removal rates that approximate the instantaneous rates linear regression analysis was used to determine vmax and km from the lineweaver burk plot 2 6 denitrification temperature coefficient the vmax values obtained at temperatures of 5 and 22 c were used to determine the q10 temperature coefficient for nitrate removal by the following equation 5 q 10 r 2 r 1 10 c t 2 t 1 where r1 and r2 are the vmax values at temperatures t1 5 c and t2 22 c respectively 2 7 statistical analysis statistical analysis was conducted using the one way anova with post hoc tukey hsd tests to compare the nitrate removal of different reactors the rstudio version 1 2 was used for the statistical tests 3 results and discussion 3 1 nitrate removal rates of woodchip column reactors fig 1 presents the nitrate concentration profiles along the length of columns for selected influent concentrations at an hrt of 12 h and a temperature of 22 c all three bioreactors exhibited linear nitrate reductions with increasing flow travel time when the influent concentrations were 50 and 30 mg n l suggesting that the denitrification process was not largely limited by nitrate for the entire concentration range 7 2 50 mg n l observed in the column reactors the average nitrate removal percentages were 19 6 7 1 and 47 6 for the fresh aged and composted woodchip reactors when the influent concentration was 50 mg n l the corresponding removal percentages increased to 32 4 10 4 and 76 1 at an influent concentration of 30 mg n l the composted woodchips showed higher nitrate removal capacity than the fresh woodchips which performed better than the aged woodchips when the influent nitrate concentration decreased to 10 mg n l the fresh and aged woodchip reactors steadily reduced nitrate to 2 6 and 7 5 mg n l after 12 h and no apparent nitrate limiting condition was observed however the composted woodchip reactor changed from linear reduction zero order to non linear reduction first order at approximately 3 mg n l likely due to its high nitrate removal rates all three reactors demonstrated curvilinear relationships between nitrate reduction and flow travel time for an influent concentration of 3 mg n l indicating that nitrate limiting condition occurred in all three bioreactors fig 2 shows the nitrate concentration profiles in the fresh and composted woodchip reactors for selected influent concentrations at an hrt of 12 h and a temperature of 5 c as expected denitrification in the two reactors was substantially inhibited at this low temperature for example the removal percentages were only 1 1 and 5 9 for the fresh and composted woodchip reactors at an influent concentration of 50 mg n l and the removal percentages increased to 1 7 and 9 5 at an influent concentration of 30 mg n l at 5 c the fresh woodchip reactor exhibited linear nitrate reduction for the entire concentration range of 2 5 50 mg l shown in fig 2 curvilinear relationship between nitrate reduction and flow travel time was observed for the composted woodchip reactor at an influent concentration of 3 mg n l however the degree of curve is much smaller compared to the experiments at 22 c suggesting reduced nitrate removal rates at 5 c table 1 presents the nitrate load reduction rates using the unit of g n m3 bioreactor volume d for the three column reactors the nitrate load reduction rates were 8 81 21 0 7 36 9 78 and 2 46 3 54 g n m3 d respectively for the composted fresh and aged woodchip bioreactors for influent concentrations of 10 50 mg n l at 22 c these nitrate load reductions fall well in the range 2 22 g n m3 d that has been observed for field bioreactors schipper et al 2010 statistical test results showed that the denitrification capacities of the three column reactors were significantly different p 0 05 and were in the order of composted woodchips fresh woodchips aged woodchips the nitrate load reduction rates of the composted woodchips were 1 20 2 15 times higher than that of the fresh woodchips which were 2 76 3 37 times higher than that of the aged woodchips influent nitrate concentrations also had an impact on the nitrate load reduction rates variations in nitrate load reduction rates were less than 12 5 for the three column reactors when the influent concentration decreased from 50 to 30 mg n l when the influent concentration further declined to 10 mg n l all three reactors showed large decreases in nitrate load reduction rates and the decreases were 58 0 24 7 and 30 5 for the composted fresh and aged woodchips respectively compared to 50 mg n l the nitrate load reduction rates were 2 18 2 60 and 0 53 0 55 g n m3 d respectively for the composted and fresh woodchips for influent concentrations of 10 50 mg n l at 5 c compared to 22 c the nitrate load reduction rates decreased by 75 3 87 6 average 84 8 and 92 7 94 5 average 94 1 for composted and fresh woodchips at different nitrate concentrations this indicates that the composted woodchip bioreactor had a better tolerance to the low temperature compared to the fresh woodchip bioreactor as evidenced by the lower reductions in denitrification performance at 5 c 3 2 woodchip doc leaching and sem images the results of column reactor experiments suggest that denitrification capacity of woodchips decreased after woodchip aging but increased after woodchip composting reactor effluent doc concentrations were analyzed to evaluate whether organic substrate concentrations played a role in influencing nitrate removal among the three reactors and the results are shown in fig 3 the effluent doc concentrations of the fresh woodchip reactor varied between 7 1 and 8 9 mg l with an average of 8 0 mg l during the kinetics experiments at 22 c the doc concentrations were 5 5 7 4 mg l average 6 3 mg l and 1 4 1 9 mg l average 1 6 mg l for the composted and aged woodchip reactors under the same experimental conditions lower doc levels in the aged woodchip reactor are expected because of the 1 year operation under saturated hydraulic conditions before the kinetics experiments microbial utilization and doc leaching during the 1 year reactor operation gradually depleted available organic substrates from woodchips thereby leading to decreased nitrate load reduction rates in the aged woodchip bioreactor the narrow range of effluent doc variations 0 5 mg l during the nitrate removal kinetics experiments suggest that the doc leaching from the aged woodchips had reached a relatively steady state robertson 2010 compared nitrate removal of woodchips with varying age and the results showed that the nitrate removal rates of the 2 year old media and the 7 year old media were within 52 6 78 6 and 39 6 59 1 of the fresh woodchips in this study the aged woodchips exhibited nitrate load reductions that were 29 7 36 2 of that of the fresh woodchips therefore the nitrate load reduction rates observed in the aged woodchip reactor could represent the long term sustained denitrification performance of field bioreactors after several years of operation under intermittent flow conditions the composted woodchips exhibited higher nitrate load reduction rates than the fresh woodchips despite the lower doc levels found in the reactor effluents therefore the quantity of organic carbon in the rectors cannot explain the observed differences in nitrate removal between the two column reactors it is likely that the composting process before the bioreactor experiments modified the quality of wood materials such that more biodegradable organic compounds were produced to promote the denitrification reactions this demonstrates the importance of woodchip quality on nitrate removal in bioreactors other researchers have used external carbon sources and drying rewetting cycles to improve the carbon availability for nitrate removal in woodchip reactors roser et al 2018 maxwell et al 2019 the doc levels in the fresh and composted woodchip rectors declined to 1 2 1 5 mg l average 1 3 mg l and 0 7 1 0 mg l average 0 8 mg l respectively during the kinetics experiments at 5 c the average reactor effluent doc at 5 c decreased by 83 6 86 6 for the two reactors compared to 22 c it is clear that low temperatures could inhibit both microbial denitrification rates and woodchip doc leaching rates which resulted in overall lower nitrate removal in the column reactors fig 4 presents sem images of fresh and composted woodchips before and after the bioreactor experiments the surface of the fresh woodchip image a showed fresh open cell walls by tangential cut after the bioreactor experiments the surface of the aged woodchip clearly exhibited deterioration and degradation by water and bacteria image b water attack and biodegradation caused erosion of cell walls into adjacent areas localized cavitation on the wood surface is also evident from the sem image images c and d in fig 4 present the surface morphological information of the composted woodchips before and after the bioreactor experiments it is evident that fine soil particles were attached to the woodchip surface during the composting process and partially covered the wood surface which makes the cell wall structure illegible erosion cracks and cavitation were observed on the composted woodchip surface after the experiments some of the attached soil particles were not easily detached from the wood surface even after the bioreactor experiments wood is primarily composed of cellulose hemicellulose and lignin cellulose is a glucose polymer hemicellulose is a heteropolysaccharide polymer and lignin is a complex cross linked polymer with amorphous aromatic and heterogeneous structures andlar et al 2018 microbial utilization of woodchip organic substrates requires the production of soluble organic carbon by enzymatic hydrolysis first under anaerobic conditions cellulase enzymes are used by bacteria to break down the crystalline cellulose into smaller soluble oligosaccharides which can be metabolized by bacterial community in biofilm lynd et al 2002 compared to cellulose lignin is generally resistant to bacterial biodegradation and therefore it provides a protective barrier to enzymatic decomposition of cellulose in wood the soluble organic hydrolysis rate typically decreases over time because fewer cellulose sites are available for cellulase enzyme adsorption therefore the doc release from woodchip bioreactors generally follows the power law exponential decline over time abusallout and hua 2017 wood degrading fungi are the primary microorganisms responsible for lignincellulose degradation in nature andlar et al 2018 during the woodchip composting process in this study it was observed that fungi were widely distributed on the woodchip surface figure s2 the modification and removal of lignin by fungi will increase the enzyme access to hemicellulose and cellulose which is likely one of the key factors that led to increased denitrification potential of the composted woodchips under aerobic conditions fungi are also effective at depolymerizing hemicellulose and cellulose to produce monomers and other smaller units which can also help improve the biodegradability of organic substrates moreover fungi and bacteria degradation of woodchips during composting would also cause surface erosions with depressions channels and honeycomb patterns which can create more surface areas for biofilm growth these factors together may have contributed to the increased woodchip denitrification efficiency after composting 3 3 nitrate removal michaelis menten kinetics parameters fig 5 uses the fresh woodchip bioreactor as an example to illustrate the application of lineweaver burk plot to process the nitrate removal experimental data the high linear regression coefficient r2 suggests that the denitrification process in the bioreactor can be sufficiently described by the michaelis menten model after the model parameters vmax and km were obtained from the slope km vmax and intercept 1 vmax of the lineweaver burk plot the developed michaelis menten model was then used to predict the nitrate removal rates of the bioreactor at different nitrate concentrations fig 6 presents a comparison of nitrate removal rates obtained from the model prediction and the experimental data it is evident that the model results closely tracked the experimental results table 2 summarizes the michaelis menten model parameters for the three woodchip bioreactors the model vmax values at 22 c were 2 09 0 88 and 0 30 mg n l h for the composted fresh and aged woodchips respectively the maximum removal rate of the composted woodchips was 2 4 times higher than that of the fresh woodchips which was again 2 9 times higher than that of the aged woodchips these results quantitatively agree with the analysis of nitrate load reductions of the three bioreactors shown in table 1 despite the large differences in the maximum removal rates the three bioreactors exhibited similar half saturation constants the km values at 22 c were 2 60 2 16 and 2 01 mg n l for the composted fresh and aged woodchips respectively it seems that woodchips that had high maximum nitrate removal rates also exhibited relatively high half saturation constants both vmax and km values declined under the cold temperature of 5 c the vmax values decreased to 0 26 and 0 05 mg n l h for the composted and fresh woodchips which correspond to 87 6 and 94 3 reductions compared to 22 c these results confirm that low temperature of 5 c substantially inhibited biological denitrification activities in the woodchip bioreactors and that the composted woodchips showed better resistance to the cold temperature the better performance of the composted woodchip bioreactor at 5 c may be attributed to lignincellulose fungi degradation production of biodegradable organic substrates and surface modification during the composting process the cold temperature of 5 c also decreased km values to 1 74 and 1 19 mg l respectively for composted and fresh woodchips the model coefficients r2 of different bioreactors varied between 0 970 and 0 993 suggesting that the nitrate removal data obtained from this study fit the michaelis menten model well the michaelis menten km values obtained at 22 c predict that the nitrate removal by the three woodchip bioreactors follows a zero order reaction when the nitrate concentration is much higher than 2 01 2 60 mg n l a switch from a zero order reaction to a mixed order reaction occurs when the nitrate concentration is similar to 2 01 2 60 mg n l the denitrification reaction becomes a first order reaction when the nitrate concentration is much lower than 2 01 2 60 mg n l these model results can be used to analyze nitrate removal kinetics in woodchip bioreactors for various applications nitrate concentrations in agricultural subsurface drainage and some wastewater sources such as aquaculture wastewater are typically higher than 10 mg n l fausey et al 1995 lepine et al 2016 therefore nitrate removal in woodchip bioreactors for subsurface drainage and wastewater treatment can be operationally defined as a zero order reaction nitrate is not a major limiting factor under such conditions it is possible that cellulose enzymatic and abiotic hydrolysis and subsequent metabolism of oligosaccharides are the limiting factors controlling the denitrification rate when nitrate is present at relatively high concentrations for urban stormwater with relatively low nitrate concentrations e g 10 mg n l mixed order and first order reactions may be observed during woodchip denitrification the km values of the bioreactors reduced to 1 19 1 74 mg l when the temperature decreased to 5 c suggesting that the reduced biological activities at 5 c decreased the half saturation constant for nitrate removal at such a low temperature nitrate removal in most woodchip bioreactors would follow a zero order reaction with reduced rate constants the composted and fresh woodchip bioreactors showed q10 values of 3 4 and 5 4 respectively these two values translate to 3 4 fold and 5 4 fold increases in nitrate removal rates for every 10 c increase in temperature the fresh woodchips exhibited a higher temperature dependence in nitrate removal than the composted woodchips similar q10 values in the range of 4 4 4 7 have been reported for column experiments under controlled laboratory conditions schmidt and clark 2013 halaburka et al 2019 however lower q10 values 1 4 1 7 have also been reported in field woodchip bioreactors cameron and schipper 2010 the q10 variability for woodchip denitrification may be attributed to differences in treatment systems field and laboratory experimental conditions and temperature ranges 3 4 hrt impacts on nitrate removal and nitrite accumulation fig 7 presents the impacts of hrt on the denitrification performance of the fresh and composted woodchip bioreactors for an influent concentration of 10 mg n l the average removal percentages were 98 7 73 7 and 35 7 respectively for 24 12 and 6 h hrts by the fresh woodchip bioreactor the nitrate load reduction rates by the fresh woodchip bioreactor were 4 93 7 36 and 7 14 g n m3 d for 24 12 and 6 h hrts similar nitrate load reductions were achieved by 12 and 6 h hrts the relatively low nitrate load reduction at a 24 h hrt can be attributed to the switch of a zero order reaction to a first order reaction along the length of the reactor unlike the fresh woodchip bioreactor near complete removal of nitrate was observed for the composted woodchip bioreactor under all three hrts therefore an hrt of 6 h is adequate for the composted woodchips to completely remove nitrate for an influent concentration of 10 mg n l this further demonstrates that the composted woodchips are much more efficient denitrifying media than the fresh woodchips denitrification is a microbial process that involves the reduction of nitrate through the intermediate nitrite to nitrogen gas nitrite concentration profiles along the length of the reactors were analyzed to evaluate the nitrite accumulation in the fresh and composted woodchip bioreactors for both reactors operated at 24 h hrt nitrite gradually increased with increasing reaction time and reached a peak concentration when nitrate reduced to a certain level and after that nitrite gradually declined similar nitrite profile was also observed for the composted woodchip bioreactor operated at 12 and 6 h hrts and the final effluent nitrite was 0 for all three hrt conditions peak nitrite concentrations in the composted woodchip bioreactor were 0 53 0 66 and 0 72 mg n l when nitrate reduced to 4 86 5 66 and 3 32 mg n l for the three hrts these peak nitrite concentrations accounted for 10 3 15 2 of the reduced nitrate for the fresh woodchip bioreactor operated at 24 h hrt nitrite reached a peak concentration of 0 68 mg n l when nitrate reduced to 2 18 mg n l this peak nitrite concentration amounted to 8 70 of the reduced nitrate when the hrt decreased to 12 and 6 h nitrite gradually increased with increasing flow travel time and no nitrite decline phase was observed the final effluent nitrite concentration of the fresh woodchip bioreactor was 0 22 1 17 and 0 65 mg n l for 24 12 and 6 h hrts the nitrate and nitrite concentration profiles reflect the difference between the nitrate and nitrite reduction rates at different substrate concentrations nitrite accumulation occurs when the nitrate reduction rate is higher than the nitrite reduction rate and reaches a peak when the nitrate reduction rate is equal to the nitrite reduction rate after that the nitrite reduction rate overtakes the nitrate reduction rate leading to the nitrite declining phase the results in fig 7 indicate that nitrate would need to decrease to below approximately 2 2 mg n l before nitrite could decline for the fresh woodchip bioreactor for the composted woodchip bioreactor nitrate would need to decrease to below approximately 3 3 5 7 mg n l to level off nitrite accumulation and reduce nitrite in the reactor effluent these results suggest that nitrite reduction in the bioreactors occurred only after nitrate become limiting in the bioreactors nitrite reduction rates rnitrite reduction can be calculated from the difference between nitrate reduction rates rnitrate reduction and nitrite accumulation rates rnitrite accumulation using the following equation rnitrite reduction rnitrate reduction rnitrite accumulation the nitrate and nitrite concentration profiles of the bioreactors operated at 12 h hrt were used to determine the nitrite reduction rates the linear regression was used to model nitrate and nitrite data in the time range of 0 6 h for the fresh woodchip reactor and 0 2 h for the composted woodchip reactor to obtain the reaction rates the resulting rnitrate reduction and rnitrite accumulation values were 0 57 and 0 10 mg n l h for the fresh woodchips and 1 41 and 0 28 mg n l h for the composted woodchips r2 0 981 1 the calculated nitrite reduction rate rnitrite reduction was 0 47 and 1 13 mg n l h respectively for the fresh and composted woodchip bioreactors the nitrite reduction rates were 82 5 and 80 1 of the respective nitrate reduction rates for the two bioreactors the comparable nitrate and nitrite reduction rates obtained from this study support the observation that nitrite accumulation is generally not high in field bioreactors however the fresh woodchip bioreactor produced an effluent with nitrite exceeding us environmental protection agency drinking water standard 1 mg n l at an hrt of 12 h therefore nitrite should be evaluated during woodchip bioreactor design and operation to avoid high nitrite levels in reactor effluents 3 5 implications on woodchip denitrification applications woodchip bioreactors have been employed to remove nitrate in various sources for more than two decades blowes et al 1994 however there are still uncertainties about kinetic parameters vmax and km of michaelis menten model for nitrate removal in woodchip bioreactors the results of this study suggest that the use of a zero order reaction model is adequate to design woodchip bioreactors for treating agricultural subsurface drainage and wastewaters that contain nitrate much higher than the km values based on the nitrate removal rates observed in this study and several other studies robertson 2010 hua et al 2016 nordstrom and herbert 2017 we propose the following nitrate removal rates as general guidelines to facilitate the design and evaluation of woodchip bioreactors for new woodchip bioreactors nitrate removal rates of 1 1 5 mg n l h and 0 1 0 3 mg n l h can be used for reactor design under warm 22 c and cold 5 c seasons these rates are equivalent to nitrate load reduction rates of 16 8 25 2 g n m3 d at 22 c and 1 68 5 04 g n m3 d at 5 c when a typical field woodchip bioreactor porosity of 0 7 is used for woodchip bioreactors that have been used for several years in the field a nitrate removal rate of 0 3 mg n l h can be used for reactor analysis the results of this study showed that microbial degradation of woodchips during the composting process led to more than doubled nitrate removal rates compared to fresh woodchips therefore microbial degradation of woodchips before bioreactor installation could be a practical and low cost management tool to enhance the denitrification performance of woodchip bioreactors this pre installation management strategy can be realized through the storage of woodchips under natural conditions natural rain or artificial water spray and certain soil amendment could create the required moister content and microorganism community for the wood degradation therefore we recommend that woodchips should be stored in an outdoor environment for several weeks to months before the bioreactor installation certainly long term laboratory and field studies are needed to evaluate the longevity of the effect of woodchip composting on nitrate removal this study indicates that the quality of doc leached from woodchips can have a significant impact on nitrate removal rates more studies are needed to determine the biodegradability of woodchip doc and the release rates of biodegradable organic carbon from woodchips to better understand nitrate removal kinetics in bioreactors 4 conclusions this study was conducted to determine the nitrate removal kinetics parameters in denitrification bioreactors using the fresh aged and composted woodchips the results showed that denitrification efficiency followed the order of composted woodchips fresh woodchips aged woodchips the average nitrate load reduction rates were 8 81 21 0 7 36 9 78 and 2 46 3 54 g n m3 d for the composted fresh and aged woodchips at influent nitrate concentrations of 10 50 mg n l an hrt of 12 h and 22 c the composted woodchips exhibited denitrification capacities that were 1 20 2 15 times higher than that of the fresh woodchips at 22 c the nitrate load reduction rates decreased to 2 18 2 60 and 0 53 0 55 g n m3 d for the composted and fresh woodchip bioreactors operated at 5 c woodchip

bioreactor produced an effluent with nitrite exceeding drinking water standard 1 mg n l at an influent nitrate of 10 mg n l and an hrt of 12 h nitrite should be evaluated during woodchip bioreactor

17099,woodchip bioreactors have emerged as a viable water management tool to reduce nitrate contamination from agricultural subsurface drainage wastewater and stormwater understanding of denitrification kinetics is critical to the design and application of field woodchip bioreactors the denitrification process in woodchip bioreactors generally obeys a model of michaelis menten type enzyme kinetics the objective of this study was to determine michaelis menten model parameters for nitrate removal in laboratory bioreactors using the fresh composted and aged woodchips the results showed that the maximum nitrate removal rates vmax were 2 09 0 88 and 0 30 mg n l h and the half saturation constants km were 2 60 2 16 and 2 01 mg n l for the composted fresh and aged woodchip bioreactors at 22 c the vmax values decreased to 0 26 and 0 05 mg n l h and the km values decreased to 1 74 and 1 19 mg n l when the composted and fresh woodchip bioreactors were operated at 5 c denitrification in woodchip bioreactors can be operationally defined as a zero order reaction when treating contaminated water with nitrate much higher than the km values the nitrate removal

enhance denitrification performance of bioreactors graphic abstract image graphical abstract keywords woodchips bioreactors denitrification kinetics nitrate removal composting 1 introduction nitrate is an important contaminant in aquatic ecosystems worldwide excessive export of nitrate from anthropogenic activities can accelerate the rate and extent of eutrophication in surface waters which can lead to significant detrimental effects on water resources and public health anderson et al 2002 dodds et al 2008 therefore managing the nitrogen cycle has been identified as one of the major challenges in various environmental systems galloway et al 2003 woodchip bioreactors have emerged as a viable management tool to reduce nitrate export from agricultural drainage urban stormwater and wastewaters schipper et al 2010 peterson et al 2015 lepine et al 2016 lopez ponnada et al 2017 woodchips are used in bioreactors to support the growth of denitrifying bacteria which can convert nitrate to inert nitrogen gas woodchips are widely available and inexpensive materials that can serve as a long persistent organic carbon source for the denitrification process the relatively large particle sizes and physical stability of woodchips allow high permeability such that woodchip bioreactors are well suited for nitrate removal in various sources christianson et al 2010 long term field experiences indicate that woodchip bioreactors can provide consistent nitrate removal for 5 to15 years with little maintenance required robertson et al 2000 schipper et al 2010 nitrate removal efficiencies of woodchip bioreactors can be affected by many factors including water temperatures influent nitrate concentrations hydraulic retention times and woodchip age addy et al 2016 understanding of nitrate removal kinetics is crucial for woodchip bioreactor design and application many field and laboratory woodchip denitrification studies showed that nitrate concentrations typically decreased linearly along the length of reactors suggesting zero order nitrate removal kinetics schipper et al 2005 robertson 2010 warneke et al 2011 a zero order denitrification kinetics indicates that nitrate removal rates in woodchip bioreactors do not change with influent nitrate concentrations other independent parameters such as the release rate of biodegradable organic substrates may control nitrate removal rates a number of studies also used a first order model to describe nitrate removal in woodchip bioreactors chun et al 2009 camilo et al 2013 moorman et al 2015 influent nitrate concentrations become an important factor that limits nitrate removal rates under the first order reaction scenario the variations in the observed woodchip denitrification reaction orders may be explained by a model of michaelis menten type enzyme kinetics schipper et al 2010 halaburka et al 2017 zhao et al 2018 according to the michaelis menten model nitrate removal follows zero order kinetics when nitrate concentrations are much higher than the half saturation constant and switches to first order kinetics when nitrate concentrations are much lower than the half saturation constant hua et al 2016 observed that nitrate removal in a laboratory column reactor followed zero order reaction rate constant k 1 42 mg n l h during the first 12 h and changed to first order reaction k 0 49 h 1 after 12 h when nitrate became limiting 3 3 mg n l hoover et al 2016 reported that nitrate reduction rates increased with influent nitrate concentrations and became saturated when nitrate increased to 30 50 mg n l although it has been recognized that woodchip denitrification generally obeys michaelis menten kinetics few studies have determined key parameters of this kinetic model for nitrate removal in woodchip bioreactors ghane et al 2015 used a forcheimer hydraulic model with michaelis menten kinetics to evaluate nitrate removal rates in a horizontal woodchip reactor bed the model results showed a half saturation constant km of 7 2 mg n l and a maximum removal rate vmax of 7 1 mg n l h this vmax value is equivalent to a load reduction rate of 144 8 g n m3 d which is substantially higher than the nitrate reduction rates 2 22 g n m3 d observed in field woodchip bioreactors schipper et al 2010 nordstrom and herbert 2017 reported vmax of 0 25 1 64 mg n l h and km of 2 3 10 6 mg n l for a series of column tests using a mixture of woodchips and activated sludge at 5 22 c the reported half saturation constants from both studies are somewhat higher than the expectations from several field and laboratory studies that showed nitrate limiting conditions did not occur until the concentrations were below approximately 1 3 mg n l roberston 2010 hua et al 2016 halaburka et al 2017 zhao et al 2018 most of the woodchip denitrification kinetics studies focused on the impact of operating parameters on nitrate removal few studies have evaluated the effect of woodchip quality on denitrification performance in bioreactors several studies have shown that woodchip ageing could reduce the efficiency of bioreactors over time due to the loss of available organic substrates robertson 2010 halaburka et al 2017 woodchip quality can also be changed by natural weathering processes during woodchip storage before bioreactor installation biological degradation of wood by bacteria and fungi during storage could modify chemical and physical properties of organic substrates derived from woodchips thereby affecting the denitrification performance of bioreactors however little is known about the impact of woodchip biodegradation before installation on nitrate removal in bioreactors it is clear that with increased applications of woodchip bioreactors for nitrate control a better understanding of nitrate removal kinetics is needed in order to improve the design and operation of woodchip bioreactors the objective of this study was to determine michaelis menten kinetics model parameters for nitrate removal in bioreactors using the fresh aged and composted woodchips this study focused on the modelling analysis of the effect of woodchip quality and pre treatment on nitrate removal kinetics in bioreactors the aged woodchips were produced by operating a bioreactor for 12 months under saturated hydraulic conditions and the composted woodchips were produced by composting woodchips with soil and moisture for three months to simulate the biological degradation of wood during storage laboratory column bioreactors filled with different woodchips were operated under a wide range of influent nitrate concentrations and temperatures to generate sufficient experimental data to determine nitrate removal kinetics model parameters 2 materials and methods 2 1 woodchips and column reactors woodchips made from cottonwood populus deltoids were obtained from a playground woodchip distributor in sioux falls south dakota the distributor receives woodchips produced from south dakota and minnesota after collection in the spring season woodchips larger than 6 cm were removed manually and woodchips smaller than 4 mm were removed by sieving the woodchips were then gently washed with distilled water to remove dirt and floating fine particles and air dried before use the size distribution of processed woodchips was 0 4 1 cm 11 1 3 cm 53 and 3 6 cm 36 and these woodchips were referred to as the fresh woodchips in this study an up flow column reactor filled with the fresh woodchips was operated at room temperature 22 c and a hydraulic retention time of 12 h for 12 months the column reactor was fed with an artificial runoff solution table s1 that contains nitrate of 50 mg n l after 12 months the reactor effluent dissolved organic carbon concentrations were below 2 mg l the woodchips in the bioreactor after 12 month operation was defined as the aged woodchips a composting process with soil and moisture was used to treat the fresh woodchips and produce the composted woodchips the composting experiments were conducted in 5 gallon plastic buckets approximately 2 5 kg woodchips were mixed with 1 5 kg soil in each bucket the soil sample was collected from the south dakota state university research farm in volga sd each bucket was capped and placed at an open space outside crothers engineering hall at south dakota state university brookings sd a 500 ml of water was added to each bucket weekly to maintain moisture during the composting process the composting experiment were conducted from june to august with daily average temperatures varied between 13 6 and 26 8 c figure s1 shows pictures of the three woodchips used for this study three clear acrylic tubes with a length of 1 2 meters and inside diameter of 8 85 cm were used to construct up flow column reactors each reactor had 12 sampling ports installed along the length of the column at 10 cm intervals approximately 1840 g of each type of woodchips were added to each reactor resulting in an average packing density of 0 25 g cm3 distilled water was added to each column to soak the woodchips for 48 h before the determination of reactor porosity drainable porosity was determined by draining each reactor over 1 h and the resulting porosities were 49 9 49 7 and 44 1 respectively for the fresh aged and composted woodchip bioreactors 2 2 reactor hydraulic retention times hrt after the porosity tests distilled water was pumped to the fresh aged and composted woodchip reactors at flow rates of 5 1 5 1 and 4 5 ml min respectively the flow travel time through each section between two sampling ports was determined based on the rising water level and recorded using a stopwatch the resulting flow travel times of the 36 sampling sections of the three reactors were within a range of 1 0 05 h which were very close to the theoretical flow travel time of 1 h this indicates that the woodchips were well mixed and evenly packed in each column reactor it was determined that theoretical hrts based on drainable porosities were adequate to describe the flow travel times through the column reactors and were used as the reaction times in the calculation of nitrate removal rates in each sampling section 2 3 column reactor experimental conditions variable speed peristaltic pumps masterflex model l s cole parmer vernon hills il were used to pump an artificial runoff water from an influent tank to the column reactors during this study the artificial runoff water was prepared based on a previously published method hua et al 2016 and it was composed of various ionic constituents and trace minerals table s1 to ensure that microbial growth was not limited kno3 was added to the artificial runoff water to achieve different influent nitrate concentrations for the column experiments a gas diffuser was installed at the bottom of the influent tank to continuously bubble nitrogen gas to reduce the dissolved oxygen do concentrations below 3 0 mg l this was done to minimize the potential impact of influent do on the denitrification process all three column rectors were operated at an influent nitrate concentration of 50 mg n l and an hrt of 12 h under room temperature 22 c for 1 month to achieve steady state nitrate removal conditions it was observed that daily variations in reactor effluent nitrate were less than 10 under the steady state conditions after that nitrate removal kinetics experiments were conducted by varying influent nitrate concentrations in the sequence of 50 40 30 20 10 5 and 3 mg n l at an hrt of 12 h the column reactors were operated for 7 days at each concentration the first 4 days were used as the stabilization period to ensure that steady state removal was reached for each concentration and the last 3 days were used as the sampling period two sampling events were conducted during each sampling day and samples were taken at each sample port along the length of the column six replicates were obtained for each sample port at each influent concentration in addition to the 12 h hrt experiments the fresh and composted woodchip bioreactors were also operated at hrts of 24 and 6 h and an influent concentration of 10 mg n l to evaluate the impact of flow variations on reactor performance same sampling procedures were used during the variable hrt experiments after the completion of the above mentioned experiments at 22 c the fresh and composted woodchip bioreactors were moved into a cool room with a controlled temperature of 5 c the two column reactors were allowed to stabilize the nitrate removal efficiency for 1 month at an influent concentration of 50 mg n l and an hrt of 12 h in the cool room the variation in nitrate removal during the one month stabilization period was less than 15 then nitrate removal kinetics experiments at 5 c were conducted by varying influent nitrate concentrations in the sequence of 50 40 30 20 10 5 and 3 mg l samples were taken based on the same procedures used during the room temperature experiments during each sampling event a 40 ml sample was collected at each sampling port following a sequence of the topmost sample port to the bottom sample port the collected samples were filtered using 0 45 μm membrane filters milliporesigma burlington ma and then stored at 4 c before analysis of nitrate and nitrite dissolved organic carbon doc concentrations were also measured for reactor effluent samples after filtration by 0 45 μm membrane filters weekly samples were taken from the influent tank to measure do concentrations 2 4 analytical methods all solutions used in this study were prepared with ultrapure water 18 mω cm produced by a barnstead nanopure system thermo fisher waltham ma the influent solutions were adjusted to ph 7 using sodium hydroxide or sulfuric acid solutions the chemicals used in this study were of american chemical society reagent grade and were purchased from sigma aldrich st luis mo nitrate and nitrite ions

measured using an ysi proobod probe ysi inc yellow springs oh after the bioreactor experiments woodchips from the fresh and composted woodchip bioreactors were air dried under room temperature woodchip samples before and after the experiments were collected for surface characterization by a scanning electron microscope sem equipment model hitachi s 3400n santa clara ca 2 5 michaelis menten model parameters denitrifying bacteria in woodchip bioreactors remove nitrate through a respiration reaction that uses nitrate as an electron acceptor and organic carbon as an electron donor a dual substrate michaelis menten model can be used to describe nitrate removal rates in woodchip bioreactors halaburka et al 2017 1 v i v m a x c j k c c j n i k n n i where vi is the nitrate removal rate mg n l h vmax is the maximum removal rate mg n l h cj is the concentration of doc mg c l kc is the half saturation constant for doc mg c l ni is the concentration of nitrate mg n l and kn is the half saturation constant for nitrate mg n l organic carbon released from woodchips is a complex mixture of heterogeneous organic compounds and only a fraction of the doc is biodegradable therefore it is a challenge to implement this dual substrate model to predict nitrate removal rates during this study each nitrate removal kinetics experiment was conducted under short term steady state conditions to limit doc variations we assume that the release rates of biodegradable organic carbon from woodchips remain relatively stable during each kinetics experiment thus a simplified single substrate

considering the generally slow nitrate reduction rates by woodchips the spatial sampling time interval of 1 h was determined to be sufficient to produce nitrate removal rates that approximate the instantaneous rates linear regression analysis was used to determine vmax and km from the lineweaver burk plot 2 6 denitrification temperature coefficient the vmax values obtained at temperatures of 5 and 22 c were used to determine the q10 temperature coefficient for nitrate removal by the following equation 5 q 10 r 2 r 1 10 c t 2 t 1 where r1 and r2 are the vmax values at temperatures t1 5 c and t2 22 c respectively 2 7 statistical analysis statistical analysis was conducted using the one way anova with post hoc tukey hsd tests to compare the nitrate removal of different reactors the rstudio version 1 2 was used for the statistical tests 3 results and discussion 3 1 nitrate removal rates of woodchip column reactors fig 1 presents the nitrate concentration profiles along the length of columns for selected influent concentrations at an hrt of 12 h and a temperature of 22 c all three bioreactors exhibited linear nitrate reductions with increasing flow travel time when the influent concentrations were 50 and 30 mg n l suggesting that the denitrification process was not largely limited by nitrate for the entire concentration range 7 2 50 mg n l observed in the column reactors the average nitrate removal percentages were 19 6 7 1 and 47 6 for the fresh aged and composted woodchip reactors when the influent concentration was 50 mg n l the corresponding removal percentages increased to 32 4 10 4 and 76 1 at an influent concentration of 30 mg n l the composted woodchips showed higher nitrate removal capacity than the fresh woodchips which performed better than the aged woodchips when the influent nitrate concentration decreased to 10 mg n l the fresh and aged woodchip reactors steadily reduced nitrate to 2 6 and 7 5 mg n l after 12 h and no apparent nitrate limiting condition was observed however the composted woodchip reactor changed from linear reduction zero order to non linear reduction first order at approximately 3 mg n l likely due to its high nitrate removal rates all three reactors demonstrated curvilinear relationships between nitrate reduction and flow travel time for an influent concentration of 3 mg n l indicating that nitrate limiting condition occurred in all three bioreactors fig 2 shows the nitrate concentration profiles in the fresh and composted woodchip reactors for selected influent concentrations at an hrt of 12 h and a temperature of 5 c as expected denitrification in the two reactors was substantially inhibited at this low temperature for example the removal percentages were only 1 1 and 5 9 for the fresh and composted woodchip reactors at an influent concentration of 50 mg n l and the removal percentages increased to 1 7 and 9 5 at an influent concentration of 30 mg n l at 5 c the fresh woodchip reactor exhibited linear nitrate reduction for the entire concentration range of 2 5 50 mg l shown in fig 2 curvilinear relationship between nitrate reduction and flow travel time was observed for the composted woodchip reactor at an influent concentration of 3 mg n l however the degree of curve is much smaller compared to the experiments at 22 c suggesting reduced nitrate removal rates at 5 c table 1 presents the nitrate load reduction rates using the unit of g n m3 bioreactor volume d for the three column reactors the nitrate load reduction rates were 8 81 21 0 7 36 9 78 and 2 46 3 54 g n m3 d respectively for the composted fresh and aged woodchip bioreactors for influent concentrations of 10 50 mg n l at 22 c these nitrate load reductions fall well in the range 2 22 g n m3 d that has been observed for field bioreactors schipper et al 2010 statistical test results showed that the denitrification capacities of the three column reactors were significantly different p 0 05 and were in the order of composted woodchips fresh woodchips aged woodchips the nitrate load reduction rates of the composted woodchips were 1 20 2 15 times higher than that of the fresh woodchips which were 2 76 3 37 times higher than that of the aged woodchips influent nitrate concentrations also had an impact on the nitrate load reduction rates variations in nitrate load reduction rates were less than 12 5 for the three column reactors when the influent concentration decreased from 50 to 30 mg n l when the influent concentration further declined to 10 mg n l all three reactors showed large decreases in nitrate load reduction rates and the decreases were 58 0 24 7 and 30 5 for the composted fresh and aged woodchips respectively compared to 50 mg n l the nitrate load reduction rates were 2 18 2 60 and 0 53 0 55 g n m3 d respectively for the composted and fresh woodchips for influent concentrations of 10 50 mg n l at 5 c compared to 22 c the nitrate load reduction rates decreased by 75 3 87 6 average 84 8 and 92 7 94 5 average 94 1 for composted and fresh woodchips at different nitrate concentrations this indicates that the composted woodchip bioreactor had a better tolerance to the low temperature compared to the fresh woodchip bioreactor as evidenced by the lower reductions in denitrification performance at 5 c 3 2 woodchip doc leaching and sem images the results of column reactor experiments suggest that denitrification capacity of woodchips decreased after woodchip aging but increased after woodchip composting reactor effluent doc concentrations were analyzed to evaluate whether organic substrate concentrations played a role in influencing nitrate removal among the three reactors and the results are shown in fig 3 the effluent doc concentrations of the fresh woodchip reactor varied between 7 1 and 8 9 mg l with an average of 8 0 mg l during the kinetics experiments at 22 c the doc concentrations were 5 5 7 4 mg l average 6 3 mg l and 1 4 1 9 mg l average 1 6 mg l for the composted and aged woodchip reactors under the same experimental conditions lower doc levels in the aged woodchip reactor are expected because of the 1 year operation under saturated hydraulic conditions before the kinetics experiments microbial utilization and doc leaching during the 1 year reactor operation gradually depleted available organic substrates from woodchips thereby leading to decreased nitrate load reduction rates in the aged woodchip bioreactor the narrow range of effluent doc variations 0 5 mg l during the nitrate removal kinetics experiments suggest that the doc leaching from the aged woodchips had reached a relatively steady state robertson 2010 compared nitrate removal of woodchips with varying age and the results showed that the nitrate removal rates of the 2 year old media and the 7 year old media were within 52 6 78 6 and 39 6 59 1 of the fresh woodchips in this study the aged woodchips exhibited nitrate load reductions that were 29 7 36 2 of that of the fresh woodchips therefore the nitrate load reduction rates observed in the aged woodchip reactor could represent the long term sustained denitrification performance of field bioreactors after several years of operation under intermittent flow conditions the composted woodchips exhibited higher nitrate load reduction rates than the fresh woodchips despite the lower doc levels found in the reactor effluents therefore the quantity of organic carbon in the rectors cannot explain the observed differences in nitrate removal between the two column reactors it is likely that the composting process before the bioreactor experiments modified the quality of wood materials such that more biodegradable organic compounds were produced to promote the denitrification reactions this demonstrates the importance of woodchip quality on nitrate removal in bioreactors other researchers have used external carbon sources and drying rewetting cycles to improve the carbon availability for nitrate removal in woodchip reactors roser et al 2018 maxwell et al 2019 the doc levels in the fresh and composted woodchip rectors declined to 1 2 1 5 mg l average 1 3 mg l and 0 7 1 0 mg l average 0 8 mg l respectively during the kinetics experiments at 5 c the average reactor effluent doc at 5 c decreased by 83 6 86 6 for the two reactors compared to 22 c it is clear that low temperatures could inhibit both microbial denitrification rates and woodchip doc leaching rates which resulted in overall lower nitrate removal in the column reactors fig 4 presents sem images of fresh and composted woodchips before and after the bioreactor experiments the surface of the fresh woodchip image a showed fresh open cell walls by tangential cut after the bioreactor experiments the surface of the aged woodchip clearly exhibited deterioration and degradation by water and bacteria image b water attack and biodegradation caused erosion of cell walls into adjacent areas localized cavitation on the wood surface is also evident from the sem image images c and d in fig 4 present the surface morphological information of the composted woodchips before and after the bioreactor experiments it is evident that fine soil particles were attached to the woodchip surface during the composting process and partially covered the wood surface which makes the cell wall structure illegible erosion cracks and cavitation were observed on the composted woodchip surface after the experiments some of the attached soil particles were not easily detached from the wood surface even after the bioreactor experiments wood is primarily composed of cellulose hemicellulose and lignin cellulose is a glucose polymer hemicellulose is a heteropolysaccharide polymer and lignin is a complex cross linked polymer with amorphous aromatic and heterogeneous structures andlar et al 2018 microbial utilization of woodchip organic substrates requires the production of soluble organic carbon by enzymatic hydrolysis first under anaerobic conditions cellulase enzymes are used by bacteria to break down the crystalline cellulose into smaller soluble oligosaccharides which can be metabolized by bacterial community in biofilm lynd et al 2002 compared to cellulose lignin is generally resistant to bacterial biodegradation and therefore it provides a protective barrier to enzymatic decomposition of cellulose in wood the soluble organic hydrolysis rate typically decreases over time because fewer cellulose sites are available for cellulase enzyme adsorption therefore the doc release from woodchip bioreactors generally follows the power law exponential decline over time abusallout and hua 2017 wood degrading fungi are the primary microorganisms responsible for lignincellulose degradation in nature andlar et al 2018 during the woodchip composting process in this study it was observed that fungi were widely distributed on the woodchip surface figure s2 the modification and removal of lignin by fungi will increase the enzyme access to hemicellulose and cellulose which is likely one of the key factors that led to increased denitrification potential of the composted woodchips under aerobic conditions fungi are also effective at depolymerizing hemicellulose and cellulose to produce monomers and other smaller units which can also help improve the biodegradability of organic substrates moreover fungi and bacteria degradation of woodchips during composting would also cause surface erosions with depressions channels and honeycomb patterns which can create more surface areas for biofilm growth these factors together may have contributed to the increased woodchip denitrification efficiency after composting 3 3 nitrate removal michaelis menten kinetics parameters fig 5 uses the fresh woodchip bioreactor as an example to illustrate the application of lineweaver burk plot to process the nitrate removal experimental data the high linear regression coefficient r2 suggests that the denitrification process in the bioreactor can be sufficiently described by the michaelis menten model after the model parameters vmax and km were obtained from the slope km vmax and intercept 1 vmax of the lineweaver burk plot the developed michaelis menten model was then used to predict the nitrate removal rates of the bioreactor at different nitrate concentrations fig 6 presents a comparison of nitrate removal rates obtained from the model prediction and the experimental data it is evident that the model results closely tracked the experimental results table 2 summarizes the michaelis menten model parameters for the three woodchip bioreactors the model vmax values at 22 c were 2 09 0 88 and 0 30 mg n l h for the composted fresh and aged woodchips respectively the maximum removal rate of the composted woodchips was 2 4 times higher than that of the fresh woodchips which was again 2 9 times higher than that of the aged woodchips these results quantitatively agree with the analysis of nitrate load reductions of the three bioreactors shown in table 1 despite the large differences in the maximum removal rates the three bioreactors exhibited similar half saturation constants the km values at 22 c were 2 60 2 16 and 2 01 mg n l for the composted fresh and aged woodchips respectively it seems that woodchips that had high maximum nitrate removal rates also exhibited relatively high half saturation constants both vmax and km values declined under the cold temperature of 5 c the vmax values decreased to 0 26 and 0 05 mg n l h for the composted and fresh woodchips which correspond to 87 6 and 94 3 reductions compared to 22 c these results confirm that low temperature of 5 c substantially inhibited biological denitrification activities in the woodchip bioreactors and that the composted woodchips showed better resistance to the cold temperature the better performance of the composted woodchip bioreactor at 5 c may be attributed to lignincellulose fungi degradation production of biodegradable organic substrates and surface modification during the composting process the cold temperature of 5 c also decreased km values to 1 74 and 1 19 mg l respectively for composted and fresh woodchips the model coefficients r2 of different bioreactors varied between 0 970 and 0 993 suggesting that the nitrate removal data obtained from this study fit the michaelis menten model well the michaelis menten km values obtained at 22 c predict that the nitrate removal by the three woodchip bioreactors follows a zero order reaction when the nitrate concentration is much higher than 2 01 2 60 mg n l a switch from a zero order reaction to a mixed order reaction occurs when the nitrate concentration is similar to 2 01 2 60 mg n l the denitrification reaction becomes a first order reaction when the nitrate concentration is much lower than 2 01 2 60 mg n l these model results can be used to analyze nitrate removal kinetics in woodchip bioreactors for various applications nitrate concentrations in agricultural subsurface drainage and some wastewater sources such as aquaculture wastewater are typically higher than 10 mg n l fausey et al 1995 lepine et al 2016 therefore nitrate removal in woodchip bioreactors for subsurface drainage and wastewater treatment can be operationally defined as a zero order reaction nitrate is not a major limiting factor under such conditions it is possible that cellulose enzymatic and abiotic hydrolysis and subsequent metabolism of oligosaccharides are the limiting factors controlling the denitrification rate when nitrate is present at relatively high concentrations for urban stormwater with relatively low nitrate concentrations e g 10 mg n l mixed order and first order reactions may be observed during woodchip denitrification the km values of the bioreactors reduced to 1 19 1 74 mg l when the temperature decreased to 5 c suggesting that the reduced biological activities at 5 c decreased the half saturation constant for nitrate removal at such a low temperature nitrate removal in most woodchip bioreactors would follow a zero order reaction with reduced rate constants the composted and fresh woodchip bioreactors showed q10 values of 3 4 and 5 4 respectively these two values translate to 3 4 fold and 5 4 fold increases in nitrate removal rates for every 10 c increase in temperature the fresh woodchips exhibited a higher temperature dependence in nitrate removal than the composted woodchips similar q10 values in the range of 4 4 4 7 have been reported for column experiments under controlled laboratory conditions schmidt and clark 2013 halaburka et al 2019 however lower q10 values 1 4 1 7 have also been reported in field woodchip bioreactors cameron and schipper 2010 the q10 variability for woodchip denitrification may be attributed to differences in treatment systems field and laboratory experimental conditions and temperature ranges 3 4 hrt impacts on nitrate removal and nitrite accumulation fig 7 presents the impacts of hrt on the denitrification performance of the fresh and composted woodchip bioreactors for an influent concentration of 10 mg n l the average removal percentages were 98 7 73 7 and 35 7 respectively for 24 12 and 6 h hrts by the fresh woodchip bioreactor the nitrate load reduction rates by the fresh woodchip bioreactor were 4 93 7 36 and 7 14 g n m3 d for 24 12 and 6 h hrts similar nitrate load reductions were achieved by 12 and 6 h hrts the relatively low nitrate load reduction at a 24 h hrt can be attributed to the switch of a zero order reaction to a first order reaction along the length of the reactor unlike the fresh woodchip bioreactor near complete removal of nitrate was observed for the composted woodchip bioreactor under all three hrts therefore an hrt of 6 h is adequate for the composted woodchips to completely remove nitrate for an influent concentration of 10 mg n l this further demonstrates that the composted woodchips are much more efficient denitrifying media than the fresh woodchips denitrification is a microbial process that involves the reduction of nitrate through the intermediate nitrite to nitrogen gas nitrite concentration profiles along the length of the reactors were analyzed to evaluate the nitrite accumulation in the fresh and composted woodchip bioreactors for both reactors operated at 24 h hrt nitrite gradually increased with increasing reaction time and reached a peak concentration when nitrate reduced to a certain level and after that nitrite gradually declined similar nitrite profile was also observed for the composted woodchip bioreactor operated at 12 and 6 h hrts and the final effluent nitrite was 0 for all three hrt conditions peak nitrite concentrations in the composted woodchip bioreactor were 0 53 0 66 and 0 72 mg n l when nitrate reduced to 4 86 5 66 and 3 32 mg n l for the three hrts these peak nitrite concentrations accounted for 10 3 15 2 of the reduced nitrate for the fresh woodchip bioreactor operated at 24 h hrt nitrite reached a peak concentration of 0 68 mg n l when nitrate reduced to 2 18 mg n l this peak nitrite concentration amounted to 8 70 of the reduced nitrate when the hrt decreased to 12 and 6 h nitrite gradually increased with increasing flow travel time and no nitrite decline phase was observed the final effluent nitrite concentration of the fresh woodchip bioreactor was 0 22 1 17 and 0 65 mg n l for 24 12 and 6 h hrts the nitrate and nitrite concentration profiles reflect the difference between the nitrate and nitrite reduction rates at different substrate concentrations nitrite accumulation occurs when the nitrate reduction rate is higher than the nitrite reduction rate and reaches a peak when the nitrate reduction rate is equal to the nitrite reduction rate after that the nitrite reduction rate overtakes the nitrate reduction rate leading to the nitrite declining phase the results in fig 7 indicate that nitrate would need to decrease to below approximately 2 2 mg n l before nitrite could decline for the fresh woodchip bioreactor for the composted woodchip bioreactor nitrate would need to decrease to below approximately 3 3 5 7 mg n l to level off nitrite accumulation and reduce nitrite in the reactor effluent these results suggest that nitrite reduction in the bioreactors occurred only after nitrate become limiting in the bioreactors nitrite reduction rates rnitrite reduction can be calculated from the difference between nitrate reduction rates rnitrate reduction and nitrite accumulation rates rnitrite accumulation using the following equation rnitrite reduction rnitrate reduction rnitrite accumulation the nitrate and nitrite concentration profiles of the bioreactors operated at 12 h hrt were used to determine the nitrite reduction rates the linear regression was used to model nitrate and nitrite data in the time range of 0 6 h for the fresh woodchip reactor and 0 2 h for the composted woodchip reactor to obtain the reaction rates the resulting rnitrate reduction and rnitrite accumulation values were 0 57 and 0 10 mg n l h for the fresh woodchips and 1 41 and 0 28 mg n l h for the composted woodchips r2 0 981 1 the calculated nitrite reduction rate rnitrite reduction was 0 47 and 1 13 mg n l h respectively for the fresh and composted woodchip bioreactors the nitrite reduction rates were 82 5 and 80 1 of the respective nitrate reduction rates for the two bioreactors the comparable nitrate and nitrite reduction rates obtained from this study support the observation that nitrite accumulation is generally not high in field bioreactors however the fresh woodchip bioreactor produced an effluent with nitrite exceeding us environmental protection agency drinking water standard 1 mg n l at an hrt of 12 h therefore nitrite should be evaluated during woodchip bioreactor design and operation to avoid high nitrite levels in reactor effluents 3 5 implications on woodchip denitrification applications woodchip bioreactors have been employed to remove nitrate in various sources for more than two decades blowes et al 1994 however there are still uncertainties about kinetic parameters vmax and km of michaelis menten model for nitrate removal in woodchip bioreactors the results of this study suggest that the use of a zero order reaction model is adequate to design woodchip bioreactors for treating agricultural subsurface drainage and wastewaters that contain nitrate much higher than the km values based on the nitrate removal rates observed in this study and several other studies robertson 2010 hua et al 2016 nordstrom and herbert 2017 we propose the following nitrate removal rates as general guidelines to facilitate the design and evaluation of woodchip bioreactors for new woodchip bioreactors nitrate removal rates of 1 1 5 mg n l h and 0 1 0 3 mg n l h can be used for reactor design under warm 22 c and cold 5 c seasons these rates are equivalent to nitrate load reduction rates of 16 8 25 2 g n m3 d at 22 c and 1 68 5 04 g n m3 d at 5 c when a typical field woodchip bioreactor porosity of 0 7 is used for woodchip bioreactors that have been used for several years in the field a nitrate removal rate of 0 3 mg n l h can be used for reactor analysis the results of this study showed that microbial degradation of woodchips during the composting process led to more than doubled nitrate removal rates compared to fresh woodchips therefore microbial degradation of woodchips before bioreactor installation could be a practical and low cost management tool to enhance the denitrification performance of woodchip bioreactors this pre installation management strategy can be realized through the storage of woodchips under natural conditions natural rain or artificial water spray and certain soil amendment could create the required moister content and microorganism community for the wood degradation therefore we recommend that woodchips should be stored in an outdoor environment for several weeks to months before the bioreactor installation certainly long term laboratory and field studies are needed to evaluate the longevity of the effect of woodchip composting on nitrate removal this study indicates that the quality of doc leached from woodchips can have a significant impact on nitrate removal rates more studies are needed to determine the biodegradability of woodchip doc and the release rates of biodegradable organic carbon from woodchips to better understand nitrate removal kinetics in bioreactors 4 conclusions this study was conducted to determine the nitrate removal kinetics parameters in denitrification bioreactors using the fresh aged and composted woodchips the results showed that denitrification efficiency followed the order of composted woodchips fresh woodchips aged woodchips the average nitrate load reduction rates were 8 81 21 0 7 36 9 78 and 2 46 3 54 g n m3 d for the composted fresh and aged woodchips at influent nitrate concentrations of 10 50 mg n l an hrt of 12 h and 22 c the composted woodchips exhibited denitrification capacities that were 1 20 2 15 times higher than that of the fresh woodchips at 22 c the nitrate load reduction rates decreased to 2 18 2 60 and 0 53 0 55 g n m3 d for the composted and fresh woodchip bioreactors operated at 5 c woodchip composting before bioreactor installation can be used as a practical management tool to improve denitrification efficiency the michaelis menten model adequately described the nitrate removal process in woodchip bioreactors r2 0 970 0 993 the vmax values were 2 09 0 88 and 0 30 mg n l h and the km values were 2 60 2 16 and 2 01 mg n l for the composted fresh and aged woodchips at 22 c the vmax values decreased to 0 26 and 0 05 mg n l h and the km values decreased to 1 74 and 1 19 mg n l when the composted and fresh woodchip bioreactors were operated at 5 c the nitrite reduction rates were 0 47 and 1 13 mg n l h for the fresh and composted woodchips which were 82 5 and 80 1 of the respective nitrate reduction rates for an influent nitrate of 10 mg n l and 22 c the fresh woodchip bioreactor produced an effluent with nitrite exceeding drinking water standard 1 mg n l at an influent nitrate of 10 mg n l and an hrt of 12 h nitrite should be evaluated during woodchip bioreactor operation to avoid high nitrite levels in reactor effluents declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that
