12705,the abuse of doxycycline hydrochloride dox in animal husbandry and its incomplete treatment have led to serious environmental problems especially the risk of bacterial resistance as an efficient simple and non polluting method of catalysis electrocatalysis has many advantages which has attracted extensive attention in the removal of antibiotic pollutants in wastewater hence the ni mwcnts oh ti composite electrode was prepared by galvanostatic electrodeposition to electrocatalyze dox and then the electrode was observed and analyzed by sem xrd and xps the optimal conditions mwcnts oh was 0 10 mg l the concentration of niso4 was 75 mmol l the degradation current was 15 ma nacl was present at a concentration of 0 20 mol l and ph value of 4 for degradation of 30 mg l dox within 60 min were determined by controlling variables the degradation process of dox followed langmuir hinshelwood quasi first order reaction kinetics as a result of stable the electrode dox removal rate was consistently above 70 after 10 continuous uses which showed good stability and reusability the composite electrode electrocatalyzed dox under the synergistic effect of cathode and anode to identify the main intermediates involved in the electrochemical degradation of dox lc ms was used the toxicity of the intermediate products and final products was compared and analyzed by microbial culture experiment and then ecosar 2 2 was used to predict the biotoxicity of main intermediates to fish daphnid and green algae this work provides a new material for the environmental remediation of antibiotic pollution graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords electrocatalytic wastewater treatment doxycycline hydrochloride hydroxylated multi walled carbon nanotubes data availability no data was used for the research described in the article 1 introduction antibiotics as essential medicines for humans and animals to resist the invasion of external germs are effective in the treatment and prevention of bacterial infections in humans and animals 1 2 however due to overuse and improper application of antibiotics they are discharged directly in the form of industrial wastewater or indirectly in the form of metabolites of human or animal bodies into water bodies 3 because of their high hydrophilicity and bioaccumulation they will destroy the ecosystems and endanger the health of organisms 4 therefore it has become an urgent task to control antibiotics in the water environment and protect the ecological environment on which organisms depend adsorption 5 biological processes 6 chemical processes 7 and advanced oxidation processes aop 8 11 are common methods for treating antibiotics in water treatment of pollutants by adsorption method will not produce toxic metabolites but it may even cause secondary pollution since it cannot fundamentally remove pollutants 12 in order to develop green and efficient catalysts carbon materials 13 magnetic materials 14 agricultural and horticultural wastes 15 and nanomaterials 16 have been widely studied low running costs and simplicity make the biological method attractive but the concentration of antibiotics will affect the effect of the biological method on wastewater treatment 17 microbial degradation is the most widespread method to treat antibiotics but the molecular mechanism of microbial decomposition and transformation of tetracycline antibiotics under different nutritional conditions is still unclear during the process of treatment special consideration should be given to the production of drug resistant superbacteria and the treatment of excess sludge it is prominent to consider the generation of drug resistant superbacteria the chemical method can treat wastewater with high concentration and high cod but this method requires additional chemical reagents which increases the cost of treatment so this method has not been widely used in wastewater treatment 18 as a result of the limitations of traditional methods alternative methods of purification are being explored such as ozone oxidation electro fenton reactions and photocatalysis 19 23 as a kind of advanced oxidation method electrocatalysis has the advantages of simple operation environmentally friendly low water treatment cost no secondary pollution and so on 24 25 these advantages make it widely used in wastewater treatment an important consideration when electrochemically degrading pollutants is the electrode material 26 27 among many electrode materials hydroxylated multi walled carbon nanotubes mwcnts oh have large specific surface area and conductivity 28 30 and ni as a transition metal its outer electronic structure contains d electrons and empty d orbitals which can form a hybrid orbital coordination structure and promote catalytic activity and electrochemical stability 31 33 it s noted that the hybrid coordination structure between c and ni can promote the electrochemical stability of the catalyst 34 nevertheless there are few reports introducing ni mwcnts oh onto ti matrix for the electrocatalytic degradation of dox in this work an electrochemical method was used to prepare ni mwcnts oh ti composite electrodes for the degradation of dox the ni mwcnts oh ti composite electrode has catalytic activity and stability for degrading dox under optimum working conditions the degradation rate of dox can reach 76 46 within 60 min the ni mwcnts oh ti electrode will provide a new idea for the degradation of tetracycline antibiotics 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental instruments and reagents all reagents were analytically pure and the experimental water was ultrapure water titanium plate was purchased from baoji baoye titanium nickel manufacturing co ltd platinum

sulfate sinopharm chemical reagent co ltd sodium fluoride tianjin damao chemical reagent factory hydroxylated multi walled carbon nanotubes nickel ii sulfate hexahydrate aladdin reagent co ltd concentrated nitric acid and acetone xilong chemical group co ltd 2 2 preparation of ni mwcnts oh ti electrode at 35 c a 10 mm 1 mm 100 mm ti sheet as anode and a pt sheet as cathode were connected to a dual potentiostat the effective area of the ti sheet was 40 mm 10 mm by potentiostat chemical polymerization with 1 0 mol l na2so4 and 0 5 naf as electrolyte two electrodes were placed in parallel with a distance of 2 cm a voltage of 20 v and etched for 1 h the ni mwcnts oh ti electrode was prepared by electrodeposition at current intensity of 5 ma for 10 min 2 3 characteristics and performance scanning electron microscope sem apreo 2c thermo fisher scientific was used to analyze the apparent morphologies of ti matrix mwcnts oh ti supporting electrode and ni mwcnts oh ti electrode 10 kv 5000 times the crystal structure of the electrode was confirmed by x ray diffraction xrd xrd 7000 s shimadzu japan x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps phi 5700 physical electronics inc was used to analyze the valence of ni mwcnts oh ti electrode the oh in the reaction solution was determined by fluorescence spectrophotometry rf 5301 pc japan liquid chromatography mass spectrometry lc ms agilent 1260 usa was applied to determine the degradation intermediates of dox 2 4 removal of dox the degradation experiment of 30 mg l dox was accomplished by ni mwcnts oh ti electrode the electrolyte was nacl aqueous solution the quantitative analysis of dox was carried out by uv vis spectrophotometry with 271 nm the removal rate of dox was calculated according to the following formula 1 η c c 0 c 0 100 where η was the removal rate of dox c 0 was the initial concentration of dox mg l c was the final concentration of dox mg l 3 results and discussion 3 1 apparent morphology and crystal structure of ni mwcnts oh ti electrode in order to observe the apparent morphological characteristics of etched ti substrate mwcnts oh ti support electrode and ni mwcnts oh ti electrode sem was performed as shown in fig 1 a c the ti matrix was smooth with small ripples 35 the electrode obtained by directly loading metal on this substrate can easily fall off its surface the etched surface of the ti substrate was wavy which was the 1d structure of the ti surface there were many wavy holes and it was a 2d structure of ti surface this improved the adhesion between the base material and the intermediate layer which was beneficial to the loading of mwcnts oh fig 1 a after mwcnts oh was loaded on the surface the fluctuation of the material became larger and it had a 3d network structure which was beneficial to the subsequent ni loading fig 1 b there were small particles appearing on the electrode surface when ni was loaded on mwcnts oh ti support electrode fig 1 c the prepared metal particles had good dispersibility and spatial ductility which was helpful to increase the catalytic active sites and improve the utilization rate of the catalyst as a good material for hydrogen evolution ni can produce a large amount of h at the cathode which can promote the degradation of dox 36 meanwhile it was also beneficial to the diffusion of target pollutants on the electrode surface and accelerated the mass transfer process on the electrode surface it can effectively prevent the further agglomeration of mwcnts oh which improved the dispersibility of mwcnts oh on the electrode surface therefore the electrochemical reaction can be effectively catalyzed to obtain the crystal structure information of ni mwcnts oh ti the electrode was tested by xrd fig 1 d the c had two diffraction peaks with 2θ values of 43 93 and 75 30 which belonged to the diffraction peaks of 111 and 220 crystal planes of c respectively this also confirmed that mwcnts oh was loaded successfully the values of 2θ were 35 09 38 42 40 17 53 00 62 94 70 66 76 22 and 77 36 which belonged to 100 002 101 102 110 103 112 and 201 of ti respectively among them the 2θ values of diffraction peaks with strong relative signals were 40 17 53 00 and 70 66 the 2θ values of 36 88 37 70 38 51 62 57 and 75 93 were the 103 004 112 204 and 203 crystal planes of tio2 ni had two diffraction peaks with 2θ values of 44 51 and 76 37 respectively which belonged to the diffraction peaks of ni 111 and 220 crystal planes this diffraction peak was not apparent because ni was thin and its crystallinity was not strong the surface of ni mwcnts oh ti electrode was analyzed by energy dispersive spectroscopy eds in fig 1 e h on the surface of ni mwcnts oh ti electrode elements such as ti c o and ni existed the element ti came from ti matrix c came from mwcnts oh and o came from mwcnts oh and ti matrix the existence of ni indicated that ni had been loaded on the electrode surface successfully 3 2 valence analysis of ni mwcnts oh ti electrode elements to study the chemical valence states of elements of c o ti and ni the electrode was analyzed by xps and the xps narrow scanning peak results were fitted by xpspeak 4 1 software fig 2 fig 2 a xps scanning of c of ni mwcnts oh ti electrode showed that three peaks of c can be distinguished including the peak 284 6 ev of cc and cc the peak 286 4 ev of co and the peak 288 6 ev of cooh 37 as can be seen from the narrow scanning spectrum of o in fig 2 b five peaks of o can be distinguished and the peak of the oh binding at 531 2 ev was related to the defect of the low oxygen coordination bond on the material surface which can promote the adsorption of oxygen oh and so on the peak binding at 529 7 ev was mainly attributed to the contribution of the metal oxygen bond the peak of cco bonding at 531 8 ev the peak of cooh binding at 530 5 ev and the peak of coo at a binding energy of 532 5 ev as part of ti was oxidized during etching part of oxygen might come from tio2 the lattice oxygen with relatively low binding energy was the oxygen in tio2 it can be seen from the narrow scanning spectrum of ti 2p in fig 2 c that there were two characteristic peaks of ti 2p and ti 2p1 2 of ti element binding at 458 0 ev and 463 6 ev in fig 2 d there were four typical peaks of ni can be distinguished the peaks with the binding energy of 855 6 ev and 873 3 ev correspond to ni 2p3 2 and ni 2p1 2 respectively and the peaks with the binding energy of 861 2 ev and 879 1 ev correspond to a pair of satellite peaks of ni 2p the results showed that ni was successfully loaded on the electrode surface 3 3 influence of working conditions on the performance of ni mwcnts oh ti electrode to study the influence of mwcnts oh deposition amount on the electrode different concentrations of mwcnts oh deposition solutions were prepared the mwcnts oh ti electrode was prepared by electrodeposition at 35 c with 100 ml of 0 5 mol l na2so4 solution as electrolyte and 5 ma constant current an initial concentration of 30 mg l dox was used in the degradation experiment an electrolyte of 0 20 mol l nacl and a ph value of 4 were used in fig 3 a when the concentration of mwcnts oh deposition solution increased to 0 20 mg l the removal rate of dox began to decrease a higher concentration of mwcnts oh in the solution led to more mwcnts oh being loaded onto the electrode which enhanced its catalytic activity in the presence of increasing concentrations of mwcnts oh the removal rate of dox decreased the electrode surface might become damaged by excessive load causing mwcnts oh to fall off therefore the concentration of mwcnts oh deposition solution was 0 10 mg l which was the best concentration for preparing mwcnts oh ti electrode fig 3 f showed the linear fitting of dox at different concentrations of mwcnts oh the degradation of dox by mwcnts oh ti electrode accorded with langmuir hinshelwood pseudo first order reaction kinetics the reaction rate constants of electrodes prepared with different concentrations of mwcnts oh for dox degradation were 0 10 mg l 0 00688 min 1 0 15 mg l 0 00674 min 1 0 20 mg l 0 00672 min 1 0 05 mg l 0 00597 min 1 0 mg l 0 00434 min 1 the results showed that 0 10 mg l was the best concentration of mwcnts oh experimental results supported this conclusion to investigate the influence of the amount of niso4 deposited on the performance of electrodes different concentrations of niso4 were made during the deposition process the electrolyte was 100 ml of 0 5 mol l na2so4 and the mwcnts oh concentration was 0 10 mg l the degradation experiment was performed with 30 mg l dox 0 2 mol l nacl as the electrolyte ph 4 and 60 min degradation time in 35 c in fig 3 b when the concentration of niso4 was 0 0 075 mol l the removal rate of dox increased and when the concentration of niso4 continued to increase the removal rate of dox decreased the electrode without niso4 was more effective than the electrode modified with 0 100 mol l niso4 which was due to the uneven distribution of ni after excessive loading and shedding in the solution and the catalytic effect of the electrode decreased therefore the concentration of niso4 deposition solution was 0 075 mol l which was the best concentration for preparing ni mwcnts oh ti electrodes fig 3 g showed the linear fitting of dox at different concentrations of niso4 the degradation of dox by ni mwcnts oh ti electrode accorded with langmuir hinshelwood pseudo first order reaction kinetics the reaction rate constants of dox degradation by ni mwcnts oh ti electrodes prepared with different concentrations of niso4 were as follows 0 075 mol l 0 00759 min 1 0 050 mol l 0 00739 min 1 0 025 mol l 0 00727 min 1 0 mol l 0 00770 min 1 0 100 mol l 0 00586 min 1 the results showed that 0 075 mol l was the best concentration of ni mwcnts oh which was consistent with the experimental results the concentration of electrolyte directly affects the current and voltage of the reaction system and then affects the electrochemical reaction rate when investigating the influence of electrolyte concentration on ni mwcnts oh ti electrode the electrocatalytic electrode was ni mwcnts oh ti and the counter electrode was pt at the beginning of the experiment a solution containing 30 mg l of dox was supplied at a working current intensity of 5 ma a reaction temperature of 35 c and a ph value of 4 in fig 3 c the influence of electrolyte concentration on the electrocatalytic dox removal rate of ni mwcnts oh ti electrode showed a process of first increasing and then decreasing the removal rate of dox gradually increased when the concentration of electrolyte nacl increased from 0 10 to 0 20 mol l when the electrolyte nacl concentration increased to 0 25 mol l and 0 30 mol l however the removal rate of dox decreased a solution with low electrolyte concentration increased in conductivity with an increase in electrolyte concentration thus increasing the electrocatalytic performance of the electrode effective current decreased when the electrolyte concentration increased resulting in an increase in electrolyte interaction when electrolyte concentration increased working voltage and power supply decreased therefore the best electrolyte concentration was 0 20 mol l of nacl for the removal rate of dox by the ni mwcnts oh ti electrode fig 3 h showed the linear fitting of dox at different concentrations of nacl the degradation of dox by ni mwcnts oh ti electrode accorded with langmuir hinshelwood pseudo first order reaction kinetics under the condition of different electrolyte concentrations the reaction rate constants of dox degradation by ni mwcnts oh ti electrodes were as follows 0 20 mol l 0 02179 min 1 0 30 mol l 0 01858 min 1 0 25 mol l 0 00727 min 1 0 15 mol l 0 01961 min 1 0 10 mol l 0 00657 min 1 the results showed that 0 20 mol l nacl was the best concentration of ni mwcnts oh for dox degradation which was consistent with the experimental results current directly affects the electrocatalytic activity of the electrode the effect of working current of ni mwcnts oh ti electrode was studied the electrolyte was 0 20 mol l nacl solution and ni mwcnts oh ti electrode was used as the catalytic electrode in fig 3 d the electrode had little effect on dox under the condition of no power supply after increasing the current the electrode started to act on dox the degradation rate increased with the increase of current when the working current increased to 20 ma the degradation effect decreased at this time there were bubbles around the pt electrode and the current efficiency decreased the side reaction of the electrode increased resulting in the reduction of electrocatalytic activity of the electrode therefore 15 ma was the best concentration for degradation of the ni mwcnts oh ti electrode fig 3 i showed the linear fitting of dox at different currents the degradation of dox by ni mwcnts oh ti electrode accorded with langmuir hinshelwood pseudo first order reaction kinetics under the condition of different currents the reaction rate constants of dox degradation by ni mwcnts oh ti electrodes were as follows 15 ma 0 02258 min 1 20 ma 0 01542 min 1 10 ma 0 01530 min 1 5 ma 0 00877 min 1 3 ma 0 00294 min 1 0 ma 0 00039 min 1 the results showed that 15 ma was the best concentration of ni mwcnts oh for dox degradation which was consistent with the experimental results whenever the material reaction is controlled the ph value of the solution plays a key role the ph value of the solution would affect the micro interface charge between the material and the solution thus affecting the hydrogen evolution potential of the electrode the reaction conditions were as follows dox concentration 30 mg l reaction temperature 35 c electrolyte 0 20 mol l nacl solution current intensity 15 ma and reaction time 60 min the results of the investigation into how the ph of the solution affected the performance of the ni mwcnts oh ti electrode were displayed in fig 3 e within a certain range of reaction times the removal rate of dox decreased gradually with a decrease in ph reducing the ph value to 1 increased the removal efficiency initially but it rapidly decreased after a while at this time the most obvious electrode degradation phenomenon appeared and the current efficiency dropped rapidly before the electrode was destroyed the ph value of the solution had little influence on the overall efficiency of the system as well so the best ph value for degrading dox was 4 degradation effects of dox were linearly fitted to solutions with different ph values fig 3 j the reaction rate constants of dox degradation by ni mwcnts oh ti electrodes were in accordance with langmuir hinshelwood pseudo first order reaction kinetics it can be seen that when the ph was 4 0 01989 min 1 the highest rate constant of degradation reaction was observed experiments confirmed this to investigate the practicability of the ni mwcnts oh ti electrode the continuous electrochemical degradation of dox was studied in fig 3 f the removal efficiency of dox dropped from 72 46 to 71 89 after 10 times of continuous use which had little effect on the removal rate of dox indicating that the ni mwcnts oh ti electrode had well stability this showed that the ni mwcnts oh ti electrode prepared in this study had good practical potential which provided the possibility for further practical application at present there is little research on electrocatalytic treatment of dox we compared this material with other composite materials as shown in table 1 compared with other composite materials ni mwcnts oh ti composite electrode can treat dox with high concentration and has good treatment effect therefore this electrode is expected to be a candidate electrode for dox degradation 3 4 degradation mechanism of dox by ni mwcnts oh ti oh as the most important active oxidizing substance in the electrocatalytic reaction system its output directly affects the degradation and removal effect of organic pollutants 25 to verify the oh produced by the ni mwcnts oh ti electrode in the process of dox degradation the output in the reaction process was detected by indirect measurement the target simulated degradation substance was replaced by coumarin in the same electrocatalytic degradation test system and the oh produced in the reaction process would be captured 44 45 the fluorescent substance would be generated with coumarin and the characteristic fluorescence peak would appear in the process of fluorescence detection and then fluorescence spectrophotometry was used for detection thereby further obtaining oh related data the fluorescence intensity of 7 hydroxycoumarin increases with the duration of the degradation reaction as shown in fig 4 accordingly during the electrocatalytic oxidation of dox on the ni mwcnts oh ti electrode oh was generated and freely diffused into the reaction solution it can oxidize and degrade dox 2 dox e oxide 3 h 2 o oh h e 4 oh dox oxide xco 2 yh 2 o 5 oh reduzate oxide 6 dox ne reduzate 7 h ni ni h 8 h e h 9 h dox reduzate 10 h dox reduzate 11 h h e h 2 12 h h h 2 where dox represents the degradation intermediate of dox the h is a chemically adsorbed active hydrogen atom both the anode and cathode coexisted in this experiment to remove dox so the degradation of dox was catalyzed by the anode and cathode and oxidation and reduction took place simultaneously 46 dox adsorbed on the anode directly lost electrons and was oxidized which was the direct oxidation process of dox eq 2 the oh played a significant role in the degradation of dox 38 the water was oxidized to heterogeneous oh by anodic oxidation eq 3 the oh was adsorbed on the anode surface and oxidized with dox producing oxide h2o and co2 eq 4 at the same time the products reduced by the cathode were oxidized by oh eq 5 besides oxidation there was reduction in the whole electrocatalytic system 47 the reduction reaction can be divided into indirect reduction and direct reduction dox adsorbed on the surface of the electrode was directly reduced by the electrode eq 6 which was the direct reduction process of dox 46 the key to indirect reduction lied in the adsorbed hydrogen produced on the cathode surface and this process was more likely to occur under the action of transition metal catalysts 48 50 the outer electronic structure of ni contained d electrons and empty d orbitals and the cni hybrid orbital coordination structure formed by sp d orbital charge transferred with surrounding carbon atoms can promote catalytic activity and electrochemical stability 34 hydrogen atoms generated by hydrolysis were easily adsorbed on the surface of ni 51 eq 7 this was beneficial for the h on the electrode surface to attack the positively charged carbon atoms in dox and took a reduction so that dox was degraded this experiment deals with acidic conditions low concentration of oh can also promote the dissociation and adsorption process of h2 on the electrode surface and increase the rate of h generation 52 53 in volmer step h got electrons to generate h eq 8 the generated h reduced dox eq 9 and its intermediate products eq 10 at the cathode to generate a reduction product 54 the generated potential of h2 was smaller than that of h 55 so h2 was generated by heyrovsky step eq 11 and tafel step eq 12 at the same time in the presence of the catalyst the generated hydrogen can enter the metal lattice nih and reduce dox and its intermediate products 51 therefore the ni mwcnts oh ti electrode cathode prepared in this study can degrade dox by co catalysis with anode in order to comprehensively investigate the degradation pathway and intermediates generated by the ni mwcnts oh ti electrode lc ms was performed fig 5 showed the lc ms spectrum of the intermediate product obtained from the degradation of dox by a ni mwcnts oh ti electrode at the position of the ion peak m z in this experiment while oh oxidized dox and its intermediates the active atom h also had a reducing effect during hydrogenation reactions of cc and co ni mwcnts oh ti electrodes demonstrate extremely high catalytic activity and stability 56 therefore there were two pathways to decompose dox there were several ionizable and electron rich functional groups such as dimethyl amino group phenolic group conjugated double bond and so on within the dox molecule which can be easily attacked by oh 27 57 58 the double bonds in p1 m z 461 and p2 m z 477 were attacked by oh in sequence and the oh groups nearby were oxidized into carbonyl groups under the action of oh the methyl group of dox was oxidized and under the action of h the carbonyl group was the convention to the hydroxyl group to obtain p3 m z 433 59 after demethylation p4 m z 449 p5 m z 384 p6 m z 417 p7 m z 401 and p8 m z 374 were formed from p3 m z 433 to p8 m z 374 it was the process of demethylation of dimethylamino with the progress of the reaction the ring opening demethylation of the above intermediates continuously produced compounds with simpler structures such as p9 m z 318 p10 m z 301 p11 m z 135 and p12 m z 122 eventually these products were further degraded into smaller molecules 3 5 toxicity test of ni mwcnts oh ti electrode to investigate the safety of using ni mwcnts oh ti electrodes in degrading dox a toxicity experiment was conducted the toxicity of the intermediate products and final products of the dox solution was compared and analyzed by microbial culture experiment e coli was selected as the experimental strain and e coli cultures were cultured in different dox degradation solutions for different periods of time and the toxicity of the degradation solution was assessed by counting the colonies fig s 1 a showed the culture medium containing water and the culture medium with ultrapure water was shown in fig s 1 b whereas the culture medium with different degradation times 0 15 30 45 and 60 min was shown in fig s 1 c g table s 1 showed the number and inhibitory rate of e coli in the culture medium the effects of electro catalytic degradation of dox on fish daphnids and green algae were simulated using ecosar 2 2 for acute and chronic toxicity 60 the results were shown in table s 2 fig 6 a showed the suppression ratio of e coli cultured in different conditions distilled water blank control and microbial culture medium cultivated with dox wastewater in different periods in the illustration of fig 6 a the colony number of e coli in seven time periods were 237 0 82 188 190 132 and 222 respectively the dox can inhibit the growth of e coli and the inhibition rate was 65 4 with the progress of the degradation reaction dox was oxidized and decomposed into small molecules and its toxicity to e coli is reduced the toxicity increased after 45 min of reaction in this process toxic substances were produced after 60 min of reaction the degradation solution had the lowest toxicity to e coli which meat that the application of ni mwcnts oh ti electrode in water treatment was safe based on ecosar 2 2 the acute and chronic toxicity of intermediates and products produced in the degradation process to fish daphnia and green algae were examined to understand the environmental risk of treating dox with ni mwcnts oh ti in fig 6 b the acute toxicity of dox to aquatic organisms increased in the process of degradation to p1 p2 and p4 and decreased when it was degraded to p3 p5 p6 p7 p8 and p9 which was lower than that of the parent compound however with further degradation the acute toxicity reached its maximum when it degraded to p10 in fig 6 c in the electrocatalytic degradation of dox at the beginning the chronic toxicity of dox gradually increased and the chronic toxicity of the product p2 to aquatic organisms reached the maximum much higher than that of the parent compound as the degradation reaction advances the acute and chronic toxicity of the products were gradually reduced and p5 p7 p8 and h2o were harmless to aquatic organisms 4 conclusions in this study the ni mwcnts oh ti electrode with excellent electrocatalytic activity and high stability was successfully prepared and used to degrade dox under the optimum preparation conditions and experimental parameters the removal rate of dox was 76 46 within 60 min in terms of reaction kinetics the rate at which dox was degraded by ni mwcnts oh ti electrodes was consistent with langmuir hinshelwood quasi first order models after 10 times of continuous use the removal rate of dox was still higher than 70 which indicated that ni mwcnts oh ti electrode had excellent stability and reproducibility the oxidation reduction mechanism of dox by oh and active atom h was proposed the results of lc ms analysis showed that dox can be effectively treated by demethylation and dehydration in addition the toxicity test of e coli and ecosar 2 2 proved that the toxicity of ni mwcnts oh ti electrode after treating dox for 60 min was significantly reduced therefore the ni mwcnts oh ti electrode will provide a new idea for the degradation of

12705,the abuse of doxycycline hydrochloride dox in animal husbandry and its incomplete treatment have led to serious environmental problems especially the risk of bacterial resistance as an efficient simple and non polluting method of catalysis electrocatalysis has many advantages which has attracted extensive attention in the removal of antibiotic pollutants in wastewater hence the ni mwcnts oh ti composite electrode was prepared by galvanostatic electrodeposition to electrocatalyze dox and then the electrode was observed and analyzed by sem xrd and xps the optimal conditions mwcnts oh was 0 10 mg l the concentration of niso4 was 75 mmol l the degradation current was 15 ma nacl was present at a concentration of 0 20 mol l and ph value of 4 for degradation of 30 mg l dox within 60 min were determined by controlling variables the degradation process of dox followed langmuir hinshelwood quasi first order reaction kinetics as a result of stable the electrode dox removal rate was consistently above 70 after 10 continuous uses which showed good stability and reusability the composite electrode electrocatalyzed dox under the synergistic effect of cathode and anode to identify the main intermediates involved in the electrochemical degradation of dox lc ms was used the toxicity of the intermediate products and final products was compared and analyzed by microbial culture experiment and then ecosar 2 2 was used to predict the biotoxicity of main intermediates to fish daphnid and green algae this work provides a new material for the environmental remediation of antibiotic pollution graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords electrocatalytic wastewater treatment doxycycline hydrochloride hydroxylated multi walled carbon nanotubes data availability no data was used for the research described in the article 1 introduction antibiotics as essential medicines for humans and animals to resist the invasion of external germs are effective in the treatment and prevention of bacterial infections in humans and animals 1 2 however due to overuse and improper application of antibiotics they are discharged directly in the form of industrial wastewater or indirectly in the form of metabolites of human or animal bodies into water bodies 3 because of their high hydrophilicity and bioaccumulation they will destroy the ecosystems and endanger the health of organisms 4 therefore it has become an urgent task to control antibiotics in the water environment and protect the ecological environment on which organisms depend adsorption 5 biological processes 6 chemical processes 7 and advanced oxidation processes aop 8 11 are common methods for treating antibiotics in water treatment of pollutants by adsorption method will not produce toxic metabolites but it may even cause secondary pollution since it cannot fundamentally remove pollutants 12 in order to develop green and efficient catalysts carbon materials 13 magnetic materials 14 agricultural and horticultural wastes 15 and nanomaterials 16 have been widely studied low running costs and simplicity make the biological method attractive but the concentration of antibiotics will affect the effect of the biological method on wastewater treatment 17 microbial degradation is the most widespread method to treat antibiotics but the molecular mechanism of microbial decomposition and transformation of tetracycline antibiotics under different nutritional conditions is still unclear during the process of treatment special consideration should be given to the production of drug resistant superbacteria and the treatment of excess sludge it is prominent to consider the generation of drug resistant superbacteria the chemical method can treat wastewater with high concentration and high cod but this method requires additional chemical reagents which increases the cost of treatment so this method has not been widely used in wastewater treatment 18 as a result of the limitations of traditional methods alternative methods of purification are being explored such as ozone oxidation electro fenton reactions and photocatalysis 19 23 as a kind of advanced oxidation method electrocatalysis has the advantages of simple operation environmentally friendly low water treatment cost no secondary pollution and so on 24 25 these advantages make it widely used in wastewater treatment an important consideration when electrochemically degrading pollutants is the electrode material 26 27 among many electrode materials hydroxylated multi walled carbon nanotubes mwcnts oh have large specific surface area and conductivity 28 30 and ni as a transition metal its outer electronic structure contains d electrons and empty d orbitals which can form a hybrid orbital coordination structure and promote catalytic activity and electrochemical stability 31 33 it s noted that the hybrid coordination structure between c and ni can promote the electrochemical stability of the catalyst 34 nevertheless there are few reports introducing ni mwcnts oh onto ti matrix for the electrocatalytic degradation of dox in this work an electrochemical method was used to prepare ni mwcnts oh ti composite electrodes for the degradation of dox the ni mwcnts oh ti composite electrode has catalytic activity and stability for degrading dox under optimum working conditions the degradation rate of dox can reach 76 46 within 60 min the ni mwcnts oh ti electrode will provide a new idea for the degradation of tetracycline antibiotics 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental

concentrated nitric acid and acetone xilong chemical group co ltd 2 2 preparation of ni mwcnts oh ti electrode at 35 c a 10 mm 1 mm 100 mm ti sheet as anode and a pt sheet as cathode were connected to a dual potentiostat the effective area of the ti sheet was 40 mm 10 mm by potentiostat chemical polymerization with 1 0 mol l na2so4 and 0 5 naf as electrolyte two electrodes were placed in parallel with a distance of 2 cm a voltage of 20 v and etched for 1 h the ni mwcnts oh ti electrode was prepared by electrodeposition at current intensity of 5 ma for 10 min 2 3 characteristics and performance scanning electron microscope sem apreo 2c thermo fisher scientific was used to analyze the apparent morphologies of ti matrix mwcnts oh ti supporting electrode and ni mwcnts oh ti electrode 10 kv 5000 times the crystal structure of the electrode was confirmed by x ray diffraction xrd xrd 7000 s shimadzu japan x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps phi 5700 physical electronics inc was used to analyze the valence of ni mwcnts oh ti electrode the oh in the reaction solution was determined by fluorescence spectrophotometry rf 5301 pc japan liquid chromatography mass spectrometry lc ms agilent 1260 usa was applied to determine the degradation intermediates of dox 2 4 removal of dox the degradation experiment of 30 mg l dox was accomplished by ni mwcnts oh ti electrode the electrolyte was nacl aqueous solution the quantitative analysis of dox was carried out by uv vis spectrophotometry with 271 nm the removal rate of dox was calculated according to the following formula 1 η c c 0 c 0 100 where η was the removal rate of dox c 0 was the initial concentration of dox mg l c was the final concentration of dox mg l 3 results and discussion 3 1 apparent morphology and crystal structure of ni mwcnts oh ti electrode in order to observe the apparent morphological characteristics of etched ti substrate mwcnts oh ti support electrode and ni mwcnts oh ti electrode sem was performed as shown in fig 1 a c the ti matrix was smooth with small ripples 35 the electrode obtained by directly loading metal on this substrate can easily fall off its surface the etched surface of the ti substrate was wavy which was the 1d structure of the ti surface there were many wavy holes and it was a 2d structure of ti surface this improved the adhesion between the base material and the intermediate layer which was beneficial to the loading of mwcnts oh fig 1 a after mwcnts oh was loaded on the surface the fluctuation of the material became larger and it had a 3d network structure which was beneficial to the subsequent ni loading fig 1 b there were small particles appearing on the electrode surface when ni was loaded on mwcnts oh ti support electrode fig 1 c the prepared metal particles had good dispersibility and spatial ductility which was helpful to increase the catalytic active sites and improve the utilization rate of the catalyst as a good material for hydrogen evolution ni can produce a large amount of h at the cathode which can promote the degradation of dox 36 meanwhile it was also beneficial to the diffusion of target pollutants on the electrode surface and accelerated the mass transfer process on the electrode surface it can effectively prevent the further agglomeration of mwcnts oh which improved the dispersibility of mwcnts oh on the electrode surface therefore the electrochemical reaction can be effectively catalyzed to obtain the crystal structure information of ni mwcnts oh ti the electrode was tested by xrd fig 1 d the c had two diffraction peaks with 2θ values of 43 93 and 75 30 which belonged to the diffraction peaks of 111 and 220 crystal planes of c respectively this also confirmed that mwcnts oh was loaded successfully the values of 2θ were 35 09 38 42 40 17 53 00 62 94 70 66 76 22 and 77 36 which belonged to 100 002 101 102 110 103 112 and 201 of ti respectively among them the 2θ values of diffraction peaks with strong relative signals were 40 17 53 00 and 70 66 the 2θ values of 36 88 37 70 38 51 62 57 and 75 93 were the 103 004 112 204 and 203 crystal planes of tio2 ni had two diffraction peaks with 2θ values of 44 51 and 76 37 respectively which belonged to the diffraction peaks of ni 111 and 220 crystal planes this diffraction peak was not apparent because ni was thin and its crystallinity was not strong the surface of ni mwcnts oh ti electrode was analyzed by energy dispersive spectroscopy eds in fig 1 e h on the surface of ni mwcnts oh ti electrode elements such as ti c o and ni existed the element ti came from ti matrix c came from mwcnts oh and o came from mwcnts oh and ti matrix the existence of ni indicated that ni had been loaded on the electrode surface successfully 3 2 valence analysis of ni mwcnts oh ti electrode elements to study the chemical valence states of elements of c o ti and ni the electrode was analyzed by xps and the xps narrow scanning peak results were fitted by xpspeak 4 1 software fig 2 fig 2 a xps scanning of c of ni mwcnts oh ti electrode showed that three peaks of c can be distinguished including the peak 284 6 ev of cc and cc the peak 286 4 ev of co and the peak 288 6 ev of cooh 37 as can be seen from the narrow scanning spectrum of o in fig 2 b five peaks of o can be distinguished and the peak of the oh binding at 531 2 ev was related to the defect of the low oxygen coordination bond on the material surface which can promote the adsorption of oxygen oh and so on the peak binding at 529 7 ev was mainly attributed to the contribution of the metal oxygen bond the peak of cco bonding at 531 8 ev the peak of cooh binding at 530 5 ev and the peak of coo at a binding energy of 532 5 ev as part of ti was oxidized during etching part of oxygen might come from tio2 the lattice oxygen with relatively low binding energy was the oxygen in tio2 it can be seen from the narrow scanning spectrum of ti 2p in fig 2 c that there were two characteristic peaks of ti 2p and ti 2p1 2 of ti element binding at 458 0 ev and 463 6 ev in fig 2 d there were four typical peaks of ni can be distinguished the peaks with the binding energy of 855 6 ev and 873 3 ev correspond to ni 2p3 2 and ni 2p1 2 respectively and the peaks with the binding energy of 861 2 ev and 879 1 ev correspond to a pair of satellite peaks of ni 2p the results showed that ni was successfully loaded on the electrode surface 3 3 influence of working conditions on the performance of ni mwcnts oh ti electrode to study the influence of mwcnts oh deposition amount on the electrode different concentrations of mwcnts oh deposition solutions were prepared the mwcnts oh ti electrode was prepared by electrodeposition at 35 c with 100 ml of 0 5 mol l na2so4 solution as electrolyte and 5 ma constant current an initial concentration of 30 mg l dox was used in the degradation experiment an electrolyte of 0 20 mol l nacl and a ph value of 4 were used in fig 3 a when the concentration of mwcnts oh deposition solution increased to 0 20 mg l the removal rate of dox began to decrease a higher concentration of mwcnts oh in the solution led to more mwcnts oh being loaded onto the electrode which enhanced its catalytic activity in the presence of increasing concentrations of mwcnts oh the removal rate of dox decreased the electrode surface might become damaged by excessive load causing mwcnts oh to fall off therefore the concentration of mwcnts oh deposition solution was 0 10 mg l which was the best concentration for preparing mwcnts oh ti electrode fig 3 f showed the linear fitting of dox at different concentrations of mwcnts oh the degradation of dox by mwcnts oh ti electrode accorded with langmuir hinshelwood pseudo first order reaction kinetics the reaction rate constants of electrodes prepared with different concentrations of mwcnts oh for dox degradation were 0 10 mg l 0 00688 min 1 0 15 mg l 0 00674 min 1 0 20 mg l 0 00672 min 1 0 05 mg l 0 00597 min 1 0 mg l 0 00434 min 1 the results showed that 0 10 mg l was the best concentration of mwcnts oh experimental results supported this conclusion to investigate the influence of the amount of niso4 deposited on the performance of electrodes different concentrations of niso4 were made during the deposition process the electrolyte was 100 ml of 0 5 mol l na2so4 and the mwcnts oh concentration was 0 10 mg l the degradation experiment was performed with 30 mg l dox 0 2 mol l nacl as the electrolyte ph 4 and 60 min degradation time in 35 c in fig 3 b when the concentration of niso4 was 0 0 075 mol l the removal rate of dox increased and when the concentration of niso4 continued to increase the removal rate of dox decreased the electrode without niso4 was more effective than the electrode modified with 0 100 mol l niso4 which was due to the uneven distribution of ni after excessive loading and shedding in the solution and the catalytic effect of the electrode decreased therefore the concentration of niso4 deposition solution was 0 075 mol l which was the best concentration for preparing ni mwcnts oh ti electrodes fig 3 g showed the linear fitting of dox at different concentrations of niso4 the degradation of dox by ni mwcnts oh ti electrode accorded with langmuir hinshelwood pseudo first order reaction kinetics the reaction rate constants of dox degradation by ni mwcnts oh ti electrodes prepared with different concentrations of niso4 were as follows 0 075 mol l 0 00759 min 1 0 050 mol l 0 00739 min 1 0 025 mol l 0 00727 min 1 0 mol l 0 00770 min 1 0 100 mol l 0 00586 min 1 the results showed that 0 075 mol l was the best concentration of ni mwcnts oh which was consistent with the experimental results the concentration of electrolyte directly affects the current and voltage of the reaction system and then affects the electrochemical reaction rate when investigating the influence of electrolyte concentration on ni mwcnts oh ti electrode the electrocatalytic electrode was ni mwcnts oh ti and the counter electrode was pt at the beginning of the experiment a solution containing 30 mg l of dox was supplied at a working current intensity of 5 ma a reaction temperature of 35 c and a ph value of 4 in fig 3 c the influence of electrolyte concentration on the electrocatalytic dox removal rate of ni mwcnts oh ti electrode showed a process of first increasing and then decreasing the removal rate of dox gradually increased when the concentration of electrolyte nacl increased from 0 10 to 0 20 mol l when the electrolyte nacl concentration increased to 0 25 mol l and 0 30 mol l however the removal rate of dox decreased a solution with low electrolyte concentration increased in conductivity with an increase in electrolyte concentration thus increasing the electrocatalytic performance of the electrode effective current decreased when the electrolyte concentration increased resulting in an increase in electrolyte interaction when electrolyte concentration increased working voltage and power supply decreased therefore the best electrolyte concentration was 0 20 mol l of nacl for the removal rate of dox by the ni mwcnts oh ti electrode fig 3 h showed the linear fitting of dox at different concentrations of nacl the degradation of dox by ni mwcnts oh ti electrode accorded with langmuir hinshelwood pseudo first order reaction kinetics under the condition of different electrolyte concentrations the reaction rate constants of dox degradation by ni mwcnts oh ti electrodes were as follows 0 20 mol l 0 02179 min 1 0 30 mol l 0 01858 min 1 0 25 mol l 0 00727 min 1 0 15 mol l 0 01961 min 1 0 10 mol l 0 00657 min 1 the results showed that 0 20 mol l nacl was the best concentration of ni mwcnts oh for dox degradation which was consistent with the experimental results current directly affects the electrocatalytic activity of the electrode the effect of working current of ni mwcnts oh ti electrode was studied the electrolyte was 0 20 mol l nacl solution and ni mwcnts oh ti electrode was used as the catalytic electrode in fig 3 d the electrode had little effect on dox under the condition of no power supply after increasing the current the electrode started to act on dox the degradation rate increased with the increase of current when the working current increased to 20 ma the degradation effect decreased at this time there were bubbles around the pt electrode and the current efficiency decreased the side reaction of the electrode increased resulting in the reduction of electrocatalytic activity of the electrode therefore 15 ma was the best concentration for degradation of the ni mwcnts oh ti electrode fig 3 i showed the linear fitting of dox at different currents the degradation of dox by ni mwcnts oh ti electrode accorded with langmuir hinshelwood pseudo first order reaction kinetics under the condition of different currents the reaction rate constants of dox degradation by ni mwcnts oh ti electrodes were as follows 15 ma 0 02258 min 1 20 ma 0 01542 min 1 10 ma 0 01530 min 1 5 ma 0 00877 min 1 3 ma 0 00294 min 1 0 ma 0 00039 min 1 the results showed that 15 ma was the best concentration of ni mwcnts oh for dox degradation which was consistent with the experimental results whenever the material reaction is controlled the ph value of the solution plays a key role the ph value of the solution would affect the micro interface charge between the material and the solution thus affecting the hydrogen evolution potential of the electrode the reaction conditions were as follows dox concentration 30 mg l reaction temperature 35 c electrolyte 0 20 mol l nacl solution current intensity 15 ma and reaction time 60 min the results of the investigation into how the ph of the solution affected the performance of the ni mwcnts oh ti electrode were displayed in fig 3 e within a certain range of reaction times the removal rate of dox decreased gradually with a decrease in ph reducing the ph value to 1 increased the removal efficiency initially but it rapidly decreased after a while at this time the most obvious electrode degradation phenomenon appeared and the current efficiency dropped rapidly before the electrode was destroyed the ph value of the solution had little influence on the overall efficiency of the system as well so the best ph value for degrading dox was 4 degradation effects of dox were linearly fitted to solutions with different ph values fig 3 j the reaction rate constants of dox degradation by ni mwcnts oh ti electrodes were in accordance with langmuir hinshelwood pseudo first order reaction kinetics it can be seen that when the ph was 4 0 01989 min 1 the highest rate constant of degradation reaction was observed experiments confirmed this to investigate the practicability of the ni mwcnts oh ti electrode the continuous electrochemical degradation of dox was studied in fig 3 f the removal efficiency of dox dropped from 72 46 to 71 89 after 10 times of continuous use which had little effect on the removal rate of dox indicating that the ni mwcnts oh ti electrode had well stability this showed that the ni mwcnts oh ti electrode prepared in this study had good practical potential which provided the possibility for further practical application at present there is little research on electrocatalytic treatment of dox we compared this material with other composite materials as shown in table 1 compared with other composite materials ni mwcnts oh ti composite electrode can treat dox with high concentration and has good treatment effect therefore this electrode is expected to be a candidate electrode for dox degradation 3 4 degradation mechanism of dox by ni mwcnts oh ti oh as the most important active oxidizing substance in the electrocatalytic reaction system its output directly affects the degradation and removal effect of organic pollutants 25 to verify the oh produced by the ni mwcnts oh ti electrode in the process of dox degradation the output in the reaction process was detected by indirect measurement the target simulated degradation substance was replaced by coumarin in the same electrocatalytic degradation test system and the oh produced in the reaction process would be captured 44 45 the fluorescent substance would be generated with coumarin and the characteristic fluorescence peak would appear in the process of fluorescence detection and then fluorescence spectrophotometry was used for detection thereby further obtaining oh related data the fluorescence intensity of 7 hydroxycoumarin increases with the duration of the degradation reaction as shown in fig 4 accordingly during the electrocatalytic oxidation of dox on the ni mwcnts oh ti electrode oh was generated and freely diffused into the reaction solution it can oxidize and degrade dox 2 dox e oxide 3 h 2 o oh h e 4 oh dox oxide xco 2 yh 2 o 5 oh reduzate oxide 6 dox ne reduzate 7 h ni ni h 8 h e h 9 h dox reduzate 10 h dox reduzate 11 h h e h 2 12 h h h 2 where dox represents the degradation intermediate of dox the h is a chemically adsorbed active hydrogen atom both the anode and cathode coexisted in this experiment to remove dox so the degradation of dox was catalyzed by the anode and cathode and oxidation and reduction took place simultaneously 46 dox adsorbed on the anode directly lost electrons and was oxidized which was the direct oxidation process of dox eq 2 the oh played a significant role in the degradation of dox 38 the water was oxidized to heterogeneous oh by anodic oxidation eq 3 the oh was adsorbed on the anode surface and oxidized with dox producing oxide h2o and co2 eq 4 at the same time the products reduced by the cathode were oxidized by oh eq 5 besides oxidation there was reduction in the whole electrocatalytic system 47 the reduction reaction can be divided into indirect reduction and direct reduction dox adsorbed on the surface of the electrode was directly reduced by the electrode eq 6 which was the direct reduction process of dox 46 the key to indirect reduction lied in the adsorbed hydrogen produced on the cathode surface and this process was more likely to occur under the action of transition metal catalysts 48 50 the outer electronic structure of ni contained d electrons and empty d orbitals and the cni hybrid orbital coordination structure formed by sp d orbital charge transferred with surrounding carbon atoms can promote catalytic activity and electrochemical stability 34 hydrogen atoms generated by hydrolysis were easily adsorbed on the surface of ni 51 eq 7 this was beneficial for the h on the electrode surface to attack the positively charged carbon atoms in dox and took a reduction so that dox was degraded this experiment deals with acidic conditions low concentration of oh can also promote the dissociation and adsorption process of h2 on the electrode surface and increase the rate of h generation 52 53 in volmer step h got electrons to generate h eq 8 the generated h reduced dox eq 9 and its intermediate products eq 10 at the cathode to generate a reduction product 54 the generated potential of h2 was smaller than that of h 55 so h2 was generated by heyrovsky step eq 11 and tafel step eq 12 at the same time in the presence of the catalyst the generated hydrogen can enter the metal lattice nih and reduce dox and its intermediate products 51 therefore the ni mwcnts oh ti electrode cathode prepared in this study can degrade dox by co catalysis with anode in order to comprehensively investigate the degradation pathway and intermediates generated by the ni mwcnts oh ti electrode lc ms was performed fig 5 showed the lc ms spectrum of the intermediate product obtained from the degradation of dox by a ni mwcnts oh ti electrode at the position of the ion peak m z in this experiment while oh oxidized dox and its intermediates the active atom h also had a reducing effect during hydrogenation reactions of cc and co ni mwcnts oh ti electrodes demonstrate extremely high catalytic activity and stability 56 therefore there were two pathways to decompose dox there were several ionizable and electron rich functional groups such as dimethyl amino group phenolic group conjugated double bond and so on within the dox molecule which can be easily attacked by oh 27 57 58 the double bonds in p1 m z 461 and p2 m z 477 were attacked by oh in sequence and the oh groups nearby were oxidized into carbonyl groups under the action of oh the methyl group of dox was oxidized and under the action of h the carbonyl group was the convention to the hydroxyl group to obtain p3 m z 433 59 after demethylation p4 m z 449 p5 m z 384 p6 m z 417 p7 m z 401 and p8 m z 374 were formed from p3 m z 433 to p8 m z 374 it was the process of demethylation of dimethylamino with the progress of the reaction the ring opening demethylation of the above intermediates continuously produced compounds with simpler structures such as p9 m z 318 p10 m z 301 p11 m z 135 and p12 m z 122 eventually these products were further degraded into smaller molecules 3 5 toxicity test of ni mwcnts oh ti electrode to investigate the safety of using ni mwcnts oh ti electrodes in degrading dox a toxicity experiment was conducted the toxicity of the intermediate products and final products of the dox solution was compared and analyzed by microbial culture experiment e coli was selected as the experimental strain and e coli cultures were cultured in different dox degradation solutions for different periods of time and the toxicity of the degradation solution was assessed by counting the colonies fig s 1 a showed the culture medium containing water and the culture medium with ultrapure water was shown in fig s 1 b whereas the culture medium with different degradation times 0 15 30 45 and 60 min was shown in fig s 1 c g table s 1 showed the number and inhibitory rate of e coli in the culture medium the effects of electro catalytic degradation of dox on fish daphnids and green algae were simulated using ecosar 2 2 for acute and chronic toxicity 60 the results were shown in table s 2 fig 6 a showed the suppression ratio of e coli cultured in different conditions distilled water blank control and microbial culture medium cultivated with dox wastewater in different periods in the illustration of fig 6 a the colony number of e coli in seven time periods were 237 0 82 188 190 132 and 222 respectively the dox can inhibit the growth of e coli and the inhibition rate was 65 4 with the progress of the degradation reaction dox was oxidized and decomposed into small molecules and its toxicity to e coli is reduced the toxicity increased after 45 min of reaction in this process toxic substances were produced after 60 min of reaction the degradation solution had the lowest toxicity to e coli which meat that the application of ni mwcnts oh ti electrode in water treatment was safe based on ecosar 2 2 the acute and chronic toxicity of intermediates and products produced in the degradation process to fish daphnia and green algae were examined to understand the environmental risk of treating dox with ni mwcnts oh ti in fig 6 b the acute toxicity of dox to aquatic organisms increased in the process of degradation to p1 p2 and p4 and decreased when it was degraded to p3 p5 p6 p7 p8 and p9 which was lower than that of the parent compound however with further degradation the acute toxicity reached its maximum when it degraded to p10 in fig 6 c in the electrocatalytic degradation of dox at the beginning the chronic toxicity of dox gradually increased and the chronic toxicity of the product p2 to aquatic organisms reached the maximum much higher than that of the parent compound as the degradation reaction advances the acute and chronic toxicity of the products were gradually reduced and p5 p7 p8 and h2o were harmless to aquatic organisms 4 conclusions in this study the ni mwcnts oh ti electrode with excellent electrocatalytic activity and high stability was successfully prepared and used to degrade dox under the optimum preparation conditions and experimental parameters the removal rate of dox was 76 46 within 60 min in terms of reaction kinetics the rate at which dox was degraded by ni mwcnts oh ti electrodes was consistent with langmuir hinshelwood quasi first order models after 10 times of continuous use the removal rate of dox was still higher than 70 which indicated that ni mwcnts oh ti electrode had excellent stability and reproducibility the oxidation reduction mechanism of dox by oh and active atom h was proposed the results of lc ms analysis showed that dox can be effectively treated by demethylation and dehydration in addition the toxicity test of e coli and ecosar 2 2 proved that the toxicity of ni mwcnts oh ti electrode after treating dox for 60 min was significantly reduced therefore the ni mwcnts oh ti electrode will provide a new idea for the degradation of

12706,a laboratory scale dual chambered bioanode and biocathode based microbial fuel cell mfc was employed in the biodegradation of a dye reactive red 195 rr195 and pesticide chlorpyrifos using bacterial and fungal strains uv spectrophotometery and and fourier transform infrared ftir data showed removal rates of almost 100 for both dye 150 mg l and pesticide 50 mg l with 70 and 81 chemical oxygen demand cod in 18 h and 48 h respectively bio electrochemical degradation of said pollutants was also coupled with simultaneous generation of electricity the maximal cell potential was recorded

effective in the treatment of ecological hazardous aromatic pollutants such as dyes i e rr 195 and pesticides e g chlorpyrifos and for harnessing energy graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords bacterial mfc fungal mfc rr 195 chlorpyrifos biodegradation power voltage cv ca data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction rapid industrialization and agriculture have had numerous beneficial and harmful environmental consequences they dyes are employed in a variety of industries including those that deal with textiles tanneries cosmetics rubber plastics leather paper pulp printing pharmaceuticals and food 1 3 these colors cause allergies are cancerous and are harmful to aquatic life the environment people and animals 2 4 6 because of the intricate structure of these dyes and pesticides they are difficult to remove and are not aesthetically pleasing 7 8 in addition global pesticide production rose from 0 2 million tons in the 1950s to 5 million tons by 2000 at a pace of nearly 11 annually every year nearly 3 billion kg of pesticides are used worldwide 9 11 the long term effect of these lethal aromatic chemicals exposure incorporates their teratogenicity carcinogenicity nervous system diseases neurotoxicity and reproductive disorders 11 12 reactive red 195 is a textile azo dye with a reactive group sixty five to 75 of all textile dyes are azo dyes which are distinguished by the azo group n n as the chromophore and the so3h sulphonate as the auxochrome group the auxochrome groups are ionizable in aqueous conditions and provide the colors and their binding qualities to the fiber 13 86 on the other hand chlorpyrifos is a broad spectrum organophosphate pesticide that is utilized to control a variety of insects and pests on crops 14 chlorpyrifos toxicity is mostly due to its inhibition of acetyl cholinesterase ache activity which affects both the central and peripheral nervous systems 12 85 the inappropriate storage or disposal of chlorpyrifos as well as its abuse is a major source of possible environmental pollution various traditional methods such as ion exchange adsorption filtration photocatalytic degradation and advanced oxidation process are conventionally used for the elimination of dyes and pesticides from their effluents but they have the drawback of producing secondary pollutants and being expensive 2 3 12 15 the sorption processes have the drawback of treating the contaminants instead only shift them from waste to adsorbent in addition while some bacteria and fungi may break down these contaminants the use of these biological processes produces an excessive amount of sludge 16 as a result novel and efficient procedures for the biodegradation of these toxic effluents are critical although it has been thought that combining the two methods for electrochemical bioremediation of wastewater can be more effective it is also a viable option for the treatment of dye pesticide and other harmful organics as well as energy production 17 19 mfc is a new clean and green technology that is recently used to remove dyes and pesticides it has various advantages including no subsidiary waste formation as a result the of anaerobic aerobic type of the degradation process mfc systems are superior to standalone anaerobic and aerobic bioremediation because they create electricity while degrading at a faster rate 20 despite its high cost mfc technology can be utilized instead of biological and conventional procedures because of its dual use of energy production and quicker degradation 21 86 the biocathode system of mfc comprises microorganisms that act as biocatalysts in the anode driving the breakdown of organic materials to generate electrons that move to the cathode which also includes microorganisms chamber through an electric circuit free electrons present on the mfc cathode trigger the reduction of oxygen to generate water microorganisms will in this instance receive electrons at the cathode by reducing electron acceptors such as oxygen nitrate sulphate perchlorates and metals 22 25 thus biodegradable organic matter is transformed by mfcs into energy hydrogen or other compounds with additional value 26 28 due to its cost effectiveness use of self regenerate catalysts and sustainable power supply biocathodes in mfc have recently attracted attention for the removal of various pollutants 29 30 additionally progress has been made by utilizing a variety of microorganisms as biocatalysts on biocathodes 29 32 according to studies the presence of microorganisms at the cathode can improve mfcs performance 31 34 not only do biocathodes with biofilms catalyze the reduction of oxygen at the cathode but they also exhibit performance levels that are equivalent to or superior to those of an abiotic cathode 35 36 although biocathodes have a lot of potential for mfc technology problems with biocatalyst performance at terminal acceptor conditions cathodic activation overpotentials 37 38 biofouling accumulation and competition of metabolite 39 40 among others need to be resolved for them to be used widely in the future to achieve that more discussion regarding long term operation and the scaling up of biocathodes is required to make the biocathode mfcs technology more feasible 41 several studies of dye and pesticide degradation via mfc have been stated by various researchers in the past 42 44 in the reported study the decolorization of reactive brilliant red x 3b was done using mfc 45 and in 46 effectively degraded acid orange 7 90 was achieved in a microbial fuel cell with two phase an aerobic bioreactor system recently mishra et al 47 have efficiently removed a blend of reactive orange 16 and reactive red 21 by pseudomonas aeruginosa 23 n1 in mfc the degradation of these dyes shows toxic and cytotoxic attributes 46 48 some researchers have reported the bioelectrochemical treatment for pesticides with mfcs however they are restricted to minor concentrations with consequently lower power densities pd 16 49 meanwhile mfcs have been shown to dramatically improve the removal efficiency of refractory pesticides like hexachlorobenzene sulphamethoxazole and pentachlorophenol 17 50 51 the mfc is a good contender for the elimination of environmental toxins because of the aforementioned features however research into rr 195 and chlorpyrifos degradation by biocathode based mfcs currently limited and it is unclear if mfc can successfully break down these pollutants while still producing power additionally the degradation of dye and pesticide with simultaneous bioenergy production in bacterial bacterial bioanodic and biocathodic and fungal bioanode bacteria biocathode fungus mfc systems is rarely compared in the literature which is the major focus of this research in this study the removal of rr 195 and chlorpyrifos in bacterial and fungal mfc were reactors was examined with the capability to remove pollutants and generate electricity moreover efforts have been made to connect the bioenergy output with the degradation of pollutants and chemical oxygen demand cod in biocathodes containing dye and pesticides the bioelectrochemical behavior of the system was studied using cyclic voltammetry cv chronoamperometry ca and the performance assessment was carried out by estimating the cell potential power density pd and the cod removal efficiency of the two mfc systems spectrophotometric and ftir techniques further examined the percentages of degradation and analysis of degraded metabolites scanning electron microscopy sem was also employed to study the surface morphologies of bioelectrodes from both studied mfc systems the reactor was also tested for the simultaneous biodegradation of real textile wastewater and bioelectricity production the findings of this study on pollutant bio electrochemical degradation will aid in the development of novel tactics for large scale wastewater treatment plants that also produce energy 2 experimental 2 1 screening of dye and pesticide degrading isolates the microorganisms which could biodegrade dye and pesticide were procured from microbial biotechnology and bioengineering lab department of microbiology quaid i azam university islamabad pakistan these microorganisms include five fungal isolates including aspergillus niger alternaria alternata fusarium oxysporum trichoderma spp and rhizopus spp and four bacterial strains including staphylococcus aureus pseudomonas aeruginosa bacillus subtilis and e coli these efficient pollutants degrading bacterial and fungal isolates were screened using agar the plating method and submerged fermentation then optimized under different conditions static shaking aerobic and microaerophilic at variable pollutant concentrations ranging from 10 to 100 mg l and finally incubated at 37 c and 28 c for 7 days the degradation of pollutants was analyzed by the formation of zones on agar plates and by uv spectrophotometer in terms of percentages 52 53 2 2 biocathode fabrication and biofilm formation carbon felt cf was consistently cut into a square of 6 by 3 cm washed with deionized water submerged in 1000 ml of deionized water for 2 h and then periodically rinse with deionized water for 40 min to yield modified carbon felt the washed cf was put in a beaker with 20 w v nitric acid agitated for 2 h in a constant temperature oscillator and then rinsed with deionized water the material was then dried for 10 h at 130 c in a constant temperature drying oven then removed and stored in a desiccator until needed 54 85 biofilm formation on the electrode was taken place in a 50 ml agar plate then a suspension of bacterial and fungal isolates was vortexed and was further diluted up to 4 folds 10 1 10 2 10 3 and 10 4 the fabricated modified carbon felt was positioned on the surface of the agar plate and 4 ml suspension of 10 4 fold was poured drop by drop on the electrode for the formation of biofilm on the surface and placed in an incubator at 37 c and 28 c for 4 days this electrode was then used in the cathodic chamber of mfc as a biocathode electrode 2 3 mfc construction and operation two glass bottles with a working volume of 350 ml were used to create a two chamber mfc reactor a proton exchange membrane pem nafion 117 was used to separate the two chambers of the mfcs the electrodes are suspended from the top of each chamber entirely submerged in the electrolyte and are connected to an external resistor through the copper wire 0 8 mm in diameter a wastewater treatment plant islamabad pakistan provided the pre enriched activated sludge used as inoculum in bioanode in the anode chamber activated sludge was supplied with wastewater in a 3 50 ratio all reactors were autoclaved for 20 min at 121 c for the treatment of synthetic wastewater the cathode of the mfc reactors was then injected with various quantities of dye and pesticide the devices were distributed into three groups and functioned in two modes which were bacterial mfc fungal mfc and control mfc without pollutant operated in open circuit mode and closed circuit mode to increase the cathode potential minimal liquid medium was utilized as catholyte for bacterial and fungal mfc respectively all of the reactors were run in batch mode when the mfc s output voltage fell below 100 mv its catholyte was replaced considered a cycle for real wastewater treatment effluent containing dye was added into the mfc and was investigated under batch mode for 3 days before chemical analysis samples were removed from the biocathode stored at 80 c experiments were conducted at ambient temperature between 28 and 37 2 c 53 55 2 4 investigation of biodegradation of dye and pesticide in mfc and analytical methods 2 4 1 degradation of rr195 and chlorpyrifos a uv vis spectrophotometer cecil 2502 was used to monitor the change in absorbance for dye and pesticide at 545 nm and 289 nm respectively eq 1 was used to calculate the percentage of degradation and the concentration of pollutant degraded 1 percentage biodegradati o n initial absorbance final absorbance initial absorbance 100 the chemical oxygen demand cod removal efficiency was evaluated using eq 2 and the 5220c standard technique american public health association 2005 by calculating the initial and final cod of the samples from the mfc chamber and using cod test kits with a range of 1 15 000 mg l 2 cod removal efficiency 100 1 final cod initial cod 2 4 2 investigation of degraded metabolites of rr 195 and chlorpyrifos by ftir the kbr pellet method was used to perform ftir analysis for the control dye and pesticide and its metabolites after trial in a ratio of 1 10 percent wavenumbers 400 to 4000 cm 1 were used to measure transmittance 56 2 4 3 electrochemical parameters and instrumental measurements the voltage output across the exterior load was measured by a digital millimeter power density pd was calculated using eq 3 3 pd v 2 ra where v is the output voltage mv r is the external resistance u and a is the electrode area m2 the temperature tds ph and electrical conductivity ec were all measured using standard temperature tds ph and ec meters by using a uv visible spectrophotometer cecil 2502 to monitor the microbial cell growth absorbance at 600 nm in terms of optical density in a temperature range of 30 c all experiments were repeated in duplicate the surface morphologies of biocathodes and bioanodes derived from both mfc systems were examined by scanning electron microscopy sem the samples were cleaned in phosphate buffer with ph 7 2 and fixed overnight with a 2 glutaraldehyde solution before sem examination the samples were then rinsed in ethanol solutions containing 10 30 50 70 90 and 100 ethanol and dried for two days 57 2 4 4 analytical procedures voltammetric techniques were used to investigate the redox reaction happening at the surface of the bioelectrodes in the reactor systems the performance of all three reactors bacterial mfc fungal mfc and control reactor systems was evaluated by monitoring the anodic and cathodic potential the reference electrode was a kcl saturated ag agcl electrode using anode as a working electrode anode potential was determined with reference to ag agcl s cyclic voltammetry cv was performed using bioanode as working electrode and biocathode as counter electrode against ag agcl s reference electrode while chronoamperometry ca and cyclic voltammetry cv were used to examine the bioelectrochemical behavior of biocathode via potentiostat sp150 using a three electrode cv device the cv was calculated b monitoring current over a particular potential range the electrochemical performance was investigated using a scan rate of 20 mvs 1 over a potential range of 1 to 1 0 v 3 results and discussion 3 1 synthetic wastewater treatment potential of bacterial and fungal based mfc 3 1 1 selection of dye and pesticide degrading isolates nine morphologically different isolates were obtained for degradation of the rr195 dye and chlorpyrifos pesticide on agar plates and msm medium containing erlenmeyer flasks all nine isolates including bacterial and fungal strains were exposed to degradation of rr195 and chlorpyrifos at a varying concentrations ranging from 10 to 100 mg l from various experimental conditions a bacterial strain staphylococcus aureus and a fungal isolate aspergillus niger were selected as potential rr195 and chlorpyrifos degrading isolates the performance of bacterial isolate was maximum under the combined aerobic and microaerophilic static conditions at 37 c ph 7 while fungus grows best under shaking conditions at 28 c and ph 5 with maximum biodegrading efficiency sri et al have also reported the similar isolate with similar incubating conditions and now here in this study it was also confirmed for dye and pesticide degradation 52 53 the decolorization efficiency of selected strains were studied by measuring the optical density after 24 48 to 168 h of incubation and the results were plotted it was noticed that there was a decrease in the optical density od as the incubation period increased the percentage of degradation was also calculated and it was found that staphylococcus aureus and aspergillus niger showed 90 and 95 degradation efficiency of dye and pesticide in two weeks respectively 3 1 2 biodegradation and cod removal of pollutants in mfc the most efficient isolate one from bacterial staphylococcus aureus and one from fungal aspergillus niger was selected for the construction of bacterial and fungal mfc for rr195 and chlorpyrifos degradation respectively degradation was investigated for rr195 and chlorpyrifos at different concentrations of 15 300 mg l and 15 100 mg l for dyes and pesticide respectively with ph 4 0 7 0 in both cases similar degradation trends were observed with an increase in the concentration of pollutants the experiment was carried out for 40 days and divided into two tests i e test 1 21 days and test 2 7 days to check the efficiency of bioelectrodes six dye concentrations such as 15 30 50 100 150 200 and 300 mg l were used to analyses the decolorization efficiency in bacterial mfc with time and the results are presented in fig 1 in this study 15 ppm concentration takes 75 h to decolorize 98 of dye but 30 mg l 98 in 58 h 50 mg l 98 in 48 h 100 mg l 98 in 46 h 150 mg l 100 in 45 h were decolorized in less time even though they were in higher concentrations it is probably due to that at earlier hours the biofilm on the electrode was not fully developed and stable but it matures with time and acted efficiently to degrade the dye thus the biofilm utilized untreated dye as the sole carbon source because there was no other carbon substrate in liquid media and degradation efficiency increased from 98 at 15 30 50 and 100 mg l to 100 at 150 and 200 mg l and then again fall to 92 at 300 mg l for every concentration but it varies with the time both in test 1 and 2 afterward at 200 and 300 mg l concentrations decolorization was achieved after 90 and 150 h respectively and took more time compared to initial concentrations because of dye toxicity and accumulation of bacterial debris in catholyte that now act on biocathode and consequently no further dye degradation could achieve in the cathodic chamber of bacterial mfc the 1st test took 21 days to completion moreover after 21 days the previous catholyte was completely removed and replaced with a new one in the cathodic chamber of bacterial mfc in a fully sterile environment to check the stability and efficiency of the biocathode and the working of mfc so from current study it was revealed that same concentrations of dye 15 mg l 98 in 8 h 30 mg l 98 in 10 h 50 mg l 98 in 12 h 100 mg l 98 in 15 h 150 mg l 100 in 18 h 200 mg l 100 in 24 h and 300 mg l 92 in 30 h in test 2 acquired less time i e only 5 days to completely degrade in mfc as compared to test 1 that took 21 days similar studies have been previously conducted and the resulting response validates the results of our experiments for evaluating the potential of bacterial strains for degradation and bioremediation of rr195 in mfc 42 55 thus it is assumed that changing the catholyte every ten days might result in the degradation of higher dye concentrations possibly up to 600 mg l or 700 mg l in fungal mfc during test 1 with increasing concentrations of pesticide its degradation efficiency also increased i e 15 mg l 91 in 96 h 30 mg l 93 in 96 h 50 mg l 95 in 96 h but degradation follows the reverse order after introduction of 100 mg l 75 in 216 h in cathode chamber then with the increase in the concentration of pesticide degradation starts to decrease which might be due to the higher toxicity of chlorpyrifos large mycelial growth on the cathode and accumulation of debris in the medium a similar pattern of pesticide degradation was also observed during test 2 of fungal mfc when catholyte was completely removed and replaced with a new one then the addition of 15 mg l concentration resulted in 97 degradation within 36 h and the addition of higher pesticide concentrations results in enhanced degradation efficiency in less time i e 30 mg l 97 in 36 h 50 mg l 98 in 48 h and 100 mg l 95 in 48 h the results obtained from test 2 were analogous to that of test 1 as shown in fig 2 which discovered the increasing degradation efficiency with increasing concentration till the tolerance point i e 100 mg l in the case of fungal mfc ph has an effective role in the degradation of pesticide as fungal cells normally grow at low ph 5 7 58 during the course of maximum degradation efficiency ph was maintained at 5 i e 15 mg l 30 mg l 50 mg l but for the remaining concentration it shifts from 5 to 4 causing a reduction in degradation efficiency this phenomenon might be ascribed to the toxicity of the degraded metabolites towards fungus at a higher concentration of pesticide 59 60 degradation of pesticide follows the order for ph 5 0 4 0 and for concentration mg l 15 30 50 100 and it was also cleared from the graph that maximum rr195 and chlorpyrifos degradation were obtained at 150 200 mg l and 50 mg l up to 100 and 95 during test 1 in bacterial and fungal mfc respectively and during test 2 for both mfcs up to 100 and 98 degradation was achieved at similar concentrations respectively the reactors performance was also evaluated in terms of cod elimination the amount of organic carbon recovered in the form of electricity was precisely proportional to the total cod removed from the system indicating that energy is created in mfc at the expenditure of cod 61 the early cod of the system holding 100 mg l of dye and pesticide was 5920 mg l and 6910 mg l and the cod was fallen to 1779 mg l and 1310 mg l for bacterial as well as fungal mfc respectively during the progression of 21 days of degradation the cod removal efficiency was found to be a maximum for 100 ppm for both the reactor systems 70 in bacterial mfc and 81 in fungal mfc 3 1 3 analysis of metabolites of pollutants in mfc via ftir ftir spectra in fig 3 showed significant variation among the treated and the control dye sample the spectrum of the control dye showed a strong peak at 3420 cm 1 and 3113 cm 1 matches to the nh and ch stretching another prominent peak at 1756 cm 1 and 1619 cm 1 links to co and cc stretching respectively the peaks observed at 1322 1294 and 1104 cm 1 correspond to so cn and co stretching indicating sulfone strong aromatic amines and aliphatic ether the peak positions at 1035 986 886 and 733 cm 1 are characterized by the so cc bending and ch stretching respectively the ftir spectrum of treated rr195 after degradation showed significant transformation in the locus of peaks when matched to the control dye spectrum the peaks at 3264 3130 and 2948 cm 1 characterize ch stretching specifying the aliphatic nature of the formed metabolite a peak at 2137 and 2105 cm 1 represents weak cc stretching indicating alkyne the peaks at 1670 1541 1464 and 1339 cm 1 correspond to stretching of cc no ch and blending of oh respectively whereas a peak at 1071 1289 836 and 696 cm 1 which are corresponding to the co cn ccl and cc stretching support formation of alkenes aromatic amine primary alcohols and halo compounds 62 63 the structural alterations of rr195 and chlorpyrifos are better understood by the ftir spectrophotometer fig 4 shows the ftir spectra of chlorpyrifos and its metabolites there is a clear difference in the spectra suggesting chlorpyrifos breakdown chlorpyrifos spectra revealed bands at 2923 and 1606 cm 1 which correspond to the nh and co amide groups respectively cc stretching co stretching ch bending and ccl stretching have peak locations of 1410 1021 833 and 676 cm 1 respectively in sample concentrations of 15 mg ml 30 mg ml 50 mg ml and 100 mg ml bands were detected in the ftir spectra of chlorpyrifos degraded materials at 3282 3309 3280 and 3293 cm 1 respectively which correspond to the nh group the amide ii group is represented by 1634 1635 1634 and 1634 cm 1 bands in chlorpyrifos degraded materials with concentrations of 15 mg ml 30 mg ml 50 mg ml and 100 mg ml respectively the 1410 1021 833 and 676 cm 1 bands of the chlorpyrifos ftir spectra vanished in chlorpyrifos degraded materials at all concentrations the features of ccl deformation include bands at 575 578 578 and 570 cm 1 in chlorpyrifos degraded samples of 15 mg ml 30 mg ml 50 mg ml and 100 mg ml respectively overall the results indicate that chlorpyrifos in the samples has been degraded 64 3 1 4 biocathode characterization by sem analysis the surface morphologies of biocathodes of bacterial and fungal mfcs were analyzed using sem fig 5 c d and e f displayed the sem images of biocathodes acquired from both mfc systems at diverse magnifications 250 1000 2500 respectively the microscopic images obtained from both reactors showed the presence of enormous bacterial biofilm and fungal growth on the cathodic surface fig 5 a and b illustrated the sem images of the electrode surface before and after the modification 3 1 5 electrochemical behavior and performance of mfc 3 1 5 1 bioelectricity generation the bioenergy recovered during the breakdown of pollutants in bacterial mfc and fungal mfc was measured in terms of cell potential mv during the test period and the findings are shown in fig 6 with the addition of dye and pesticide to both mfc systems it was discovered that current output was initially low this could be because the biological system was not yet stable enough to withstand the damaging effects of increasing pollution concentrations but as the sludge became further accustomed to the process over time the current output increased in the instance of bacterial mfc the potential was seen to attain a peak value of 635 mv at 150 mg l of rr195 and then decline as the dye concentration was increased in fungal mfc however the cell potential increased as the concentration was exceeded from 15 to 50 mg l peaking at 706 mv and then fell as the concentration was increased to 100 ppm however as the concentration was increased further the voltage production decreased due to the increased toxicity other scientists have found similar developments in mfc treatment of hazardous substances in the current generation 65 66 to stimulate microbial activity and growth the system was given medium twice a week the concentration of added substrate declined with time for a given cycle and subsequently the current i was reduced to the minimum value due to substrate restrictions the graph s peaks represent the addition of new media the toxic action of rr195 and chlorpyrifos on bacterial and fungal biofilms could explain the decreasing trend of current with increasing pollutant concentrations 19 which led to poor microbial activity and consequently decreased the production of current this means that the substrate should be provided at regular intervals to maintain the required feast to famine ratio for continuous energy production the reduced output voltage seen after the addition of dye and pesticide shows that these pollutants have an inhibitory effect on microorganisms and as a result it affect the mfc performance the pd shown in fig 7 on the other hand was highest 224 01 mw m 2 at 150 mg l for bacterial mfc however the pd for fungal mfc was found to be highest at 50 mg l 276 9 mw m 2 which is much higher than the other reported studies employing fungus as a cathode catalyst 39 67 68 the peaks on the pd curve correlate to the addition of minimum medium for the first time when the co substrate was introduced to the medium the pd peaked the decreased pd in the presence of bacterial mfc could be owing to other pathways such as methanogenesis in which the electrons created were lost and thus cannot be regained as energy output even though the maximum cod reduction was at 100 mg l in the case of bacterial mfc the maximum pd was 150 mg l this behavior could be explained by one of two factors either electrons were lost in alternate pathways in bacterial mfc or the biofilm took longer to become sustainable in bacterial mfc resulting in lower power output at 100 ppm while cod removal was best at 100 mg l for fungal mfc th highest pd was attained at 50 mg l where the degradation rate was also highest then when the concentration of pollutants increased pd fell indicating that the pollutants had an inhibitory impact on microorganisms resulting in lower power output 19 69 3 1 5 2 current response by cyclic voltammetry a cv study of the bioelectrode was achieved to understand the electron transfer course from the bacterial and fungal biofilm to the underneath electrode the electrochemical behavior of bioanode and biocathode present in both bacterial mfc and fungal mfc was investigated a three electrode system was employed to perform cv at a scan rate of 20 mv s a voltammogram obtained from anodic chamber displayed a narrow redox loop attained for both bacterial mfc and fungal mfc validating the accumulation of biofilm on bioanode with time and these active microbial communities carried out the electron transfer figs 8 9 shows the voltammograms at a scan rate of 20 mvs 1 for both mfcs wherein a redox loop with a forward peak was obtained at 0 1 v two reverse peaks were found at 0 1 v and 0 5 v showing that microorganisms in the anodic chamber of both mfcs have minimal redox activity when no pollutant is present the reduced anodic potential of bioanode significantly suggests high bacterial colonization on the anode material and easy cellular electron transport to the electrode for the cathodic chamber the broader voltammogram in the case of bacterial and fungal mfc could specify its enhanced performance compared to the anode in terms of stability as well as capacitance 70 when compared to the control which contained no pollution the voltammograms obtained for both mfcs were completely different in character the bio electrode s biofilm grown cathodic potential was found to be between 1 and 1 v which is much greater than the bioanode the redox current response of the biocathode was much higher than the bioanode having no pollutant for both mfcs a derivative voltammogram of the biocathodes was constructed and displayed numerous inflecting peaks some of the highlighted peaks obtained from biocathode of bacterial mfcs with the redox potentials v of 0 15 peak 1 0 58 peak 2 0 79 peak 3 0 88 peak 4 0 12 peak 5 0 39 peak 6 0 57 peak 7 0 6 peak 8 0 85 peak 9 and 0 95 peak 10 observed in the derived voltammogram shown in fig 10 while for fungal mfc peaks with redox potential of 0 12 peak 1 0 21 peak 2 0 67 peak 3 0 79 peak 4 0 002 peak 5 0 25 peak 6 0 49 peak 7 0 51 peak 8 0 66 peak 9 0 73 peak 10 0 86 peak 11 0 94 peak 12 was observed as shown in fig 11 these reducing equivalents with redox potential are predicted to improve the flow of metabolic electrons to the cathode while avoiding the electron scavenging effect of oxygen produced the current response of bacterial mfc was much higher than fungal mfc for bacterial mfc with an increase of concentration of dye current response also increases maximum response was recorded at 150 mg l and 200 mg l which were 118 ma and 122 ma respectively in biocathode while for fungal mfc the current response reaches up to 27 35 ma for 50 ppm concentration where the rate of degradation was also highest the low current response in fungal mfc compared to bacterial mfc was attributed to the limited electron transfer due to the adhesion of fungus to the carbon felt electrode 71 these cathodic current responses of both mfcs were also much higher than their respective bioanodes demonstrating the presence of pollutant and pure culture in biocathode resulted in accelerated efficiency of the mfc 3 1 5 3 current response by chronoamperometry ca analysis was conducted to determine electrochemical parameters of maximum current intensities during cultivation and in situ simultaneous oxygen reduction to reveal the steady current production in a system we can calculate the number of electrons that were effectively deprived from the substrate using these characteristics to monitor the stable currents in the system ca was done by applying a potential of 0 2 v continuously over a period of 1800 s at 24 h intervals initially maximum current generation was detected which steadily dropped over time and settled at a point that could be deemed sustainable current generation 72 higher stabilized currents were observed in the cathodic chamber of the bacterial and fungal mfc system in comparison to the anodic chamber of the mfc system relatively bacterial mfc represented maximum sustainable currents 13 8 3 ma followed by fungal mfc 10 66 2 34 ma systems at 150 mg l and 50 mg l respectively where the rate of degradation was also maximum fig 12 this might be attributed to the activity of electrochemical microorganisms which aid in the continual emission of electrons enabling power generation in the anode chamber lower values of currents i were observed bacterial mfc 0 57 0 097 ma and fungal mfc 0 14 0 018 ma which might be influenced by the absence of pollutants and low level of the electrogenic environment in the system the substantial variation in bioelectrochemical activity revealed by the biocatalysts might be one of the credible reasons for the improved performance of the cathodic system compared to the anodic system of both bacterial and fungal mfcs the performance of both bacterial and fungal mfc systems is given in table 1 3 2 dye containing real wastewater treatment potential of the mfc system the batch tests cod removal efficiency and the mfc s capabilities for treating real wastewater have been investigated the effluent of the mfc showed a noticeable decolorization of the wastewater indicating the viability of wastewater treatment the batch trial on the mfc system revealed 95 colour removal at its maximum given that it appeared to have created ideal circumstances for microbial development the biologically degradable oxidizable organic percentage of the actual effluent may be responsible for the significant colour loss as a result we deduced that the bioelectrogenic process and colour removal were related in some way the results of this investigation exceeded those of a prior study which produced decolorization values of 45 60 by taking colour removal and wastewater type into account 73 other studies have shown 73 74 and nearly complete decolorization 37 the ph of the real wastewater in the mfc varied during the experiment from being alkaline ph 8 6 to neutral ph 7 1 the simultaneous modification of ph in the mfc would be a huge benefit for wastewater treatment because the actual wastewater is complicated this conclusion is consistent with that made by 75 mfc had a 72 cod elimination efficiency after the experiment although substantially higher levels of cod removal are reported in other studies our results are similar to those of 76 who showed high substrate removal at neutral ph other studies that handled the same kind of wastewater produced cod removal efficiencies of up to 71 74 these findings demonstrated how wastewater was treated bioelectrochemically to remove organic debris and colour the performance of the bioelectrochemical system was not great in terms of cod removal efficiency therefore a more practical method would involve transforming the organic matter in the real effluent using a mixed redox metabolism of electrogenic and or anaerobic non electrogenic bacteria to learn more about the precise function played by each bacterial group more research is required when real wastewater treatment was combined with high power density output the performance was superior fig 13 to that of domestic brewing and starch processing wastewater treatments other parameters including tds and ec have also been measured and eminent change has been observed between the initial and final values from 470 ppm to 608 ppm for tds and from 986 us cm to 1187 us cm for ec respectively current response by cv and ca has also been measured showing a high response rate current production and stabilization as shown in figs 14 and 15 it should be mentioned that the real wastewater served as a microbiological and nutrient supply and was treated primarily in air exposed mfc reactors to remove colour organic charge and for current generation other investigations showed that the cod removal performance of the biocathode and control mfcs was two fold better than that of the experiment without electrodes 77 thus it was concluded that the bioelectrochemical system configuration electrode presence anode biofilm electron and proton release and flux were necessary for the treatment of the actual wastewater contrary to what buitron and moreno andrade 78 observed better removal efficiencies were achieved by common non electrogenic anaerobic bacteria than by electrogenic bacteria even though the pollutants being removed were different the power production and wastewater treatment capacity of this investigation were compared to those of other studies using biocathodes table 2 regardless of the processes that could take place in a broader perspective several reasons may be responsible for the relatively high power output experimental reactor design low internal resistance etc however it was noted that real wastewater was treated while electricity was generated 4 conclusion the mfc may greatly improve the removal efficiency of refractory organic compounds after a long acclimation period temperature ph and the original pollutant concentration all played a role in its breakdown the research shows that rr 195 and chlorpyrifos can be effectively treated in both bacterial and fungal dual chambered mfcs while also producing energy electrogenic bacteria on the anode produced enough electrons to boost the catabolic reaction efficiency of aromatics degrading bacteria and fungus at ph 7 over 100 dye 150 mg l and 98 pesticide 50 mg l were eliminated in 18 and 48 h respectively voltage and power density increase with increases in concentration from 15 to 150 mg l for bacterial mfc and 15 50 mg l for fungal mfc but both drop afterward due to the toxicity of pollutants towards bacteria and fungus the maximum value of cell potential for bacterial and fungal mfcs was 635 mv and 706 mv at 150 mg l and 50 mg l respectively maximum pollutant degradation was detected during this time and cod was reduced to a sufficient level with maximum cod removal of 70 and 81 seen at 100 mg l dye and pesticide respectively the system s ability to remove pollutants and their metabolites through the action of bacterial and fungal pure culture was demonstrated by the considerable reduction in cod levels furthermore after degradation significant peak shifts and the absence of an aromatic ring in ftir data suggest that contaminants are removed by biodegradation in mfc furthermore sem results revealed that bacteria and fungus may be effectively immobilized on electrodes the dye containing real wastewater treatment and electricity generation were also investigated sufficient cod removal 72 colour 95 as well as high power density 519 49 mwm 2 were accomplished the results of real wastewater treatment were comparable with the systems described in the literature interestingly considerable energy could be recovered from wastewater leading to self sustained wastewater treatment if the mfcs are optimized as a result harmful compounds can be efficiently handled in a bio electrochemical system while also producing power however further research is needed before this technique can be scaled up declaration of competing interest the authors

these dyes and pesticides they are difficult to remove and are not aesthetically pleasing 7 8 in addition global pesticide production rose from 0 2 million tons in the 1950s to 5 million tons by 2000 at a pace of nearly 11 annually every year nearly 3 billion kg of pesticides are used worldwide 9 11 the long term effect of these lethal aromatic chemicals exposure incorporates their teratogenicity carcinogenicity nervous system diseases neurotoxicity and reproductive disorders 11 12 reactive red 195 is a textile azo dye with a reactive group sixty five to 75 of all textile dyes are azo dyes which are distinguished by the azo group n n as the chromophore and the so3h sulphonate as the auxochrome group the auxochrome groups are ionizable in aqueous conditions and provide the colors and their binding qualities to the fiber 13 86 on the other hand chlorpyrifos is a broad spectrum organophosphate pesticide that is utilized to control a variety of insects and pests on crops 14 chlorpyrifos toxicity is mostly due to its inhibition of acetyl cholinesterase ache activity which affects both the central and peripheral nervous systems 12 85 the inappropriate storage or disposal of chlorpyrifos as well as its abuse is a major source of possible environmental pollution various traditional methods such as ion exchange adsorption filtration photocatalytic degradation and advanced oxidation process are conventionally used for the elimination of dyes and pesticides from their effluents but they have the drawback of producing secondary pollutants and being expensive 2 3 12 15 the sorption processes have the drawback of treating the contaminants instead only shift them from waste to adsorbent in addition while some bacteria and fungi may break down these contaminants the use of these biological processes produces an excessive amount of sludge 16 as a result novel and efficient procedures for the biodegradation of these toxic effluents are critical although it has been thought that combining the two methods for electrochemical bioremediation of wastewater can be more effective it is also a viable option for the treatment of dye pesticide and other harmful organics as well as energy production 17 19 mfc is a new clean and green technology that is recently used to remove dyes and pesticides it has various advantages including no subsidiary waste formation as a result the of anaerobic aerobic type of the degradation process mfc systems are superior to standalone anaerobic and aerobic bioremediation because they create electricity while degrading at a faster rate 20 despite its high cost mfc technology can be utilized instead of biological and conventional procedures because of its dual use of energy production and quicker degradation 21 86 the biocathode system of mfc comprises microorganisms that act as biocatalysts in the anode driving the breakdown of organic materials to generate electrons that move to the cathode which also includes microorganisms chamber through an electric circuit free electrons present on the mfc cathode trigger the reduction of oxygen to generate water microorganisms will in this instance receive electrons at the cathode by reducing electron acceptors such as oxygen nitrate sulphate perchlorates and metals 22 25 thus biodegradable organic matter is transformed by mfcs into energy hydrogen or other compounds with additional value 26 28 due to its cost effectiveness use of self regenerate catalysts and sustainable power supply biocathodes in mfc have recently attracted attention for the removal of various pollutants 29 30 additionally progress has been made by utilizing a variety of microorganisms as biocatalysts on biocathodes 29 32 according to studies the presence of microorganisms at the cathode can improve mfcs performance 31 34 not only do biocathodes with biofilms catalyze the reduction of oxygen at the cathode but they also exhibit performance levels that are equivalent to or superior to those of an abiotic cathode 35 36 although biocathodes have a lot of potential for mfc technology problems with biocatalyst performance at terminal acceptor conditions cathodic activation overpotentials 37 38 biofouling accumulation and competition of metabolite 39 40 among others need to be resolved for them to be used widely in the future to achieve that more discussion regarding long term operation and the scaling up of biocathodes is required to make the biocathode mfcs technology more feasible 41 several studies of dye and pesticide degradation via mfc have been stated by various researchers in the past 42 44 in the reported study the decolorization of reactive brilliant red x 3b was done using mfc 45 and in 46 effectively degraded acid orange 7 90 was achieved in a microbial fuel cell with two phase an aerobic bioreactor system recently mishra et al 47 have efficiently removed a blend of reactive orange 16 and reactive red 21 by pseudomonas aeruginosa 23 n1 in mfc the degradation of these dyes shows toxic and cytotoxic attributes 46 48 some researchers have reported the bioelectrochemical treatment for pesticides with mfcs however they are restricted to minor concentrations with consequently lower power densities pd 16 49 meanwhile mfcs have been shown to dramatically improve the removal efficiency of refractory pesticides like hexachlorobenzene sulphamethoxazole and pentachlorophenol 17 50 51 the mfc is a good contender for the elimination of environmental toxins because of the aforementioned features however research into rr 195 and chlorpyrifos degradation by biocathode based mfcs currently limited and it is unclear if mfc can successfully break down these pollutants while still producing power additionally the degradation of dye and pesticide with simultaneous bioenergy production in bacterial bacterial bioanodic and biocathodic and fungal bioanode bacteria biocathode fungus mfc systems is rarely compared in the literature which is the major focus of this research in this study the removal of rr 195 and chlorpyrifos in bacterial and fungal mfc were reactors was examined with the capability to remove pollutants and generate electricity moreover efforts have been made to connect the bioenergy output with the degradation of pollutants and chemical oxygen demand cod in biocathodes containing dye and pesticides the bioelectrochemical behavior of the system was studied using cyclic voltammetry cv chronoamperometry ca and the performance assessment was carried out by estimating the cell potential power density pd and the cod removal efficiency of the two mfc systems spectrophotometric and ftir techniques further examined the percentages of degradation and analysis of degraded metabolites scanning electron microscopy sem was also employed to study the surface morphologies of bioelectrodes from both studied mfc systems the reactor was also tested for the simultaneous biodegradation of real textile wastewater and bioelectricity production the findings of this study on pollutant bio electrochemical degradation will aid in the development of novel tactics for large scale wastewater treatment plants that also produce energy 2 experimental 2 1 screening of dye and pesticide degrading isolates the microorganisms which could biodegrade dye and pesticide were procured from microbial biotechnology and bioengineering lab department of microbiology quaid i azam university islamabad pakistan these microorganisms include five fungal isolates including aspergillus niger alternaria alternata fusarium oxysporum trichoderma spp and rhizopus spp and four bacterial strains including staphylococcus aureus pseudomonas aeruginosa bacillus subtilis and e coli these efficient pollutants degrading bacterial and fungal isolates were screened using agar the plating method and submerged fermentation then optimized under different conditions static shaking aerobic and microaerophilic at variable pollutant concentrations ranging from 10 to 100 mg l and finally incubated at 37 c and 28 c for 7 days the degradation of pollutants was analyzed by the formation of zones on agar plates and by uv spectrophotometer in terms of percentages 52 53 2 2 biocathode fabrication and biofilm formation carbon felt cf was consistently cut into a square of 6 by 3 cm washed with deionized water submerged in 1000 ml of deionized water for 2 h and then periodically rinse with deionized water for 40 min to yield modified carbon felt the washed cf was put in a beaker with 20 w v nitric acid agitated for 2 h in a constant temperature oscillator and then rinsed with deionized water the material was then dried for 10 h at 130 c in a constant temperature drying oven then removed and stored in a desiccator until needed 54 85 biofilm formation on the electrode was taken place in a 50 ml agar plate then a suspension of bacterial and fungal isolates was vortexed and was further diluted up to 4 folds 10 1 10 2 10 3 and 10 4 the fabricated modified carbon felt was positioned on the surface of the agar plate and 4 ml suspension of 10 4 fold was poured drop by drop on the electrode for the formation of biofilm on the surface and placed in an incubator at 37 c and 28 c for 4 days this electrode was then used in the cathodic chamber of mfc as a biocathode electrode 2 3 mfc construction and operation two glass bottles with a working volume of 350 ml were used to create a two chamber mfc reactor a proton exchange membrane pem nafion 117 was used to separate the two chambers of the mfcs the electrodes are suspended from the top of each chamber entirely submerged in the electrolyte and are connected to an external resistor through the copper wire 0 8 mm in diameter a wastewater treatment plant islamabad pakistan provided the pre enriched activated sludge used as inoculum in bioanode in the anode chamber activated sludge was supplied with wastewater in a 3 50 ratio all reactors were autoclaved for 20 min at 121 c for the treatment of synthetic wastewater the cathode of the mfc reactors was then injected with various quantities of dye and pesticide the devices were distributed into three groups and functioned in two modes which were bacterial mfc fungal mfc and control mfc without pollutant operated in open circuit mode and closed circuit mode to increase the cathode potential minimal liquid medium was utilized as catholyte for bacterial and fungal mfc respectively all of the reactors were run in batch mode when the mfc s output voltage fell below 100 mv its catholyte was replaced considered a cycle for real wastewater treatment effluent containing dye was added into the mfc and was investigated under batch mode for 3 days before chemical analysis samples were removed from the biocathode stored at 80 c experiments were conducted at ambient temperature between 28 and 37 2 c 53 55 2 4 investigation of biodegradation of dye and pesticide in mfc and analytical methods 2 4 1 degradation of rr195 and chlorpyrifos a uv vis spectrophotometer cecil 2502 was used to monitor the change in absorbance for dye and pesticide at 545 nm and 289 nm respectively eq 1 was used to calculate the percentage of degradation and the concentration of pollutant degraded 1 percentage biodegradati o n initial absorbance final absorbance initial absorbance 100 the chemical oxygen demand cod removal efficiency was evaluated using eq 2 and the 5220c standard technique american public health association 2005 by calculating the initial and final cod of the samples from the mfc chamber and using cod test kits with a range of 1 15 000 mg l 2 cod removal efficiency 100 1 final cod initial cod 2 4 2 investigation of degraded metabolites of rr 195 and chlorpyrifos by ftir the kbr pellet method was used to perform ftir analysis for the control dye and pesticide and its metabolites after trial in a ratio of 1 10 percent wavenumbers 400 to 4000 cm 1 were used to measure transmittance 56 2 4 3 electrochemical parameters and instrumental measurements the voltage output across the exterior load was measured by a digital millimeter power density pd was calculated using eq 3 3 pd v 2 ra where v is the output voltage mv r is the external resistance u and a is the electrode area m2 the temperature tds ph and electrical conductivity ec were all measured using standard temperature tds ph and ec meters by using a uv visible spectrophotometer cecil 2502 to monitor the microbial cell growth absorbance at 600 nm in terms of optical density in a temperature range of 30 c all experiments were repeated in duplicate the surface morphologies of biocathodes and bioanodes derived from both mfc systems were examined by scanning electron microscopy sem the samples were cleaned in phosphate buffer with ph 7 2 and fixed overnight with a 2 glutaraldehyde solution before sem examination the samples were then rinsed in ethanol solutions containing 10 30 50 70 90 and 100 ethanol and dried for two days 57 2 4 4 analytical procedures voltammetric techniques were used to investigate the redox reaction happening at the surface of the bioelectrodes in the reactor systems the performance of all three reactors bacterial mfc fungal mfc and control reactor systems was evaluated by monitoring the anodic and cathodic potential the reference electrode was a kcl saturated ag agcl electrode using anode as a working electrode anode potential was determined with reference to ag agcl s cyclic voltammetry cv was performed using bioanode as working electrode and biocathode as counter electrode against ag agcl s reference electrode while chronoamperometry ca and cyclic voltammetry cv were used to examine the bioelectrochemical behavior of biocathode via potentiostat sp150 using a three electrode cv device the cv was calculated b monitoring current over a particular potential range the electrochemical performance was investigated using a scan rate of 20 mvs 1 over a potential range of 1 to 1 0 v 3 results and discussion 3 1 synthetic wastewater treatment potential of bacterial and fungal based mfc 3 1 1 selection of dye and pesticide degrading isolates nine morphologically different isolates were obtained for degradation of the rr195 dye and chlorpyrifos pesticide on agar plates and msm medium containing erlenmeyer flasks all nine isolates including bacterial and fungal strains were exposed to degradation of rr195 and chlorpyrifos at a varying concentrations ranging from 10 to 100 mg l from various experimental conditions a bacterial strain staphylococcus aureus and a fungal isolate aspergillus niger were selected as potential rr195 and chlorpyrifos degrading isolates the performance of bacterial isolate was maximum under the combined aerobic and microaerophilic static conditions at 37 c ph 7 while fungus grows best under shaking conditions at 28 c and ph 5 with maximum biodegrading efficiency sri et al have also reported the similar isolate with similar incubating conditions and now here in this study it was also confirmed for dye and pesticide degradation 52 53 the decolorization efficiency of selected strains were studied by measuring the optical density after 24 48 to 168 h of incubation and the results were plotted it was noticed that there was a decrease in the optical density od as the incubation period increased the percentage of degradation was also calculated and it was found that staphylococcus aureus and aspergillus niger showed 90 and 95 degradation efficiency of dye and pesticide in two weeks respectively 3 1 2 biodegradation and cod removal of pollutants in mfc the most efficient isolate one from bacterial staphylococcus aureus and one from fungal aspergillus niger was selected for the construction of bacterial and fungal mfc for rr195 and chlorpyrifos degradation respectively degradation was investigated for rr195 and chlorpyrifos at different concentrations of 15 300 mg l and 15 100 mg l for dyes and pesticide respectively with ph 4 0 7 0 in both cases similar degradation trends were observed with an increase in the concentration of pollutants the experiment was carried out for 40 days and divided into two tests i e test 1 21 days and test 2 7 days to check the efficiency of bioelectrodes six dye concentrations such as 15 30 50 100 150 200 and 300 mg l were used to analyses the decolorization efficiency in bacterial mfc with time and the results are presented in fig 1 in this study 15 ppm concentration takes 75 h to decolorize 98 of dye but 30 mg l 98 in 58 h 50 mg l 98 in 48 h 100 mg l 98 in 46 h 150 mg l 100 in 45 h were decolorized in less time even though they were in higher concentrations it is probably due to that at earlier hours the biofilm on the electrode was not fully developed and stable but it matures with time and acted efficiently to degrade the dye thus the biofilm utilized untreated dye as the sole carbon source because there was no other carbon substrate in liquid media and degradation efficiency increased from 98 at 15 30 50 and 100 mg l to 100 at 150 and 200 mg l and then again fall to 92 at 300 mg l for every concentration but it varies with the time both in test 1 and 2 afterward at 200 and 300 mg l concentrations decolorization was achieved after 90 and 150 h respectively and took more time compared to initial concentrations because of dye toxicity and accumulation of bacterial debris in catholyte that now act on biocathode and consequently no further dye degradation could achieve in the cathodic chamber of bacterial mfc the 1st test took 21 days to completion moreover after 21 days the previous catholyte was completely removed and replaced with a new one in the cathodic chamber of bacterial mfc in a fully sterile environment to check the stability and efficiency of the biocathode and the working of mfc so from current study it was revealed that same concentrations of dye 15 mg l 98 in 8 h 30 mg l 98 in 10 h 50 mg l 98 in 12 h 100 mg l 98 in 15 h 150 mg l 100 in 18 h 200 mg l 100 in 24 h and 300 mg l 92 in 30 h in test 2 acquired less time i e only 5 days to completely degrade in mfc as compared to test 1 that took 21 days similar studies have been previously conducted and the resulting response validates the results of our experiments for evaluating the potential of bacterial strains for degradation and bioremediation of rr195 in mfc 42 55 thus it is assumed that changing the catholyte every ten days might result in the degradation of higher dye concentrations possibly up to 600 mg l or 700 mg l in fungal mfc during test 1 with increasing concentrations of pesticide its degradation efficiency also increased i e 15 mg l 91 in 96 h 30 mg l 93 in 96 h 50 mg l 95 in 96 h but degradation follows the reverse order after introduction of 100 mg l 75 in 216 h in cathode chamber then with the increase in the concentration of pesticide degradation starts to decrease which might be due to the higher toxicity of chlorpyrifos large mycelial growth on the cathode and accumulation of debris in the medium a similar pattern of pesticide degradation was also observed during test 2 of fungal mfc when catholyte was completely removed and replaced with a new one then the addition of 15 mg l concentration resulted in 97 degradation within 36 h and the addition of higher pesticide concentrations results in enhanced degradation efficiency in less time i e 30 mg l 97 in 36 h 50 mg l 98 in 48 h and 100 mg l 95 in 48 h the results obtained from test 2 were analogous to that of test 1 as shown in fig 2 which discovered the increasing degradation efficiency with increasing concentration till the tolerance point i e 100 mg l in the case of fungal mfc ph has an effective role in the degradation of pesticide as fungal cells normally grow at low ph 5 7 58 during the course of maximum degradation efficiency ph was maintained at 5 i e 15 mg l 30 mg l 50 mg l but for the remaining concentration it shifts from 5 to 4 causing a reduction in degradation efficiency this phenomenon might be ascribed to the toxicity of the degraded metabolites towards fungus at a higher concentration of pesticide 59 60 degradation of pesticide follows the order for ph 5 0 4 0 and for concentration mg l 15 30 50 100 and it was also cleared from the graph that maximum rr195 and chlorpyrifos degradation were obtained at 150 200 mg l and 50 mg l up to 100 and 95 during test 1 in bacterial and fungal mfc respectively and during test 2 for both mfcs up to 100 and 98 degradation was achieved at similar concentrations respectively the reactors performance was also evaluated in terms of cod elimination the amount of organic carbon recovered in the form of electricity was precisely proportional to the total cod removed from the system indicating that energy is created in mfc at the expenditure of cod 61 the early cod of the system holding 100 mg l of dye and pesticide was 5920 mg l and 6910 mg l and the cod was fallen to 1779 mg l and 1310 mg l for bacterial as well as fungal mfc respectively during the progression of 21 days of degradation the cod removal efficiency was found to be a maximum for 100 ppm for both the reactor systems 70 in bacterial mfc and 81 in fungal mfc 3 1 3 analysis of metabolites of pollutants in mfc via ftir ftir spectra in fig 3 showed significant variation among the treated and the control dye sample the spectrum of the control dye showed a strong peak at 3420 cm 1 and 3113 cm 1 matches to the nh and ch stretching another prominent peak at 1756 cm 1 and 1619 cm 1 links to co and cc stretching respectively the peaks observed at 1322 1294 and 1104 cm 1 correspond to so cn and co stretching indicating sulfone strong aromatic amines and aliphatic ether the peak positions at 1035 986 886 and 733 cm 1 are characterized by the so cc bending and ch stretching respectively the ftir spectrum of treated rr195 after degradation showed significant transformation in the locus of peaks when matched to the control dye spectrum the peaks at 3264 3130 and 2948 cm 1 characterize ch stretching specifying the aliphatic nature of the formed metabolite a peak at 2137 and 2105 cm 1 represents weak cc stretching indicating alkyne the peaks at 1670 1541 1464 and 1339 cm 1 correspond to stretching of cc no ch and blending of oh respectively whereas a peak at 1071 1289 836 and 696 cm 1 which are corresponding to the co cn ccl and cc stretching support formation of alkenes aromatic amine primary alcohols and halo compounds 62 63 the structural alterations of rr195 and chlorpyrifos are better understood by the ftir spectrophotometer fig 4 shows the ftir spectra of chlorpyrifos and its metabolites there is a clear difference in the spectra suggesting chlorpyrifos breakdown chlorpyrifos spectra revealed bands at 2923 and 1606 cm 1 which correspond to the nh and co amide groups respectively cc stretching co stretching ch bending and ccl stretching have peak locations of 1410 1021 833 and 676 cm 1 respectively in sample concentrations of 15 mg ml 30 mg ml 50 mg ml and 100 mg ml bands were detected in the ftir spectra of chlorpyrifos degraded materials at 3282 3309 3280 and 3293 cm 1 respectively which correspond to the nh group the amide ii group is represented by 1634 1635 1634 and 1634 cm 1 bands in chlorpyrifos degraded materials with concentrations of 15 mg ml 30 mg ml 50 mg ml and 100 mg ml respectively the 1410 1021 833 and 676 cm 1 bands of the chlorpyrifos ftir spectra vanished in chlorpyrifos degraded materials at all concentrations the features of ccl deformation include bands at 575 578 578 and 570 cm 1 in chlorpyrifos degraded samples of 15 mg ml 30 mg ml 50 mg ml and 100 mg ml respectively overall the results indicate that chlorpyrifos in the samples has been degraded 64 3 1 4 biocathode characterization by sem analysis the surface morphologies of biocathodes of bacterial and fungal mfcs were analyzed using sem fig 5 c d and e f displayed the sem images of biocathodes acquired from both mfc systems at diverse magnifications 250 1000 2500 respectively the microscopic images obtained from both reactors showed the presence of enormous bacterial biofilm and fungal growth on the cathodic surface fig 5 a and b illustrated the sem images of the electrode surface before and after the modification 3 1 5 electrochemical behavior and performance of mfc 3 1 5 1 bioelectricity generation the bioenergy recovered during the breakdown of pollutants in bacterial mfc and fungal mfc was measured in terms of cell potential mv during the test period and the findings are shown in fig 6 with the addition of dye and pesticide to both mfc systems it was discovered that current output was initially low this could be because the biological system was not yet stable enough to withstand the damaging effects of increasing pollution concentrations but as the sludge became further accustomed to the process over time the current output increased in the instance of bacterial mfc the potential was seen to attain a peak value of 635 mv at 150 mg l of rr195 and then decline as the dye concentration was increased in fungal mfc however the cell potential increased as the concentration was exceeded from 15 to 50 mg l peaking at 706 mv and then fell as the concentration was increased to 100 ppm however as the concentration was increased further the voltage production decreased due to the increased toxicity other scientists have found similar developments in mfc treatment of hazardous substances in the current generation 65 66 to stimulate microbial activity and growth the system was given medium twice a week the concentration of added substrate declined with time for a given cycle and subsequently the current i was reduced to the minimum value due to substrate restrictions the graph s peaks represent the addition of new media the toxic action of rr195 and chlorpyrifos on bacterial and fungal biofilms could explain the decreasing trend of current with increasing pollutant concentrations 19 which led to poor microbial activity and consequently decreased the production of current this means that the substrate should be provided at regular intervals to maintain the required feast to famine ratio for continuous energy production the reduced output voltage seen after the addition of dye and pesticide shows that these pollutants have an inhibitory effect on microorganisms and as a result it affect the mfc performance the pd shown in fig 7 on the other hand was highest 224 01 mw m 2 at 150 mg l for bacterial mfc however the pd for fungal mfc was found to be highest at 50 mg l 276 9 mw m 2 which is much higher than the other reported studies employing fungus as a cathode catalyst 39 67 68 the peaks on the pd curve correlate to the addition of minimum medium for the first time when the co substrate was introduced to the medium the pd peaked the decreased pd in the presence of bacterial mfc could be owing to other pathways such as methanogenesis in which the electrons created were lost and thus cannot be regained as energy output even though the maximum cod reduction was at 100 mg l in the case of bacterial mfc the maximum pd was 150 mg l this behavior could be explained by one of two factors either electrons were lost in alternate pathways in bacterial mfc or the biofilm took longer to become sustainable in bacterial mfc resulting in lower power output at 100 ppm while cod removal was best at 100 mg l for fungal mfc th highest pd was attained at 50 mg l where the degradation rate was also highest then when the concentration of pollutants increased pd fell indicating that the pollutants had an inhibitory impact on microorganisms resulting in lower power output 19 69 3 1 5 2 current response by cyclic voltammetry a cv study of the bioelectrode was achieved to understand the electron transfer course from the bacterial and fungal biofilm to the underneath electrode the electrochemical behavior of bioanode and biocathode present in both bacterial mfc and fungal mfc was investigated a three electrode system was employed to perform cv at a scan rate of 20 mv s a voltammogram obtained from anodic chamber displayed a narrow redox loop attained for both bacterial mfc and fungal mfc validating the accumulation of biofilm on bioanode with time and these active microbial communities carried out the electron transfer figs 8 9 shows the voltammograms at a scan rate of 20 mvs 1 for both mfcs wherein a redox loop with a forward peak was obtained at 0 1 v two reverse peaks were found at 0 1 v and 0 5 v showing that microorganisms in the anodic chamber of both mfcs have minimal redox activity when no pollutant is present the reduced anodic potential of bioanode significantly suggests high bacterial colonization on the anode material and easy cellular electron transport to the electrode for the cathodic chamber the broader voltammogram in the case of bacterial and fungal mfc could specify its enhanced performance compared to the anode in terms of stability as well as capacitance 70 when compared to the control which contained no pollution the voltammograms obtained for both mfcs were completely different in character the bio electrode s biofilm grown cathodic potential was found to be between 1 and 1 v which is much greater than the bioanode the redox current response of the biocathode was much higher than the bioanode having no pollutant for both mfcs a derivative voltammogram of the biocathodes was constructed and displayed numerous inflecting peaks some of the highlighted peaks obtained from biocathode of bacterial mfcs with the redox potentials v of 0 15 peak 1 0 58 peak 2 0 79 peak 3 0 88 peak 4 0 12 peak 5 0 39 peak 6 0 57 peak 7 0 6 peak 8 0 85 peak 9 and 0 95 peak 10 observed in the derived voltammogram shown in fig 10 while for fungal mfc peaks with redox potential of 0 12 peak 1 0 21 peak 2 0 67 peak 3 0 79 peak 4 0 002 peak 5 0 25 peak 6 0 49 peak 7 0 51 peak 8 0 66 peak 9 0 73 peak 10 0 86 peak 11 0 94 peak 12 was observed as shown in fig 11 these reducing equivalents with redox potential are predicted to improve the flow of metabolic electrons to the cathode while avoiding the electron scavenging effect of oxygen produced the current response of bacterial mfc was much higher than fungal mfc for bacterial mfc with an increase of concentration of dye current response also increases maximum response was recorded at 150 mg l and 200 mg l which were 118 ma and 122 ma respectively in biocathode while for fungal mfc the current response reaches up to 27 35 ma for 50 ppm concentration where the rate of degradation was also highest the low current response in fungal mfc compared to bacterial mfc was attributed to the limited electron transfer due to the adhesion of fungus to the carbon felt electrode 71 these cathodic current responses of both mfcs were also much higher than their respective bioanodes demonstrating the presence of pollutant and pure culture in biocathode resulted in accelerated efficiency of the mfc 3 1 5 3 current response by chronoamperometry ca analysis was conducted to determine electrochemical parameters of maximum current intensities during cultivation and in situ simultaneous oxygen reduction to reveal the steady current production in a system we can calculate the number of electrons that were effectively deprived from the substrate using these characteristics to monitor the stable currents in the system ca was done by applying a potential of 0 2 v continuously over a period of 1800 s at 24 h intervals initially maximum current generation was detected which steadily dropped over time and settled at a point that could be deemed sustainable current generation 72 higher stabilized currents were observed in the cathodic chamber of the bacterial and fungal mfc system in comparison to the anodic chamber of the mfc system relatively bacterial mfc represented maximum sustainable currents 13 8 3 ma followed by fungal mfc 10 66 2 34 ma systems at 150 mg l and 50 mg l respectively where the rate of degradation was also maximum fig 12 this might be attributed to the activity of electrochemical microorganisms which aid in the continual emission of electrons enabling power generation in the anode chamber lower values of currents i were observed bacterial mfc 0 57 0 097 ma and fungal mfc 0 14 0 018 ma which might be influenced by the absence of pollutants and low level of the electrogenic environment in the system the substantial variation in bioelectrochemical activity revealed by the biocatalysts might be one of the credible reasons for the improved performance of the cathodic system compared to the anodic system of both bacterial and fungal mfcs the performance of both bacterial and fungal mfc systems is given in table 1 3 2 dye containing real wastewater treatment potential of the mfc system the batch tests cod removal efficiency and the mfc s capabilities for treating real wastewater have been investigated the effluent of the mfc showed a noticeable decolorization of the wastewater indicating the viability of wastewater treatment the batch trial on the mfc system revealed 95 colour removal at its maximum given that it appeared to have created ideal circumstances for microbial development the biologically degradable oxidizable organic percentage of the actual effluent may be responsible for the significant colour loss as a result we deduced that the bioelectrogenic process and colour removal were related in some way the results of this investigation exceeded those of a prior study which produced decolorization values of 45 60 by taking colour removal and wastewater type into account 73 other studies have shown 73 74 and nearly complete decolorization 37 the ph of the real wastewater in the mfc varied during the experiment from being alkaline ph 8 6 to neutral ph 7 1 the simultaneous modification of ph in the mfc would be a huge benefit for wastewater treatment because the actual wastewater is complicated this conclusion is consistent with that made by 75 mfc had a 72 cod elimination efficiency after the experiment although substantially higher levels of cod removal are reported in other studies our results are similar to those of 76 who showed high substrate removal at neutral ph other studies that handled the same kind of wastewater produced cod removal efficiencies of up to 71 74 these findings demonstrated how wastewater was treated bioelectrochemically to remove organic debris and colour the performance of the bioelectrochemical system was not great in terms of cod removal efficiency therefore a more practical method would involve transforming the organic matter in the real effluent using a mixed redox metabolism of electrogenic and or anaerobic non electrogenic bacteria to learn more about the precise function played by each bacterial group more research is required when real wastewater treatment was combined with high power density output the performance was superior fig 13 to that of domestic brewing and starch processing wastewater treatments other parameters including tds and ec have also been measured and eminent change has been observed between the initial and final values from 470 ppm to 608 ppm for tds and from 986 us cm to 1187 us cm for ec respectively current response by cv and ca has also been measured showing a high response rate current production and stabilization as shown in figs 14 and 15 it should be mentioned that the real wastewater served as a microbiological and nutrient supply and was treated primarily in air exposed mfc reactors to remove colour organic charge and for current generation other investigations showed that the cod removal performance of the biocathode and control mfcs was two fold better than that of the experiment without electrodes 77 thus it was concluded that the bioelectrochemical system configuration electrode presence anode biofilm electron and proton release and flux were necessary for the treatment of the actual wastewater contrary to what buitron and moreno andrade 78 observed better removal efficiencies were achieved by common non electrogenic anaerobic bacteria than by electrogenic bacteria even though the pollutants being removed were different the power production and wastewater treatment capacity of this investigation were compared to those of other studies using biocathodes table 2 regardless of the processes that could take place in a broader perspective several reasons may be responsible for the relatively high power output experimental reactor design low internal resistance etc however it was noted that real wastewater was treated while electricity was generated 4 conclusion the mfc may greatly improve the removal efficiency of refractory organic compounds after a long acclimation period temperature ph and the original pollutant concentration all played a role in its breakdown the research shows that rr 195 and chlorpyrifos can be effectively treated in both bacterial and fungal dual chambered mfcs while also producing energy electrogenic bacteria on the anode produced enough electrons to boost the catabolic reaction efficiency of aromatics degrading bacteria and fungus at ph 7 over 100 dye 150 mg l and 98 pesticide 50 mg l were eliminated in 18 and 48 h respectively voltage and power density increase with increases in concentration from 15 to 150 mg l for bacterial mfc and 15 50 mg l for fungal mfc but both drop afterward due to the toxicity of pollutants towards bacteria and fungus the maximum value of cell potential for bacterial and fungal mfcs was 635 mv and 706 mv at 150 mg l and 50 mg l respectively maximum pollutant degradation was detected during this time and cod was reduced to a sufficient level with maximum cod removal of 70 and 81 seen at 100 mg l dye and pesticide respectively the system s ability to remove pollutants and their metabolites through the action of bacterial and fungal pure culture was demonstrated by the considerable reduction in cod levels furthermore after degradation significant peak shifts and the absence of an aromatic ring in ftir data suggest that contaminants are removed by biodegradation in mfc furthermore sem results revealed that bacteria and fungus may be effectively immobilized on electrodes the dye containing real wastewater treatment and electricity generation were also investigated sufficient cod removal 72 colour 95 as well as high power density 519 49 mwm 2 were accomplished the results of real wastewater treatment were comparable with the systems described in the literature interestingly considerable energy could be recovered from wastewater leading to self sustained wastewater treatment if the mfcs are optimized as a result harmful compounds can be efficiently handled in a bio electrochemical system while also producing power however further research is needed before this technique can be scaled up declaration of competing interest the authors

water data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction the use of ultraviolet uv light as a disinfectant in water resource recovery facilities wrrfs is a well accepted and increasingly popular technology due to ease of operation and efficacy of treatment benefits of uv disinfection include no residual chemicals to remove following disinfection no production of harmful disinfection byproducts and fast reaction rates on the order of seconds uv disinfection for municipal wastewater is primarily regulated by bacterial concentration targets for effluents due to the risk to public and environmental health that these organisms pose 1 these effluent targets can often be missed as treatment is limited by poorer water quality typical of wwrf matrices furthermore traditional uv technologies such as mercury based low and medium pressure lamps are limited to a design fluence once they are installed in a facility which translates to fragile facilities that cannot effectively respond to changes in influent water quality or quantity wastewater matrix limitations refer to the upper limit of treatment for a reactor based on the chemical and physical constituents present in a water matrix which scavenge or block photons and reduce uv disinfection efficacy high organic and inorganic contaminant loading which can substantially reduce the uv transmittance uvt ultimately reducing the ability of the applied photons to penetrate a column of water and inactivate the microorganisms low uvt is problematic as wavelengths used for disinfection are in the uv c region 200 280 nm and typical uv absorbance for water matrices increases as the emitted wavelength decrease into this region 2 for example iron can reduce the uvt and affect disinfection performance due to the propensity of ferric and ferrous compounds to absorb radiation in the uv spectrum however the ability for iron compounds to absorb uv light is dependent on the oxidation state and complexation with organic matter 2 3 furthermore increased total suspended solids tss can decrease inactivation of microorganisms due to the absorption of uv radiation by the particles bacterial attachment and physical blocking of the uv radiation 4 5 the presence of contaminants of emerging concern such as personal care product residuals in wastewater can also negatively impact uvt organic uv filtering compounds are often found in these products and can pose an additional challenge for uv disinfection 6 it is important to characterize such water quality parameters to understand how they impact uv disinfection performance given the complexity of the factors that influence uv disinfection system limitations refer to the inherent constraints of delivered fluence and flow rates for uv disinfection wastewater facilities related to diurnal and seasonal variations in influent composition and flow the impacts of climate change challenge the long term efficacy of wastewater treatment facility processes as utilities need to be mindful of carbon consumption 7 these changes in influent water quality can pressure wastewater treatment facilities beyond their design capacity furthermore the biological activity of effluent wastewater must be strictly monitored as microbiological growth is enhanced in warmer months 8 increases in biological activity can be very costly for municipalities and water utilities as retrofitting or increases in chlorine use are typical avenues for maintaining proper disinfection uv systems are challenged over time as quartz sleeves in the systems foul and uv lamps dim due to aging 9 given the various factors that impact disinfection performance it is important to have an easy to use assessment tool to aid in isolating and addressing treatment limitations different assessment techniques such as collimated beam testing biodosimetry fluorescent microspheres computational fluid dynamics cfd modelling and model detector methods exist to evaluate suitability or validate fluence of full scale uv systems a uv fluence is akin to a chlorine dose and is the most common unit to report the delivered amount of uv light a system provides uv fluence is calculated on an energy basis to make comparisons between devices light sources and systems interpretable collimated beam testing conducted by uv system manufacturers can be used to develop fluence response curves for microorganisms present in the natural wastewater biome this testing can be used to assess the susceptibility of a wastewater matrix for uv treatment to determine the feasibility of installing a uv system or to assess the potential performance of a current uv reactor by treating the regulated target microorganism in situ however the performance of the plant at the time of sampling is often not characterized during these assessments for existing systems moreover this type of testing only indicates a minimum fluence required to achieve effluent regulatory discharge limits but does not indicate actual performance i e fluence achieved by the specific reactor of systems already in place and has no long term monitoring capabilities biodosimetry is another method used to validate the fluence achieved by a uv reactor in this approach a challenge microorganism is placed upstream of the uv reactor and pre and post uv samples are collected to assess the log reduction in the microorganism this log reduction is then compared to a collimated beam assessment of the microorganism to determine the reduction equivalent fluence ref achieved by the system 10 while biodosimetry is a widely used method to validate the uv fluence achieved by reactors there is inherent error in the range of inactivation rates reported for various challenge organisms it does not allow for direct comparison of the reduction of the target regulatory organism typically e coli or total coliforms and has no ability to monitor long term performance of an installed full scale reactor 11 furthermore each challenge organism responds differently to different wavelengths due to the action spectra 12 which can overly complicate the biodosimetry calculation when considering medium pressure lamps or uv light emitting diodes uv leds dyed microspheres have also been used for validation of full scale uv reactors 13 for this approach uv sensitive microspheres are injected into a reactor and then captured in the effluent the effluent is then processed on a flow cytometer to determine fluence distribution and ref of the reactor dyed microspheres offer a methodology to validate a uv reactor with lower biosecurity concerns compared to biodosimetry however more research is required to understand how reactions with the uv sensitive dyed microspheres and the constituents in a matrix impact fluence determination 10 furthermore this methodology in unable to determine the fluence in an installed full scale reactor limiting the possibility of long term or seasonal monitoring cfd modelling is an inexpensive option that has been used extensively to estimate full scale uv reactor fluence distribution while inexpensive this assessment method often still requires one of the aforementioned full scale testing methods to validate the model 14 as such cfd also shares in the limitations of long term monitoring of an installed full scale reactor moreover typical water quality parameter and flows assessed in models often do not capture the full range of a facility which may lead to inaccurate fluence estimations 11 furthermore the complexity of emerging technologies such as uv leds require further research to ensure valid models are being implemented 11 the model detector method is one method that does allow for real time fluence determination in an installed full scale reactor in this approach cfd modelling is paired with uvt flowrate and uv intensity detector measurements to develop numerical models can be used to produce mathematical expressions that relate the 3 measured parameters to estimate the real time fluence however the usepa recommends that an empirical expression be developed based on on site validation testing across a range of water quality parameters and lamp powers 14 in recent years a microfluorescent silica detector was used to assess fluence rate at a fixed point in an installed full scale reactor to link the cfd model with detector measurements 15 and allow for an inexpensive measurement of real time fluence rate 11 model detector methods provide a relatively inexpensive option for real time and long term monitoring of fluence in an installed full scale reactor however improper placement of the intensity or fluence rate monitor and model assumptions of uniform lamp output and fouling could lead to inaccurate approximations 11 a novel uv auditing approach was designed to address the limitations of conventional assessment methods by concurrently estimating the minimum fluence required to meet effluent discharge limits providing direct inactivation results of the regulated organism providing long term monitoring tool and determining the minimum fluence achieved by an installed full scale system a bench scale collimated beam experimental design was developed to quantify and understand uv system limitations at the facility versus wastewater matrix limitations by pairing fluence response curves for e coli log reductions achieved by system facilities and key water quality parameters the objectives of this study were to develop the uv audit methodology apply uv auditing to four different wastewater resource recovery facilities wrrfs integrate modelling of inactivation kinetics into the auditing workflow to reduce interpretation bias and assess vulnerabilities in this process by using seasonality in wastewater quality as a challenge condition 2 methods and materials 2 1 wastewater treatment facility description and sampling protocol four wastewater treatment facilities wwtfs with various treatment technologies and flowrates in nova scotia canada were selected to be audited these locations were chosen to reflect a wide variety of treatment arrangements for wwtfs and provided a diverse dataset when assessing the utility of uv audits wwtf a is a chemically enhanced alum and polymer primary treatment plant with average daily flows of 34 00 m3day 1 wwtf b is also a chemically enhanced alum and polymer primary treatment plant the collections system is a combined sewer that serves both industrial commercial and residential customers with average daily flows of 51 600 m3day 1 wwtf c is a secondary treatment system using a moving bed bioreactor mbbr and batched dissolved air flotation daf clarification for solids and nutrient removal and has average daily flows of 2010 m3day 1 wwtf d is a secondary treatment system using purox activated sludge and has average daily flows of 23 700 m3day 1 pre and post uv exposed samples were collected from the wrrfs and transported on ice to dalhousie university to be analyzed for tss uvt total iron and e coli tss uvt and iron were measured on pre uv samples whereas e coli was measured on both pre and post uv samples the pre uv samples were also used to develop fluence response curves for e coli in total there were 17 sampling events between february 27 2019 and may 1 2019 at wwtf a 18 sampling events of each train between august 8 2016 and october 10 2016 at wwtf b 22 sampling events between october 14 2020 and august 25 2021 at wwtf c and 23 sampling events between march 22 2016 and may 26 2016 at wwtf d 2 2 water quality analysis tss was determined according to the standard methods apha awwa wef 2012 methods 2540 d glass microfiber filters were pre washed with three 20 ml aliquots of ultrapure water and dried at 105 c for at least 1 h once dry the clean filters were weighed using a precision analytical scale 100 200 ml of well mixed samples were filtered using a vacuum filtration apparatus and then dried at 105 c for at least 1 h before weighing uvt at 254 nm was measuring on a hach dr5000 spectrophotometer and in duplicate for sampling date total iron samples were prepared by first acidifying the sample in the original vial using trace metal grade concentrated nitric acid samples were stored at 20 c for at least 24 h before further processing following acidification samples underwent a heated nitric acid digestion with a nitric acid concentration of 0 5 v v for 2 h at 105 c samples were cooled to 20 c and the volume was returned to the original 10 ml using ultrapure water samples then underwent a heated hydrogen peroxide digestion hydrogen peroxide 30 was added to the samples at a concentration of 0 6 v v and digested for 2 h at 105 c following digestion samples were brought back to their original volume with ultrapure water centrifuged at 3000 rpm for 10 min and the supernatant transferred to a new vial and acidified using trace metal grade concentrated nitric acid samples were then analyzed by the lab technician using an icp ms samples were processed in duplicate 2 3 fluence calculations uv disinfection was performed using a 40 w low pressure uv collimated beam apparatus calgon carbon corporation usa exposure times were calculated using the bolton linden method 16 after the reactor completed a 15 minute warm up period uv irradiance was measured at the center of the beam and the plane coincident with the surface of the water using a usb4000 spectrometer and the spectrasuite software ocean optics inc fl usa 2 4 uv fluence response testing uv fluence response curve data were collected by portioning pre uv wastewater into a petri dish to a depth of 1 cm wastewater samples were then exposed to uv fluences between 10 and 60 mj cm2 following treatment samples were enumerated for e coli and total coliforms pre and post uv exposure samples collected at the wastewater treatment facility were also enumerated as controls all samples were collected as singlets per event and processed under subdued red light to reduce the effects of photo reactivation 2 5 biological methods e coli was enumerated

studio 4 0 3 and affinity designer 1 10 5 the ggplot tidyverse and nlstools packages were used in conjunction with the core r functions for statistical and graphical analysis of data non linear models were fitted using the nls function in r 4 0 3 the non linear models used a modified form of the heat inactivation model presented by geeraerd 18 that only includes the log linear and shoulder phases eq 1 1 n t n 0 n res 10 kf n res where nd is the concentration of the population after uv fluence f n0 is the initial concentration of the population and k is the inactivation rate constant and nres is the concentration of a resistant population the goodness of fit of the models were evaluated using the rmse for the non linear models 3 results and discussion 3 1 uv audit of plant performance wastewater treatment facility audit log reduction values lrv shown in fig 1 highlight the differences between each of the sample locations the dashed line across each plot indicates the mean plant performance at each location over the study duration and the shaded area provides a 95 confidence interval about the mean bench scale collimated beam performance data is shown for a range of fluences 0 60 mj cm 2 and is visualized via box plots combining these data fig 1 shows the minimum fluence achieved at full scale for each of the wwtfs the minimum achieved fluence is determined by the first boxplot that overlaps with the shaded mean log reduction region for example the minimum fluence achieved at wwtf a was 10 mj cm 2 while wwtf c achieved a minimum fluence of 30 mj cm 2 and both the wwtf b and wwtf d systems achieved a minimum fluence of 30 mj cm 2 using this audit it was evident that the wwtf a disinfection performance fluence fell below the upper limit of disinfection the discrepancy in performance indicated that wwtf a experienced difficulties in achieving effective disinfection during the study period and that the system was under sized for the influent conditions this result indicated that wwtf a had reached its system limitation but not a matrix limitation for disinfection this result is not entirely unexpected as the collection system for the treatment facility had expanded greatly since it was commissioned in 2005 conversely the three other sampling locations appeared to be matrix limited based on visual inspection this meant that these uv systems were sized appropriately but that water matrix specific factors such as particles and uvt inhibited further disinfection 3 2 applied uv audit for inactivation kinetics and modelling of plant performance the geeraerd model provides an estimation of the inactivation rate constant k and the upper limit of treatment nres for uv reactors nres provides an objective target to compare plant performance to which reduces error when deciding if a facility is system or matrix limited fig 2 shows the collimated beam data along with the modeled inactivation kinetics for each of the facilities these model fits show that e coli in wwtf a wwtf c and wwtf d had similar responses to treatment k range between 0 0915 and 0 0978 cm2 mj 1 the wwtf b response was significantly greater than the other three facilities examined like the inactivation rate constants wwtf a wwtf c and wwtf d had similar upper limits of treatment 2 41 2 67 lrv and wwtf b had a significantly higher upper limit of treatment 3 10 lrv table 1 shows the inactivation rate constants along with the modelling and observed log reduction values for each of the sampling sites 95 confidence intervals were calculated for each location for both observed and modeled disinfection efficacy comparing the confidence intervals for the nres value to the plant lrv from the plant determines if the treatment is system or matrix limited if the wrrf lrv is significantly lower than the modeled nres then there is a system limitation if there is no significant difference then the system is performing at the limitation of the matrix this comparison of confidence intervals revealed that wwtf a and wwtf d s were system limited whereas wwtf b and wwtf c were matrix limited this aspect of the uv audit provides a robust modelling parameter to compare to effluent lrv when definitively determining system versus matrix limited reactors this feature of the audit also removes human error in the assessment of plant performance as wwtf d system limitation was not detected via the initial audit step described in section 3 1 3 3 water quality impacts on uv audit outcomes water quality varied between the wrrfs and showed a range of challenging matrices table 2 the total influent iron concentration for wwtf a was the highest and far exceed the upper limit of 0 3 mgl 1 that most manufacturers recommend to reduce fouling 19 wwtf a has the highest iron 1 40 0 22 mgl 1 highest tss 23 9 7 4 mgl 1 and lowest uvt 43 7 2 9 which suggests that in addition to being an undersized reactor the wastewater matrix for this sampling location is particularly challenging total iron at wwtf b and wwtf d were observed to be similar 0 34 0 03 and 0 38 0 10 mgl 1 respectively and near the upper limit of typically recommended total iron concentration wwtf c had the lowest total iron concentration at 0 147 0 021 mgl 1 uvt at the other three plants varied wwtf b 46 4 3 7 wwtf c 66 8 4 1 wwtf d 52 3 2 7 the higher uvt observed at wwtf c was attributed to wet weather events experienced during the fall months of the study duration where influent wastewater was diluted by stormwater a study by carré et al showed that the range of uvt for the secondary plant examined was 67 2 20 indicating that these data provide a conservative matrix for analysis furthermore these data show that for a wide range of uvt and tss that the matrix limited facilities were still able to achieve large enough lrv to meet regulated e coli effluent targets the increased iron concentrations may also be the cause for reduced uvt the majority of iron present in the wastewater collected is ferric due to the near neutral ph and additions of oxygen into wastewater treatment processes furthermore soluble iron organic complexes which have a high absorption coefficient for uv wavelengths 3 can form between ferric iron and ligands present in wastewater tss concentrations were observed to be moderate and well below the upper limit of 30 mg l 1 recommended by the usepa 21 at wwtf b 9 7 2 0 mg l 1 wwtf c 13 9 5 3 mg l 1 and wwtf d 12 6 2 9 mg l 1 there was a substantial increase in the upper limit of disinfection at wwtf b when comparing wwtf a to wwtf b which had similar influent e coli concentrations 3 4 seasonal effects on disinfection performance uv auditing provided several layers of analysis in understanding the wwtf processes the robustness of auditing was further tested by subsetting the data from two locations into fall and summer seasonal groups fig 3 shows the seasonal changes in disinfection efficacy for the fall and summer months these seasons were chosen as they experienced the largest changes in water quality due to temperature differences precipitation over the course of a year wwtf b experienced a reduction in disinfection efficacy with the average log reduction value changing from 3 00 1 15 in summer to 2 52 0 50 in fall the 95 confidence interval about the mean log reduction for summer disinfection in wwtf b was also much wider when compared to fall sampling table 3 shows the inactivation rate constants along with the modelling and observed log reduction values for each of the sampling sites no significant difference in the k values or nres at either plant indicated that the change in water quality should not have a significant impact on uv performance the average log reduction of wwtf c was relatively unchanged from season to season suggesting that this facility was operating at a system limit throughout the year while the results are not statistically significant the mean values of the plant lrv and nres values were substantially different between seasons the mean effluent e coli lrv was lower in the summer than in the fall δlrv 0 62 log in wwtf b samples and indicated that the reactor was moving towards system limitation the water quality between seasons remained unchanged table 4 suggesting that this plant is more influenced by system factors the lower plant lrv compared to nres in the fall also aligned with when the uv system is taken offline for annual maintenance when aging and fouling would have their greatest impact thus the shift towards a system limited reactor is likely due to increased fouling and aging of the lamps during this period of sampling the mean plant lrv was lower in the summer compared to the fall δlrv 0 43 log for wwtf c sampling location the wwtf c system assessment showed unchanged plant lrv season to season indicating that the system had an upper limit to disinfection as the daf was operated in a batch mode the flow rate was constant and as such the uv system was hypothesized to be mostly influenced by water quality in the summer months there was a significant increase in influent e coli δ 1 3 log increase in tss δ 12 70 mgl 1 and decrease in uvt δ 16 8 changes in water quality make it increasingly difficult to treat water at a constant flow rate the increase in e coli paired with the similar performance in lrv at the plant indicated the detection of a system limitation further shifts beyond system limitations are due to an undersized system 3 5 system vs matrix limitations identified by uv auditing the impacts of system and matrix limitations are a recurring theme throughout this study system limitations can arise from fouling of quartz sleeves aging of lamps or undersized systems system limitations can be addressed by properly assessing the needs and technical requirements of an influent wastewater uv auditing as described in this study was an effective tool for quantifying these limits and could inform decision making for facility upgrades as well as proper maintenance of systems matrix limitations arising from low uvt or high particulate loading can largely be overcome by ensuring the upstream processes are running effectively a matrix limited system is often indicative of an adequately sized system and is not always problematic if effluent regulatory disinfection targets are being consistently met a matrix limited system that consistently is not meeting effluent targets would indicate that improvements to upstream processes or the uv reactor would be required additionally operators and utility managers can use the information provided by uv audits to better time system maintenance and adjust system processes to improve the delivered fluence by a uv reactor the results of this work indicated that uv auditing is a practical and useful tool for both researchers and water utilities when assessing the performance of facilities uv auditing is also useful as full scale uv led technologies mature as a technology and become a viable treatment option for wastewater treatment facilities providing wastewater treatment facilities with a treatment technology that is responsive to the impacts of both climate change and population growth is valuable to municipalities and water utilities quantifying the system and matrix limitations by auditing a variety of uv wastewater systems addresses knowledge gaps related to uv performance the approach described in this study provides both a strategy and protocol for improving performance in full scale wastewater disinfection systems 4 conclusion this study developed a novel uv audit methodology and applied it to four different water resource recovery facilities while also testing for vulnerabilities in this approach uv auditing was capable of successfully identifying system and matrix limitations for four different facilities with wide ranging water qualities and facility capacities this work is significant as uv audits are an alternative tool to currently available methods for assessing the performance of installed reactors uv auditing identifies if a facility is undersized or if there were issues due to fouling or aging of the uv lamps the results of this study suggested that wwtf a was undersized and could overcome system limitations by optimizing plant processes comparing the modeled expected performance at each location to observed data indicated that wwtf d was also system limited analysis of both audits and models for wwtf d showed that it is matrix limited in some respects and system limited in others exploring the water quality data showed that wwtf b had unchanged water quality between fall and summer sampling periods but aligned with annual cleaning of the uv systems within the facility seasonal water quality analysis of wwtf c found a more challenging water matrix to treat with increasing influent e coli during the fall and suggested that the shift towards system limited treatment was due to an undersized system future work will consider the impact that uv led technology has on wastewater treatment processes given the differences in emitted light for leds compared to low pressure lamps uv auditing is also a responsive methodology in the face of climate change and can gauge the performance of uv disinfection as climate pressures change the nature of influent wastewater in summary uv auditing provided a clear and robust method to better understand how water resource recovery facilities perform declaration of competing interest the authors declare

fluence response curves for microorganisms present in the natural wastewater biome this testing can be used to assess the susceptibility of a wastewater matrix for uv treatment to determine the feasibility of installing a uv system or to assess the potential performance of a current uv reactor by treating the regulated target microorganism in situ however the performance of the plant at the time of sampling is often not characterized during these assessments for existing systems moreover this type of testing only indicates a minimum fluence required to achieve effluent regulatory discharge limits but does not indicate actual performance i e fluence achieved by the specific reactor of systems already in place and has no long term monitoring capabilities biodosimetry is another method used to validate the fluence achieved by a uv reactor in this approach a challenge microorganism is placed upstream of the uv reactor and pre and post uv samples are collected to assess the log reduction in the microorganism this log reduction is then compared to a collimated beam assessment of the microorganism to determine the reduction equivalent fluence ref achieved by the system 10 while biodosimetry is a widely used method to validate the uv fluence achieved by reactors there is inherent error in the range of inactivation rates reported for various challenge organisms it does not allow for direct comparison of the reduction of the target regulatory organism typically e coli or total coliforms and has no ability to monitor long term performance of an installed full scale reactor 11 furthermore each challenge organism responds differently to different wavelengths due to the action spectra 12 which can overly complicate the biodosimetry calculation when considering medium pressure lamps or uv light emitting diodes uv leds dyed microspheres have also been used for validation of full scale uv reactors 13 for this approach uv sensitive microspheres are injected into a reactor and then captured in the effluent the effluent is then processed on a flow cytometer to determine fluence distribution and ref of the reactor dyed microspheres offer a methodology to validate a uv reactor with lower biosecurity concerns compared to biodosimetry however more research is required to understand how reactions with the uv sensitive dyed microspheres and the constituents in a matrix impact fluence determination 10 furthermore this methodology in unable to determine the fluence in an installed full scale reactor limiting the possibility of long term or seasonal monitoring cfd modelling is an inexpensive option that has been used extensively to estimate full scale uv reactor fluence distribution while inexpensive this assessment method often still requires one of the aforementioned full scale testing methods to validate the model 14 as such cfd also shares in the limitations of long term monitoring of an installed full scale reactor moreover typical water quality parameter and flows assessed in models often do not capture the full range of a facility which may lead to inaccurate fluence estimations 11 furthermore the complexity of emerging technologies such as uv leds require further research to ensure valid models are being implemented 11 the model detector method is one method that does allow for real time fluence determination in an installed full scale reactor in this approach cfd modelling is paired with uvt flowrate and uv intensity detector measurements to develop numerical models can be used to produce mathematical expressions that relate the 3 measured parameters to estimate the real time fluence however the usepa recommends that an empirical expression be developed based on on site validation testing across a range of water quality parameters and lamp powers 14 in recent years a microfluorescent silica detector was used to assess fluence rate at a fixed point in an installed full scale reactor to link the cfd model with detector measurements 15 and allow for an inexpensive measurement of real time fluence rate 11 model detector methods provide a relatively inexpensive option for real time and long term monitoring of fluence in an installed full scale reactor however improper placement of the intensity or fluence rate monitor and model assumptions of uniform lamp output and fouling could lead to inaccurate approximations 11 a novel uv auditing approach was designed to address the limitations of conventional assessment methods by concurrently estimating the minimum fluence required to meet effluent discharge limits providing direct inactivation results of the regulated organism providing long term monitoring tool and determining the minimum fluence achieved by an installed full scale system a bench scale collimated beam experimental design was developed to quantify and understand uv system limitations at the facility versus wastewater matrix limitations by pairing fluence response curves for e coli log reductions achieved by system facilities and key water quality parameters the objectives of this study were to develop the uv audit methodology apply uv auditing to four different wastewater resource recovery facilities wrrfs integrate modelling of inactivation kinetics into the auditing workflow to reduce interpretation bias and assess vulnerabilities in this process by using seasonality in wastewater quality as a challenge condition 2 methods and materials 2 1 wastewater treatment facility description and sampling protocol four wastewater treatment facilities wwtfs with various treatment technologies and flowrates in nova scotia canada were selected to be audited these locations were chosen to reflect a wide variety of treatment arrangements for wwtfs and provided a diverse dataset when assessing the utility of uv audits wwtf a is a chemically enhanced alum and polymer primary treatment plant with average daily flows of 34 00 m3day 1 wwtf b is also a chemically enhanced alum and polymer primary treatment plant the collections system is a combined sewer that serves both industrial commercial and residential

samples were collected from the wrrfs and transported on ice to dalhousie university to be analyzed for tss uvt total iron and e coli tss uvt and iron were measured on pre uv samples whereas e coli was measured on both pre and post uv samples the pre uv samples were also used to develop fluence response curves for e coli in total there were 17 sampling events between february 27 2019 and may 1 2019 at wwtf a 18 sampling events of each train between august 8 2016 and october 10 2016 at wwtf b 22 sampling events between october 14 2020 and august 25 2021 at wwtf c and 23 sampling events between march 22 2016 and may 26 2016 at wwtf d 2 2 water quality analysis tss was determined according to the standard methods apha awwa wef 2012 methods 2540 d glass microfiber filters were pre washed with three 20 ml aliquots of ultrapure water and dried at 105 c for at least 1 h once dry the clean filters were weighed using a precision analytical scale 100 200 ml of well mixed samples were filtered using a vacuum filtration apparatus and then dried at 105 c for at least 1 h before weighing uvt at 254 nm was measuring on a hach dr5000 spectrophotometer and in duplicate for sampling date total iron samples were prepared by first acidifying the sample in the original vial using trace metal grade concentrated nitric acid samples were stored at 20 c for at least 24 h before further processing following acidification samples underwent a heated nitric acid digestion with a nitric acid concentration of 0 5 v v for 2 h at 105 c samples were cooled to 20 c and the volume was returned to the original 10 ml using ultrapure water samples then underwent a heated hydrogen peroxide digestion hydrogen peroxide 30 was added to the samples at a concentration of 0 6 v v and digested for 2 h

performed using a 40 w low pressure uv collimated beam apparatus calgon carbon corporation usa exposure times were calculated using the bolton linden method 16 after the reactor completed a 15 minute warm up period uv irradiance was measured at the center of the beam and the plane coincident with the surface of the water using a usb4000 spectrometer and the spectrasuite software ocean optics inc fl usa 2 4 uv fluence response testing uv fluence response curve data were collected by portioning pre uv wastewater into a petri dish to a depth of 1 cm wastewater samples were then exposed to uv fluences between 10 and 60 mj cm2 following treatment samples were enumerated for e coli and total coliforms pre and post uv exposure samples collected at the wastewater treatment facility were also enumerated as controls all samples were collected as singlets per event and processed under subdued red light to reduce the effects of photo reactivation 2 5 biological methods e coli was enumerated using colilert test kits idexx ma usa volumes between 0 1 and 10 ml of treated and untreated samples were added to sterile 100 ml square cell culture bottles and then filled to 100 ml with sterile phosphate buffered solution one package of colilert s nutrient indicator was added to each flask and mixed until dissolved samples were then transferred to a quanti tray 2000 idexx ma usa and sealed using a quanti tray sealer idexx ma usa samples were incubated at 36 2 c for 24 to 28 h following incubation samples were counted according to the manufacturer s instructions to determine the most probable number mpn of e coli per 100 ml well counts were converted to mpn using the quantitray package in r 4 0 3 17 2 6 statistical methods and data visualization all graphics were generated using r studio 4 0 3 and affinity designer 1 10 5 the ggplot tidyverse and nlstools packages were used in conjunction with the core r functions for statistical and graphical analysis of data non linear models were fitted using the nls function in r 4 0 3 the non linear models used a modified form of the heat inactivation model presented by geeraerd 18 that only includes the log linear and shoulder phases eq 1 1 n t n 0 n res 10 kf n res where nd is the concentration of the population after uv fluence f n0 is the initial concentration of the population and k is the inactivation rate constant and nres is the concentration of a resistant population the goodness of fit of the models were evaluated using the rmse for the non linear models 3 results and discussion 3 1 uv audit of plant performance wastewater treatment facility audit log reduction values lrv shown in fig 1 highlight the differences between each of the sample locations the dashed line across each plot indicates the mean plant performance at each location over the study duration and the shaded area provides a 95 confidence interval about the mean bench scale collimated beam performance data is shown for a range of fluences 0 60 mj cm 2 and is visualized via box plots combining these data fig 1 shows the minimum fluence achieved at full scale for each of the wwtfs the minimum achieved fluence is determined by the first boxplot that overlaps with the shaded mean log reduction region for example the minimum fluence achieved at wwtf a was 10 mj cm 2 while wwtf c achieved a minimum fluence of 30 mj cm 2 and both the wwtf b and wwtf d systems achieved a minimum fluence of 30 mj cm 2 using this audit it was evident that the wwtf a disinfection performance fluence fell below the upper limit of disinfection the discrepancy in performance indicated that wwtf a experienced difficulties in achieving effective disinfection during the study period and that the system was under sized for the influent conditions this result indicated that wwtf a had reached its system limitation but not a matrix limitation for disinfection this result is not entirely unexpected as the collection system for the treatment facility had expanded greatly since it was commissioned in 2005 conversely the three other sampling locations appeared to be matrix limited based on visual inspection this meant that these uv systems were sized appropriately but that water matrix specific factors such as particles and uvt inhibited further disinfection 3 2 applied uv audit for inactivation kinetics and modelling of plant performance the geeraerd model provides an estimation of the inactivation rate constant k and the upper limit of treatment nres for uv reactors nres provides an objective target to compare plant performance to which reduces error when deciding if a facility is system or matrix limited fig 2 shows the collimated beam data along with the modeled inactivation kinetics for each of the facilities these model fits show that e coli in wwtf a wwtf c and wwtf d had similar responses to treatment k range between 0 0915 and 0 0978 cm2 mj 1 the wwtf b response was significantly greater than the other three facilities examined like the inactivation rate constants wwtf a wwtf c and wwtf d had similar upper limits of treatment 2 41 2 67 lrv and wwtf b had a significantly higher upper limit of treatment 3 10 lrv table 1 shows the inactivation rate constants along with the modelling and observed log reduction values for each of the sampling sites 95 confidence intervals were calculated for each location for both observed and modeled disinfection efficacy comparing the confidence intervals for the nres value to the plant lrv from the plant determines if the treatment is system or matrix limited if the wrrf lrv is significantly lower than the modeled nres then there is a system limitation if there is no significant difference then the system is performing at the limitation of the matrix this comparison of confidence intervals revealed that wwtf a and wwtf d s were system limited whereas wwtf b and wwtf c were matrix limited this aspect of the uv audit provides a robust modelling parameter to compare to effluent lrv when definitively determining system versus matrix limited reactors this feature of the audit also removes human error in the assessment of plant performance as wwtf d system limitation was not detected via the initial audit step described in section 3 1 3 3 water quality impacts on uv audit outcomes water quality varied between the wrrfs and showed a range of challenging matrices table 2 the total influent iron concentration for wwtf a was the highest and far exceed the upper limit of 0 3 mgl 1 that most manufacturers recommend to reduce fouling 19 wwtf a has the highest iron 1 40 0 22 mgl 1 highest tss 23 9 7 4 mgl 1 and lowest uvt 43 7 2 9 which suggests that in addition to being an undersized reactor the wastewater matrix for this sampling location is particularly challenging total iron at wwtf b and wwtf d were observed to be similar 0 34 0 03 and 0 38 0 10 mgl 1 respectively and near the upper limit of typically recommended total iron concentration wwtf c had the lowest total iron concentration at 0 147 0 021 mgl 1 uvt at the other three plants varied wwtf b 46 4 3 7 wwtf c 66 8 4 1 wwtf d 52 3 2 7 the higher uvt observed at wwtf c was attributed to wet weather events experienced during the fall months of the study duration where influent wastewater was diluted by stormwater a study by carré et al showed that the range of uvt for the secondary plant examined was 67 2 20 indicating that these data provide a conservative matrix for analysis furthermore these data show that for a wide range of uvt and tss that the matrix limited facilities were still able to achieve large enough lrv to meet regulated e coli effluent targets the increased iron concentrations may also be the cause for reduced uvt the majority of iron present in the wastewater collected is ferric due to the near neutral ph and additions of oxygen into wastewater treatment processes furthermore soluble iron organic complexes which have a high absorption coefficient for uv wavelengths 3 can form between ferric iron and ligands present in wastewater tss concentrations were observed to be moderate and well below the upper limit of 30 mg l 1 recommended by the usepa 21 at wwtf b 9 7 2 0 mg l 1 wwtf c 13 9 5 3 mg l 1 and wwtf d 12 6 2 9 mg l 1 there was a substantial increase in the upper limit of disinfection at wwtf b when comparing wwtf a to wwtf b which had similar influent e coli concentrations 3 4 seasonal effects on disinfection performance uv auditing provided several layers of analysis in understanding the wwtf processes the robustness of auditing was further tested by subsetting the data from two locations into fall and summer seasonal groups fig 3 shows the seasonal changes in disinfection efficacy for the fall and summer months these seasons were chosen as they experienced the largest changes in water quality due to temperature differences precipitation over the course of a year wwtf b experienced a reduction in disinfection efficacy with the average log reduction value changing from 3 00 1 15 in summer to 2 52 0 50 in fall the 95 confidence interval about the mean log reduction for summer disinfection in wwtf b was also much wider when compared to fall sampling table 3 shows the inactivation rate constants along with the modelling and observed log reduction values for each of the sampling sites no significant difference in the k values or nres at either plant indicated that the change in water quality should not have a significant impact on uv performance the average log reduction of wwtf c was relatively unchanged from season to season suggesting that this facility was operating at a system limit throughout the year while the results are not statistically significant the mean values of the plant lrv and nres values were substantially different between seasons the mean effluent e coli lrv was lower in the summer than in the fall δlrv 0 62 log in wwtf b samples and indicated that the reactor was moving towards system limitation the water quality between seasons remained unchanged table 4 suggesting that this plant is more influenced by system factors the lower plant lrv compared to nres in the fall also aligned with when the uv system is taken offline for annual maintenance when aging and fouling would have their greatest impact thus the shift towards a system limited reactor is likely due to increased fouling and aging of the lamps during this period of sampling the mean plant lrv was lower in the summer compared to the fall δlrv 0 43 log for wwtf c sampling location the wwtf c system assessment showed unchanged plant lrv season to season indicating that the system had an upper limit to disinfection as the daf was operated in a batch mode the flow rate was constant and as such the uv system was hypothesized to be mostly influenced by water quality in the summer months there was a significant increase in influent e coli δ 1 3 log increase in tss δ 12 70 mgl 1 and decrease in uvt δ 16 8 changes in water quality make it increasingly difficult to treat water at a constant flow rate the increase in e coli paired with the similar performance in lrv at the plant indicated the detection of a system limitation further shifts beyond system limitations are due to an undersized system 3 5 system vs matrix limitations identified by uv auditing the impacts of system and matrix limitations are a recurring theme throughout this study system limitations can arise from fouling of quartz sleeves aging of lamps or undersized systems system limitations can be addressed by properly assessing the needs and technical requirements of an influent wastewater uv auditing as described in this study was an effective tool for quantifying these limits and could inform decision making for facility upgrades as well as proper maintenance of systems matrix limitations arising from low uvt or high particulate loading can largely be overcome by ensuring the upstream processes are running effectively a matrix limited system is often indicative of an adequately sized system and is not always problematic if effluent regulatory disinfection targets are being consistently met a matrix limited system that consistently is not meeting effluent targets would indicate that improvements to upstream processes or the uv reactor would be required additionally operators and utility managers can use the information provided by uv audits to better time system maintenance and adjust system processes to improve the delivered fluence by a uv reactor the results of this work indicated that uv auditing is a practical and useful tool for both researchers and water utilities when assessing the performance of facilities uv auditing is also useful as full scale uv led technologies mature as a technology and become a viable treatment option for wastewater treatment facilities providing wastewater treatment facilities with a treatment technology that is responsive to the impacts of both climate change and population growth is valuable to municipalities and water utilities quantifying the system and matrix limitations by auditing a variety of uv wastewater systems addresses knowledge gaps related to uv performance the approach described in this study provides both a strategy and protocol for improving performance in full scale wastewater disinfection systems 4 conclusion this study developed a novel uv audit methodology and applied it to four different water resource recovery facilities while also testing for vulnerabilities in this approach uv auditing was capable of successfully identifying system and matrix limitations for four different facilities with wide ranging water qualities and facility capacities this work is significant as uv audits are an alternative tool to currently available methods for assessing the performance of installed reactors uv auditing identifies if a facility is undersized or if there were issues due to fouling or aging of the uv lamps the results of this study suggested that wwtf a was undersized and could overcome system limitations by optimizing plant processes comparing the modeled expected performance at each location to observed data indicated that wwtf d was also system limited analysis of both audits and models for wwtf d showed that it is matrix limited in some respects and system limited in others exploring the water quality data showed that wwtf b had unchanged water quality between fall and summer sampling periods but aligned with annual cleaning of the uv systems within the facility seasonal water quality analysis of wwtf c found a more challenging water matrix to treat with increasing influent e coli during the fall and suggested that the shift towards system limited treatment was due to an undersized system future work will consider the impact that uv led technology has on wastewater treatment processes given the differences in emitted light for leds compared to low pressure lamps uv auditing is also a responsive methodology in the face of climate change and can gauge the performance of uv disinfection as climate pressures change the nature of influent wastewater in summary uv auditing provided a clear and robust method to better understand how water resource recovery facilities perform declaration of competing interest the authors declare

12708,in recent years many researches have reported that anaerobic digestion and methane production can be significantly improved with the addition of conductive materials to the process despite advances a number of questions about this strategy remain unsolved including the mechanism and impact of material properties on methanogenic pathways in order to provide an update on the current state of knowledge and future application perspectives this work analyzed some of the most recent studies using conductive materials in the anaerobic digestion of effluents through a systematic review of the literature and statistical analysis as well as the enriched microorganisms the influence of the dosage size and conductivity of the materials used it was found that the change in the microbial community is associated with the use of conductive material p 0 05 additionally a slight trend was suggested that millimeter scale materials appear to be more effective in increasing methane production in contrast to expectations it was not possible to find a correlation between electrical conductivity and an increase in methane production supporting the idea that other properties may also perform important roles in the process and require further research in general the use of conductive materials is a promising approach to improve anaerobic digestion and methane production however the need for future research was indicated to expand the scale of application of this technology keywords wastewater treatment biomethane biogas anaerobic digestion energy recovery data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction currently the scarcity of resources is a crucial problem for society resource demand requires that the various sectors improve their operating mechanisms and seek comprehensive solutions especially given the global scenario of climate change water scarcity and the transition of the energy matrix 1 in this context the treatment of effluents is presumably an important recovery strategy capable of transforming wastewater into resources that generate value for society such as nutrients water and renewable energy 2 4 anaerobic digestion ad is one of the main routes to recovering energy from organic material 5 6 ad is a biological process used as a strategy in wastewater treatment that involves the decomposition and transformation of organic materials in the absence of oxygen and nitrate in addition to the possibility of recovering energy the main advantages of ad are low biological solid production excess sludge with better dehydration characteristics lower implementation and operation costs low energy consumption and the possibility of operation with high sludge retention time srt and low hydraulic retention times hrt 7 however low concentration of organic matter in some effluents such as municipal wastewater represents a limitation for the exploitation of biogas for energy production municipal effluents for example produced 82 and 75 less volumetric methane than vinasse and glycerol effluents respectively 8 furthermore despite the low solubility in water 20 mg l or 1 25 mmol l it is estimated that up to 45 of the total methane generated remains dissolved in the liquid phase in anaerobic reactors at 30 c and is subsequently lost with the effluent 9 10 these are relevant issues and pose challenges to maximizing the potential energy production in wastewater treatment the use of conductive materials cms as a support for biofilm development has been investigated as a strategy to increase methane production in ad numerous research conducted recently has demonstrated that treating with cm can significantly increase methane production in addition to reducing other disadvantages of the process such as start up time and resistance to adverse conditions 11 various cms have been applied in ad to improve the performance of biological methane production including carbon based materials 12 14 iron based materials 15 16 combinations of carbon and iron 17 or materials such as conductive polymers and iron containing residues 18 19 the majority of research has found an increase in methane production organic matter removal lag phase reduction and resistance to inhibitory conditions although the addition of cms can significantly improve methanogenesis the exact mechanism is still unclear furthermore despite significant advances already reported in the literature there are still questions to be answered such as the role of materials properties in the process and how they affect the microorganisms involved this article sought to review experimental studies that had recently been published that used conductive materials in the anaerobic treatment of effluents in order to remove organic matter and increase methane production with this an overview of the current state of knowledge the techniques developed and the most significant advancements in the area to date are given in contrast to other previous review papers a systematic review of the literature was performed including i the mechanisms known until the time of this paper ii the performance of cms used in methanogenesis iii the effect of their properties and iv the effect of cms on the selection of microorganisms potentially involved in the process for this the microbial groups enriched in the experiments and their possible involvement in direct interspecies electron transfer diet were examined the difference in microbial groups was also statistically examined to see if it was caused by the cm or the different substrates utilized in the studies the methane production increases were analyzed in connection to the dose of each type of material as well as the properties of electrical conductivity and material size as far as we know no other publications have previously analyzed this set of information and data in this way finally this paper discusses future prospects for the application of the technology in effluent treatment and the necessity to develop future research based on what has previously been reported 2 article selection and data analysis several studies have been conducted to investigate the correlation between the addition of cms and the increase in methane production the results of recent research were selected and reviewed in this paper to obtain a better understanding of the mechanisms involved in this process the scheme illustrated in fig 1 describes the procedure used to select experimental data from articles in the end 46 recent articles were selected and used for data collection 32 of these papers provided data that allowed them to be used in statistical analysis with r software including i experimental parameters ii predictions of conductive materials iii performance by materials type iv identification of groups of microorganisms and v technologies and operating data 3 mechanisms of electron transfer between microorganisms methanogenesis depends on an electron exchange process between various species of microorganisms this process is currently called interspecies electron transfer iet and can occur in a mediated miet or direct diet way miet involves the use of mediating molecules that transport electrons diffusing in and out of microorganisms the first mechanism described for miet in methanogenic systems was hydrogen transfer between species 20 where electron donating bacteria reduce h protons by using them as electron acceptors in the oxidation of organic matter with the consequent production of h2 later in methanogenesis the electrons present in the h2 molecule are used by hydrogenotrophic methanogens to reduce co2 to ch4 this process is thermodynamically unfavorable at standard temperature and pressure 21 and it is necessary to keep the partial pressure of h2 low in the anaerobic system to ensure that the reaction occurs continuously which is considered a limitation of the process another issue is the dependence on the diffusion capacity of these mediating molecules which can slow down the process diet is another electron transfer mechanism between microorganisms in which co2 is reduced to ch4 using free electrons that move from one cell exoelectrogenic to another electrotrophic without the use of reduced molecules like hydrogen 22 the description of these mechanisms is more recent with the first report made in 2010 by summers et al 23 in a study with cocultures of geobacter species g metallireducens and g sulfurreducens morita et al 24 discovered diet in methanogenic aggregates in 2011 and methanogenesis via diet was confirmed in 2014 between geobacter species and methanogenic archaea methanosarcina 25 and methanothrix 26 and in 2020 for methanobacterium 27 methanothrix is unable to convert co2 to ch4 using h2 as an electron donor due to the absence of the hydrogenase enzyme but it is able to accept electrons directly from other microorganisms via diet not depending exclusively on the acetoclastic pathway 26 diet is considered a more efficient mechanism than miet because it does not rely on electron carrier diffusion 28 making its stimulation a promising strategy for optimizing ad two routes have been identified for diet via biological compounds with physical cell to cell contact through conductive pili e pili c type cytochrome and other electron transport proteins linked to the cell membrane 29 or through abiotic components such as cms 30 conductive pili are conductive appendages similar to long hairs that grow on the bacterial surface are made up of protein pilin and have conductivity similar to metals due to the overlapping of π orbitals of aromatic amino acids 31 in syntrophic associations the absence of pilin genes or any change in the aromatic amino acids of pilin inhibited electron transfer 32 c type cytochromes are proteins that contain prosthetic heme groups which contain an iron atom and are associated with the inner membrane the periplasm and the outer membrane of microorganisms where they transport electrons during oxidation and reduction 33 one of the most cited c type cytochromes is omcs which is involved in extracellular electron transfer summers et al 23 found that omcs was the most abundant c type cytochrome in microbial aggregates and the exclusion of genes encoding omcs or pilin inhibited any visible growth even after long term incubation similar results were observed in co culture of g metallireducens and methanosarcina 25 or methanothrix 26 in which g metallireducens mutants without pili and cytochromes could not initiate oxidation of substrate in addition to these two cellular compounds there are other electron transport proteins outside the cell membranes involved in diet when microorganisms form a direct cell to cell connection 34 diet via membrane bound electron transport proteins may be a mechanism for the formation of methane 34 however there is no evidence of its occurrence currently available suggesting that this pathway is not common for methanogenic microorganisms although the mechanisms of electron transfer from electron donating bacteria have been largely elucidated it is still unclear how methanogenic microorganisms can accept electrons during diet 35 37 some methanosarcina species have c type cytochromes 38 and this could facilitate electron transfer in the cellular envelopes of methanosarcina and methanothrix there are multiple active redox proteins and it is possible that external proteins such as ferredoxin obtain electrons from electron donating bacteria it is also possible that the flagellar appendages of methanogenic microorganisms which are similar to conductive pili are involved in extracellular electron capture 39 the first suggestion that cms could accelerate microbial metabolism via diet for methane production was made in 2012 12 40 since then many researchers have tested a variety of cms carbon based materials iron oxides and conductive polymers have all been identified as aiding in the electron transfer process but the stimulating mechanism of diet via cms to promote methane production remains unclear 41 initially the interspecies electron transfer induced by cms was also identified as diet however rotaru et al 37 recently proposed the name ciet conductive particle mediated interspecies electron transfer since cells are not in direct contact with one another in interactions cell material cell and the genes typically involved in diet are markedly dysregulated however as the term diet is used in all the papers analyzed in this review it will be utilized throughout this article even so it should be noted that as proposed by rotaru et al 37 the process under investigation here is the interspecies electron transfer mediated by cms or ciet different cms have different roles in diet stimulation liu et al 12 found evidence of diet via cm using granular activated carbon gac in a coculture of g metallireducens e g sulfurreducens in contrast to what would be expected if there were only biological electrical connections the investigators observed that the cells were firmly connected with gac in co cultures without conducting pili or the pili associated cytochromes chen et al 42 found that the addition of carbon cloth restored the interspecies electron transfer according to these results these cms might be able to take the position of conductive cytochromes and pili as a pathway for extracellular long range electron transfer however a different result was verified using magnetite magnetite can compensate for the absence of c type cytochromes but conductive pili are still required for electron transfer 43 44 magnetite was found along the pili of a mutant omcs deficient strain compensating for the loss of omcs and allowing diet to proceed the micrographs included in some works assist in illuminating the different roles that cms can play in the stimulation of electron transfer between microorganisms 33 44 while some cms are significantly larger than microorganisms allowing microbial cells to attach to their surfaces for electron transfer without pili being present magnetite is much smaller than cells and requires the pili structure 45 despite playing distinct roles both types of materials can provide energy savings to cells and improve ad fig 2 illustrates the different ways that these cms perform not only can magnetite play the role of omcs during diet but it also suppresses the expression of the gene responsible for this cytochrome in non mutant strains implying that cells do not need to expend as much energy to synthesize diet associated proteins in the presence of magnetite and possibly other cms 35 this is supported by the fact that diet between g sulfurreducens and g metallireducens can take up to 30 days in the absence of cms 23 implying that cells need time to express the cellular components required for electron transfer although the functions of pili and c type cytochrome in diet are not fully understood the results suggest that cms can replace these biological connectors in a controlled manner for example through different doses and types of materials 47 it is yet unclear which properties of cms affect methanogenesis and how numerous controversial findings were found throughout the investigation suggesting that further research needs to be done on this subject the ad improvement was associated with a variety of properties specific surface area roughness electrical conductivity pore size and other properties of cms can influence their potential to increase methanogenesis xu et al 17 proposed that the electron donating capacity edc of goethite feooh was an important factor in explaining the improved performance of this cm in methanogenesis the same authors indicated the selective enrichment of syntrophic bacteria was associated with the electron exchange characteristics of the cms the abundance of methanothrix and some syntrophic bacteria such as aminicenantes synergistaceae and thauera were benefited by higher values in electron accepting capacity eac while methanosarcina and syntrophomonadaceae species were benefited by higher values in edc 17 conversely wang et al 48 examined a variety of biochars with comparable electron donating and accepting capacities but variable ad performance demonstrating that differences in methane production were unrelated to the electrochemical properties of the biochars the difficulty in inferring how cms affect methanogenic pathways has led many studies to attribute the improvement in ad performance exclusively to diet however xiao et al 49 published evidence that the use of cms in ad can benefit additional methanogenic pathways such as acetoclastic and hydrogenotrophic pathways suggesting that co2 reduction by diet alone does not necessarily account for enhanced performance in agreement with this statement wang et al 48 discovered that in spite of the increase in methane production the hydrogenotrophic pathway not diet was dominating in the ad process furthermore according to wu et al 50 the interaction between diet and miet is cooperative rather than antagonistic the majority of research makes indirect inferences about diet nonetheless a complex set of methods is needed to confirm its occurrence metagenomics analysis is one technique to investigate the metabolic pathways used by microorganisms park et al 51 found that microbial aggregates in contact with conductive material had a higher abundance of methanothrix genes associated with the co2 reduction pathway and a lower abundance of genes associated with the acetate decarboxylation pathway indicating the presence of the diet pathway since this microorganism cannot use the hydrogenotrophic pathway to reduce co2 also according to the authors functional gene expression is another way to determine the mechanism by which diet occurs the pila and omcs genes are overexpressed in the mechanism via pili and c type cytochrome to promote the physical connection between species and electron transfer 52 because cms can substitute the proteins encoded by these functional genes pila and omcs are less expressed in the process via cms 12 in case the mechanism occurs via membrane bound electron transport proteins pila is less expressed and omcs is overexpressed because electron transfer is achieved via membrane bound electron carriers c type cytochrome without conducting pili 51 omics analyses are a possibility but steendam 53 provides a detailed examination of the current approaches used to confirm diet and explains their limitations rotaru et al 37 also discuss the inadequacies of the methods already in use and emphasize the need for new investigation strategies 4 impact of conductive materials on anaerobic digestion 4 1 conductive materials reduced lag times increased methane production rates high methane yields and increased tolerance to inhibitory circumstances have all been observed in reactors with the addition of cms in most experiments these findings show that the addition of cms to traditional ad improves it significantly the cms employed as well as the effects of supplementation with these materials on methanogenesis are detailed below 4 1 1 carbon based materials conductive carbon based materials have been widely used to stimulate methane production granular activated carbon gac powdered activated carbon pac biochar carbon fiber carbon nanotubes graphene and graphite are all examples of this type of carbon table 1 shows the results of experiments that used carbon based materials to improve methanogenesis 4 1 1 1 activated carbon gac and pac activated carbon has been the most commonly used material in studies on diet stimulation using cms activated carbon is a cheap substance with little biological toxicity a large specific surface area and numerous pores 61 initially its use in ad was due to its ability to adsorb toxic chemicals that could inhibit microbial activity 30 granular activated carbon gac provides a large surface area for microbial adhesion is electrically conductive and can be used as an electron acceptor in anaerobic respiration by some microorganisms 11 17 the majority of the studies examined used particles with a size range of 0 15 4 76 mm 4 100 mesh which allows the material to be retained in reactors 11 as show in table 1 the majority of gac investigations resulted in considerable increases in methane yield when compared to the control condition there were increases in methane yield of 2 to 966 and increases in methane production rate of 1 06 to 7 6 times various experimental conditions quantity of material size substrates cod etc can influence the observed results in the works examined the amount of material utilized for supplementing is an important parameter for improving methanogenesis park et al 51 found that increasing the mass of gac from 3 to 6 g l increased methane production with higher maximum methane production rates than in reactors supplemented with pac and magnetite xu et al 64 also investigated different gac dosages and discovered that increasing the gac concentration from 0 5 g l to 25 g l reduced the latency phase period from 3 4 to 0 9 days in the propionate fed reactor and from 12 7 to 7 8 days in the butyrate fed reactor however when the gac dosage was increased from 5 g l to 25 g l a very small increment in the maximum methane production rate was found indicating that the lower dosage is more appropriate 64 and therefore the increase in methane production does not occur in a linear manner to the amount of material added xu et al 64 investigated the performance of gac at different substrate concentrations 1 g l and 5 g l of acetate butyrate and propionate and discovered that the addition of gac had no significant effect at the lowest concentration condition with results that were quite similar to the control with increased concentrations different results were observed for each substrate the addition of gac had little effect on acetate degradation the results were still very near to the control but it considerably increased the degradation of propionate and butyrate resulting in increases in methane yield of 9 to 10 times that of the control propionate and butyrate must be metabolized first by acetogenic bacteria whereas acetate is the only volatile fatty acids vfa that may be absorbed directly by methanogens 64 this result indicates the addition of gac benefits the enrichment of syntrophic bacteria and can accelerate the degradation of these substrates even under high organic loading in 2020 xu et al 17 observed a 66 133 increase in methane yield using a mixture of acetate propionate and butyrate in a reactor supplemented with gac in opposition to most results namal 60 observed a reduction 30 in methane production in a gac supplemented reactor which was attributed to the inhibition of microbial activity caused by the penetration of gac nanoparticles into the cell membrane of microorganisms in addition the reactor supplemented with the material showed a lower methane production rate and a longer lag time further reinforcing the possibility of inhibition these results indicate that more research is needed to confirm the inhibition effect of the cms on microorganisms and that material selection remains a challenge treatment of wastewater with lower organic loads presents a challenge in terms of methane production but even here adding gac has proven to be a promising strategy even at low temperatures 14 5 to 20 c gac promoted an increase in methane production of up to 2 14 times compared to the control when added to uasb reactors for the treatment of wastewater with cod in the range of 100 to 400 mg l 55 57 59 park et al 58 also confirmed that the addition of gac improves methane production even at low temperatures however not all of the results were positive which suggests the need for more study to comprehend the true effects of gac on methanogenesis florentino et al 62 used black water as a substrate to examine the performance of gac in the treatment of three different concentrations of organic matter for the lowest dilution case cod of 18 5 g l the biochemical methane potential bmp increased from 35 6 to 53 1 however in conditions of higher dilution 4 6 and 2 6 g cod l there was a drastic decrease in bmp from 42 6 to 16 1 and from 50 4 to 9 6 respectively according to the authors the gac promoted the removal of up to 86 of cod in the highly diluted samples by adsorption implying a very low concentration of substrates available for hydrolysis and acidogenesis hindering the efficient performance of all subsequent reactions furthermore a decrease in suspended and adherent biomass on the gac surface was found in these samples indicating a shortage of substrates in the medium it was suggested that the supply of substrates was insufficient to sustain microorganism growth and that the conductive property of gac had no effect in these circumstances shanmugam et al 13 reported lower methane production using gac attributed again to the adsorption of organic acids as a result attention should be exercised when using gac particularly for the treatment of more diluted wastewater as organic component adsorption under these conditions may be a limiting issue in addition to using activated carbon in granular form the powdered form pac has also been used to enhance methanogenesis park et al 51 compared pac and gac in the degradation of ethanol and acetate except for size and specific surface area both materials had similar physicochemical properties pac was expected to provide more sites for microbial attachment involved in diet due to its larger specific surface area and this in turn would increase methane production however the gac supplemented serum bottles showed a 22 increase in final volume and a 20 increase in methane production rate compared to the pac supplemented serum bottles using acetate as substrate the reactors supplemented with pac showed few significant differences compared to the control regardless of the substrate used 51 shanmugam et al 13 also found lower pac performance than gac in methane production during glucose degradation in this study it was observed that the electrical conductivity of gac was significantly higher than pac 322 1 and 17 0 μs cm 1 respectively which could explain the difference in performance between these materials however in the same study when comparing gac with biochars that presented similar conductivities in the range from 322 to 350 μs cm 1 the performance was distinct in this case the lower performance when using gac could be attributed in part to the adsorption effect of the material as discussed previously demonstrating that methane production can be influenced by several parameters in addition to electrical conductivity which needs to be evaluated in future research the impact of gac on long term larger scale and more complex substrates needs to be investigated and demonstrated further in addition some authors point out possible disadvantages to its use according to florentino et al 62 there is not much homogeneity in the quality of gac and the adsorptive capacity may differ from series to series in production impacting the optimal concentration for each situation under investigation hu et al 18 state that activated carbon has an unstable structure and chemical properties and its conductivity can be reduced due to microbial activity under anaerobic conditions therefore although it is a potential and affordable substrate further investigations are needed for a complete evaluation of the material and to scale up the technology 4 1 1 2 biochar biochar is a carbon rich porous material produced by the thermochemical degradation of biomass via gasification or pyrolysis at a cheap cost and with minimal environmental impact 13 its composition depends on the nature of the feedstock and the carbonization process biochar was produced using a wide range of raw materials and at different temperatures additionally the biochars were modified in three studies by oxidation reduction h2o2 hno3 and k2co3 65 67 as a result biochars with a variety of characteristics and effects can be seen in table 1 in the studies evaluated the particle size ranged from 0 1 to 2 55 mm while the electrical conductivity varied greatly from 1 13e10 8 to 1350 ms cm 1 table 1 as a general trend biochar supplementation showed significant improvement in the performance of anaerobic digestion both in the degradation of simple and complex organic matter shanmugam et al 13 worked with biochar produced from three types of biomass two of which were produced at two different temperatures resulting in five types of biochar with different properties biochar from biomass of canola meal cbc switchgrass sbc and ashe juniper abc was used using glucose as a substrate sbc and abc achieved similar results effectively reducing the lag time and showing a 70 to 72 increase in methane production compared to control using a complex substrate aqueous phase of algal bio oil increases of 54 to 1133 in methane yield were observed when compared to the control biochar cbc and abc respectively an increase in cod removal efficiency was also observed regarding the pyrolysis temperature the biochar produced at an intermediate temperature 400 c showed higher biogas production when compared to biochar produced at higher temperatures 600 to 900 c this result was attributed to the existence of higher concentrations of redox active moieties such as quinones and phenazines in biochar produced at intermediate temperatures which can act as catalysts mediating the transfer of electrons between microorganisms the ideal pyrolysis temperature for ad however is a matter of debate according to qi et al 69 biochar produced at 900 c performed more stably over a long period of time than biochar produced at 400 c sun et al 65 found a similar result finding that biochar produced at 900 c outperformed biochars produced at lower temperatures in ad using ethanol as a substrate qi et al 69 examined the performance of biochar made from hickory wood chips at 400 and 900 c in the control reactor acidification was seen in the first 25 days whereas the biochar equipped reactors were stable and increased the specific production of methane the reason for this according to the authors is that biochar speeds up the degradation of acetic acid and reduces the acidogenesis acetogenesis lag period additionally the authors state that one of the benefits of biochar is an increase in the bioavailability of trace elements that are crucial for the synthesis of enzymes during ad this could occur in two ways first biochar naturally contains abundant trace elements that can be utilized by methanogens second biochar can adsorb and release trace elements under various conditions as a result of two physicochemical properties that affect microbial accessibility in the study by bose et al 68 which used synthetic black water as a substrate there was no substantial difference in the methane generation between biochars made at different temperatures 300 425 and 550 c however the two biochars generated at higher temperatures were slightly more successful in minimizing lag phases and biochar produced at 550 c accumulated less vfa attributable to the larger surface area and possibly higher vfa adsorption regarding modified biochars oxidation with hno3 inhibited methanegenesis possibly as a result of the production and or dissolution of inhibitory compounds and ph disturbance by nitrate nitro groups whereas oxidation with h2o2 had a positive effect increasing methane yield by 58 07 compared to control and 9 9 compared to unmodified biochar 67 this effect was explained by the fact that the oxidation with h2o2 enhanced the redox properties particularly the capacity to donate electrons as a result of an increase in surface functional groups such as phenolics and lactonics sun et al 65 however employed the same substance h2o2 to oxidize biochar and the results were no better than those of unaltered biochar another modification was made with k2co3 when compared to the control kobayashi et al 66 observed that the k2co3 modified biochar improved ad accelerated the rate of palmitic acid degradation and increased the maximum rate of methane production by 1 3 times this result was attributed to the higher specific area high conductivity and hydrophilicity of the k2co3 modified biochar analyzing these researches reveals that despite efforts to increase methanogenesis and growing concern over the correlations between material properties and stimulatory effects on ad there is still no agreement on the specific biochar properties that are promoting the improvement in ad for example while sun et al 65 reported that electrical conductivity and electron donating capacity were significant determinants of methane yield wang et al 48 indicated that neither of these attributes was associated with differences in methane production more research is still needed to understand how biochars affect methanogenesis it is also controversial which methanogenic pathway is affected although some research has associated increased methane production with the occurrence of diet wang et al 48 discovered that despite the apparent increase in methane production the hydrogenotrophic pathway was probably the primary one rather than diet it has been proposed that although it is possible that biochar addition stimulated the co existence of diet with mediated interspecies electron transfer the low electrical conductivity and electron transfer capacity of biochar limited its dominance in this instance the pore volume and adsorption capabilities were the key variables that influenced the system environment and microbial metabolism ultimately reflected in the variations in methane yield jiang et al 67 attributed the intensification of the acetoclastic pathway to the increase in methane generation the vast majority of research examined shows a significant improvement in ad and methane production with the use of biochar but the precise factors that support these benefits are yet unknown additionally it is difficult to produce biochar with consistent physicochemical properties because the properties of this material strongly depend on the raw materials utilized and the production process 78 4 1 1 3 carbon fibers carbon fibers are another cm that has been tested to improve ad this material has the advantage of low cost and ease of being incorporated into the permanent design of anaerobic reactors and can be maintained in the reactors without loss by washing 11 carbon fibers with a specific surface area ranging from 0 4 to 1 6 m2 l were used in the treatment of organic acids and ethanol when compared to the control methane yields increased by 38 to 137 cumulative methane volume increased by 10 to 44 and methane production rates increased by 1 3 to 6 7 times 73 75 despite significant differences in the specific surface areas of the carbon fibers used barua et al 74 discovered that the methanogenesis rate and specific methane yield were only slightly higher in the reactor with the larger surface area fiber implying that while carbon fibers promote increased methane yield and improved methanogenesis kinetics this occurs nonlinearly to the increase in specific surface area authors suggest that this is due to carbon fiber aggregation which reduces specific surface area available for biomass attachment and that more research is needed to correlate specific surface areas in different arrangements with methanogenic activity another material employed was carbon cloth a form of carbon fiber 79 the carbon cloth improved the rate of methane production by up to 260 during the stable part of the ad in addition to helping to recover a failed anaerobic reactor 71 in the six steps of the experiment carbon cloth was alternately added and removed performance quickly increased whenever carbon cloth was added while performance decreased when it was removed the authors explained this observation by explaining that when the cm is removed the diet is disrupted nevertheless it is also possible that this result is related to the reduction of biofilm which disturbs the system the mixing conditions of the reactors with carbon cloth were also examined 70 the unmixed reactor demonstrated an up to 23 increase in methane production rate intense mixing too often can remove biofilm and hinder ad performance according to both studies the properties that may have contributed to the improvement in ad were a large specific surface area and high conductivity which stimulated the production of biofilms and electron transfer within the microbial community 70 71 the performance of a brush made of carbon fiber was compared to brushes made of stainless steel horsehair and polyester 72 and the results were quite interesting only the polyester brush reactor underperformed the others the high biocompatibility of the horsehair which allowed for more biomass retention was credited with the successful material outcome whereas the polyester brush had poor biocompatibility comparable results between the conductive carbon fiber and stainless steel brushes and the non conductive horsehair brush show that electrical conductivity was not required for increased ad performance however stainless steel despite being less biocompatible also demonstrated a result comparable to that of horsehair brush and carbon fiber so electrical conductivity cannot be disregarded therefore it would seem that the advantages of electrical conductivity compensate for the reduced biofilm formation in these reactors these findings also indicate that polyester is not an efficient control material in diet studies and that biocompatibility of materials is a significant consideration in investigations employing cms 4 1 1 4 graphite graphite is a crystalline carbon allotrope and in the studies reviewed it was used in granular form with a size of between 3 and 5 mm 14 and in felt 76 guo et al 14 compared the performance of two up flow biofilm reactors one with quartz particles and the other with graphite particles using low strength wastewater as substrate 400 mg cod l and microbial fuel cell fluid as inoculum the authors reported an uncommon and far above average outcome with the addition of granular graphite increasing the production rate and the yield of methane by 34 3 and 22 4 times respectively this expressive result was associated with the type of reactor employed since the properties of the support material have a significant influence on the biofilm that forms in up flow fixed bed reactors additionally the result was attributed to significant modifications in the microbial community and metabolism particularly for the archaea genera since the inoculum was extracted from a microbial fuel cell it may have already contained electroactive microorganisms that benefited from the presence of cm however some observations need to be considered the control had a methane production rate of just 3 18 l kg cod which explains why the percentage rise was so expressive despite the methane production with graphite not being particularly high according to the authors themselves the low methane production in the control reactor was caused by the short hrt but the type of material used as control which may have had low biocompatibility might also have had an impact on the result as discussed in 4 1 1 3 despite the significant improvement seen the methane yield in the graphite reactor was only 74 5 l kg cod which is less than the average for other studies 200 l kg cod this can be explained in part because the substrate has a lower than average organic load even so this discovery is significant because ad is frequently employed in hot climate countries like brazil to treat low strength wastewater such as municipal wastewater and the addition of cm can be effective too in these conditions more study is necessary however as previous research has shown that when used to treat low strength effluents graphite performs worse than other carbon based materials such as biochar and gac 80 81 zhang et al 76 analyzed the use of graphite felt in a sequential batch reactor comparing the performance in the degradation of propionate and butyrate with a cod concentration of 5 g l with both substrates reductions in lag time and increases of 16 7 to 19 1 in methane production rate and 15 3 to 17 in methane yield were observed however the control was done in the absence of any material and it is difficult to say whether this improvement in methane production was caused by the conductive properties of the material or just the presence of a support medium for biofilm formation in addition the influence of graphite felt was tested under conditions of high hydrogen pressure where it was observed that in the reactors supplemented with the material there was practically no change in substrate degradation and methane production while in the control reactor the process was inhibited demonstrating that the graphite felt can favor alternative electron transfer pathways to conventional ones acetoclastic and hydrogenotrophic 4 1 1 5 graphene and carbon nanotubes graphene and carbon nanotubes are layered and cylindrical carbon nanostructures respectively forming a hexagonal lattice they have high electrical conductivity mechanical strength and thermal conductivity 82 these materials have also been used in the stimulation of diet but they can be highly toxic to microorganisms graphene 0 8 16 nm thick and 2 μm long and multi walled nanotubes were used in the analyzed studies lin et al 77 investigated the effects of different concentrations of graphene on the degradation of the amino acid glycine which has a metabolically different degradation pathway from vfa the authors discovered that adding 0 5 g l of graphene increased methane yield by 5 7 while increasing the amount to 2 g l resulted in a 10 decrease confirming its inhibitory effect on microbial activity according to the authors previous studies have verified the cytotoxicity of nanomaterials on different microorganisms and the size of the materials is the key to the antimicrobial effects bacterial cell membranes have been reported to be damaged by graphene due to direct contact with the very sharp edges of graphene nanosheets resulting in the efflux of intracellular components such as rna 77 however the application of graphene had a positive effect on methanogenesis with the appropriate dosage with the addition of 1 0 g l graphene the highest peak methane production was achieved resulting in a 28 increase above the control furthermore the time required to reach the maximum methane production rate was reduced from 12 to 9 days multi walled carbon nanotubes were used by ambuchi et al 16 in the ad of beet sugar industrial wastewater the control reactor performed better in the first 6 h in terms of cod removal and in the first 18 h in terms of methane generation an effect attributed to the necessity for microorganisms to acclimate to the cm following that the reactor using carbon nanotubes showed a 20 increase in methane production and a 26 improvement in cod removal efficiency while the presence of free and dispersed microorganisms could be seen in the sample obtained in the reactor under control circumstances the microorganisms in the sample collected in the reactor supplemented with the material were densely compacted the electrons generated by substrate oxidation were most likely transported to the methanogenic bacteria through electron conduits established by the cm however a gap fracture was found in the microbial aggregation which the authors attribute to physical contact between the carbon nanotubes and the microbial cells which caused damage to the membranes resulting in perforation and cell death in agreement with what lin et al 77 pointed out although this effect did not cause the process to be inhibited in this case it does indicate that using nanomaterials in ad should be done with caution in addition to cell disruption caused mainly by the small size of these materials oxidation processes on the cell membrane can also occur the effect of these materials is dependent on the shape size and type of microorganisms that come into contact with them 83 and because ad occurs in a highly heterogeneous microbial community their application may be limited as well as the high cost of using these materials in a realistic context 4 1 2 iron based materials methane production has also been enhanced using conductive iron based materials magnetite goethite and hematite have all been tested in recent years according to baek kim and lee 84 there is evidence that suggests that the conductivity and crystallinity of iron oxides may be the major factors in the diet promoting effect table 2 summarizes research that has used iron based materials to enhance methanogenesis 4 1 2 1 magnetite magnetite is the most commonly used iron oxide the conductivity of iron oxides has been reported to alter the kinetics of methanogenesis shortening the latency phase and resulting in increased methane yields 40 magnetite as a cm has several advantages including minimal environmental toxicity availability strong magnetism and high conductivity 28 magnetite was utilized in experiments with diameters up to 88 μm and dosages ranging from 1 to 10 g l park et al 51 examined two different magnetite concentrations in the degradation of acetate and ethanol and found the methane production trends were similar regardless of substrate when the magnetite concentration was increased from 3 to 6 g l the final volume of methane produced increased by 18 to 31 this rise in methane production with increasing magnetite mass indicated that the cm was the primary cause of the increased methane production methane yields were 91 6 for acetate and 87 4 for ethanol with the highest magnetite dosage due to faster electron transfer via cm than diffusive electron carriers such as hydrogen and formate yin et al 90 reported that magnetite produced 78 3 more methane using a more complex substrate synthetic wastewater tryptone with a 2 g l cod with varying organic loading rates olr from 1 6 to 25 6 kg cod m 3 d 1 magnetite also demonstrated good effects permitting increases in methane output of 7 to 483 with low olr exhibiting the strongest stimulation 85 using nano sized magnetite a positive effect was also observed methane production and cod removal effectiveness outperformed control by 31 1 and 101 5 respectively 88 in addition to increasing methane production magnetite influences the reactor recovery time after a disruption wang et al 15 investigated the use of magnetite in micron size in the ad of synthetic wastewater in a 7 5 l uasb reactor under startup and starvation recovery conditions and discovered that adding material increased cod removal efficiency during system disturbances while also reducing recovery time by 50 in addition to accelerating starving recovery magnetite was also demonstrated by wang et al 87 to hasten reactor recovery following perturbation caused by the use of different substrates indicating that the use of magnetite can increase the resistance of system namal 60 found that the use of magnetite reduced the lag time by 50 and also observed higher accumulated methane volume and higher cod removal efficiency the use of magnetite in ad has shown promising results in improving methanogenesis cod removal lag time reduction and reactor recovery time after disturbance but the use of iron based materials in general remains a challenge because their presence in the sludge can affect disposal practices and the environment 47 necessitating the development of strategies to retain material in the reactor hu et al 18 also indicate difficulties related to the use of iron oxides due to the possibility of these materials being corroded and dissolved in the effluent 4 1 2 2 goethite goethite was another iron oxide used to stimulate diet the particle size employed in the treatment of three distinct doses of vfa was 0 15 to 0 25 mm at 5 g l of goethite performance improved with the rise in organic matter concentration and methane production yields increased from 40 to 153 goethite performed slightly worse than gac at the lowest organic matter concentration 17 according to xu et al 17 goethite can activate iron containing enzymes f420 involved in methanogenesis and acidogenesis and selectively enrich functional microorganisms furthermore the higher electron donating capacity edc of goethite 2 0 μmol g compared to 0 8 μmol g of gac may operate as a triggering factor for the growth of bacteria capable of diet with methanogens for syntrophic organic acid degradation the ability to transfer electrons could be an important indicator of the redox activity of conductive particles further research is needed to determine the role of these properties in diet promotion 4 1 2 3 hematite although the chemical compositions and electrical conductivities of magnetite and hematite differ their stimulation in diet appears to be similar based on lag times and methane production rates the efficacy of hematite nanoparticles in the treatment of beet sugar industrial wastewater was investigated by ambuchi et al 16 when compared to the control the reactor supplemented with hematite demonstrated a 35 increase in accumulated methane volume and methane production rate after 48 h the need for biomass acclimation was cited as the reason for the delay in methane production the enhanced methane production in the presence of hematite can be attributed to these highly conductive properties which can result in distinct patterns of interaction with the substrate due to its structural orientation thermodynamic and reactivity capabilities 16 4 1 2 4 zero valent iron zero valent iron zvi has also been utilized to enhance ad zhong et al 91 explored the issue of material size the authors investigated the impact of various doses 0 2 5 g l and particle sizes 0 1 250 μm on the glucose degradation using zvi an optimal dosage was found for each particle size with 2 g l of 48 μm particles producing the largest increase in methane production 84 1 the potential mechanisms by which the zvi size effect affects the methane production process are explained when zvi particles are large greater than or equal to 48 μm they primarily act as a medium for microorganism fixation increasing the biomass in the ad system and boosting the efficiency of methane production when zvi particles are very small less than or equal to 0 1 μm they can be easily dispersed in the mixed liquid and interact with microorganisms increasing the activity of related enzymes and subsequently increasing the efficiency of methanogenesis however it was also shown that nanoscale zvi generates a significant amount of biotoxic reactive oxygen species on the cell surface which causes microbial cells to lyse and die and ultimately causes the ad system to fail 4 1 3 carbon modified with iron oxides and other metals some research has modified carbon materials with iron oxides and nickel to address issues such as iron oxide particles being easily washed out of reactors or to increase the conductivity of carbon materials 11 92 in the investigations gac and carbon fiber modified with hematite magnetite goethite zero valent iron and nickel were employed table 3 presents a summary of the investigations that utilized these resources recent studies have examined how metals like fe and ni can increase methane production these trace metals are necessary for a number of biochemical processes that are connected to the use of vfa enzymatic activity and methane generation in ad 95 the presence of fe3 oxides enhances iron reducing bacteria that can participate in diet but these same oxides can compete for the electrons that would be used by methanogenic microorganisms in co2 reduction 73 the combination of iron oxides and carbon materials was used to enhance iron reducing bacteria while also transferring electrons to methanogenic microorganisms through the carbon materials 73 when carbon fiber modified with hematite hcf was used in propionate degradation methane production increased by 15 compared to the control and by 3 7 compared to reactors supplemented with carbon fiber only 73 furthermore after 16 days it was observed that the substrate was completely degraded only in the reactor with hcf according to the amount of fe2 released in the reactor the fe3 ion as an electron acceptor was only responsible for 1 34 of the substrate degradation which is much less than the entire removal 19 67 when comparing the peak current of the hcf to the reactor with only carbon fibers a 3 57 fold increase in peak current was discovered indicating an increase in electron exchange capacity this strategy did not improve the results in the study by xu et al 17 the authors found that gac doped with goethite and akaganeite had a lower methane production efficiency than gac and goethite alone the reduced efficiency was attributable to the ferric oxides attached to the gac surface having poor crystallinity resulting in fe3 leaching when compared to crystalline compounds poorly crystalline or amorphous fe3 oxides can inhibit methanogenesis because the less crystalline forms are more easily dissociated and the dissociated fe3 can be utilized as an electron acceptor by iron reducing bacteria the amount of fe2 emitted was not reported by the authors in this investigation more research is needed to determine the effect of this process on methane production in gac doping both micron size mgac and nanoparticle form mngac magnetite has been used and both demonstrated higher performance than reactors without cm and those supplemented only with gac 61 63 gac with sizes ranging from 0 84 to 2 38 mm doped with magnetite powder 5 μm was employed in the propionate degradation investigation by barua et al 63 under these conditions the methane production of this material increased by 1 52 and 1 21 times that of the control reactor and the gac only reactor respectively the accumulation of acetate in the control and gac reactors which could have resulted in decreased performance was not detected in the mgac supplemented reactor in the ad of synthetic wastewater song et al 61 employed gac doped with magnetite nanoparticles average diameter of 10 nm mngac had a conductivity 2 03 times that of gac resulting in a 220 increase in the volume of methane produced as compared to the control condition in addition the proportion of methane in the biogas generated was increased by 25 compared to the control and by 10 compared to the gac reactor these findings are explained by the fact that magnetite nanoparticles have a biostimulation impact on methanogenic microorganisms increasing the conversion of substrate into methane as well as the higher conductivity which accelerates electron transfer in order to increase methane production gac was modified with nanoparticles of zero valent iron it was found that with 1000 mg l the cod degradation rate and methane production increased by 9 38 and 14 29 respectively 93 the degradation of acetate butyrate and propionate was investigated with ni modified gac the strong metabolic ability of the inoculum to metabolize acetate is responsible for the fact that as observed in other research cm supplementation had no effect on acetate degradation the maximum methane rate increased by 16 55 for butyrate and 54 06 for propionate respectively the authors attributed this improvement to an increase in syntrophic metabolism between syntrophomonas and methanogens additionally it was shown that adding ni alone to the reactor had no effect on the degradation of acetate but had a significant inhibitory effect on the production of methane utilizing propionate and butyrate nickel may have inhibited methanogens hydrogenotrophic or syntrophic oxidizing bacteria but not acetotrophic methanogens 94 4 1 4 other materials table 4 summarizes the other cms that were used in the improvement of methanogenesis blast furnace dust bfd is a byproduct of the steelmaking process that is abundant in carbon and iron oxides especially magnetite and hematite 19 yang et al 19 added different concentrations of bfd to uasb reactors with a concentration of 40 mg l the highest biogas production efficiency was achieved with 116 88 l ch4 g of material used the performance was worse at a dosage of 50 mg l presumably due to an excess of material that inhibited microbial activity supplementation with polyaniline pani a conductive polymer also increased methane production during ad the length of the polymer chains provides a stable chemical structure and high resistance to microbial degradation other properties of pani stand out such as ease of synthesis low cost and environmental stability 18 additionally the electrical conductivity can be modified throughout the synthesis process hu et al 18 used pani nanorods in synthetic wastewater treatment in 2017 and obtained nearly 2 times more methane at an optimal dosage of 600 mg l in 2019 a new way of pani synthesis was tested using intracellular polymeric substances ips released from e coli cells 100 the conductivity of pani was controlled by the concentration of ips added the higher the conductivity the more methane is produced with production reaching around 2 times that of the control reactor according to the authors conductivity was found to be more relevant in ch4 production than material porosity in this circumstance a different approach to enhancing ad and finding answers to problems with employing materials alone such as the cited difficulty in keeping materials in reactors has been to combine the structures of particular materials for example pani was used to synthesize other compounds pani and magnetite composites in hydrogel form pani covering polyvinylidene fluoride pvdf and polyethylene terephthalate pet and pani with polypyrrole the pani magnetite composite which was created with 40 magnetite increased ch4 production rate by 26 98 at an ideal dose of 0 6 g l but performance decreased when the dosage was increased to 5 4 g l due to an inhibitory effect the authors found that the acetoclastic pathway enzymes increased whereas the hydrogenotrophic pathway enzymes did not differ significantly when they examined the enzymatic activity associated with methanogenesis 96 a pani hydrogel that was created by zhou et al 99 has the benefit of facilitating microbial adherence in addition to its large size and mechanical strength with an optimal dosage of 3 g l the pani hydrogel enabled an increase in ch4 production rate of up to 28 77 pani has also been used to coat non conductive polymers like polyvinylidene fluoride pvdf and polyethylene terephthalate pet 98 this approach was used in order to keep the pani in the reactor for a long period of time with the usage of pani coated pet and pvdf the rate of ch4 production improved by 9 and 25 respectively the higher specific surface area of the pvdf material was credited with producing the greatest results zhou et al 97 combined pani and polypyrrole to create core shell structures polypyrrole is a conductive polymer with a stable chemical structure and high conductivity the methane production rate and yield increased by 70 2 and 28 3 respectively when the recommended dosage of 0 6 g l of this core shell material was used this indicates that the substance is effective at accelerating ad high density polyethylene hdpe which has been treated with graphite powder was another polymer investigated 101 it was shown that ad performance improved with increasing graphite content even at high olr conditions 23 7 kg cod m 3 d 1 the syntrophic conversion of organic matter to ch4 according to the authors was sped up by hdpe with graphite powder polymeric materials have demonstrated promise to increase ad efficiency and methane production offering advantages of being more resistant and modifiable to satisfy system demands however the precise properties that improve ad efficiency are still unknown which in some ways restricts the development of more suitable materials 4 2 main configurations and techniques used 4 2 1 reactors among the 46 studies analyzed 61 were operated in batch in serum bottles with a volume of 100 ml to 1 2 l and 11 were operated in semi batch with 120 900 ml serum bottles only 17 of the works examined used continuous operation with six employing a 1 7 5 l uasb one employing a 1 l up flow biofilm reactor and one employing an iffas uasb reactors can maintain relatively high microorganism concentrations resulting in a shorter hrt and faster reaction rates 11 furthermore because of the upward flow the uasb reactor can minimize aggregation and precipitation of the added cms as well as proper mixing of the material into the sludge 89 demonstrating that it is a potential reactor for the application of the technique the type of reactor utilized may have a significant impact on diet potentiation however the types of reactors and operating conditions for enriching microorganisms in diet have not yet been improved for large scale applications further reactor designs and investigations of operational conditions for selective enrichment of diet microorganisms are required and further study is still needed 4 2 2 substrates and inoculum in 28 of the research examined vfa acetate butyrate and or propionate was utilized as a substrate in two experiments ethanol was used to promote diet while glucose and sucrose were employed in ten more more complex substrates with high olr were used in 17 of the experiments only 10 of the studies used effluents with lower organic loads in the range of 300 500 mg cod l the number of works that use substrates that are similar to real municipal effluents is relatively small all the research examined used mixed cultures and the majority of them used sludge collected from reactors that used synthetic wastewater as an inoculum considering that the occurrence of diet is dependent on the presence of specific microorganisms that can use this metabolic route the inoculum used can have a significant impact on the performance of the process with inoculums containing electroactive microorganisms being preferred as discussed in item 4 1 1 4 4 3 microorganisms anaerobic digestion is known to be dependent on the presence of specific bacteria and methanogenic archaea that form an effective consortium electron donating bacteria and electron accepting methanogenic archaea must be present to achieve ad via diet through cms table 5 summarizes the reported microorganism groups that were shown to be enriched in the presence of cms in the studied papers in most cases the taxonomic level presented in this revision is the lowest reported by the authors which was usually at the genus level enriched microorganisms developed were those that demonstrated a percentage increase in the reactor supplemented with cm as compared to control some studies did not examine this issue while others found no significant changes with the addition of the conductive material and still other investigations discovered that the other operating parameters had a stronger influence on the selection of microorganisms 66 67 70 72 101 in general adding cms does not appear to increase the amount of biomass in the reactors ruling out the possibility that an increase in biomass is the cause of the improvement in ad but it does cause a change in its composition selectively enriching certain microbial groups 63 pseudomonas geobacter clostridium desulfuromonas smithella peptoclostridium syntrophomonas and levilinea were the most often enriched bacterial genera in the presence of cms in contrast to what had previously been reported geobacter a genus known to be capable of engaging in diet was not the most prevalent genus and was even absent in some reactors implying that other bacterial groups are favored by cms and could also participate in diet 14 64 75 5 effects on methanogenesis studies analyzed were conducted under diverse experimental settings making it difficult to compare and better comprehend the process as stated throughout this paper analyses based on the data provided by the selected articles were conducted in an effort to comprehend the process better and the results are summarized below 5 1 influence of substrate and material on the microbial community variations in substrate type and concentration conductive material properties and dose and previously present microbial communities in the inoculum used as well as other factors such as temperature variation can have a significant impact on the microbial group that will be enriched in the reactor 55 58 85 identifying groups of microorganisms that are frequently enriched under specific experimental settings is critical for directing future research as they play a central position in ad via cm supplementation the identification of these groups can be used as part of a strategy to promote diet more effectively such as using bioaugmentation considering that the substrate is one of the factors that can significantly alter the microbial community the enrichment frequencies of microbial groups and families by material type and substrate were investigated using descriptive statistics fig 3 presents graphs of microorganism groups and families enriched with a frequency 3 by material type the archaea domain is represented by the bolded classes and families except for genus geobacter class deltaproteobacteria family geobacteraceae there is still no consensus on which bacteria participate in diet but some groups are suggested as potential electron donors pseudomonas class gammaproteobacteria family pseudomonadaceae and desulfuromonas class deltaproteobacteria family desulfuromonadaceae are known as electroactive bacteria because of their extracellular electron transfer capability which enables them to oxidize various organic electron donors while also reducing insoluble electron acceptors 74 it has been reported that fe3 reducing species of the genus clostridium class clostridia family clostridiaceae can perform extracellular electron transfer 102 with their possible participation in diet being suggested 18 syntrophomonas class clostridia family syntrophomonadaceae are syntrophic bacteria that metabolize vfa into acetate h2 and formate however it has been suggested that this genus can also metabolize the substrate into short chain organic acids protons and electrons 103 making them potential electron donors genes generating conductor pili have also been discovered in the genera desulfuromonas syntrophomonas and smithella class deltaproteobacteria family syntrophaceae suggesting that they could act as electron donor partners in diet 104 105 methanothrix class methanomicrobia family methanosaetaceae and methanosarcina class methanomicrobia family methanosarcinaceae were the most frequently enriched genera in the presence of cms in the methanogenic archaea group with already recognized potential to participate in diet 25 26 methanolinea class methanomicrobia family methanoregulaceae and methanobacterium class methanobacteria family methanobacteriaceae were also often enriched methanogenic archaea genera methanolinea is recognized as hydrogenotrophic methanogens but it has also been mentioned as potential electron donor bacterium partner 11 methanobacterium enrichment in the systems has been interpreted by some studies as an indication that diet was not occurring but recently zheng et al 27 found that a strain of this methanogen was also able to participate in diet suggesting that the ability of diet is much more widely distributed among methanogens than previously thought the intercorrelation between the enriched microbial community and the substrate and material employed was investigated using pearson s chi squared and cramér s v tests the goal was to find out if the microbial community changes were more influenced by the different substrates utilized or by the cms that were added table 6 summarizes the findings the tests were applied to the taxonomic levels of class and family based on the results it is possible to infer that both the substrate and the cm exhibit a statistically significant association with the class of enriched microorganisms p value 0 05 according to cramér s v test the association with the substrate is moderate between 0 3 and 0 5 while with cm the association is probably higher 0 603 suggesting that enriched microorganisms have a stronger correlation with cm than with the substrate when combined these findings imply that while the various substrates used exert some selection on the microbial groups that have a higher or lower affinity for a particular substrate the effect of cms stands out demonstrating their high capacity to alter the microbial community possibly by favoring microorganisms capable of using them in diet the analyses only offer a limited amount of information when the taxonomic level is lowered for instance to the family level p 0 05 indicating the need for additional research it is worth noting that not all of the works analyzed used the same type of control some researchers employed reactors with no material while others utilized reactors supplemented with an inert or non conductive materials it is well recognized that adding material to the reactor as a support medium impacts methanogenesis due to biofilm formation and that the physicochemical properties of these materials can have a significant impact on the enrichment of specific microbial groups 106 the effect of the support medium in the promotion of diet as cavalcante gehring and zaiat 107 point out extends beyond the effect of biofilm formation due to electrochemical interactions between bacteria and the conductive material as a result the authors recommend using a dual control strategy non conductive material and suspended biomass to obtain a better understanding of the interaction between microorganisms and conductive materials as well as the contribution of biofilm formation and electrochemical interactions to diet processes 5 2 influence of the material on methane production fig 4 shows the maximum and average increments in methane production per material type compared to the control methane production increased significantly when carbon based materials were employed these materials are not only electrically conductive but also act as redox mediators and provide a large surface area for microbial colonization 12 carbon based materials also adsorb chemical compounds that inhibit methanogenesis such as phenol and ammonia 47 and increase the speed of the proliferation of methanogenic archaea methanosarcina and methanothrix 108 which have both been found to engage in diet this finding corroborates what was reported in a review published by wu et al 50 initially data on the increase in methane production as a function of cm dosage was represented graphically fig 5 methane production appears to increase as material dosage increases but the linear correlation is weak r 0 197 the lack of an association can be attributed to the need to find the ideal dosage for each type of material as well as the fact that in most cases the increase in methane production does not actually increase linearly with the dosage of cm with some cases revealing that lower dosages are more effective this result is consistent with the findings of park et al 11 who reported that increasing the dose of the cms increased methane generation but with a weak association due to the varied experimental settings fig 6 shows methane production increasing as a function of carbon based material dose the data were analyzed using linear and quadratic regression with the first analysis showing a higher correlation r 0 360 suggesting that there is a tendency for methane production to increase with increasing dosage for this type of material still there are many cases where lower dosages are more effective and the ideal dosage for each experimental condition must be evaluated fig 7 illustrates how the dosage of materials based on iron oxides influences the increase in methane visually the graph tends to suggest that methane production rises until an ideal dosage is reached then decreases most likely as a result of the inhibitory effect on microbial activity with high concentrations of material the low correlation which prevented the analysis from drawing more conclusions may have been caused by the limited data provided for this type of material electrical conductivity fig 8 and size fig 9 of the materials were investigated in relation to the increase in methane production no apparent correlation was observed between the increase in methane production and the conductivity of the materials opposite to what was expected methane production does not appear to increase as electrical conductivity increases suggesting that other characteristics of the material such as specific surface area redox potential and effects such as organic matter adsorption may also be relevant in the process and require further research the lack of electrical conductivity values available in the surveys examined is a factor that has to be highlighted because it makes it challenging to adequately analyze this material property martins et al 108 pointed out that there were similar difficulties in analyzing this property the slope of the line in fig 9 would suggest that larger materials might produce methane more effectively as was previously mentioned different materials play different roles in the electron transfer between microorganisms bigger materials have larger adhesion surfaces which facilitate microbial growth and allow electron exchange even when microorganisms are not in direct physical contact 109 in addition to the considerations mentioned above iron based nanomaterials have been suggested to act as electron acceptors reducing methane production 110 these results and observations suggest that using materials with larger diameters on the order of millimeters is more appropriate and should be explored further 6 perspectives and challenges the majority of research has demonstrated that use of cms in anaerobic treatment of effluents increases methane production and also reduces some disadvantages of ad including long lag times recovery after reactor disturbance and cod removal although the exact mechanism remains unknown these materials appear to promote methanogenesis enabling the occurrence of diet and creating favorable conditions for the other methanogenic pathways in addition to selectively enriching microorganisms however there are still a number of issues that need to be addressed before full scale application most investigations have focused on finding cms that can promote diet and how supplementation of specific cms improves methanogenic performance however most of the studies presented indirect evidence of the occurrence of diet and attributed the increase in methane production exclusively to this methanogenic pathway which does not seem to be the case some of the primary conceptual issues that have yet to be resolved are a better understanding of how cm supplementation influences methanogenic pathways as well as which microorganisms can participate in diet and their influence on increasing methane production more adequate methods to validate the occurrence of diet also need to be developed significant progress has been made in identifying the microorganisms that can participate in diet recently initially only a few species were known to be able to utilize this methanogenic route but as of now more are known and possibly more will be found the need for research in this field arises from the possibility of improving the inoculum and optimizing the experimental conditions by identifying the microorganisms engaged in the process in addition to being an important issue to understand the mechanism involved the controversy over the role of material properties in methanogenesis is evident in many of the papers examined initially it was believed that the increase in methane production caused by diet stimulation was mostly due to electrical conductivity however as discussed in this article new findings have demonstrated that a number of additional properties need to be taken into consideration such as specific surface area roughness porosity redox properties etc with some material properties favoring and others inhibiting the process the final performance of ad seems to be a balance between these characteristics and specific experimental conditions the materials have a combination of advantages and disadvantages and it is crucial to determine the importance of each component of this equation in order to optimize the process in addition to understanding the role of the properties of conductive materials in ad research is also needed to develop materials suitable for the application of this technology many works use activated carbon or iron based materials although the issues with these materials have been highlighted earlier to achieve a long term operation it is worthwhile to investigate different materials such as conductive polymers which are more resistant and have the advantage of being more easily modified to satisfy the operating parameters required for diet still as nguyen et al 47 point out a balance between the cost and quantity of cm is an important factor to consider when increasing the usage of this technology a comprehensive techno economic analysis is required to find cms that are suitable for full scale operation in terms of applicability a better understanding of the mechanisms of diet in complex and or dilute substrates is still needed to demonstrate the benefits of this metabolic route most studies have employed pure and simple substrates as vfa and or with high organic loadings and more research is needed utilizing substrates that realistically simulate the properties of other wastewater effluents such as municipal another point to consider is the reactors proper which are usually small scale and low volume pilot scale reactor research is still in its beginning the requirement for cm retention in the reactor is a challenge for full scale implementation of the system because flushing would require continuous material addition which would not only increase the volume of biosolids for handling and disposal but also raise operating expenses 47 material retention can be accomplished by focusing on the reactor using barriers such as filter membranes or by focusing on the material employed such as using mobile or fixed microbial growth media the settings in the research that were analyzed varied greatly including the types of materials used their characteristics doses and sizes the substrates organic loads and the sources of the inoculum due to the wide range of conditions it was challenging to compare the findings for a more in depth future review it is recommended to define certain experimental conditions such as focusing on a type of material and defining a range of organic load that will be considered in the selection another difficulty found in this review was the lack of data or the lack of standardization of data for comparing the observed results cavalcante gehring e zaiat 107 propose the use of indicators that allow direct comparison of the results of studies in methanogenic reactors enhanced with cms as well as an indicator to detect inhibitory limits and an indication to compare the usage of different particle sizes 7 conclusion some of the most recent studies that used cms in ad of effluents were reviewed and analyzed in this paper the mechanism by which cms promote increases in methane production is still unknown despite recent advances there is still controversy over the properties of these materials that affect the different methanogenic pathways the effects of these materials on the result obtained and the true contribution of diet to these outcomes we verified that in fact the alteration in the microbial community does appear to be related to the addition of conductive materials after analyzing the data from the selected articles and we discussed the main microbial groups and their possibles roles in ad via diet contrary to expectations no correlation was found between electrical conductivity and increased methane production this property of cm does not appear to be the most essential in increasing methane which supports the hypothesis that other characteristics such as redox properties may be significant the improvement in ad appears to be the result of a balance between the various properties of the added cms and the experimental conditions employed during the process it was also noted that cms with sizes in the order of millimeters appeared to be more effective for producing methane finally the necessity for additional research is highlighted it is advised to standardize the reporting of outcomes to enable the comparison of investigations as we stress the need to compare data from various works to better understand the process declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper 
12708,in recent years many researches have reported that anaerobic digestion and methane production can be significantly improved with the addition of conductive materials to the process despite advances a number of questions about this strategy remain unsolved including the mechanism and impact of material properties on methanogenic pathways in order to provide an update on the current state of knowledge and future application perspectives this work analyzed some of the most recent studies using conductive materials in the anaerobic digestion of effluents through a systematic review of the literature and statistical analysis as well as the enriched microorganisms the influence of the dosage size and conductivity of the materials used it was found that the change in the microbial community is associated with the use of conductive material p 0 05 additionally a slight trend was suggested that millimeter scale materials appear to be more effective in increasing methane production in contrast to expectations it was not possible to find a correlation between electrical conductivity and an increase in methane production supporting the idea that other properties may also perform important roles in the process and require further research in general the use of conductive materials is a promising approach to improve anaerobic digestion and methane production however the need for future research was indicated to expand the scale of application of this technology keywords wastewater treatment biomethane biogas anaerobic digestion energy recovery data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction currently the scarcity of resources is a crucial problem for society resource demand requires that the various sectors improve their operating mechanisms and seek comprehensive solutions especially given the global scenario of climate change water scarcity and the transition of the energy matrix 1 in this context the treatment of effluents is presumably an important recovery strategy capable of transforming wastewater into resources that generate value for society such as nutrients water and renewable energy 2 4 anaerobic digestion ad is one of the main routes to recovering energy from organic material 5 6 ad is a biological process used as a strategy in wastewater treatment that involves the decomposition and transformation of organic materials in the absence of oxygen and nitrate in addition to the possibility of recovering energy the main advantages of ad are low biological solid production excess sludge with better dehydration characteristics lower implementation and operation costs low energy consumption and the possibility of operation with high sludge retention time srt and low hydraulic retention times hrt 7 however low concentration of organic matter in some effluents such as municipal wastewater represents a limitation for the exploitation of biogas for energy production municipal effluents for example produced 82 and 75 less volumetric methane than vinasse and glycerol effluents respectively 8 furthermore despite the low solubility in water 20 mg l or 1 25 mmol l it is estimated that up to 45 of the total methane generated remains dissolved in the liquid phase in anaerobic reactors at 30 c and is subsequently lost with the effluent 9 10 these are relevant issues and pose challenges to maximizing the potential energy production in wastewater treatment the use of conductive materials cms as a support for biofilm development has been investigated as a strategy to increase methane production in ad numerous research conducted recently has demonstrated that treating with cm can significantly increase methane production in addition to reducing other disadvantages of the process such as start up time and resistance to adverse conditions 11 various cms have been applied in ad to improve the performance of biological methane production including carbon based materials 12 14 iron based materials 15 16 combinations of carbon and iron 17 or materials such as conductive polymers and iron containing residues 18 19 the majority of research has found an increase in methane production organic matter removal lag phase reduction and resistance to inhibitory conditions although the addition of cms can significantly improve methanogenesis the exact mechanism is still unclear furthermore despite significant advances already reported in the literature there are still questions to be answered such as the role of materials properties in the process and how they affect the microorganisms involved this article sought to review experimental studies that had recently been published that used conductive materials in the anaerobic treatment of effluents in order to remove organic matter and increase methane production with this an overview of the current state of knowledge the techniques developed and the most significant advancements in the area to date are given in contrast to other previous review papers a systematic review of the literature was performed including i the mechanisms known until the time of this paper ii the performance of cms used in methanogenesis iii the effect of their properties and iv the effect of cms on the selection of microorganisms potentially involved in the process for this the microbial groups enriched in the experiments and their possible involvement in direct interspecies electron transfer diet were examined the difference in microbial groups was also statistically examined to see if it was caused by the cm or the different substrates utilized in the studies the methane production increases were analyzed in connection to the dose of each type of material as well as the properties of electrical conductivity and material size as far as we know no other publications have previously analyzed this set of information and data in this way finally this paper discusses future prospects for the application of the technology in effluent treatment and the necessity to develop future research based on what has previously been reported 2 article selection and data analysis several studies have been conducted to investigate the correlation between the addition of cms and the increase in methane production the results of recent research were selected and reviewed in this paper to obtain a better understanding of the mechanisms involved in this process the scheme illustrated in fig 1 describes the procedure used to select experimental data from articles in the end 46 recent articles were selected and used for data collection 32 of these papers provided data that allowed them to be used in statistical analysis with r software including i experimental parameters ii predictions of conductive materials iii performance by materials type iv identification of groups of microorganisms and v technologies and operating data 3 mechanisms of electron transfer between microorganisms methanogenesis depends on an electron exchange process between various species of microorganisms this process is currently called interspecies electron transfer iet and can occur in a mediated miet or direct diet way miet involves the use of mediating molecules that transport electrons diffusing in and out of microorganisms the first mechanism described for miet in methanogenic systems was hydrogen transfer between species 20 where electron donating bacteria reduce h protons by using them as electron acceptors in the oxidation of organic matter with the consequent production of h2 later in methanogenesis the electrons present in the h2 molecule are used by hydrogenotrophic methanogens to reduce co2 to ch4 this process is thermodynamically unfavorable at standard temperature and pressure 21 and it is necessary to keep the partial pressure of h2 low in the anaerobic system to ensure that the reaction occurs continuously which is considered a limitation of the process another issue is the dependence on the diffusion capacity of these mediating molecules which can slow down the process diet is another electron transfer mechanism between microorganisms in which co2 is reduced to ch4 using free electrons that move from one cell exoelectrogenic to another electrotrophic without the use of reduced molecules like hydrogen 22 the description of these mechanisms is more recent with the first report made in 2010 by summers et al 23 in a study with cocultures of geobacter species g metallireducens and g sulfurreducens morita et al 24 discovered diet in methanogenic aggregates in 2011 and methanogenesis via diet was confirmed in 2014 between geobacter species and methanogenic archaea methanosarcina 25 and methanothrix 26 and in 2020 for methanobacterium 27 methanothrix is unable to convert co2 to ch4 using h2 as an electron donor due to the absence of the hydrogenase enzyme but it is able to accept electrons directly from other microorganisms via diet not depending exclusively on the acetoclastic pathway 26 diet is considered a more efficient mechanism than miet because it does not rely on electron carrier diffusion 28 making its stimulation a promising strategy for optimizing ad two routes have been identified for diet via biological compounds with physical cell to cell contact through conductive pili e pili c type cytochrome and other electron transport proteins linked to the cell membrane 29 or through abiotic components such as cms 30 conductive pili are conductive appendages similar to long hairs that grow on the bacterial surface are made up of protein pilin and have conductivity similar to metals due to the overlapping of π orbitals of aromatic amino acids 31 in syntrophic associations the absence of pilin genes or any change in the aromatic amino acids of pilin inhibited electron transfer 32 c type cytochromes are proteins that contain prosthetic heme groups which contain an iron atom and are associated with the inner membrane the periplasm and the outer membrane of microorganisms where they transport electrons during oxidation and reduction 33 one of the most cited c type cytochromes is omcs which is involved in extracellular electron transfer summers et al 23 found that omcs was the most abundant c type cytochrome in microbial aggregates and the exclusion of genes encoding omcs or pilin inhibited any visible growth even after long term incubation similar results were observed in co culture of g metallireducens and methanosarcina 25 or methanothrix 26 in which g metallireducens mutants without pili and cytochromes could not initiate oxidation of substrate in addition to these two cellular compounds there are other electron transport proteins outside the cell membranes involved in diet when microorganisms form a direct cell to cell connection 34 diet via membrane bound electron transport proteins may be a mechanism for the formation of methane 34 however there is no evidence of its occurrence currently available suggesting that this pathway is not common for methanogenic microorganisms although the mechanisms of electron transfer from electron donating bacteria have been largely elucidated it is still unclear how methanogenic microorganisms can accept electrons during diet 35 37 some methanosarcina species have c type cytochromes 38 and this could facilitate electron transfer in the cellular envelopes of methanosarcina and methanothrix there are multiple active redox proteins and it is possible that external proteins such as ferredoxin obtain electrons from electron donating bacteria it is also possible that the flagellar appendages of methanogenic microorganisms which are similar to conductive pili are involved in extracellular electron capture 39 the first suggestion that cms could accelerate microbial metabolism via diet for methane production was made in 2012 12 40 since then many researchers have tested a variety of cms carbon based materials iron oxides and conductive polymers have all been identified as aiding in the electron transfer process but the stimulating mechanism of diet via cms to promote methane production remains unclear 41 initially the interspecies electron transfer induced by cms was also identified as diet however rotaru et al 37 recently proposed the name ciet conductive particle mediated interspecies electron transfer since cells are not in direct contact with one another in interactions cell material cell and the genes typically involved in diet are markedly dysregulated however as the term diet is used in all the papers analyzed in this review it will be utilized throughout this article even so it should be noted that as proposed by rotaru et al 37 the process under investigation here is the interspecies electron transfer mediated by cms or ciet different cms have different roles in diet stimulation liu et al 12 found evidence of diet via cm using granular activated carbon gac in a coculture of g metallireducens e g sulfurreducens in contrast to what would be expected if there were only biological electrical connections the investigators observed that the cells were firmly connected with gac in co cultures without conducting pili or the pili associated cytochromes chen et al 42 found that the addition of carbon cloth restored the interspecies electron transfer according to these results these cms might be able to take the position of conductive cytochromes and pili as a pathway for extracellular long range electron transfer however a different result was verified using magnetite magnetite can compensate for the absence of c type cytochromes but conductive pili are still required for electron transfer 43 44 magnetite was found along the pili of a mutant omcs deficient strain compensating for the loss of omcs and allowing diet to proceed the micrographs included in some works assist in illuminating the different roles that cms can play in the stimulation of electron transfer between microorganisms 33 44 while some cms are significantly larger than microorganisms allowing microbial cells to attach to their surfaces for electron transfer without pili being present magnetite is much smaller than cells and requires the pili structure 45 despite playing distinct roles both types of materials can provide energy savings to cells and improve ad fig 2 illustrates the different ways that these cms perform not only can magnetite play the role of omcs during diet but it also suppresses the expression of the gene responsible for this cytochrome in non mutant strains implying that cells do not need to expend as much energy to synthesize diet associated proteins in the presence of magnetite and possibly other cms 35 this is supported by the fact that diet between g sulfurreducens and g metallireducens can take up to 30 days in the absence of cms 23 implying that cells need time to express the cellular components required for electron transfer although the functions of pili and c type cytochrome in diet are not fully understood the results suggest that cms can replace these biological connectors in a controlled manner for example through different doses and types of materials 47 it is yet unclear which properties of cms affect methanogenesis and how numerous controversial findings were found throughout the investigation suggesting that further research needs to be done on this subject the ad improvement was associated with a variety of properties specific surface area roughness electrical conductivity pore size and other properties of cms can influence their potential to increase methanogenesis xu et al 17 proposed that the electron donating capacity edc of goethite feooh was an important factor in explaining the improved performance of this cm in methanogenesis the same authors indicated the selective enrichment of syntrophic bacteria was associated with the electron exchange characteristics of the cms the abundance of methanothrix and some syntrophic bacteria such as aminicenantes synergistaceae and thauera were benefited by higher values in electron accepting capacity eac while methanosarcina and syntrophomonadaceae species were benefited by higher values in edc 17 conversely wang et al 48 examined a variety of biochars with comparable electron donating and accepting capacities but variable ad performance demonstrating that differences in methane production were unrelated to the electrochemical properties of the biochars the difficulty in inferring how cms affect methanogenic pathways has led many studies to attribute the improvement in ad performance exclusively to diet however xiao et al 49 published evidence that the use of cms in ad can benefit additional methanogenic pathways such as acetoclastic and hydrogenotrophic pathways suggesting that co2 reduction by diet alone does not necessarily account for enhanced performance in agreement with this statement wang et al 48 discovered that in spite of the increase in methane production the hydrogenotrophic pathway not diet was dominating in the ad process furthermore according to wu et al 50 the interaction between diet and miet is cooperative rather than antagonistic the majority of research makes indirect inferences about diet nonetheless a complex set of methods is needed to confirm its occurrence metagenomics analysis is one technique to investigate the metabolic pathways used by microorganisms park et al 51 found that microbial aggregates in contact with conductive material had a higher abundance of methanothrix genes associated with the co2 reduction pathway and a lower abundance of genes associated with the acetate decarboxylation pathway indicating the presence of the diet pathway since this microorganism cannot use the hydrogenotrophic pathway to reduce co2 also according to the authors functional gene expression is another way to determine the mechanism by which diet occurs the pila and omcs genes are overexpressed in the mechanism via pili and c type cytochrome to promote the physical connection between species and electron transfer 52 because cms can substitute the proteins encoded by these functional genes pila and omcs are less expressed in the process via cms 12 in case the mechanism occurs via membrane bound electron transport proteins pila is less expressed and omcs is overexpressed because electron transfer is achieved via membrane bound electron carriers c type cytochrome without conducting pili 51 omics analyses are a possibility but steendam 53 provides a detailed examination of the current approaches used to confirm diet and explains their limitations rotaru et al 37 also discuss the inadequacies of the methods already in use and emphasize the need for new investigation strategies 4 impact of conductive materials on anaerobic digestion 4 1 conductive materials reduced lag times increased methane production rates high methane yields and increased tolerance to inhibitory circumstances have all been observed in reactors with the addition of cms in most experiments these findings show that the addition of cms to traditional ad improves it significantly the cms employed as well as the effects of supplementation with these materials on methanogenesis are detailed below 4 1 1 carbon based materials conductive carbon based materials have been widely used to stimulate methane production granular activated carbon gac powdered activated carbon pac biochar carbon fiber carbon nanotubes graphene and graphite are all examples of this type of carbon table 1 shows the results of experiments that used carbon based materials to improve methanogenesis 4 1 1 1 activated carbon gac and pac activated carbon has been the most commonly used material in studies on diet stimulation using cms activated carbon is a cheap substance with little biological toxicity a large specific surface area and numerous pores 61 initially its use in ad was due to its ability to adsorb toxic chemicals that could inhibit microbial activity 30 granular activated carbon gac provides a large surface area for microbial adhesion is electrically conductive and can be used as an electron acceptor in anaerobic respiration by some microorganisms 11 17 the majority of the studies examined used particles with a size range of 0 15 4 76 mm 4 100 mesh which allows the material to be retained in reactors 11 as show in table 1 the majority of gac investigations resulted in considerable increases in methane yield when compared to the control condition there were increases in methane yield of 2 to 966 and increases in methane production rate of 1 06 to 7 6 times various experimental conditions quantity of material size substrates cod etc can influence the observed results in the works examined the amount of material utilized for supplementing is an important parameter for improving methanogenesis park et al 51 found that increasing the mass of gac from 3 to 6 g l increased methane production with higher maximum methane production rates than in reactors supplemented with pac and magnetite xu et al 64 also investigated different gac dosages and discovered that increasing the gac concentration from 0 5 g l to 25 g l reduced the latency phase period from 3 4 to 0 9 days in the propionate fed reactor and from 12 7 to 7 8 days in the butyrate fed reactor however when the gac dosage was increased from 5 g l to 25 g l a very small increment in the maximum methane production rate was found indicating that the lower dosage is more appropriate 64 and therefore the increase in methane production does not occur in a linear manner to the amount of material added xu et al 64 investigated the performance of gac at different substrate concentrations 1 g l and 5 g l of acetate butyrate and propionate and discovered that the addition of gac had no significant effect at the lowest concentration condition with results that were quite similar to the control with increased concentrations different results were observed for each substrate the addition of gac had little effect on acetate degradation the results were still very near to the control but it considerably increased the degradation of propionate and butyrate resulting in increases in methane yield of 9 to 10 times that of the control propionate and butyrate must be metabolized first by acetogenic bacteria whereas acetate is the only volatile fatty acids vfa that may be absorbed directly by methanogens 64 this result indicates the addition of gac benefits the enrichment of syntrophic bacteria and can accelerate the degradation of these substrates even under high organic loading in 2020 xu et al 17 observed a 66 133 increase in methane yield using a mixture of acetate propionate and butyrate in a reactor supplemented with gac in opposition to most results namal 60 observed a reduction 30 in methane production in a gac supplemented reactor which was attributed to the inhibition of microbial activity caused by the penetration of gac nanoparticles into the cell membrane of microorganisms in addition the reactor supplemented with the material showed a lower methane production rate and a longer lag time further reinforcing the possibility of inhibition these results indicate that more research is needed to confirm the inhibition effect of the cms on microorganisms and that material selection remains a challenge treatment of wastewater with lower organic loads presents a challenge in terms of methane production but even here adding gac has proven to be a promising strategy even at low temperatures 14 5 to 20 c gac promoted an increase in methane production of up to 2 14 times compared to the control when added to uasb reactors for the treatment of wastewater with cod in the range of 100 to 400 mg l 55 57 59 park et al 58 also confirmed that the addition of gac improves methane production even at low temperatures however not all of the results were positive which suggests the need for more study to comprehend the true effects of gac on methanogenesis florentino et al 62 used black water as a substrate to examine the performance of gac in the treatment of three different concentrations of organic matter for the lowest dilution case cod of 18 5 g l the biochemical methane potential bmp increased from 35 6 to 53 1 however in conditions of higher dilution 4 6 and 2 6 g cod l there was a drastic decrease in bmp from 42 6 to 16 1 and from 50 4 to 9 6 respectively according to the authors the gac promoted the removal of up to 86 of cod in the highly diluted samples by adsorption implying a very low concentration of substrates available for hydrolysis and acidogenesis hindering the efficient performance of all subsequent reactions furthermore a decrease in suspended and adherent biomass on the gac surface was found in these samples indicating a shortage of substrates in the medium it was suggested that the supply of substrates was insufficient to sustain microorganism growth and that the conductive property of gac had no effect in these circumstances shanmugam et al 13 reported lower methane production using gac attributed again to the adsorption of organic acids as a result attention should be exercised when using gac particularly for the treatment of more diluted wastewater as organic component adsorption under these conditions may be a limiting issue in addition to using activated carbon in granular form the powdered form pac has also been used to enhance methanogenesis park et al 51 compared pac and gac in the degradation of ethanol and acetate except for size and specific surface area both materials had similar physicochemical properties pac was expected to provide more sites for microbial attachment involved in diet due to its larger specific surface area and this in turn would increase methane production however the gac supplemented serum bottles showed a 22 increase in final volume and a 20 increase in methane production rate compared to the pac supplemented serum bottles using acetate as substrate the reactors supplemented with pac showed few significant differences compared to the control regardless of the substrate used 51 shanmugam et al 13 also found lower pac performance than gac in methane production during glucose degradation in this study it was observed that the electrical conductivity of gac was significantly higher than pac 322 1 and 17 0 μs cm 1 respectively which could explain the difference in performance between these materials however in the same study when comparing gac with biochars that presented similar conductivities in the range from 322 to 350 μs cm 1 the performance was distinct in this case the lower performance when using gac could be attributed in part to the adsorption effect of the material as discussed previously demonstrating that methane production can be influenced by several parameters in addition to electrical conductivity which needs to be evaluated in future research the impact of gac on long term larger scale and more complex substrates needs to be investigated and demonstrated further in addition some authors point out possible disadvantages to its use according to florentino et al 62 there is not much homogeneity in the quality of gac and the adsorptive capacity may differ from series to series in production impacting the optimal concentration for each situation under investigation hu et al 18 state that activated carbon has an unstable structure and chemical properties and its conductivity can be reduced due to microbial activity under anaerobic conditions therefore although it is a potential and affordable substrate further investigations are needed for a complete evaluation of the material and to scale up the technology 4 1 1 2 biochar biochar is a carbon rich porous material produced by the thermochemical degradation of biomass via gasification or pyrolysis at a cheap cost and with minimal environmental impact 13 its composition depends on the nature of the feedstock and the carbonization process biochar was produced using a wide range of raw materials and at different temperatures additionally the biochars were modified in three studies by oxidation reduction h2o2 hno3 and k2co3 65 67 as a result biochars with a variety of characteristics and effects can be seen in table 1 in the studies evaluated the particle size ranged from 0 1 to 2 55 mm while the electrical conductivity varied greatly from 1 13e10 8 to 1350 ms cm 1 table 1 as a general trend biochar supplementation showed significant improvement in the performance of anaerobic digestion both in the degradation of simple and complex organic matter shanmugam et al 13 worked with biochar produced from three types of biomass two of which were produced at two different temperatures resulting in five types of biochar with different properties biochar from biomass of canola meal cbc switchgrass sbc and ashe juniper abc was used using glucose as a substrate sbc and abc achieved similar results effectively reducing the lag time and showing a 70 to 72 increase in methane production compared to control using a complex substrate aqueous phase of algal bio oil increases of 54 to 1133 in methane yield were observed when compared to the control biochar cbc and abc respectively an increase in cod removal efficiency was also observed regarding the pyrolysis temperature the biochar produced at an intermediate temperature 400 c showed higher biogas production when compared to biochar produced at higher temperatures 600 to 900 c this result was attributed to the existence of higher concentrations of redox active moieties such as quinones and phenazines in biochar produced at intermediate temperatures which can act as catalysts mediating the transfer of electrons between microorganisms the ideal pyrolysis temperature for ad however is a matter of debate according to qi et al 69 biochar produced at 900 c performed more stably over a long period of time than biochar produced at 400 c sun et al 65 found a similar result finding that biochar produced at 900 c outperformed biochars produced at lower temperatures in ad using ethanol as a substrate qi et al 69 examined the performance of biochar made from hickory wood chips at 400 and 900 c in the control reactor acidification was seen in the first 25 days whereas the biochar equipped reactors were stable and increased the specific production of methane the reason for this according to the authors is that biochar speeds up the degradation of acetic acid and reduces the acidogenesis acetogenesis lag period additionally the authors state that one of the benefits of biochar is an increase in the bioavailability of trace elements that are crucial for the synthesis of enzymes during ad this could occur in two ways first biochar naturally contains abundant trace elements that can be utilized by methanogens second biochar can adsorb and release trace elements under various conditions as a result of two physicochemical properties that affect microbial accessibility in the study by bose et al 68 which used synthetic black water as a substrate there was no substantial difference in the methane generation between biochars made at different temperatures 300 425 and 550 c however the two biochars generated at higher temperatures were slightly more successful in minimizing lag phases and biochar produced at 550 c accumulated less vfa attributable to the larger surface area and possibly higher vfa adsorption regarding modified biochars oxidation with hno3 inhibited methanegenesis possibly as a result of the production and or dissolution of inhibitory compounds and ph disturbance by nitrate nitro groups whereas oxidation with h2o2 had a positive effect increasing methane yield by 58 07 compared to control and 9 9 compared to unmodified biochar 67 this effect was explained by the fact that the oxidation with h2o2 enhanced the redox properties particularly the capacity to donate electrons as a result of an increase in surface functional groups such as phenolics and lactonics sun et al 65 however employed the same substance h2o2 to oxidize biochar and the results were no better than those of unaltered biochar another modification was made with k2co3 when compared to the control kobayashi et al 66 observed that the k2co3 modified biochar improved ad accelerated the rate of palmitic acid degradation and increased the maximum rate of methane production by 1 3 times this result was attributed to the higher specific area high conductivity and hydrophilicity of the k2co3 modified biochar analyzing these researches reveals that despite efforts to increase methanogenesis and growing concern over the correlations between material properties and stimulatory effects on ad there is still no agreement on the specific biochar properties that are promoting the improvement in ad for example while sun et al 65 reported that electrical conductivity and electron donating capacity were significant determinants of methane yield wang et al 48 indicated that neither of these attributes was associated with differences in methane production more research is still needed to understand how biochars affect methanogenesis it is also controversial which methanogenic pathway is affected although some research has associated increased methane production with the occurrence of diet wang et al 48 discovered that despite the apparent increase in methane production the hydrogenotrophic pathway was probably the primary one rather than diet it has been proposed that although it is possible that biochar addition stimulated the co existence of diet with mediated interspecies electron transfer the low electrical conductivity and electron transfer capacity of biochar limited its dominance in this instance the pore volume and adsorption capabilities were the key variables that influenced the system environment and microbial metabolism ultimately reflected in the variations in methane yield jiang et al 67 attributed the intensification of the acetoclastic pathway to the increase in methane generation the vast majority of research examined shows a significant improvement in ad and methane production with the use of biochar but the precise factors that support these benefits are yet unknown additionally it is difficult to produce biochar with consistent physicochemical properties because the properties of this material strongly depend on the raw materials utilized and the production process 78 4 1 1 3 carbon fibers carbon fibers are another cm that has been tested to improve ad this material has the advantage of low cost and ease of being incorporated into the permanent design of anaerobic reactors and can be maintained in the reactors without loss by washing 11 carbon fibers with a specific surface area ranging from 0 4 to 1 6 m2 l were used in the treatment of organic acids and ethanol when compared to the control methane yields increased by 38 to 137 cumulative methane volume increased by 10 to 44 and methane production rates increased by 1 3 to 6 7 times 73 75 despite significant differences in the specific surface areas of the carbon fibers used barua et al 74 discovered that the methanogenesis rate and specific methane yield were only slightly higher in the reactor with the larger surface area fiber implying that while carbon fibers promote increased methane yield and improved methanogenesis kinetics this occurs nonlinearly to the increase in specific surface area authors suggest that this is due to carbon fiber aggregation which reduces specific surface area available for biomass attachment and that more research is needed to correlate specific surface areas in different arrangements with methanogenic activity another material employed was carbon cloth a form of carbon fiber 79 the carbon cloth improved the rate of methane production by up to 260 during the stable part of the ad in addition to helping to recover a failed anaerobic reactor 71 in the six steps of the experiment carbon cloth was alternately added and removed performance quickly increased whenever carbon cloth was added while performance decreased when it was removed the authors explained this observation by explaining that when the cm is removed the diet is disrupted nevertheless it is also possible that this result is related to the reduction of biofilm which disturbs the system the mixing conditions of the reactors with carbon cloth were also examined 70 the unmixed reactor demonstrated an up to 23 increase in methane production rate intense mixing too often can remove biofilm and hinder ad performance according to both studies the properties that may have contributed to the improvement in ad were a large specific surface area and high conductivity which stimulated the production of biofilms and electron transfer within the microbial community 70 71 the performance of a brush made of carbon fiber was compared to brushes made of stainless steel horsehair and polyester 72 and the results were quite interesting only the polyester brush reactor underperformed the others the high biocompatibility of the horsehair which allowed for more biomass retention was credited with the successful material outcome whereas the polyester brush had poor biocompatibility comparable results between the conductive carbon fiber and stainless steel brushes and the non conductive horsehair brush show that electrical conductivity was not required for increased ad performance however stainless steel despite being less biocompatible also demonstrated a result comparable to that of horsehair brush and carbon fiber so electrical conductivity cannot be disregarded therefore it would seem that the advantages of electrical conductivity compensate for the reduced biofilm formation in these reactors these findings also indicate that polyester is not an efficient control material in diet studies and that biocompatibility of materials is a significant consideration in investigations employing cms 4 1 1 4 graphite graphite is a crystalline carbon allotrope and in the studies reviewed it was used in granular form with a size of between 3 and 5 mm 14 and in felt 76 guo et al 14 compared the performance of two up flow biofilm reactors one with quartz particles and the other with graphite particles using low strength wastewater as substrate 400 mg cod l and microbial fuel cell fluid as inoculum the authors reported an uncommon and far above average outcome with the addition of granular graphite increasing the production rate and the yield of methane by 34 3 and 22 4 times respectively this expressive result was associated with the type of reactor employed since the properties of the support material have a significant influence on the biofilm that forms in up flow fixed bed reactors additionally the result was attributed to significant modifications in the microbial community and metabolism particularly for the archaea genera since the inoculum was extracted from a microbial fuel cell it may have already contained electroactive microorganisms that benefited from the presence of cm however some observations need to be considered the control had a methane production rate of just 3 18 l kg cod which explains why the percentage rise was so expressive despite the methane production with graphite not being particularly high according to the authors themselves the low methane production in the control reactor was caused by the short hrt but the type of material used as control which may have had low biocompatibility might also have had an impact on the result as discussed in 4 1 1 3 despite the significant improvement seen the methane yield in the graphite reactor was only 74 5 l kg cod which is less than the average for other studies 200 l kg cod this can be explained in part because the substrate has a lower than average organic load even so this discovery is significant because ad is frequently employed in hot climate countries like brazil to treat low strength wastewater such as municipal wastewater and the addition of cm can be effective too in these conditions more study is necessary however as previous research has shown that when used to treat low strength effluents graphite performs worse than other carbon based materials such as biochar and gac 80 81 zhang et al 76 analyzed the use of graphite felt in a sequential batch reactor comparing the performance in the degradation of propionate and butyrate with a cod concentration of 5 g l with both substrates reductions in lag time and increases of 16 7 to 19 1 in methane production rate and 15 3 to 17 in methane yield were observed however the control was done in the absence of any material and it is difficult to say whether this improvement in methane production was caused by the conductive properties of the material or just the presence of a support medium for biofilm formation in addition the influence of graphite felt was tested under conditions of high hydrogen pressure where it was observed that in the reactors supplemented with the material there was practically no change in substrate degradation and methane production while in the control reactor the process was inhibited demonstrating that the graphite felt can favor alternative electron transfer pathways to conventional ones acetoclastic and hydrogenotrophic 4 1 1 5 graphene and carbon nanotubes graphene and carbon nanotubes are layered and cylindrical carbon nanostructures respectively forming a hexagonal lattice they have high electrical conductivity mechanical strength and thermal conductivity 82 these materials have also been used in the stimulation of diet but they can be highly toxic to microorganisms graphene 0 8 16 nm thick and 2 μm long and multi walled nanotubes were used in the analyzed studies lin et al 77 investigated the effects of different concentrations of graphene on the degradation of the amino acid glycine which has a metabolically different degradation pathway from vfa the authors discovered that adding 0 5 g l of graphene increased methane yield by 5 7 while increasing the amount to 2 g l resulted in a 10 decrease confirming its inhibitory effect on microbial activity according to the authors previous studies have verified the cytotoxicity of nanomaterials on different microorganisms and the size of the materials is the key to the antimicrobial effects bacterial cell membranes have been reported to be damaged by graphene due to direct contact with the very sharp edges of graphene nanosheets resulting in the efflux of intracellular components such as rna 77 however the application of graphene had a positive effect on methanogenesis with the appropriate dosage with the addition of 1 0 g l graphene the highest peak methane production was achieved resulting in a 28 increase above the control furthermore the time required to reach the maximum methane production rate was reduced from 12 to 9 days multi walled carbon nanotubes were used by ambuchi et al 16 in the ad of beet sugar industrial wastewater the control reactor performed better in the first 6 h in terms of cod removal and in the first 18 h in terms of methane generation an effect attributed to the necessity for microorganisms to acclimate to the cm following that the reactor using carbon nanotubes showed a 20 increase in methane production and a 26 improvement in cod removal efficiency while the presence of free and dispersed microorganisms could be seen in the sample obtained in the reactor under control circumstances the microorganisms in the sample collected in the reactor supplemented with the material were densely compacted the electrons generated by substrate oxidation were most likely transported to the methanogenic bacteria through electron conduits established by the cm however a gap fracture was found in the microbial aggregation which the authors attribute to physical contact between the carbon nanotubes and the microbial cells which caused damage to the membranes resulting in perforation and cell death in agreement with what lin et al 77 pointed out although this effect did not cause the process to be inhibited in this case it does indicate that using nanomaterials in ad should be done with caution in addition to cell disruption caused mainly by the small size of these materials oxidation processes on the cell membrane can also occur the effect of these materials is dependent on the shape size and type of microorganisms that come into contact with them 83 and because ad occurs in a highly heterogeneous microbial community their application may be limited as well as the high cost of using these materials in a realistic context 4 1 2 iron based materials methane production has also been enhanced using conductive iron based materials magnetite goethite and hematite have all been tested in recent years according to baek kim and lee 84 there is evidence that suggests that the conductivity and crystallinity of iron oxides may be the major factors in the diet promoting effect table 2 summarizes research that has used iron based materials to enhance methanogenesis 4 1 2 1 magnetite magnetite is the most commonly used iron oxide the conductivity of iron oxides has been reported to alter the kinetics of methanogenesis shortening the latency phase and resulting in increased methane yields 40 magnetite as a cm has several advantages including minimal environmental toxicity availability strong magnetism and high conductivity 28 magnetite was utilized in experiments with diameters up to 88 μm and dosages ranging from 1 to 10 g l park et al 51 examined two different magnetite concentrations in the degradation of acetate and ethanol and found the methane production trends were similar regardless of substrate when the magnetite concentration was increased from 3 to 6 g l the final volume of methane produced increased by 18 to 31 this rise in methane production with increasing magnetite mass indicated that the cm was the primary cause of the increased methane production methane yields were 91 6 for acetate and 87 4 for ethanol with the highest magnetite dosage due to faster electron transfer via cm than diffusive electron carriers such as hydrogen and formate yin et al 90 reported that magnetite produced 78 3 more methane using a more complex substrate synthetic wastewater tryptone with a 2 g l cod with varying organic loading rates olr from 1 6 to 25 6 kg cod m 3 d 1 magnetite also demonstrated good effects permitting increases in methane output of 7 to 483 with low olr exhibiting the strongest stimulation 85 using nano sized magnetite a positive effect was also observed methane production and cod removal effectiveness outperformed control by 31 1 and 101 5 respectively 88 in addition to increasing methane production magnetite influences the reactor recovery time after a disruption wang et al 15 investigated the use of magnetite in micron size in the ad of synthetic wastewater in a 7 5 l uasb reactor under startup and starvation recovery conditions and discovered that adding material increased cod removal efficiency during system disturbances while also reducing recovery time by 50 in addition to accelerating starving recovery magnetite was also demonstrated by wang et al 87 to hasten reactor recovery following perturbation caused by the use of different substrates indicating that the use of magnetite can increase the resistance of system namal 60 found that the use of magnetite reduced the lag time by 50 and also observed higher accumulated methane volume and higher cod removal efficiency the use of magnetite in ad has shown promising results in improving methanogenesis cod removal lag time reduction and reactor recovery time after disturbance but the use of iron based materials in general remains a challenge because their presence in the sludge can affect disposal practices and the environment 47 necessitating the development of strategies to retain material in the reactor hu et al 18 also indicate difficulties related to the use of iron oxides due to the possibility of these materials being corroded and dissolved in the effluent 4 1 2 2 goethite goethite was another iron oxide used to stimulate diet the particle size employed in the treatment of three distinct doses of vfa was 0 15 to 0 25 mm at 5 g l of goethite performance improved with the rise in organic matter concentration and methane production yields increased from 40 to 153 goethite performed slightly worse than gac at the lowest organic matter concentration 17 according to xu et al 17 goethite can activate iron containing enzymes f420 involved in methanogenesis and acidogenesis and selectively enrich functional microorganisms furthermore the higher electron donating capacity edc of goethite 2 0 μmol g compared to 0 8 μmol g of gac may operate as a triggering factor for the growth of bacteria capable of diet with methanogens for syntrophic organic acid degradation the ability to transfer electrons could be an important indicator of the redox activity of conductive particles further research is needed to determine the role of these properties in diet promotion 4 1 2 3 hematite although the chemical compositions and electrical conductivities of magnetite and hematite differ their stimulation in diet appears to be similar based on lag times and methane production rates the efficacy of hematite nanoparticles in the treatment of beet sugar industrial wastewater was investigated by ambuchi et al 16 when compared to the control the reactor supplemented with hematite demonstrated a 35 increase in accumulated methane volume and methane production rate after 48 h the need for biomass acclimation was cited as the reason for the delay in methane production the enhanced methane production in the presence of hematite can be attributed to these highly conductive properties which can result in distinct patterns of interaction with the substrate due to its structural orientation thermodynamic and reactivity capabilities 16 4 1 2 4 zero valent iron zero valent iron zvi has also been utilized to enhance ad zhong et al 91 explored the issue of material size the authors investigated the impact of various doses 0 2 5 g l and particle sizes 0 1 250 μm on the glucose degradation using zvi an optimal dosage was found for each particle size with 2 g l of 48 μm particles producing the largest increase in methane production 84 1 the potential mechanisms by which the zvi size effect affects the methane production process are explained when zvi particles are large greater than or equal to 48 μm they primarily act as a medium for microorganism fixation increasing the biomass in the ad system and boosting the efficiency of methane production when zvi particles are very small less than or equal to 0 1 μm they can be easily dispersed in the mixed liquid and interact with microorganisms increasing the activity of related enzymes and subsequently increasing the efficiency of methanogenesis however it was also shown that nanoscale zvi generates a significant amount of biotoxic reactive oxygen species on the cell surface which causes microbial cells to lyse and die and ultimately causes the ad system to fail 4 1 3 carbon modified with iron oxides and other metals some research has modified carbon materials with iron oxides and nickel to address issues such as iron oxide particles being easily washed out of reactors or to increase the conductivity of carbon materials 11 92 in the investigations gac and carbon fiber modified with hematite magnetite goethite zero valent iron and nickel were employed table 3 presents a summary of the investigations that utilized these resources recent studies have examined how metals like fe and ni can increase methane production these trace metals are necessary for a number of biochemical processes that are connected to the use of vfa enzymatic activity and methane generation in ad 95 the presence of fe3 oxides enhances iron reducing bacteria that can participate in diet but these same oxides can compete for the electrons that would be used by methanogenic microorganisms in co2 reduction 73 the combination of iron oxides and carbon materials was used to enhance iron reducing bacteria while also transferring electrons to methanogenic microorganisms through the carbon materials 73 when carbon fiber modified with hematite hcf was used in propionate degradation methane production increased by 15 compared to the control and by 3 7 compared to reactors supplemented with carbon fiber only 73 furthermore after 16 days it was observed that the substrate was completely degraded only in the reactor with hcf according to the amount of fe2 released in the reactor the fe3 ion as an electron acceptor was only responsible for 1 34 of the substrate degradation which is much less than the entire removal 19 67 when comparing the peak current of the hcf to the reactor with only carbon fibers a 3 57 fold increase in peak current was discovered indicating an increase in electron exchange capacity this strategy did not improve the results in the study by xu et al 17 the authors found that gac doped with goethite and akaganeite had a lower methane production efficiency than gac and goethite alone the reduced efficiency was attributable to the ferric oxides attached to the gac surface having poor crystallinity resulting in fe3 leaching when compared to crystalline compounds poorly crystalline or amorphous fe3 oxides can inhibit methanogenesis because the less crystalline forms are more easily dissociated and the dissociated fe3 can be utilized as an electron acceptor by iron reducing bacteria the amount of fe2 emitted was not reported by the authors in this investigation more research is needed to determine the effect of this process on methane production in gac doping both micron size mgac and nanoparticle form mngac magnetite has been used and both demonstrated higher performance than reactors without cm and those supplemented only with gac 61 63 gac with sizes ranging from 0 84 to 2 38 mm doped with magnetite powder 5 μm was employed in the propionate degradation investigation by barua et al 63 under these conditions the methane production of this material increased by 1 52 and 1 21 times that of the control reactor and the gac only reactor respectively the accumulation of acetate in the control and gac reactors which could have resulted in decreased performance was not detected in the mgac supplemented reactor in the ad of synthetic wastewater song et al 61 employed gac doped with magnetite nanoparticles average diameter of 10 nm mngac had a conductivity 2 03 times that of gac resulting in a 220 increase in the volume of methane produced as compared to the control condition in addition the proportion of methane in the biogas generated was increased by 25 compared to the control and by 10 compared to the gac reactor these findings are explained by the fact that magnetite nanoparticles have a biostimulation impact on methanogenic microorganisms increasing the conversion of substrate into methane as well as the higher conductivity which accelerates electron transfer in order to increase methane production gac was modified with nanoparticles of zero valent iron it was found that with 1000 mg l the cod degradation rate and methane production increased by 9 38 and 14 29 respectively 93 the degradation of acetate butyrate and propionate was investigated with ni modified gac the strong metabolic ability of the inoculum to metabolize acetate is responsible for the fact that as observed in other research cm supplementation had no effect on acetate degradation the maximum methane rate increased by 16 55 for butyrate and 54 06 for propionate respectively the authors attributed this improvement to an increase in syntrophic metabolism between syntrophomonas and methanogens additionally it was shown that adding ni alone to the reactor had no effect on the degradation of acetate but had a significant inhibitory effect on the production of methane utilizing propionate and butyrate nickel may have inhibited methanogens hydrogenotrophic or syntrophic oxidizing bacteria but not acetotrophic methanogens 94 4 1 4 other materials table 4 summarizes the other cms that were used in the improvement of methanogenesis blast furnace dust bfd is a byproduct of the steelmaking process that is abundant in carbon and iron oxides especially magnetite and hematite 19 yang et al 19 added different concentrations of bfd to uasb reactors with a concentration of 40 mg l the highest biogas production efficiency was achieved with 116 88 l ch4 g of material used the performance was worse at a dosage of 50 mg l presumably due to an excess of material that inhibited microbial activity supplementation with polyaniline pani a conductive polymer also increased methane production during ad the length of the polymer chains provides a stable chemical structure and high resistance to microbial degradation other properties of pani stand out such as ease of synthesis low cost and environmental stability 18 additionally the electrical conductivity can be modified throughout the synthesis process hu et al 18 used pani nanorods in synthetic wastewater treatment in 2017 and obtained nearly 2 times more methane at an optimal dosage of 600 mg l in 2019 a new way of pani synthesis was tested using intracellular polymeric substances ips released from e coli cells 100 the conductivity of pani was controlled by the concentration of ips added the higher the conductivity the more methane is produced with production reaching around 2 times that of the control reactor according to the authors conductivity was found to be more relevant in ch4 production than material porosity in this circumstance a different approach to enhancing ad and finding answers to problems with employing materials alone such as the cited difficulty in keeping materials in reactors has been to combine the structures of particular materials for example pani was used to synthesize other compounds pani and magnetite composites in hydrogel form pani covering polyvinylidene fluoride pvdf and polyethylene terephthalate pet and pani with polypyrrole the pani magnetite composite which was created with 40 magnetite increased ch4 production rate by 26 98 at an ideal dose of 0 6 g l but performance decreased when the dosage was increased to 5 4 g l due to an inhibitory effect the authors found that the acetoclastic pathway enzymes increased whereas the hydrogenotrophic pathway enzymes did not differ significantly when they examined the enzymatic activity associated with methanogenesis 96 a pani hydrogel that was created by zhou et al 99 has the benefit of facilitating microbial adherence in addition to its large size and mechanical strength with an optimal dosage of 3 g l the pani hydrogel enabled an increase in ch4 production rate of up to 28 77 pani has also been used to coat non conductive polymers like polyvinylidene fluoride pvdf and polyethylene terephthalate pet 98 this approach was used in order to keep the pani in the reactor for a long period of time with the usage of pani coated pet and pvdf the rate of ch4 production improved by 9 and 25 respectively the higher specific surface area of the pvdf material was credited with producing the greatest results zhou et al 97 combined pani and polypyrrole to create core shell structures polypyrrole is a conductive polymer with a stable chemical structure and high conductivity the methane production rate and yield increased by 70 2 and 28 3 respectively when the recommended dosage of 0 6 g l of this core shell material was used this indicates that the substance is effective at accelerating ad high density polyethylene hdpe which has been treated with graphite powder was another polymer investigated 101 it was shown that ad performance improved with increasing graphite content even at high olr conditions 23 7 kg cod m 3 d 1 the syntrophic conversion of organic matter to ch4 according to the authors was sped up by hdpe with graphite powder polymeric materials have demonstrated promise to increase ad efficiency and methane production offering advantages of being more resistant and modifiable to satisfy system demands however the precise properties that improve ad efficiency are still unknown which in some ways restricts the development of more suitable materials 4 2 main configurations and techniques used 4 2 1 reactors among the 46 studies analyzed 61 were operated in batch in serum bottles with a volume of 100 ml to 1 2 l and 11 were operated in semi batch with 120 900 ml serum bottles only 17 of the works examined used continuous operation with six employing a 1 7 5 l uasb one employing a 1 l up flow biofilm reactor and one employing an iffas uasb reactors can maintain relatively high microorganism concentrations resulting in a shorter hrt and faster reaction rates 11 furthermore because of the upward flow the uasb reactor can minimize aggregation and precipitation of the added cms as well as proper mixing of the material into the sludge 89 demonstrating that it is a potential reactor for the application of the technique the type of reactor utilized may have a significant impact on diet potentiation however the types of reactors and operating conditions for enriching microorganisms in diet have not yet been improved for large scale applications further reactor designs and investigations of operational conditions for selective enrichment of diet microorganisms are required and further study is still needed 4 2 2 substrates and inoculum in 28 of the research examined vfa acetate butyrate and or propionate was utilized as a substrate in two experiments ethanol was used to promote diet while glucose and sucrose were employed in ten more more complex substrates with high olr were used in 17 of the experiments only 10 of the studies used effluents with lower organic loads in the range of 300 500 mg cod l the number of works that use substrates that are similar to real municipal effluents is relatively small all the research examined used mixed cultures and the majority of them used sludge collected from reactors that used synthetic wastewater as an inoculum considering that the occurrence of diet is dependent on the presence of specific microorganisms that can use this metabolic route the inoculum used can have a significant impact on the performance of the process with inoculums containing electroactive microorganisms being preferred as discussed in item 4 1 1 4 4 3 microorganisms anaerobic digestion is known to be dependent on the presence of specific bacteria and methanogenic archaea that form an effective consortium electron donating bacteria and electron accepting methanogenic archaea must be present to achieve ad via diet through cms table 5 summarizes the reported microorganism groups that were shown to be enriched in the presence of cms in the studied papers in most cases the taxonomic level presented in this revision is the lowest reported by the authors which was usually at the genus level enriched microorganisms developed were those that demonstrated a percentage increase in the reactor supplemented with cm as compared to control some studies did not examine this issue while others found no significant changes with the addition of the conductive material and still other investigations discovered that the other operating parameters had a stronger influence on the selection of microorganisms 66 67 70 72 101 in general adding cms does not appear to increase the amount of biomass in the reactors ruling out the possibility that an increase in biomass is the cause of the improvement in ad but it does cause a change in its composition selectively enriching certain microbial groups 63 pseudomonas geobacter clostridium desulfuromonas smithella peptoclostridium syntrophomonas and levilinea were the most often enriched bacterial genera in the presence of cms in contrast to what had previously been reported geobacter a genus known to be capable of engaging in diet was not the most prevalent genus and was even absent in some reactors implying that other bacterial groups are favored by cms and could also participate in diet 14 64 75 5 effects on methanogenesis studies analyzed were conducted under diverse experimental settings making it difficult to compare and better comprehend the process as stated throughout this paper analyses based on the data provided by the selected articles were conducted in an effort to comprehend the process better and the results are summarized below 5 1 influence of substrate and material on the microbial community variations in substrate type and concentration conductive material properties and dose and previously present microbial communities in the inoculum used as well as other factors such as temperature variation can have a significant impact on the microbial group that will be enriched in the reactor 55 58 85 identifying groups of microorganisms that are frequently enriched under specific experimental settings is critical for directing future research as they play a central position in ad via cm supplementation the identification of these groups can be used as part of a strategy to promote diet more effectively such as using bioaugmentation considering that the substrate is one of the factors that can significantly alter the microbial community the enrichment frequencies of microbial groups and families by material type and substrate were investigated using descriptive statistics fig 3 presents graphs of microorganism groups and families enriched with a frequency 3 by material type the archaea domain is represented by the bolded classes and families except for genus geobacter class deltaproteobacteria family geobacteraceae there is still no consensus on which bacteria participate in diet but some groups are suggested as potential electron donors pseudomonas class gammaproteobacteria family pseudomonadaceae and desulfuromonas class deltaproteobacteria family desulfuromonadaceae are known as electroactive bacteria because of their extracellular electron transfer capability which enables them to oxidize various organic electron donors while also reducing insoluble electron acceptors 74 it has been reported that fe3 reducing species of the genus clostridium class clostridia family clostridiaceae can perform extracellular electron transfer 102 with their possible participation in diet being suggested 18 syntrophomonas class clostridia family syntrophomonadaceae are syntrophic bacteria that metabolize vfa into acetate h2 and formate however it has been suggested that this genus can also metabolize the substrate into short chain organic acids protons and electrons 103 making them potential electron donors genes generating conductor pili have also been discovered in the genera desulfuromonas syntrophomonas and smithella class deltaproteobacteria family syntrophaceae suggesting that they could act as electron donor partners in diet 104 105 methanothrix class methanomicrobia family methanosaetaceae and methanosarcina class methanomicrobia family methanosarcinaceae were the most frequently enriched genera in the presence of cms in the methanogenic archaea group with already recognized potential to participate in diet 25 26 methanolinea class methanomicrobia family methanoregulaceae and methanobacterium class methanobacteria family methanobacteriaceae were also often enriched methanogenic archaea genera methanolinea is recognized as hydrogenotrophic methanogens but it has also been mentioned as potential electron donor bacterium partner 11 methanobacterium enrichment in the systems has been interpreted by some studies as an indication that diet was not occurring but recently zheng et al 27 found that a strain of this methanogen was also able to participate in diet suggesting that the ability of diet is much more widely distributed among methanogens than previously thought the intercorrelation between the enriched microbial community and the substrate and material employed was investigated using pearson s chi squared and cramér s v tests the goal was to find out if the microbial community changes were more influenced by the different substrates utilized or by the cms that were added table 6 summarizes the findings the tests were applied to the taxonomic levels of class and family based on the results it is possible to infer that both the substrate and the cm exhibit a statistically significant association with the class of enriched microorganisms p value 0 05 according to cramér s v test the association with the substrate is moderate between 0 3 and 0 5 while with cm the association is probably higher 0 603 suggesting that enriched microorganisms have a stronger correlation with cm than with the substrate when combined these findings imply that while the various substrates used exert some selection on the microbial groups that have a higher or lower affinity for a particular substrate the effect of cms stands out demonstrating their high capacity to alter the microbial community possibly by favoring microorganisms capable of using them in diet the analyses only offer a limited amount of information when the taxonomic level is lowered for instance to the family level p 0 05 indicating the need for additional research it is worth noting that not all of the works analyzed used the same type of control some researchers employed reactors with no material while others utilized reactors supplemented with an inert or non conductive materials it is well recognized that adding material to the reactor as a support medium impacts methanogenesis due to biofilm formation and that the physicochemical properties of these materials can have a significant impact on the enrichment of specific microbial groups 106 the effect of the support medium in the promotion of diet as cavalcante gehring and zaiat 107 point out extends beyond the effect of biofilm formation due to electrochemical interactions between bacteria and the conductive material as a result the authors recommend using a dual control strategy non conductive material and suspended biomass to obtain a better understanding of the interaction between microorganisms and conductive materials as well as the contribution of biofilm formation and electrochemical interactions to diet processes 5 2 influence of the material on methane production fig 4 shows the maximum and average increments in methane production per material type compared to the control methane production increased significantly when carbon based materials were employed these materials are not only electrically conductive but also act as redox mediators and provide a large surface area for microbial colonization 12 carbon based materials also adsorb chemical compounds that inhibit methanogenesis such as phenol and ammonia 47 and increase the speed of the proliferation of methanogenic archaea methanosarcina and methanothrix 108 which have both been found to engage in diet this finding corroborates what was reported in a review published by wu et al 50 initially data on the increase in methane production as a function of cm dosage was represented graphically fig 5 methane production appears to increase as material dosage increases but the linear correlation is weak r 0 197 the lack of an association can be attributed to the need to find the ideal dosage for each type of material as well as the fact that in most cases the increase in methane production does not actually increase linearly with the dosage of cm with some cases revealing that lower dosages are more effective this result is consistent with the findings of park et al 11 who reported that increasing the dose of the cms increased methane generation but with a weak association due to the varied experimental settings fig 6 shows methane production increasing as a function of carbon based material dose the data were analyzed using linear and quadratic regression with the first analysis showing a higher correlation r 0 360 suggesting that there is a tendency for methane production to increase with increasing dosage for this type of material still there are many cases where lower dosages are more effective and the ideal dosage for each experimental condition must be evaluated fig 7 illustrates how the dosage of materials based on iron oxides influences the increase in methane visually the graph tends to suggest that methane production rises until an ideal dosage is reached then decreases most likely as a result of the inhibitory effect on microbial activity with high concentrations of material the low correlation which prevented the analysis from drawing more conclusions may have been caused by the limited data provided for this type of material electrical conductivity fig 8 and size fig 9 of the materials were investigated in relation to the increase in methane production no apparent correlation was observed between the increase in methane production and the conductivity of the materials opposite to what was expected methane production does not appear to increase as electrical conductivity increases suggesting that other characteristics of the material such as specific surface area redox potential and effects such as organic matter adsorption may also be relevant in the process and require further research the lack of electrical conductivity values available in the surveys examined is a factor that has to be highlighted because it makes it challenging to adequately analyze this material property martins et al 108 pointed out that there were similar difficulties in analyzing this property the slope of the line in fig 9 would suggest that larger materials might produce methane more effectively as was previously mentioned different materials play different roles in the electron transfer between microorganisms bigger materials have larger adhesion surfaces which facilitate microbial growth and allow electron exchange even when microorganisms are not in direct physical contact 109 in addition to the considerations mentioned above iron based nanomaterials have been suggested to act as electron acceptors reducing methane production 110 these results and observations suggest that using materials with larger diameters on the order of millimeters is more appropriate and should be explored further 6 perspectives and challenges the majority of research has demonstrated that use of cms in anaerobic treatment of effluents increases methane production and also reduces some disadvantages of ad including long lag times recovery after reactor disturbance and cod removal although the exact mechanism remains unknown these materials appear to promote methanogenesis enabling the occurrence of diet and creating favorable conditions for the other methanogenic pathways in addition to selectively enriching microorganisms however there are still a number of issues that need to be addressed before full scale application most investigations have focused on finding cms that can promote diet and how supplementation of specific cms improves methanogenic performance however most of the studies presented indirect evidence of the occurrence of diet and attributed the increase in methane production exclusively to this methanogenic pathway which does not seem to be the case some of the primary conceptual issues that have yet to be resolved are a better understanding of how cm supplementation influences methanogenic pathways as well as which microorganisms can participate in diet and their influence on increasing methane production more adequate methods to validate the occurrence of diet also need to be developed significant progress has been made in identifying the microorganisms that can participate in diet recently initially only a few species were known to be able to utilize this methanogenic route but as of now more are known and possibly more will be found the need for research in this field arises from the possibility of improving the inoculum and optimizing the experimental conditions by identifying the microorganisms engaged in the process in addition to being an important issue to understand the mechanism involved the controversy over the role of material properties in methanogenesis is evident in many of the papers examined initially it was believed that the increase in methane production caused by diet stimulation was mostly due to electrical conductivity however as discussed in this article new findings have demonstrated that a number of additional properties need to be taken into consideration such as specific surface area roughness porosity redox properties etc with some material properties favoring and others inhibiting the process the final performance of ad seems to be a balance between these characteristics and specific experimental conditions the materials have a combination of advantages and disadvantages and it is crucial to determine the importance of each component of this equation in order to optimize the process in addition to understanding the role of the properties of conductive materials in ad research is also needed to develop materials suitable for the application of this technology many works use activated carbon or iron based materials although the issues with these materials have been highlighted earlier to achieve a long term operation it is worthwhile to investigate different materials such as conductive polymers which are more resistant and have the advantage of being more easily modified to satisfy the operating parameters required for diet still as nguyen et al 47 point out a balance between the cost and quantity of cm is an important factor to consider when increasing the usage of this technology a comprehensive techno economic analysis is required to find cms that are suitable for full scale operation in terms of applicability a better understanding of the mechanisms of diet in complex and or dilute substrates is still needed to demonstrate the benefits of this metabolic route most studies have employed pure and simple substrates as vfa and or with high organic loadings and more research is needed utilizing substrates that realistically simulate the properties of other wastewater effluents such as municipal another point to consider is the reactors proper which are usually small scale and low volume pilot scale reactor research is still in its beginning the requirement for cm retention in the reactor is a challenge for full scale implementation of the system because flushing would require continuous material addition which would not only increase the volume of biosolids for handling and disposal but also raise operating expenses 47 material retention can be accomplished by focusing on the reactor using barriers such as filter membranes or by focusing on the material employed such as using mobile or fixed microbial growth media the settings in the research that were analyzed varied greatly including the types of materials used their characteristics doses and sizes the substrates organic loads and the sources of the inoculum due to the wide range of conditions it was challenging to compare the findings for a more in depth future review it is recommended to define certain experimental conditions such as focusing on a type of material and defining a range of organic load that will be considered in the selection another difficulty found in this review was the lack of data or the lack of standardization of data for comparing the observed results cavalcante gehring e zaiat 107 propose the use of indicators that allow direct comparison of the results of studies in methanogenic reactors enhanced with cms as well as an indicator to detect inhibitory limits and an indication to compare the usage of different particle sizes 7 conclusion some of the most recent studies that used cms in ad of effluents were reviewed and analyzed in this paper the mechanism by which cms promote increases in methane production is still unknown despite recent advances there is still controversy over the properties of these materials that affect the different methanogenic pathways the effects of these materials on the result obtained and the true contribution of diet to these outcomes we verified that in fact the alteration in the microbial community does appear to be related to the addition of conductive materials after analyzing the data from the selected articles and we discussed the main microbial groups and their possibles roles in ad via diet contrary to expectations no correlation was found between electrical conductivity and increased methane production this property of cm does not appear to be the most essential in increasing methane which supports the hypothesis that other characteristics such as redox properties may be significant the improvement in ad appears to be the result of a balance between the various properties of the added cms and the experimental conditions employed during the process it was also noted that cms with sizes in the order of millimeters appeared to be more effective for producing methane finally the necessity for additional research is highlighted it is advised to standardize the reporting of outcomes to enable the comparison of investigations as we stress the need to compare data from various works to better understand the process declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper 
12709,electroactive microorganisms eams are the core element of microbial electrochemical technologies mets due to their ability to interact with electrodes allowing wiring of current flow and microbial metabolism however eams are not the unique microbes in mets particularly when they are fed with complex substrates non electrochemically active microorganisms non eams often coexist with eams in mets and they can be important not only for electricity generation but also for the treatment of wastewater the production of hydrogen and methane among other processes a systematic review of the diversity of eams and non eams and their potential relationships in mets was conducted in this study the results indicate that eams and non eams are highly diverse and present in all three domains of life bacteria archaea and eukarya therefore microbial ecology studies on the diversity of one of these three microbial groups give only a partial characterization of the electromicrobiology in mets a complex balance between eams and non eams appears to be necessary to maintain efficient energy production without detrimental impacts on other treatment processes in mets knowledge gaps and areas where future research efforts should be prioritized are discussed graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords microbial fuel cell bioelectrochemical system microbial diversity electroactivity microbial metabolism data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction the discovery of the ability of microorganisms to electrically interact with an electrode and produce a current 1 has resulted in the development of different biotechnological applications based on electrochemical reactions derived from microbe electrode interactions 2 microbial electrochemical technologies mets include microbial fuel cells mfcs for electricity production wastewater treatment and toxicity detection microbial electrolysis cells mecs for hydrogen h2 or methane ch4 production and other mets that can be utilized to desalinate water or produce chemical products e g hydrogen peroxide such as microbial desalinization cells mdc and microbial electrosynthesis cells mes respectively fig 1 generally considered mets require an anode and a cathode electrode that are connected through a conductive wire and separated by a membrane for proton exchange pem fig 1 while mfc and mdc do not require an external power supply an electric voltage is applied to mec and mes to trigger electrochemical reactions fig 1 3 4 these mets and their components have been summarized in recent reviews 5 11 however the characterization of the core element of these systems electroactive microorganisms eams still remains a challenging area of research due to the high diversity and complex interactions between the microbial groups involved in current production the lack of accurate molecular tools to identify eams and the still poor understanding of the impact of variations in the design configuration operational parameters and electrode materials of mets on the growth diversity and energy generation of eams 12 13 eams carry out the exchange of electrons between intracellular and extracellular redox active electron donors and acceptors 213 exoelectrogenic microorganisms those that transfer electrons to a solid electrode from the bacteria archaea and eukarya domains can produce current on the anode from the anaerobic oxidation of organic substrates but only prokaryotes members of the domains bacteria and archaea have been reported to function as electrotrophs those that receive electrons from the electrode on the cathode where aerobic conditions exist 14 considerable efforts have been made to characterize eams in mets thanks to the development of numerous microbiological and electrochemical techniques that can be applied to these systems 15 17 studies over the last decade have shown that the characterization of the diversity of eams in mets is important for a improving met performance b preventing failures by monitoring the microbial community c selecting microbial inoculum and bioaugmentation strategies and d providing data for modeling 16 17 therefore a review of the diversity of eams in mets can be important to increase our understanding of their interactions how they can grow develop and communicate in these systems and ultimately how this information can be used to improve energy generation in mets several reports have found that eams are not the unique microorganisms in mets particularly when they are fed with complex substrates e g real effluents as wastewaters marine sediments soil and leachates non electrochemically active microorganisms non eams from all domains of life often coexist with eams in mets and they can be important not only for electricity generation but also for wastewater treatment and h2 and ch4 production among other processes 18 22 non eams can form and co exist in anode biofilms and contribute to minimizing electron transfer to the anode 23 for example the presence of non eams such as methanogens sulfate and nitrate reducers as well as fermentative aerobic and h2 scavenging microorganisms in anodes has been related to decreased power generation in mets if they proliferate excessively 19 21 24 however other non eams such as algae can provide a continuous supply of o2 at cathodes owing to their capability of oxygenic photosynthesis which enhances energy recovery in mets 25 non eam enzyme producing fungi can also increase energy efficiency in cathodes 26 therefore a complex balance between eams and non eams appears to be necessary for mets to maintain efficient energy production without detrimental impacts on other treatment processes to date few studies have tried to explore the diversity and potential relationships between eams and non eams in mets understanding the mechanisms that mediate the activity and growth of eams and non eams and their potential relationships is crucial to optimizing the design and operating parameters of mets and helping develop more efficient bioelectrochemical systems by knowing the diversity of eam and non eam in mets and their potentially more important groups for power production and reduction more accurate strategies can be developed to monitor their growth and communication and understand their relationships with current production when they proliferate or disappear in these systems this review article aims to provide an overview of the diversity of eams and non eams in anodes and cathodes of mets and to synthesize our current understanding of their potential relationships in electroactive biofilms and planktonic cells in particular the diversity of exoelectrogenic microorganisms bacteria archaea and eukaryotes electrotrophic microorganisms bacteria and archaea and non eams methanogenic fermentative sulfate reducing nitrate reducing aerobic h2 scavenging microalgae and fungal microorganisms that have been described and reported in mets is discussed a detailed description of the literature review strategy used in this study is provided in the supplementary materials and methods 2 overview of electroactive microorganisms in mets mets are based on the exchange of electrons between eams and electrodes in a process known as microbial extracellular electron transfer eet during which substrate oxidation anodic or reduction cathodic reactions occur 27 28 exoelectrogenic and electrotrophic microorganisms perform eet using different mechanisms fig 2 that have been summarized in several recent reviews and therefore they are not examined in detail here 13 29 30 these mechanisms include direct interspecies electron transfer diet through physical contact between redox molecules and the solid electrode which can be established via microbial nanowires and mediated electron transfer through diffusive molecules that are reduced oxidized at the cell surface or within the cells fig 2 interactions between electrodes and electrotrophic microorganisms are thought to occur via diet or mediators in cathodes fig 2 13 27 a phylogenetic analysis revealed that exoelectrogenic and electrotrophic microorganisms cluster together fig 3 therefore no correspondence between eet mechanisms and phylogeny was found likely due to similar eet mechanisms having convergently evolved or been obtained through horizontal gene transfer 31 34 in this respect it has been demonstrated that some eams such as g metallireducens and g sulfurreducens can change between functioning as electrogens or electrotrophs which is controlled by variations in environmental conditions 35 36 tables s2 and s3 a phylogenetic analysis revealed that exoelectrogenic and electrotrophic microorganisms cluster together fig 3 therefore no correspondence between eet mechanisms and phylogeny was found likely due to similar eet mechanisms having convergently evolved or been obtained through horizontal gene transfer 31 34 in this respect it has been demonstrated that some eams such as g metallireducens and g sulfurreducens can change between functioning as electrogens or electrotrophs which is controlled by variations in environmental conditions 35 36 tables s2 and s3 microbial eet can occur in microbial biofilms as well as planktonic cells and has been characterized by different microbial and bioelectrochemical techniques both in entire electroactive biofilms and single cells see reviews by 37 38 planktonic microorganisms can perform eet through exogenous e g escherichia coli 39 or endogenous e g pseudomonas sp 40 mediator molecules 41 whereas biofilm forming microorganisms can transfer electrons directly through diet e g shewanella sp 42 or across the biofilm via nanowires e g geobacter sp 43 higher kinetic rates of electron transfer have been detected via diet and nanowires compared to mechanisms relying solely upon redox mediators 44 45 different factors can influence biofilm formation on anode and cathode electrodes of mets such as the material of the electrode and diverse operating conditions e g temperature ph and type of substrate 16 46 for a review an important ecological and biogeochemical distinction among exoelectrogenic microorganisms is their method to generate and consume energy in anodes while respiratory exoelectrogenic microorganisms generate atp through membrane associated electron transport fermentative exoelectrogenic microorganisms primarily conserve energy from substrate level phosphorylation respiratory exoelectrogenic microbes typically show greater rates of eet per mole than fermentative microorganisms as they often have the ability to completely oxidize organic compounds to co2 with an extracellular electron acceptor by contrast fermentative exoelectrogenic microorganisms release electrons onto extracellular electron acceptors generating more oxidized products such as organic acids and alcohols and or less h2 13 in cathodes similar distinctions for electrotrophic microorganisms into respiratory and non respiratory electron consumption are possible 47 48 to date most studies characterizing eams in mets have focused on those in electroactive biofilms but recent observations suggest that some specific eams can be exclusively present in suspended cells and or may require long experimental periods to colonize biofilms 16 28 therefore the study of the diversity of eams in biofilms may give only a partial characterization of all eams in these systems 49 the growth of eams as planktonic cells vs as biofilms is thought to be dependent on the metabolic status of the cell operational conditions and design parameters table 1 and appears to be species specific 23 28 50 52 for example some species of the genus shewanella can coexist in planktonic cells and biofilm in the anode and synergistically produce power 42 53 in contrast species of geobacter require direct electrical contact with the electrode as a biofilm to transfer electrons 54 2 1 exoelectrogenic microorganisms prokaryotic and eukaryotic exoelectrogenic microorganisms have been characterized using different carbon sources and isolation strategies in pure culture experiments and microbial ecology studies 12 13 27 55 bacterial exoelectrogenic species in the proteobacteria firmicutes cyanobacteria deferribacteres and actinobacteria phyla archaeal species in the euryarchaeota phylum and fungal species in the ascomycota phylum have been detected in suspended cells and or biofilms in mets treating complex substrates

diverse group of exoelectrogenic microorganisms fig 5 although most described exoelectrogenic bacteria are gram negative table s1 an increased number of gram positive exoelectrogenic bacteria that perform direct and indirect eet to electrodes has been reported see 57 for a review the known mechanisms that gram negative and gram positive bacteria use to transport electrons across the cell

envelope to external electron donors acceptors have been previously reviewed 28 57 58 the amount of energy that exoelectrogenic microorganisms can produce varies widely and high energy densities are often only achieved after long acclimatization times in the selective environment of mets 12 however direct comparisons of power densities between studies are often not possible due to different experimental conditions and growth requirements of exoelectrogenic microorganisms 12 for example power production varied by 15 with an average of 1 36 0 20 w m2 in 24 incubations carried out in the same laboratory with similar inocula electrolytes and materials 59 likely due to variations in the electrode age biofilm development and or interactions between eams and non eams with time in addition in mets treating different complex substrates it is not possible to distinguish the microbial origin of the current which depends on the diversity of the microbial inocula or substrate fed into the anode different complex substrates can provide a distinct diversity of exoelectrogenic microorganisms table s2 60 61 readers are referred to logan et al 12 for an overview of power densities from different exoelectrogenic microorganisms from pure cultures several other factors such as the electrode and membrane material temperature ph substrate loading rate biofilm and external resistance can also affect electricity generation in mets 5 11 the amount of energy that exoelectrogenic microorganisms can produce varies widely and high energy densities are often only achieved after long

proteobacteria of the gammaproteobacteria and deltaproteobacteria classes are the main groups of exoelectrogenic bacteria described to date table s2 fig 4 this is thought to be due to the presence of electron conducting proteins in their cell wall composition which may favor versatile metabolisms and adaptation to different physiological conditions 28 51 different species of geobacter table s2 fig

positive bacteria such as tolumonas osonensis have also been reported as exoelectrogenic microorganisms 69 species of the genus nitrosomonas can produce current and simultaneously carry out anoxic autotrophic ammonium oxidation in mecs 75 the production of electricity in mfc anodes by anaerobic ammonium oxidizing anammox bacteria such as candidatus brocadia sp and candidatus scalindua sp has been reported 76 in mecs anammox bacteria also have the ability to oxidize nh4 with the transfer of electrons to electron acceptors such as graphene oxide or electrodes 76 cable bacteria are electroactive multicellular filamentous microbes belonging to the deltaproteobacterial family desulfobulbaceae that can reach 1 cm in length enhancing long range electron transport 77 candidatus electrothrix and candidatus electronema are examples of cable bacteria and they can also electrically couple the oxidation of sulfide in anoxic layers with the reduction of o2 78 exoelectrogenic bacterial species have been found in many extreme environments which opens up exciting opportunities to develop novel mets see 79 for a review for example in pure culture studies current generation by exoelectrogenic bacterial species has been reported at thermophilic temperatures 45 70 c for calditerrivibrio nitroreducens 80 and thermincola ferriacetica 81 other bacteria such as acidiphilum sp 3 2 sup 5 can grow and generate current at the acidic ph of 2 5 82 whereas geoalkalibacter spp 83 and geoglobus ahangari 84 produce electricity under alkaline ph 9 and saline 3 8 nacl conditions recently it has been proposed that low power producing eams microorganisms in mets can be classified as weak exoelectrogens 85 86 to date there is not an agreed definition of weak exoelectrogens but they primarily use soluble electron acceptors 85 although weak exoelectrogens produce a small current no specific power density cut off numbers have been provided that can distinguish strong from weak exoelectrogens due to large variations in energy generation among weak exoelectrogens 85 86 great variability in current production has been observed even among strong exoelectrogens such as geobacter sp and shewanella sp 12 species of pseudomonas thauera and lactobacillus have been reported as weak exoelectrogens in mfcs 85 thauera sp appears to also be important for maintaining anaerobic conditions in mfcs via o2 scavenging 87 micro aeration at the anode has been reported to increase degradation rates of the contaminant p nitrophenol by the weak exoelectrogen pseudomonas monteilii with concomitant electricity production 88 in mfcs treating organic substrates fermentative communities often contain several weak exoelectrogens including enterococcus clostridium and streptococcus 89 although few studies on the potential roles of weak exoelectrogens in mets have been published recent observations suggest they may play critical roles in treatment processes and energy production across all types of met 85 generally considered low power producing bacteria are often in lower relative abundance in biofilms compared to high power producing bacteria 85 86 although competition between exoelectrogenic bacteria exists in biofilms and involves many factors such as substrate temperature ph flow rate anode potential surface and topology 90 91 the predominance of high power producing bacteria is not only based on their ability to produce greater current for example metabolites from the low power producing bacteria pseudomonas putida not only help this microorganism to achieve eet but also help its dominance over other bacteria because these compounds can be toxic and provide a competitive advantage under certain conditions 92 93 other bacteria such as s putrefaciens produce higher current in pure cultures than in mixed culture biofilms that are colonized by other exoelectrogens e g paracoccus sp 94 in other cases prolonged operation times in mets or repeated cultures have been shown to favor the proliferation of high power over low power producing strains such as rhodopseudomonas palustris g sulfurreducens 95 and e coli 96 but it is unknown if they can maintain such high electroactive activity over time 2 1 2 exoelectrogenic archaea few archaeal species have been characterized as exoelectrogenic microorganisms with power densities in the

bacteria is a useful application of mecs hydrogen producing biofilms are often predominantly colonized by desulfovibrio sp 115 and g sulfurreducens 116 but other bacteria such as rhodobacter sphaeroides can also produce h2 on the cathode of mecs 117 in mess fig 1 electrotrophic bacteria use electrons from the oxidation of organic compounds in the anode to reduce co2 to multi carbon organic molecules e g alcohols and acids of industrial interest for the generation of feedstocks and biofuels 118 for example acetogenic bacteria e g sporomusa sp and clostridium sp can reduce co2 to acetate in mess by accepting electrons from cathodes 223 224 however the current densities were relatively low 10 ma m 2 and the cathodic coulombic efficiencies that is consumed electrons present in products were highly variable 30 90 electromicrobial conversion of co2 to alcohol by ralstonia eutropha in an mes using co2 as the sole carbon source and electricity as the sole energy input has been reported 119 this process opens up the possibility of electricity driven bioconversion of co2 to commercial chemicals in mes using specific electrotrophic bacteria 2 2 2 electrotrophic archaea

electroactive species of geobacter however the proliferation of excessive fermentative microorganisms can result in the accumulation of acetate and a reduction in current production in general fermentative microorganisms have higher growth yields than exoelectrogens and their high yield can make biomass a significant electron sink thus reducing current production in anodes in the range of 26 60 21 132 134 for example increases in the concentration of acetate in the early stages of mfcs often indicate that the fermentative population has transformed all fermentable substrates into short chain fatty acids for respiration the implementation of a pre fermentation step before feeding mfcs can be used to increase the concentration of substrates for the respiratory population thus preventing the proliferation of excessive fermentative microorganisms in the anode 135 in addition a reduction in the proliferation of fermentative microorganims in anode biofilms due to a decrease in fermentable substrates has been reported 89 3 2 linking energy production and reduction and sulfate reducing microorganisms in mets natural redox compounds such as sulfur sulfide can be present in complex substrates feeding mets and impact electricity generation 132 although the presence of sulfate reducing bacteria can improve treatment processes and energy production in mfcs 136 the

microorganisms of the domain archaea and the main microorganisms that compete with eams for utilizing different sources of nutrients electron donors and reducing equivalents e g co2 formic acid or methylamines in the anaerobic environment of the anode 147 the presence of methanogenic microorganisms has been related to decreased current production in the range of 7 45 in mfcs as they can be a

methanosaeta and methanobacterium in anodes and cathodes after two months of reactor operation different methods have been studied to prevent the growth of excessive methanogens in biofilms and planktonic cells in anodes see 152 for a review for example adjusting the substrate loading can effectively result in reducing the number of methanogens 153 and periodic aeration can also suppress methanogenic growth 24 it has been demonstrated that a combination of high electrode surface area together with reduced substrate loading can promote the growth of eams while reducing the presence of methanogens and maintaining electricity generation in mfcs 148 152 the growth of methanogens can also be inhibited using chemical inhibitors such as 2 bromoethane sulfonate sodium 2 bromoethanesulfonic acid and iodopropane 21 37 152 the inoculum can be pretreated with several cycles of heat and acids to reduce the number of methanogens 154 however the use of chemical inhibitors to inhibit methanogens is not recommended for mfcs fed with wastewater treatment as the continuous supply of the inhibitors can make this process expensive and energy consuming 152 as discussed earlier see section 2 2 2 it is important to note that the above mentioned methanogens are important for ch4 and h2 production in the cathode of mecs where they can directly convert current to these products via electromethanogenesis 121 155 3 4 linking energy reduction and h2 scavenging microorganisms in mets mecs use exoelectrogenic microorganisms as anode catalysts for oxidizing reduced forms of compounds e g acetate 14 however treatment of complex organic compounds present in effluents such as urban wastewater requires syntrophic interactions between eams with fermentative bacteria to efficiently degrade complex organics into simple forms 133 the growth of h2 utilizing methanogens as an h2 scavenger is fundamental for exoelectrogenic microorganisms to utilize acetate from fermentable substrates however h2 generated from fermentation in anodes is an ideal substrate for h2 scavenging microorganisms which outcompetes direct h2 consumption by exoelectrogenic microorganisms thereby reducing power and h2 yields in mecs 134 156 a complex balance between exoelectrogenic microorganisms fermenters and h2 scavenging microorganisms is needed in mecs which if optimized properly

catalysts e g carbon material and noble and non noble metals such as platinum and cobalt microorganisms belonging to the alphaproteobacteria betaproteobacteria gammproteobacteria and bacteroidetes

microorganisms in cathodes 3 7 linking energy reduction and fungi in mets fungi are often present in mets treating complex substrates and can be detected in both anodes and cathodes 171 in anodes they

microalgae biomass can serve as a substrate for exoelectrogenic microorganisms in anodes of mfcs and it can be used as electron donors in the anode and electron acceptors in the cathode 174 176 conventional mfcs need continuous aeration in the cathode for the supply of o2 but microalgae can provide o2 at the cathode thanks to their ability to perform oxygenic photosynthesis using co2 from the anode 177 microalgae cells directly accept electrons flowing from the anode to the cathode via mediators during the bioconversion of co2 to carbohydrates and o2 25 alternatively o2 produced via algae photosynthesis at the cathode can be used as the sole terminal electron acceptor 178 recent studies suggest that microalgae metabolism is affected by changes in temperature ph light and other operational parameters which need to be optimized to achieve optimal current generation with simultaneous nutrient removal in mfcs 25 microalgae such as scenedesmus acutus s obliquus s quadricauda chlorella vulgaris c sorokiniana desmodesmus sp pseudokirchneriella subcapitata and desmodesmus sp have been shown to facilitate energy production and wastewater treatment in mfcs table s4 fig 6 25

electroactive such as syntrophus aciditrophicus 180 methanospirillum hungatei 181 and capnocytophaga ochracea 182 significant advancements have been made with a variety of traditional and novel techniques to isolate eams and non eams and to characterize their morphology genetic potential and metabolic capacity including their isolation in pure cultures using selective media physical enhanced methods microscope methods e g transmission electron microscopy tem and scanning electron microscope sem molecular methods e g quantitative pcr amplicon and shotgun sequencing among others 17 55 new strategies are contributing to the characterization of eams such as the characterization and visualization of eams at the single cell level 183 or the use of electrodes as the electron acceptor for isolation purposes 55 184 microbiome studies based on amplicon or shotgun sequencing techniques are also helping infer potential eams and non eams as more is learned about eet mechanisms and potential genes involved in electron transfer 34 185 186 a summary of methods for isolating and understanding the microbial community structure and composition of eams and non eams from mets is provided in table 2 however it remains largely unknown what physiological properties of the individual eams and non eams should be considered to specifically isolate them from mixed culture an aspect that should be explored in future studies once isolated the electroactivity of the potential eams and non eams strains can be tested using different techniques including electrochromic approaches with tungsten oxide wo3 187 electrochemiluminescence 188 colorimetric 189 190 and dielectrophoretic methods 191 see 17 55 for a review and techniques such as voltammetry chronoamperometry electrochemical impedance spectroscopy eis and spectrophotometry see 15 for a review eams and non eams are expected to directly and indirectly interact with each other in mets eams and non eams can communicate with each other within biofilms through quorum sensing qs chemicals e g fatty acyl homoserine lactones and p coumaroyl homoserine lactones and coordinate group behavior 192 qs between p aeruginosa and other eams species can regulate the expression of biofilm related genes 193 194 in other cases interactions between eams and non eams e g geobacter sp shewanella sp pseudomonas sp thermincola sp burkholderia sp desulfovibrio sp klebsiella sp and aeromonas sp promote biofilm formation via cellular accumulation and development of microcolonies via type iv pili and c type cytochrome genes e g omcz and pila and proper cell to cell signaling that mediate the direct electron transfer mechanisms 16 195 196 previous studies have shown that a functional mixed community is needed to achieve good performance of mets regardless of the inoculum source highlighting the need to study not only eams but also non eams in these systems 17 197 200 the growth and survival of microbial species in a complex community such as eams and non eams in mets fed with complex substrates depend on the exchange of metabolic products between microorganisms these synergistic interactions are important to carry out processes such as h2 and ch4 production organic matter oxidation and denitrification among others multiple syntrophic interactions between eams and non eams have been reported in mfcs and a summary of examples of syntrophic metabolism can be found in sieber et al 201 and dolfing 202 for example the anaerobic environment in the anode of an mfc influences the composition of the microbial community towards the presence of fermentative bacteria and exoelectrogenic microorganisms and previous reports have suggested a syntrophic relationship between them in mets 89 chen and smith 101 found that non eams aerobic methanotrophs in the cathode biofilm produce intermediate metabolites e g formate and acetate that serve as substrates for geobacter in the anode biofilm in mfcs non eams fermentative species cannot fully oxidize carbohydrates and they perform fermentation 203 whereas exoelectrogenic bacteria carry out the complete oxidation of non fermentable compounds e g acetate and the transference of the electrons to an electron acceptor 64 synergistic effects between eams e coli and p aeruginosa and non eams such as microalgae c vulgaris have been reported and related to the improved current generation in mfcs 204 the interactions between eams and non eams species in microbial consortia can improve metabolic capabilities by affecting the functionality and stability of the community for example the power generation of an mfc is determined by the efficiency of the anodic community to oxidize organic substrates and transfer electrons to the anode 205 although eams can convert simple molecules into electricity complete and efficient degradation of complex organic substrates requires diverse microbial metabolic activities to break down different molecules e g macromolecules and micromolecules which can only be achieved through the presence of different microbial species including non eams 49 interactions between eams and non eams can improve the degradation of substrate mixtures and contribute to increased energy production 206 207 however excessive proliferation of non eams can result in a reduction in power generation see section 3 therefore a complex balance between eams and non eams is needed in mets to maintain efficient energy production without detrimental impacts on other treatment processes for example acclimatization to a given substrate in mfcs controls the structure and composition of communities on anode biofilms towards microbial consortia containing eams and non eams 19 recent studies have shown that the composition of microbial communities containing eams and non eams changes during the start up of mfcs which was correlated with the production of energy 49 in sucrose fed mfcs changes in the community composition of biofilm and suspended cells were observed with time but power levels remained unchanged suggesting the presence of functional redundancy within electroactive and non electroactive communities 208 understanding the mechanisms that mediate the activity and growth of eams and non eams is expected to provide basic information to optimize the design and operating parameters of mets and help develop more efficient bioelectrochemical systems however the complexity of the microbial community makes it difficult to study eam and non eam community dynamics and the functions that each species plays in energy production and other processes in mets particularly in response to changes in operating conditions understanding of the diversity of eams and non eams in biofilm and planktonic cells is needed to scale up these systems for a broader industrial application of mets however limited information is available about the operational conditions that may lead to the proliferation of excessive non eams in mets which should be explored in future studies in addition whether different non eams may proliferate during the experimental period of mets remains largely unknown genomic analyses can help identify the diversity and functions e g shotgun sequencing of microorganisms that frequently appear in mets 5 conclusions this review provides an overview of the diversity of eams and non eams in mets and their potential interactions the characterization of both groups of microorganisms can be important for increasing current generation preventing and understanding voltage drops and or enhancing other related processes such as h2 and ch4 production in mets this is particularly important when mets are fed with complex substrates because the adaptation to a syntrophic lifestyle requires metabolic changes that might not be apparent in pure cultures therefore the characterization of eams and non eams could be used to further refine existing met technologies and help develop new technologies the following are the supplementary data related to this article supplementary materials and methods image 1 table s1 examples of exoelectrogenic microorganisms within the domain

12709,electroactive microorganisms eams are the core element of microbial electrochemical technologies mets due to their ability to interact with electrodes allowing wiring of current flow and microbial metabolism however eams are not the unique microbes in mets particularly when they are fed with complex substrates non electrochemically active microorganisms non eams often coexist with eams in mets and they can be important not only for electricity generation but also for the treatment of wastewater the production of hydrogen and methane among other processes a systematic review of the diversity of eams and non eams and their potential relationships in mets was conducted in this study the results indicate that eams and non eams are highly diverse and present in all three domains of life bacteria archaea and eukarya therefore microbial ecology studies on the diversity of one of these three microbial groups give only a partial characterization of the electromicrobiology in mets a complex balance between eams and non eams appears to be necessary to maintain efficient energy production without detrimental impacts on other treatment processes in mets knowledge gaps and areas where future research efforts should be prioritized are discussed graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords microbial fuel cell bioelectrochemical system microbial diversity electroactivity microbial metabolism data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction the discovery of the ability of microorganisms to electrically interact with an electrode and produce a current 1 has resulted in the development of different biotechnological applications based on electrochemical reactions derived from microbe electrode interactions 2 microbial electrochemical technologies mets include microbial fuel cells mfcs for electricity production wastewater treatment and toxicity detection microbial electrolysis cells mecs for hydrogen h2 or methane ch4 production and other mets that can be utilized to desalinate water or produce chemical products e g hydrogen peroxide such as microbial desalinization cells mdc and microbial electrosynthesis cells mes respectively fig 1 generally considered mets require an anode and a cathode electrode that are connected through a conductive wire and separated by a membrane for proton exchange pem fig 1 while mfc and mdc do not require an external power supply an electric voltage is applied to mec and mes to trigger electrochemical reactions fig 1 3 4 these mets and their components have been summarized in recent reviews 5 11 however the characterization of the core element of these systems electroactive microorganisms eams still remains a challenging area of research due to the high diversity and complex interactions between the microbial groups involved in current production the lack of accurate molecular tools to identify eams and the still poor understanding of the impact of variations in the design configuration operational parameters and electrode materials of mets on the growth diversity and energy generation of eams 12 13 eams carry out the exchange of electrons between intracellular and extracellular redox active electron donors and acceptors 213 exoelectrogenic microorganisms those that transfer electrons to a solid electrode from the bacteria archaea and eukarya domains can produce current on the anode from the anaerobic oxidation of organic substrates but only prokaryotes members of the domains bacteria and archaea have been reported to function as electrotrophs those that receive electrons from the electrode on the cathode where aerobic conditions exist 14 considerable efforts have been made to characterize eams in mets thanks to the development of numerous microbiological and electrochemical techniques that can be applied to these systems 15 17 studies over the last decade have shown that the characterization of the diversity of eams in mets is important for a improving met performance b preventing failures by monitoring the microbial community c selecting microbial inoculum and bioaugmentation strategies and d providing data for modeling 16 17 therefore a review of the diversity of eams in mets can be important to increase our understanding of their interactions how they can grow develop and communicate in these systems and ultimately how this information can be used to improve energy generation in mets several reports have found that eams are not the unique microorganisms in mets particularly when they are fed with complex substrates e g real effluents as wastewaters marine sediments soil and leachates non electrochemically active microorganisms non eams from all domains of life often coexist with eams in mets and they can be important not only for electricity generation but also for wastewater treatment and h2 and ch4 production among other processes 18 22 non eams can form and co exist in anode biofilms and contribute to minimizing electron transfer to the anode 23 for example the presence of non eams such as methanogens sulfate and nitrate reducers as well as fermentative aerobic and h2 scavenging microorganisms in anodes has been related to decreased power generation in mets if they proliferate excessively 19 21 24 however other non eams such as algae can provide a continuous supply of o2 at cathodes owing to their capability of oxygenic photosynthesis which enhances energy recovery in mets 25 non eam enzyme producing fungi can also increase energy efficiency in cathodes 26 therefore a complex balance between eams and non eams appears to be necessary for mets to maintain efficient energy production without detrimental impacts on other treatment processes to date few studies have tried to explore the diversity and potential relationships between eams and non eams in mets understanding the mechanisms that mediate the activity and growth of eams and non eams and their potential relationships is crucial to optimizing the design and operating parameters of mets and helping develop more efficient bioelectrochemical systems by knowing the diversity of eam and non eam in mets and their potentially more important groups for power production and reduction more accurate strategies can be developed to monitor their growth and communication and understand their relationships with current production when they proliferate or disappear in these systems this review article aims to provide an overview of the diversity of eams and non eams in anodes and cathodes of mets and to synthesize our current understanding of their potential relationships in electroactive biofilms and planktonic cells in particular the diversity of exoelectrogenic microorganisms bacteria archaea and eukaryotes electrotrophic microorganisms bacteria and archaea and non eams methanogenic fermentative sulfate reducing nitrate reducing aerobic h2 scavenging microalgae and fungal microorganisms that have been described and reported in mets is discussed a detailed description of the literature review strategy used in this study is provided in the supplementary materials and methods 2 overview of electroactive microorganisms in mets mets are based on the exchange of electrons between eams and electrodes in a process known as microbial extracellular electron transfer eet during which substrate oxidation anodic or reduction cathodic reactions occur 27 28 exoelectrogenic and electrotrophic microorganisms perform eet using different mechanisms fig 2 that have been summarized in several recent reviews and therefore they are not examined in detail here 13 29 30 these mechanisms include direct interspecies electron transfer diet through physical contact between redox molecules and the solid electrode which can be established via microbial nanowires and mediated electron transfer through diffusive molecules that are reduced oxidized at the cell surface or within the cells fig 2 interactions between electrodes and electrotrophic microorganisms are thought to occur via diet or mediators in cathodes fig 2 13 27 a phylogenetic analysis revealed that exoelectrogenic and electrotrophic microorganisms cluster together fig 3 therefore no correspondence between eet mechanisms and phylogeny was found likely due to similar eet mechanisms having convergently evolved or been obtained through horizontal gene transfer 31 34 in this respect it has been demonstrated that some eams such as g metallireducens and g sulfurreducens can change between functioning as electrogens or electrotrophs which is controlled by variations in environmental conditions 35 36 tables s2 and s3 a phylogenetic analysis revealed that exoelectrogenic and electrotrophic microorganisms cluster together fig 3 therefore no correspondence between eet mechanisms and phylogeny was found likely due to similar eet mechanisms having convergently evolved or been obtained through horizontal gene

by variations in environmental conditions 35 36 tables s2 and s3 microbial eet can occur in microbial biofilms as well as planktonic cells and has been characterized by different microbial and bioelectrochemical techniques both in entire electroactive biofilms and single cells see reviews by 37 38 planktonic microorganisms can perform eet through exogenous e g escherichia coli 39 or endogenous e g pseudomonas sp 40 mediator molecules 41 whereas biofilm forming microorganisms can transfer electrons directly through diet e g shewanella sp 42 or across the biofilm via nanowires e g geobacter sp 43 higher kinetic rates of electron transfer have been detected via diet and nanowires compared to mechanisms relying solely upon redox mediators 44 45 different factors can influence biofilm formation on anode and cathode electrodes of mets such as the material of the electrode and diverse operating conditions e g temperature ph and type of substrate 16 46 for a review an important ecological and biogeochemical distinction among exoelectrogenic microorganisms is their method to generate and consume energy in anodes while respiratory exoelectrogenic microorganisms generate atp through membrane associated electron transport fermentative exoelectrogenic microorganisms primarily conserve energy from substrate level phosphorylation respiratory exoelectrogenic microbes typically show greater rates of eet per mole than fermentative microorganisms as they often have the ability to completely oxidize organic compounds to co2 with an extracellular electron acceptor by contrast fermentative exoelectrogenic microorganisms release electrons onto extracellular electron acceptors generating more oxidized products such as organic acids and alcohols and or less h2 13 in cathodes similar distinctions for electrotrophic microorganisms into respiratory and non respiratory electron consumption are possible 47 48 to date most studies characterizing eams in mets have focused on those in electroactive biofilms but recent observations suggest that some specific eams can be exclusively present in suspended cells and or may require long experimental periods to colonize biofilms 16 28 therefore the study of the diversity of eams in biofilms may give only a partial characterization of all eams in these systems 49 the growth of eams as planktonic cells vs as biofilms is thought to be dependent on the metabolic status of the cell operational conditions and design parameters table 1 and appears to be species specific 23 28 50 52 for example some species of the genus shewanella can coexist in planktonic cells and biofilm in the anode and synergistically produce power 42 53 in contrast species of geobacter require direct electrical contact with the electrode as a biofilm to transfer electrons 54 2 1 exoelectrogenic microorganisms prokaryotic and eukaryotic exoelectrogenic microorganisms have been characterized using different carbon sources and isolation strategies in pure culture experiments and microbial ecology studies 12 13 27 55 bacterial exoelectrogenic species in the proteobacteria firmicutes cyanobacteria deferribacteres and

envelope to external electron donors acceptors have been previously reviewed 28 57 58 the amount of energy that exoelectrogenic microorganisms can produce varies widely and high energy densities are often only achieved after long acclimatization times in the selective environment of mets 12 however direct comparisons of power densities between studies are often not possible due to different experimental conditions and growth requirements of exoelectrogenic microorganisms 12 for example power production varied by 15 with an average of 1 36 0 20 w m2 in 24 incubations carried out in the same laboratory with similar inocula electrolytes and materials 59 likely due to variations in the electrode age biofilm development and or interactions between eams and non eams with time in addition in mets treating different complex substrates it is not possible to distinguish the microbial origin of the current which depends on the diversity of the microbial inocula or substrate fed into the anode different complex substrates can provide a distinct diversity of exoelectrogenic microorganisms table s2 60 61 readers are referred to logan et al 12 for an overview of power densities from

proteobacteria of the gammaproteobacteria and deltaproteobacteria classes are the main groups of exoelectrogenic bacteria described to date table s2 fig 4 this is thought to be due to the presence of

positive bacteria such as tolumonas osonensis have also been reported as exoelectrogenic microorganisms 69 species of the genus nitrosomonas can produce current and simultaneously carry out anoxic autotrophic ammonium oxidation in mecs 75 the production of electricity in mfc anodes by anaerobic ammonium oxidizing anammox bacteria such as candidatus brocadia sp and candidatus scalindua sp has been reported 76 in mecs anammox bacteria also have the ability to oxidize nh4 with the transfer of electrons to electron acceptors such as graphene oxide or electrodes 76 cable bacteria are electroactive multicellular filamentous microbes belonging to the deltaproteobacterial family desulfobulbaceae that can reach 1 cm in length enhancing long range electron transport 77 candidatus electrothrix and candidatus electronema are examples of cable bacteria and they can also electrically couple the oxidation of sulfide in anoxic layers with the reduction of o2 78 exoelectrogenic bacterial species have been found in many extreme environments which opens up exciting opportunities to develop novel mets see 79 for a review for example in pure culture studies current generation by exoelectrogenic bacterial species has been reported at thermophilic temperatures 45 70 c for calditerrivibrio nitroreducens 80 and thermincola ferriacetica 81 other bacteria such as acidiphilum sp 3 2 sup 5 can grow and generate current at the acidic ph of 2 5 82 whereas geoalkalibacter spp 83 and geoglobus ahangari 84 produce electricity under alkaline ph 9 and saline 3 8 nacl conditions recently it has been proposed that low power producing eams microorganisms in mets can be classified as weak exoelectrogens 85 86 to date there is not an agreed definition of weak exoelectrogens but they primarily use soluble electron acceptors 85 although weak exoelectrogens produce a small current no specific power density cut off numbers have been provided that can distinguish strong from weak exoelectrogens due to large variations in energy generation among weak exoelectrogens 85 86 great variability in current production has been observed even among strong exoelectrogens such as geobacter sp and shewanella sp 12 species of pseudomonas thauera and lactobacillus have been reported as weak exoelectrogens in mfcs 85 thauera sp appears to also be important for maintaining anaerobic conditions in mfcs via o2 scavenging 87 micro aeration at the anode has been reported to increase degradation rates of the contaminant p nitrophenol by the weak exoelectrogen pseudomonas monteilii with concomitant electricity production 88 in mfcs treating organic substrates fermentative communities often contain several weak exoelectrogens including enterococcus clostridium and streptococcus 89 although few studies on the potential roles of weak exoelectrogens in mets have been published recent observations suggest they may play critical roles in treatment processes and energy production across all types of met 85 generally considered low power producing bacteria are often in lower relative abundance in biofilms compared to high power producing bacteria 85 86 although competition between exoelectrogenic bacteria exists in biofilms and involves many factors such as substrate temperature ph flow rate anode potential surface and topology 90 91 the predominance of high power producing bacteria is not only based on their ability to produce greater current for example metabolites from the low power producing bacteria pseudomonas putida not only help this microorganism to achieve eet but also help its dominance over other bacteria because these compounds can be toxic and provide a competitive advantage under certain conditions 92 93 other bacteria such as s putrefaciens produce higher current in pure cultures than in mixed culture biofilms that are colonized by other exoelectrogens e g paracoccus sp 94 in other cases prolonged operation times in mets or repeated cultures have been shown to favor the proliferation of high power over low power producing strains such as rhodopseudomonas palustris g sulfurreducens 95 and e coli 96 but it is unknown if they can maintain such high electroactive activity over time 2 1 2 exoelectrogenic archaea few archaeal species have been characterized as exoelectrogenic microorganisms with power densities in the range of 46 to 225 mw m2 for species such as haloferax volcanii natrialba magadii and pyrococcus furiosus 12 in pure cultures ferroglobus placidus geoglobus ahangari 97 and p furiosus 98 that are able

example klebsiella pneumoniae reduces and precipitates particles of manganese 108 whereas g sulfurreducens and s oneidensis perform an analogous process with particles of pure palladium 109 other electrotrophic bacteria such as g metallireducens and alcaligenes faecalis can convert nitrate to nitrite 110 whereas desulfopila sp 111 and desulfovibrio sp 112 can reduce sulfate although many

bacteria is a useful application of mecs hydrogen producing biofilms are often predominantly colonized by desulfovibrio sp 115 and g sulfurreducens 116 but other bacteria such as rhodobacter sphaeroides can also produce h2 on the cathode of mecs 117 in mess fig 1 electrotrophic bacteria use electrons from the oxidation of organic compounds in the anode to reduce co2 to multi carbon organic molecules e g alcohols and acids of industrial interest for the generation of feedstocks and biofuels 118 for example acetogenic bacteria e g sporomusa sp and clostridium sp can reduce co2 to acetate in mess by accepting electrons from cathodes 223 224 however the current densities were relatively low 10 ma m 2 and the cathodic coulombic efficiencies that is consumed electrons present in products were highly variable 30 90 electromicrobial conversion of co2 to alcohol by ralstonia eutropha in an mes using co2 as the sole carbon source and electricity as the sole energy input has been reported 119 this process opens up the possibility of electricity driven bioconversion of co2 to commercial chemicals in mes using specific electrotrophic bacteria 2 2 2 electrotrophic archaea

electroactive species of geobacter however the proliferation of excessive fermentative microorganisms can result in the accumulation of acetate and a reduction in current production in general fermentative microorganisms have higher growth yields than exoelectrogens and their high yield can make biomass a significant electron sink thus reducing current production in anodes in the range of 26 60 21 132 134 for example increases in the concentration of acetate in the early stages of mfcs often indicate that the fermentative population has transformed all fermentable substrates into short chain fatty acids for respiration the implementation of a pre fermentation step before feeding mfcs can be used to increase the concentration of substrates for the respiratory population thus preventing the proliferation of excessive fermentative microorganisms in the anode 135 in addition a reduction in the proliferation of fermentative microorganims in anode biofilms due to a decrease in fermentable substrates has been reported 89 3 2 linking energy production and reduction and sulfate reducing microorganisms in mets natural redox compounds such as sulfur sulfide can be present in complex substrates feeding mets and impact electricity generation 132 although the presence of sulfate reducing bacteria can improve treatment processes and energy production in mfcs 136 the proliferation of sulfate reducing bacteria in anodes can result in the use of excessive electron donors organic compounds for their growth thereby reducing power yields in the range of 10 30 in mfcs due to competition for electron donors with eams and h2 production in mecs 132 137 139 under anaerobic conditions in the anode sulfate reducing bacteria mainly utilize sulfate as the terminal electron acceptor during the oxidation of h2 and other organic substances in mfcs and mecs 93 140 however the sulfide generated by sulfate reducing bacteria can be oxidized by electrodes and or sulfite

microorganisms of the domain archaea and the main microorganisms that compete with eams for utilizing different sources of nutrients electron donors and reducing equivalents e g co2 formic acid or methylamines in the anaerobic environment of the anode 147 the presence of methanogenic microorganisms has been related to decreased current production in the range of 7 45 in mfcs as they can be a

methanobrevibacter sp and m maripaludis have been detected in the anode of mets table s4 fig 6 37 121 124 134 150 151 for example patil et al 37 found that an enrichment strategy with several mixtures of anodic effluent methanogens increases the relative abundance of methanogens belonging to methanosaeta and methanobacterium in anodes and cathodes after two months of reactor operation methanogens

methanosaeta and methanobacterium in anodes and cathodes after two months of reactor operation different methods have been studied to prevent the growth of excessive methanogens in biofilms and planktonic cells in anodes see 152 for a review for example adjusting the substrate loading can effectively result in reducing the number of methanogens 153 and periodic aeration can also suppress methanogenic growth 24 it has been demonstrated that a combination of high electrode surface area together with reduced substrate loading can promote the growth of eams while reducing the presence of methanogens and maintaining electricity generation in mfcs 148 152 the growth of methanogens can also be inhibited using chemical inhibitors such as 2 bromoethane sulfonate sodium 2 bromoethanesulfonic acid and iodopropane 21 37 152 the inoculum can be pretreated with several cycles of heat and acids to reduce the number of methanogens 154 however the use of chemical inhibitors to inhibit methanogens is not recommended for mfcs fed with wastewater treatment as the continuous supply of the inhibitors can make this process expensive and energy consuming 152 as discussed earlier see section 2 2 2 it is important to note that the above mentioned methanogens are important for ch4 and h2 production in the cathode of mecs where they can directly convert current to these products via electromethanogenesis 121 155 3 4 linking energy reduction and h2 scavenging microorganisms in mets mecs use exoelectrogenic microorganisms as anode catalysts for oxidizing reduced forms of compounds e g acetate 14 however treatment of complex organic compounds present in effluents such as urban wastewater requires syntrophic interactions between eams with fermentative bacteria to efficiently degrade complex organics into simple forms 133 the growth of h2 utilizing methanogens as an h2 scavenger is fundamental for exoelectrogenic microorganisms to utilize acetate from fermentable substrates however h2 generated from fermentation in anodes is an ideal substrate for h2 scavenging microorganisms which outcompetes direct h2 consumption by exoelectrogenic microorganisms thereby reducing power and h2 yields in mecs 134 156 a complex balance between exoelectrogenic microorganisms fermenters and h2 scavenging microorganisms is needed in mecs which if optimized properly can increase current generation 156 h2 scavenging microorganisms hydrogenotrophic methanogens and or homoacetogenic bacteria have been found in the anode biofilm of mecs table s4 fig 6 21 134

fungal species such as phanerochaete chrysosporium galactomyces reessii trametes versicolor and ganoderma lucidum have been characterized for their ability to produce ligninolytic enzymes and their presence and or inoculation in cathodes has been related to improved power generation efficiency table s4 fig 6 12 26 for example fernández de dios et al 172 found that bacterial fungal interactions enhance power generation and the remediation of harmful toxicants in mfcs however little is known about the diversity and function of non eam fungi in anodes although they are thought to be involved in organic matter degradation 12 26 3 8 linking energy production and reduction and microalgae in mets microalgae improve energy efficiency power generation and wastewater treatment in mfcs 25 173 microalgae biomass can serve as a substrate for exoelectrogenic microorganisms in anodes of mfcs and it can be used as electron donors in the anode and electron acceptors in the cathode 174 176 conventional mfcs need continuous aeration in the cathode for the supply of o2 but microalgae can provide o2 at the cathode thanks to their ability to perform oxygenic photosynthesis using co2 from the anode 177 microalgae cells directly accept electrons flowing from the anode to the cathode via mediators during the bioconversion of co2 to carbohydrates and o2 25 alternatively o2 produced via algae photosynthesis at the cathode can be used as the sole terminal electron acceptor 178 recent studies suggest that microalgae metabolism is affected by changes in temperature ph light and other operational parameters which need to be optimized to achieve optimal current generation with simultaneous nutrient removal in mfcs 25 microalgae such as scenedesmus acutus s obliquus s quadricauda chlorella vulgaris c sorokiniana desmodesmus sp pseudokirchneriella subcapitata and desmodesmus sp have been shown to facilitate energy production and wastewater treatment in mfcs table s4 fig 6 25 for example mixed algal cultures can provide power densities in the range of 0 19 to 459 mw m2 see 25 for a review among different microalgae strains c vulgaris is widely used in the cathode of mfcs because of its high photosynthetic efficiency to fix co2 and to produce oxygen in addition c vulgaris contains a high amount of fatty acids from which biodiesel can be derived as secondary fuel 179

revealed that eams and non eams cluster together fig 6 supplementary tables s1 s2 and s3 to date no conserved functional genes exist to distinguish between eams and non eams as they are phylogenetically diverse microorganisms and the identification of potential marker genes remains a challenging area of research 12 13 27 although new eams continue to be identified non eams that were

methods microscope methods e g transmission electron microscopy tem and scanning electron microscope sem molecular methods e g quantitative pcr amplicon and shotgun sequencing among others 17 55 new strategies are contributing to the characterization of eams such as the characterization and visualization of eams at the single cell level 183 or the use of electrodes as the electron acceptor for isolation purposes 55 184 microbiome studies based on amplicon or shotgun sequencing techniques are also helping infer potential eams and non eams as more is learned about eet mechanisms and potential genes involved in electron transfer 34 185 186 a summary of methods for isolating and understanding the microbial community structure and composition of eams and non eams from mets is provided in table 2 however it remains largely unknown what physiological properties of the individual eams and non eams should be considered to specifically isolate them from mixed culture an aspect that should be explored in future studies once isolated the electroactivity of the potential eams and non eams strains can be tested using different techniques including electrochromic approaches with tungsten oxide wo3 187 electrochemiluminescence 188 colorimetric 189 190 and dielectrophoretic methods 191 see 17 55 for a review and techniques such as voltammetry chronoamperometry electrochemical impedance spectroscopy eis and spectrophotometry see 15 for a review eams and non eams are expected to directly and indirectly interact with each other in mets eams and non eams can communicate with each other within biofilms through quorum sensing qs chemicals e g fatty acyl homoserine lactones and p coumaroyl homoserine lactones and coordinate group behavior 192 qs between p aeruginosa and other eams species can regulate the expression of biofilm related genes 193 194 in other cases interactions between eams and non eams e g geobacter sp shewanella sp pseudomonas sp thermincola sp burkholderia sp desulfovibrio sp klebsiella sp and aeromonas sp promote biofilm formation via cellular accumulation and development of microcolonies via type iv pili and c type cytochrome genes e g omcz and pila and proper cell to cell signaling that mediate the direct electron transfer mechanisms 16 195 196 previous studies have shown that a functional mixed community is needed to achieve good performance of mets regardless of the inoculum source highlighting the need to study not only eams but also non eams in these systems 17 197 200 the growth and survival of microbial species in a complex community such as eams and non eams in mets fed with complex substrates depend on the exchange of metabolic products between microorganisms these synergistic interactions are important to carry out processes such as h2 and ch4 production organic matter oxidation and denitrification among others multiple syntrophic interactions between eams and non eams have been reported in mfcs and a summary of examples of syntrophic metabolism can be found in sieber et al 201 and dolfing 202 for example the anaerobic environment in the anode of an mfc influences the composition of the microbial community towards the presence of fermentative bacteria and exoelectrogenic microorganisms and previous reports have suggested a syntrophic relationship between them in mets 89 chen and smith 101 found that non eams aerobic methanotrophs in the cathode biofilm produce intermediate metabolites e g formate and acetate that serve as substrates for geobacter in the anode biofilm in mfcs non eams fermentative species cannot fully oxidize carbohydrates and they perform fermentation 203 whereas exoelectrogenic bacteria carry out the complete oxidation of non fermentable compounds e g acetate and the transference of the electrons to an electron acceptor 64 synergistic effects between eams e coli and p aeruginosa and non eams such as microalgae c vulgaris have been reported and related to the improved current generation in mfcs 204 the interactions between eams and non eams species in microbial consortia can improve metabolic capabilities by affecting the functionality and stability of the community for example the power generation of an mfc is determined by the efficiency of the anodic community to oxidize organic substrates and transfer electrons to the anode 205 although eams can convert simple molecules into electricity complete and efficient degradation of complex organic substrates requires diverse microbial metabolic activities to break down different molecules e g macromolecules and micromolecules which can only be achieved through the presence of different microbial species including non eams 49 interactions between eams and non eams can improve the degradation of substrate mixtures and contribute to increased energy production 206 207 however excessive proliferation of non eams can result in a reduction in power generation see section 3 therefore a complex balance between eams and non eams is needed in mets to maintain efficient energy production without detrimental impacts on other treatment processes for example acclimatization to a given substrate in mfcs controls the structure and composition of communities on anode biofilms towards microbial consortia containing eams and non eams 19 recent studies have shown that the composition of microbial communities containing eams and non eams changes during the start up of mfcs which was correlated with the production of energy 49 in sucrose fed mfcs changes in the community composition of biofilm and suspended cells were observed with time but power levels remained unchanged suggesting the presence of functional redundancy within electroactive and non electroactive communities 208 understanding the mechanisms that mediate the activity and growth of eams and non eams is expected to provide basic information to optimize the design and operating parameters of mets and help develop more efficient bioelectrochemical systems however the complexity of the microbial community makes it difficult to study eam and non eam community dynamics and the functions that each species plays in energy production and other processes in mets particularly in response to changes in operating conditions understanding of the diversity of eams and non eams in biofilm and planktonic cells is needed to scale up these systems for a broader industrial application of mets however limited information is available about the operational conditions that may lead to the proliferation of excessive non eams in mets which should be explored in future studies in addition whether different non eams may proliferate during the experimental period of mets remains largely unknown genomic analyses can help identify the diversity and functions e g shotgun sequencing of microorganisms that frequently appear in mets 5 conclusions this review provides an overview of the diversity of eams and non eams in mets and their potential interactions the characterization of both groups of microorganisms can be important for increasing current generation preventing and understanding voltage drops and or enhancing other related processes such as h2 and ch4 production in mets this is particularly important when mets are fed with complex substrates because the adaptation to a syntrophic lifestyle requires metabolic changes that might not be apparent in pure cultures therefore the characterization of eams and non eams could be used to further refine existing met technologies and help develop new technologies the following are the supplementary data related to this article supplementary materials and methods image 1 table s1 examples of exoelectrogenic microorganisms within the domain
