14710,in sewer systems where anaerobic conditions are present sulfate reducing bacteria reduce sulfate to hydrogen sulfide h2s leading to sewer corrosion and odor emission various sulfide corrosion control strategies have been proposed demonstrated and optimized in the past decades these included 1 chemical addition to sewage to reduce sulfide formation to remove dissolved sulfide after its formation or to reduce h2s emission from sewage to sewer air 2 ventilation to reduce the h2s and humidity levels in sewer air and 3 amendments of pipe materials surfaces to retard corrosion this work aims to comprehensively review both the commonly used sulfide control measures and the emerging technologies and to shed light on their underlying mechanisms the optimal use of the above stated strategies is also analyzed and discussed in depth the key knowledge gaps and major challenges associated with these control strategies are identified and strategies dealing with these gaps and challenges are recommended finally we emphasize a holistic approach to sulfide control by managing sewer networks as an integral part of an urban water system graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords sewer odor and corrosion sulfate reducing bacteria sulfide oxidizing bacteria free nitrous acid electrochemical system online control of chemical dosing data availability no data was used for the research described in the article 1 introduction under anaerobic environments sulfate reducing bacteria srb reduce sulfate to sulfide in sewers which is present in the forms of h2s hs and s2 collectively called dissolved sulfide or sulfide in sewage sulfide could accumulate to high levels in sewers particularly in networks with a long transport time when transferred to sewer air hydrogen sulfide causes sewer corrosion via oxidation to sulfuric acid at the inner surface of concrete pipes odor nuisance and health hazards when emitted to the surrounding environments for instance concrete corrosion occurs at a dissolved sulfide concentration of 0 1 0 5 mg s l severe concrete corrosion occurs at a dissolved sulfide level of 2 mg s l or above hvitved jacobsen et al 2002 with a corrosion rate ranging from 1 1 to 10 mm year zhang et al 2008 sulfide induced sewer corrosion is a common cause of sewer deterioration around the world pikaar et al 2014 and results in a huge loss in sewer assets for instance the annual loss of sewer assets caused by concrete corrosion in the usa was estimated to be around us 14 billion brongers et al 2002 the estimated annual loss of sewer infrastructure assets due to sulfide induced corrosion was in the order of us 100 million in australia gutierrez et al 2016 and 4 5 million in belgium romanova et al 2014 accordingly it is imperative to control sulfide in sewers various chemical and biological technologies have been developed which can be primarily categorized into two groups based on the control mechanisms prevention inhibition of sulfide generation and reduction of sulfide release from sewage to sewer air the former is principally achieved by adding inhibitors or biocides e g caustic free nitrous acid fna to sewage to inactivate srb jiang et al 2011b gutierrez et al 2014 the latter is mainly based on the addition of oxidants e g oxygen and nitrate to oxidize sulfide usepa 1991 gutierrez et al 2008 jiang et al 2013b precipitants i e iron salts to convert sulfide into insoluble metal sulfides nielsen et al 2005b gutierrez et al 2010a zhang et al 2016 or alkali i e sodium hydroxide and magnesium hydroxide mg oh 2 to reduce the h2s fraction of dissolved sulfide and hence reduce the transfer of sulfide to sewer air gutierrez et al 2009 gutierrez et al 2014 alternative strategies include sewer ventilation to reduce the h2s and humidity levels in sewer air jiang et al 2015a and amendments of concrete materials or pipe surfaces to enhance pipe resistance to corrosion grengg et al 2018 wang et al 2020 due to the complexity of sewer systems different sewers may have different sulfide producing patterns and capacities the corrosion mitigation strategies need to be carefully selected taking into account the sewage characteristics configuration of the sewer network and in fact the requirements of the downstream wastewater treatment plants as well as such a comprehensive understanding of sulfide production and sewer corrosion control mechanisms is necessary for control strategy selection and optimization the most recent critical review of sulfide mitigation in sewer systems was published in 2008 zhang et al 2008 where the authors summarized and discussed the most commonly used sulfide control strategies since then a considerable amount of research work has been undertaken which not only substantially improved our understanding of the mechanisms of the conventional sulfide control measures but also delivered new technologies based on very different mechanisms this review is conducted to critically discuss these latest advances in knowledge and developments of new technologies based on the systematic review of the sulfide control measures and the underlying mechanisms we propose guidelines for selecting and applying suitable control strategies for specific cases in practice the key knowledge gaps and challenges are also discussed to provide perspectives for further development of sulfide and sewer corrosion control strategies 2 mechanisms underlying in sewer h2s production and sewer corrosion 2 1 sulfide production in sewers sewage generally contains 40 200 mg l of sulfate paing et al 2000 more than half of which in many cases is attributed to the use of aluminum sulfate as a coagulant during drinking water production pikaar et al 2014 in some cases sewage contains a high concentration of sulfate owing to seawater infiltration or seawater toilet flushing and sulfate concentration could reach up to 600 1000 mg l liang et al 2019b in the presence of abundant organics and sulfate sulfate reduction occurs in anaerobic areas of sewer biofilm growing on the inner surfaces of sewer wall jiang et al 2009a of note sewer biofilms are often present in rising mains while sediments are present in partially filled gravity sewers re aeration can occur since sewer sediments are biologically active sulfide is generated in the anaerobic fraction of sewer sediments schmitt and seyfried 1992 methanogenic archaea ma coexist with srb in sewer biofilms sediments fig 1 sun et al 2014a sulfide formation in sewers is influenced by many factors for the biological aspect the srb activity and growth are stimulated in the presence of sufficient electron donors and acceptors i e biodegradable organics sulfate as well as other favorable environmental factors e g low dissolved oxygen do neutral ph suitable temperature 25 35 c a low sewage flow velocity equivalent to a long hydraulic retention time hrt and weak turbulence create a favorable environment for sulfate reducing activity park et al 2014 the ratio of biofilm sediment surface to wastewater volume a v is also a critical parameter a high a v ratio generally indicates a more significant biofilm contribution to sulfide production hvitved jacobsen et al 2013 for the chemical aspect the presence of oxidants e g do nitrate can reduce sulfide concentration in sewage mainly via sulfide oxidation metals e g ferrous zinc copper manganese present in sewage immobilize sulfide and reduce h2s emission via forming metal sulfide precipitates in addition h2s and hs are the two main sulfide species in sewage under neutral ph yongsiri et al 2003 only molecular h2s can cross the air water interface to sewer air an increase in ph shifts the equilibrium to the ionized form of sulfide hs 2 2 sulfide induced sewer corrosion concrete is the most prevalent material utilized in sewers especially for large sewer pipes attributed to its good strength durability and relatively low cost vahidi et al 2016 grengg et al 2018 however corrosion of concrete pipes and the associated infrastructures e g manholes and pumping stations caused by the biogenic sulfuric acid derived from the oxidation of gaseous h2s has been widely recognized as a critical deterioration process fig 1 the abiotic and biotic corrosion processes involved in the sulfide induced concrete corrosion can be categorized into three stages i the acidification of carbonation co2 and h2s decreases the ph on the surface of cement from 13 to 9 9 5 satoh et al 2009 joseph et al 2012 ii the colonized sob i e neutrophilic sob oxidize sulfide and other sulfur species e g elemental sulfur and thiosulfate to sulfuric acid under moist conditions accompanying with a further decrease of the concrete surface ph to 2 4 eq 1 roberts et al 2002 iii the acidophilic sob e g acidithiobacillus predominate in the corrosion biofilms at such an extremely acidic environment and produce sulfuric acid via sulfide oxidation which subsequently reacts with alkaline cement materials while producing expansive sulfate salts e g gypsum eqs 2 4 and ettringite eq 5 thereby leading to structural destabilization and cracking formation and finally collapse of the concretes li et al 2017 1 h 2 s 2 o 2 h 2 s o 4 2 h 2 s o 4 cac o 3 cas o 4 h 2 c o 3 3 h 2 s o 4 ca oh 2 cas o 4 2 h 2 o 4 h 2 s o 4 cao si o 2 2 h 2 o

stations and can be influenced by h2s co2 relative humidity rh and temperature okabe et al 2007 vollertsen et al 2008 satoh et al 2009 jiang et al 2015b h2s is a principal contributor the h2s concentration in sewer air not only influences the initiation time of corrosion of fresh concrete sewers jiang et al 2015b li et al 2019b but also positively impacts the corrosion biofilm activity especially sob activity nielsen et al 2005a as stated above sob has a substantial effect on the concrete corrosion jiang et al 2014a although co2 was assumed to contribute to the initial concrete acidification in sewers the acidification is mainly attributed to h2s dissolution rather than carbonation co2 joseph et al 2012 sulfide oxidation rate both chemically and biologically positively correlates with gas temperature nielsen et al 2006 sun et al 2015b humidity provides moisture to the walls of sewers via vapor condensation rh in sewer air typically varies between 60 and 100 and a high rh shortens the initial time of corrosion and enhances the corrosion process jiang et al 2014a jiang et al 2015b rh only has substantial effects on the corrosion process in the region further away from wastewater level i e crown region as the tidal region is frequently inundated by sewage ensuring the saturated water content fig 1 frequent sewage flushing in the tidal region and occasional flooding also provide the inoculum and essential medium for microbial colonization li et al 2017 thus tidal regions are subject to more severe corrosion than crown regions jiang et al 2014a song et al 2019a apart from concrete corrosion the gaseous h2s in sewers also corrodes reinforcing steel bar rebar that is embedded in concrete pipes with diameters larger than 0 6 m joshi 2015 however not much attention has been paid to rebar corrosion in sewers until a recent laboratory chamber study song et al 2019b and a pilot sewer study song et al 2020 were conducted at the initiation of rebar corrosion oxygen plays a significant role in the corrosion process while gaseous h2s exerts minor effects forming multiple iron oxides eqs 6 and 7 as the corrosion developed the rebar surface starts to be acidified due to the accumulation of h2s with iron sulfide being the corrosion product eq 8 with the exacerbation of concrete corrosion the rust layers containing iron oxides oxyhydroxides and iron sulfides could dissolve eqs 9 11 the dissolution diffusion and deposition of fe from the rebar rusts towards the corroded concrete layer could facilitate the micro cracking of the concrete corrosion front to better understand the mechanism of sulfide induced concrete and rebar corrosion in sewers conceptual models focusing on the physicochemical conditions within the corrosion layer ph mineral compositions and distributions together with the chemical and biological corrosion reactions have been proposed jiang et al 2014b song et al 2019b song et al 2020 it was suggested that the ph profile along the depth from the exposed surface could be responsible for the distribution of various concrete corrosion products i e iron oxides iron oxyhydroxides iron sulfides iron chlorides and iron sulfate and the micro cracking caused by the expansion of corrosion products overall rebar corrosion is accelerated by the acidic concrete corrosion layer which in turn would stimulate the concrete cracking at both macro and micro levels 6 4 fe 3 o 2 2 f e 2 o 3 7 3 fe 2 o 2 f e 3 o 4 8 fe h 2 s fes h 2 9 f e 2 o 3 6 h 2 f e 3 3 h 2 o 10 f e 3 o 4 8 h 2 f e 3 f e 2 4 h 2 o 11 fes 2 h f e 2 h 2 s additionally in the past 10 years many attempts have been made to establish corrosion models to predict sewer corrosion rates including the bilinear observation based model jiang et al 2014a wells and melchers 2015 artificial neural network models jiang et al 2016 and hybrid gaussian processes regression gpr model liu et al 2017 most of them showed the high correlations between corrosion rates and the levels of h2s in the sewer air however the ability of these models for prediction in a broad range of environmental conditions remains to be fully verified 3 advanced knowledge of conventional sulfide mitigation measures mitigation of sulfide emission in sewers is often conducted via dosing chemicals the conventional measures include air oxygen injection addition of nitrate salts iron salts and or alkali the effectiveness underlying mechanisms potential issues and corresponding solutions of these control strategies are discussed in this section it should be noted that strong oxidants such as hydrogen peroxide h2o2 chlorine and potassium permanganate kmno4 were also used for sulfide control in sewers waltrip and snyder 1985 usepa 1991 tomar and abdullah 1994 zhang et al 2008 however owing to the high operational costs and or undesirable control effectiveness zhang et al 2008 these strategies are now rarely employed in practice thus they are not discussed in this review 3 1 injection of air or pure oxygen oxygen is an accessible oxidant for sulfide oxidation in the case of air injection 0 2 1 mg l of do was reported in the terminal point of sewers tanaka and takenaka 1995 ochi et al 1998 however the occurrence of sulfide in sewage can be avoided only when do is above 0 5 mg l talaiekhozani et al 2016 thus undesirable sulfide control effectiveness was often reported due to the limited oxygen solubility zhang et al 2008 this strategy is mainly utilized in rising mains rather than gravity sewers and pressurized air is required to increase do concentration in sewage alternatively pure oxygen is used which would deliver an oxygen concentration five fold that of air under the same pressure zhang et al 2008 in pressure mains the solubility of pure oxygen can reach up to 40 50 mg l hvitved jacobsen et al 2013 thus dosing oxygen during the pumping period in rising mains could achieve better sulfide removal than air injection gutierrez et al 2008 although oxygen can inhibit srb activity it does not have any long lasting or irreversible inhibitory effects on srb resulting in sulfur rebound occurring immediately after oxygen depletion gutierrez et al 2008 it may be attributed to the high oxygen uptake rate of biofilms limiting the penetration of oxygen to the deep layers of sewer biofilms as a result srb keep active in the anaerobic inner layer of sewer biofilms and continuously produce sulfide even when dissolved oxygen is present in the bulk liquid gutierrez et al 2008 as reported by gutierrez et al 2008 when the bulk oxygen concentration in the laboratory scale rising mains increased from 3 1 to 6 5 mg o2 l the average sulfide production rate of the sewer biofilm only decreased from 54 4 to 39 9 mg s m2 h complete oxygen penetration can be achieved only when the organics e g volatile fatty acids is depleted oxygen injection also favors the growth of aerobic heterotrophs in biofilm which in return increases the oxygen uptake rate by sewer biofilms for instance gutierrez et al 2008 observed in the laboratory scale rising mains that repeated oxygen exposure in a time period of 120 days increased oxygen uptake rates to an average of 50 8 mg o2 l h from 11 5 mg o2 l h on average at the period of pre oxygen injection rathnayake et al 2019 and rathnayake et al 2021 reported that ferrous could serve as a catalyst to selectively oxidize sulfide with oxygen batch experiment results showed that addition of a small amount of ferrous salts 20 stoichiometric requirement to precipitate sulfide could improve the sulfide control effectiveness of oxygen injection in sewers and reduce oxygen consumption rathnayake et al 2019 as such for pipes with a long hrt e g 1 h oxygen injection at pumping stations is often less effective for such pipes it is more effective to inject oxygen at locations close to the end of a rising main or the target point a sufficient hrt should be allowed between the injection location and the ring main end or the target point to allow complete oxidation of sulfide produced in the upstream pipe section also a sufficient amount of oxygen should be injected to maintain oxic conditions between the injection location and the rising main end or the target point gutierrez et al 2008 to avoid sulfide rebound following depletion of oxygen multiple injection locations may be required in large sewer networks hvitved jacobsen et al 2013 considering the relatively short transport distance of oxygen following its injection 3 2 nitrate salt addition nitrate salts e g nano3 ca no3 2 fe no3 3 are commonly used for sulfide control in sewers bentzen et al 1995 jiang et al 2013b auguet et al 2015 in the presence of nitrate sulfide oxidizing nitrate reducing bacteria oxidize sulfide to elemental sulfur or sulfate eqs 12 and 13 liang et al 2016 heterotrophic nitrate reducing bacteria hnrb communities may also outcompete srb for organic matter resulting in the exclusion of srb jiang et al 2013b considering the higher aqueous solubility than oxygen nitrate with appropriate dosage could achieve effective sulfide control over a longer distance compared to oxygen for example previous studies demonstrated that dosing nitrate salt at a concentration of 10 to 40 mg n l has been observed to efficiently suppress sulfide concentration to 0 2 3 0 mg s l yang et al 2005 saracevic et al 2007 mohanakrishnan et al 2009 12 5 s 2 2 n o 3 12 h 5 s 0 n 2 6 h 2 o 13 5 s 0 6 n o 3 2 h 2 o 5 s o 4 2 3 n 2 4 h sulfide rebounds immediately after nitrate depletion constituting a main drawback of this strategy liang et al 2016 compared to the case where no nitrate dosing was employed sulfide production was even greater between the dosing events in the case of intermittent dosing liang et al 2016 this is because elemental sulfur generated during sulfide oxidation accumulated in the sewer biofilm and was then bio reduced back to sulfide jiang et al 2009b auguet et al 2015 of note although the aqueous solubility of elemental sulfur is low 5 μg l at 25 c it can react with the biogenic sulfide to generate polysulfide which in return improves the bioaccessibility of sulfur thereby accelerating sulfur reduction liang et al 2016 zhang et al 2021 as in the case of oxygen injection downstream nitrate dosage dnd namely dosing nitrate at a point close to the end of the sewer or close to the point of sulfide control is an optimal nitrate dosing strategy for minimizing sulfide concentration at the discharging point of a rising main gutierrez et al 2010b auguet et al 2015 although sulfide can be produced in the upstream sections of a sewer pipe not receiving nitrate dosing the produced sulfide can be efficiently oxidized in the downstream sections where nitrate becomes available the nitrate dosing rate is critical to avoid sulfide rebound following its dosage nitrate should persist in the remaining section of the pipe to prevent anaerobic condition from forming in addition to efficient sulfide control the dnd strategy could reduce methane production presumably via outcompeting methanogens in the use of organic carbon jiang et al 2013b of note when the dnd strategy is employed in a partially filled gravity sewer the sulfide produced in the upstream could cause concrete corrosion which needs to be paid attention nitrate stimulates the growth of hnrb in sewer biofilm resulting in nitrate consumption not coupled to sulfide oxidation this process increases the nitrate demand for sulfide control liang et al 2019b it should be noted that the residual nitrate in sewage would increase the nitrogen loading of the downstream wastewater treatment plants wwtps 3 3 iron salt addition different iron salts feso4 fecl2 fecl3 fe no3 3 fe2 so4 3 have been utilized to control sulfide in sewers ferric ion fe3 chemically oxidizes sulfide to elemental sulfur with itself being reduced to fe2 which can subsequently precipitate sulfide as fes precipitates eqs 14 and 15 firer et al 2008 in light of the high effectiveness approximately 66 of the total sewage receiving chemical dosing was treated by iron salts in australia ganigue et al 2011 fe3 has inhibitory effects on sulfate reducing and methanogenic activities of sewer biofilms zhang et al 2009 however the inhibitory effects were limited in sewer sediments cao et al 2019 14 f e 2 h s fe s s h 15 2 f e 3 h s 2 f e 2 s s 0 h a low sewage ph significantly increases the fe demand which results in high operational costs ganigue et al 2011 jiang et al 2011a this is because ph has a substantial influence on sulfide precipitation reaction and such a reaction is negatively influenced by lower ph especially around the sewage ph levels e g 6 8 firer et al 2008 nielsen et al 2008a for example firer et al 2008 reported that the fe2 to s2 molar ratio was 3 5 fold higher to achieve sulfide concentration of 0 1 mg s l when the ph decreased from 8 1 to 6 5 in practice owing to the presence of other anions in sewage such as co3 2 nitrilotriacetate and ethylenediaminetetraacetate iliuta and larachi 2003 nielsen et al 2005b iron salts need to be provided in excess to meet the demand by these competing anions as recommended by firer et al 2008 a minimal molar ratio of fe s 1 3 1 for ferrous salts fe s 0 9 1 for ferric salts or a mixture of both salts at a ratio of fe3 fe2 2 1 is required to reduce sulfide to 0 1 mg s l at ph around 7 0 the iron rich sludge generated in the drinking water production process dwpp could be a cheap alternative source of iron for sulfide control in sewers as iron salts are widely used in dwpp as coagulants pikaar et al 2014 sun et al 2015a demonstrated that such iron rich sludge mainly fe3 significantly reduced sulfide concentration from 15 5 to 19 8 mg s l to 0 7 2 3 mg s l in a laboratory scale rising main sewer at a sludge dosing rate giving an fe to s molar ratio of 1 1 the volume ratio of sludge to wastewater was 0 26 this strategy also reduced methane generation by 20 which was attributed to a loss in soluble organics via iron sludge adsorption the iron salt addition in sewage benefits not only corrosion control but also wastewater treatment in the downstream wwtp the formed fes precipitates in the sewage enhance the phosphate precipitation in the wwtps via forming insoluble iron phosphate hydroxide complexes gutierrez et al 2010a rebosura et al 2018 2020 in the anaerobic sludge digester iron in the iron phosphate hydroxide complexes becomes available for sulfide control thus reducing h2s in biogas ge et al 2013 these results were later confirmed in two field studies salehin et al 2019 kulandaivelu et al 2020 as shown in fig 2 an integrated iron cycle could be beneficial for sustainable water and wastewater management in an urban water system which implies that an urban water system should be managed holistically to maximize its performance 3 4 alkali addition alkali increases sewage ph which reduces the fraction of h2s molecules in wastewater and in turn decreases h2s release to the sewer air mg oh 2 and caustic soda naoh are the two types of alkali used in sewer applications gutierrez et al 2009 2014 mg oh 2 is a weak base and is safe to handle and store due to the limited water solubility of mg oh 2 0 009 g l 18 c it can only increase sewage ph to a maximum level of around 9 0 typically 8 5 9 0 its self buffering feature allows a sewer to be loaded with residual or unreacted mg oh 2 which extends the effectiveness of mg oh 2 in sulfide mitigation to areas far down from the dosing point gutierrez et al 2009 this is because the residual mg oh 2 dissolves when the sewage ph becomes lower than 9 0 due to the on going re acidification ph elevation to 8 5 9 0 has been found to reduce the srb activity in sewer biofilm by 25 50 gutierrez et al 2009 an even stronger inhibitory effect on the ma activity was observed it is attributed to the fact that an increase in free ammonia fa concentration sharma et al 2014 with elevated sewage ph could disrupt cell homeostasis after fa pass through the cellular membrane gutierrez et al 2009 in a laboratory sewer reactor operated at ph 8 5 9 0 no ma activity was observed during its 6 month operation in contrast to the reactor operated at a neutral ph gutierrez et al 2009 considering these inhibitory effects mg oh 2 should be dosed upstream to simultaneously benefit from its abilities to reduce h2s production and liquid air transfer different from mg oh 2 which is typically dosed continuously naoh dosed intermittently to cause periodic ph shocks above 10 0 for a short period hours gutierrez et al 2009 o gorman et al 2011 gutierrez et al 2014 in a laboratory study sewer biofilms were exposed to ph 10 5 for 2 6 h the srb activity was reduced by 85 90 and the ma activity was completely inhibited gutierrez et al 2014 the re growth of srb started within 1 to 3 days after a dosing event and completely recovered within 3 to 14 days gutierrez et al 2009 2014 however in a field study conducted in a 1080 m long rising main gutierrez et al 2014 found that the recovery period of srb was much shorter than that observed in the lab scale studies likely due to the lower ph level 9 at the end of pipe achieved in the real sewer than expected owing to the dilution effect of wastewater it means that a much high dosage of naoh is required in the upstream pipe to maintain a high ph level of 10 5 at the end of pipe the practical and economic feasibility of dosing caustic needs to be further assessed in addition the high ph wastewater resulting from the ph shock strategy shall be neutralized before feeding into the downstream wwtps by chemical treatment or the use of a storage release strategy gutierrez et al 2009 4 emerging technologies for in sewer sulfide control biocides addition electrochemical methods and granular iron cycling have emerged as novel methods to mitigate in sewer sulfide production and emission in the past decade their feasibility effectiveness and cost benefit have been demonstrated 4 1 free nitrous acid and urine as biocides free nitrous acid fna has recently been shown an effective biocide to control sulfide and methane emission in sewers duan et al 2020 by deactivating sewer biofilm activity including the srb and ma activities jiang et al 2011b the biocidal effect of fna strongly depends on its concentration and exposure time jiang et al 2011b jiang et al 2011a reported that fna concentration of 0 26 mg n l with an exposure time of 12 h could substantially prohibit srb and ma activities in sewer biofilms the long term sulfide control effectiveness of fna was further assessed in a full scale rising main sewer in australia 150 mm in diameter and 1080 m in length showing intermittently dosing of fna or fna combined with h2o2 could have effective control of sulfide production in which one single dose 0 26 mg n l fna or 0 26 mg n l fna 60 mg l h2o2 with a dosing duration of 8 24 h reduced sulfide production by more than 80 with a recovery period of more than 10 days jiang et al 2013a meanwhile no biofilm adaption to fna or fna h2o2 was found during the 6 month trials in real applications the required level of fna can be achieved via simultaneous dosing of nitrite and acid jiang et al 2011b fna can also be cost effectively produced from urine via nitritation which converts ammonium to nitrite with simultaneous acid production lowering ph to 6 0 zheng et al 2017 the fna concentration is primarily influenced by the nitrite concentration the solution ph and temperature eqs 16 and 17 ph at 5 6 has been applied in practical applications leemon et al 2014 while an even lower ph could further increase the fna level for a given nitrite concentration it elevates the risk of low ph induced sewer corrosion indeed balancing sewage ph and nitrite concentration to achieve an ideal fna concentration while reducing the chemical costs and mitigating the potential adverse effect of a low ph requires further research similar to nitrate addition this strategy may also increase nitrogen loading in the downstream wwtps 16 c fna c n o 2 n k a 1 0 ph 17 k a e 2300 t 273 where cfna and cno2 n are the fna and nitrite concentrations mg n l respectively ka is the ionization constant of the nitrous acid weon et al 2002 t is the temperature c zuo et al 2020 recently found that urine could be dosed to achieve effective sulfide and methane control via a laboratory scale test in which dosing real urine wastewater at a dosing duration of 24 h with an interval time of 5 15 days can reduce approximately 60 sulfide production and 100 methane generation at a high fa concentration of 154 mg nh3 n l this is because urine is rich in ammonia nh3 and nh4 9 g n l udert et al 2003 the high proportion of fa 4 g nh3 n l at 25 c and ph 9 in urine has biocidal effects on srb and ma however urine wastewater at a high ph could release volatile ammonia causing an obnoxious odor problem additional control measures should be taken during the storage and use of urine wastewater its practical feasibility needs to be demonstrated by more investigations 4 2 in situ chemical production with electrochemical methods for sulfide control in situ chemical production with electrochemical ec methods is a novel and attractive method for sulfide abatement in sewers as it avoids the transport handling and storage of concentrated chemicals often with safety concerns pikaar et al 2013 lin et al 2015 2017b 2017c pikaar et al 2013 reported in situ production of caustic and oxygen in a two compartment ec cell in which a mesh shaped ru ir coated titanium anode and a stainless steel mesh cathode were used fig 3a results showed that a caustic solution of 3 wt was directly produced from sewage in this system however the universal bivalent cations i e ca2 mg2 in sewage caused the deposit of calcium and magnesium hydroxides on the surface of cation exchange membrane leading to membrane scaling and an increase in energy consumption to address this challenge the two compartment ec cell was upgraded into a three compartment ec cell where a middle compartment was added between the anode and cathode compartments and fed with a nacl solution lin et al 2015 fig 3b results showed that the system could effectively produce caustic solution of 3 wt from wastewater during a period of 12 weeks and biofouling did not occur lin et al 2015 in site generation of dissolved iron species primarily fe2 and hydroxyl anions was recently achieved with a single compartment membrane free electrochemical cell with parallel placed iron electrodes fig 3c lin et al 2017b compared to the conventional method of fecl2 or fecl3 addition which acidifies sewage this ec method elevates sewage ph via oh production which is an additional benefit a full scale demonstration of such an electrochemical system has been performed in a 1080 m rising main diameter 150 mm for three months in which the gaseous h2s concentration in the downstream manhole at the end of the rising main decreased from 173 ppm to 6 6 ppm 90 percentile peak when a current of 1 14 a m3 of sewage was applied pikaar et al 2019 the in situ production of a high strength solution of magnetite nanoparticles particle size in 120 160 nm with mild steel as sacrificial electrodes is another promising system for sulfide control fig 3d lin et al 2017a compared to the commercial magnetite powders the sulfide removal capacity of the magnetite nanoparticles was nearly doubled moreover the production of magnetite nanoparticles does not cause sewage acidification as observed in the case of conventional iron salt dosing nielsen et al 2005b lin et al 2017a the refined magnetite nanoparticles can also eliminate the potential adverse effects of commercial magnetite powder unrefined magnetite containing heavy metals e g cr zn ni sn on sewage and sludge quality zhang et al 2016 however these electrochemical systems are still in their infancy as most were only demonstrated in laboratory scale systems over a short period with the only exception of a full scale electrochemical system used for in situ generation of alkalinity and iron pikaar et al 2019 efforts are needed to demonstrate the long term engineering feasibility of this technology at larger scales on line control systems also need to be designed to control the production of chemicals based on the actual demand which varies with time 4 3 granular iron cycling approach granular iron cycling technology based on the iron sulfur redox cycle has been proposed as a sustainable and attractive approach for in situ sulfide control in the sewer sediments fig 4 iron hydr oxides in the granular form have been found to persistently retain in the sediments and suppress the release of sulfide with nearly no iron loss into the water phase sun et al 2013 2019 feiii in the granular iron hydr oxides partially inhibits the sulfide production by srb by stimulating microbial iron reduction eq 18 and also removes the formed sulfide via abiotic sulfide oxidation and precipitation eqs 19 21 zhang et al 2016 sun et al 2020 the used iron granules can be regenerated via oxidizing the feii products back into feiii eqs 22 and 23 and then reused sun et al 2013 2014b the granular iron cycling technology provides a long lasting and renewable alternative to the addition of conventional soluble chemicals e g iron salts for the in situ sulfide control in the sewer sediments 18 8 f e iii oo h s c h 3 cooh 2 h 2 o irb 8 f

granular ferric hydroxide granular ferric oxide and rusted waste iron crusts and even increased the capacities by 20 105 injection of chemical oxidants e g hydrogen peroxide in sediments was effective for regenerating the used granular ferric hydroxide yin et al 2018 magnetic separation followed by air exposure was a potential regeneration method in the large gravity sewers where the electromagnets can be used to regenerate the used iron granules sun et al 2019 in the combined sewer systems in tidal impacted cities a dam break flushing flow generated using tidal energy can also be used to periodically suspend and mix the used iron granules with the dissolved oxygen rich tidal water for regeneration kikkert et al 2015 the energy saving and cost effective regeneration methods can be developed based on specific sewer conditions however the feasibility of the granular iron cycling technology was demonstrated mainly in laboratory scale studies systematic investigations are needed to evaluate the applicability of the granular iron cycling technology in the actual sewer environments and its overall costs i e capital investment and energy and chemical consumption 5 chemical choices based on sewer condition the different chemical addition strategies have distinct sulfide control mechanisms suggesting their different application scopes in terms of effectiveness and cost benefit according to an industry survey about five chemicals i e naoh mg oh 2 no3 fe2 fe3 and o2 used for sulfide control in sewers by the australian water industry ganigue et al 2011 and the sulfide control mechanisms of above mentioned strategies a recommendation of chemical choices can be provided as summarized in fig 5 air oxygen is preferably employed in sewer systems with medium to large flows average dry weather flow adwf 0 5 ml d and pipe diameters d 0 3 m this is because chemical sulfide oxidation contributes a large proportion of total sulfide removal a large pipe diameter means a low a v ratio thereby reducing oxygen consumption by aerobic heterotrophs inhabited in biofilm sediments in theory nitrate addition could be used in all sizes of pipes however nitrate salts are expensive it would be cost prohibitive when used in large pipes sharma et al 2011 thus nitrate salts are preferably used in sewer systems with small diameters and low to medium flows adwf 1 ml d and d 0 3 m iron salts are suitable for both large and small sewers but they are widely used in large sewer systems adwf 1 ml d and d 0 3 m as other chemicals are less appropriate ganigue et al 2011 similarly mg oh 2 should be applicable to both large and small systems with low to medium flows the effectiveness of mg oh 2 addition primarily depends on sewage ph suggesting that it should be preferentially used in systems with a relatively short hrt e g up to several hours as a long hrt would lead to an excessive production of acids to be neutralized caustic fna and fa have biocidal effects on srb and other organisms given the fact that small systems have high a v ratios these three chemicals are preferably dosed in small systems with low flow rates adwf 0 5 ml d and d 0 3 m which can effectively suppress deactivate srb activity similarly the ec methods that directly treat sewage e g those used for oxygen production caustic production and fe2 fe3 production are more suitable for small systems as otherwise the ec system would be too large to be practically acceptable in contrast the ec system producing magnetite nanoparticles can be applied to large systems as it does not involve direct treatment of sewage instead magnetite nanoparticles are produced in high concentrations and dosed to sewage additionally all the control measures can be utilized in rising mains and gravity sewers except for oxygen injection which cannot be applied to gravity sewers this is because pressurized oxygen is generally used to achieve high do concentrations in sewage for controlling h2s emission at wet wells pumping stations iron salts and alkali mg oh 2 and naoh are the most appropriate methods as they can reduce h2s emission in a very short time 6 modeling and control of chemical dosing given the highly dynamic hydraulic flow patterns and wastewater quality along the sewer systems liang et al 2019a the constant dosing regime or flow paced dosing where the amount of chemical dosed is proportional to the wastewater flow rate often results in overdose in some periods and under dosing in other periods thereby causing unsatisfactory performance and high operational costs jiang et al 2015a on the contrary demand driven chemical dosing strategies can achieve better sulfide control the prerequisite is to predict dynamic variation in sulfide production or acidification mathematical models describing in sewer biotransformation processes which take into account the dynamics of sewage flow wastewater characteristics the effect of rainfall on sulfide production and acidification is essential several sewer process models have so far been developed and employed to predict sulfide formation and h2s emission these included among others the wastewater aerobic anaerobic transformation in sewers wats model hvitved jacobsen et al 2000 yongsiri et al 2003 nielsen et al 2008b vollertsen et al 2011 vollertsen et al 2015 the sewex model sharma et al 2008 guisasola et al 2009 sharma et al 2013 sharma et al 2014 and the biofilm initiated sewer process model bism liang et al 2019a liang et al 2019b liang et al 2023 different from the wats and sewex models which lumped biofilm mediated biological reactions into simple kinetic expressions bism considers biofilm activity variation along the length of a pipe as a result of varying wastewater conditions along the pipe these models have been applied to support the selection of chemicals and dosing locations as well as the offline optimization of dosing rates de haas et al 2008 sharma et al 2012 liang et al 2019a while able to support the evaluation of on line control systems the above mentioned models are overly complicated and computationally demanding for direct use as a part of an on line control algorithm instead much simplified computationally efficient models have been developed for on line prediction of sewage acidification and sulfide production to support the design of an mg oh 2 dosing ganigué et al 2016 and an iron dosing controller ganigué et al 2018 respectively in both studies an auto regressive moving average arma model was developed to predict sewage flow rates several hours ahead chen et al 2014 which supported the prediction of sewage hrt in a pipe the predicted hrt was then used to predict sewage acidification or sulfide production enabling the on line determination of the mg oh 2 or iron salts dosing rates results showed that in addition to sulfide control improvement they reduced the chemical consumption by 15 and 30 respectively ganigué et al 2016 ganigué et al 2018 the arma model was later extended to an armax model with real time rainfall data as an external input to predict the sewage flow rate more accurately li et al 2019a an online sulfide sensor was developed by sutherland stacey et al 2008 the sensor has so far been used to evaluate the performance of various sulfide mitigation strategies but in principle it can be used to support the design of feedback controllers recently machine learning ml has been employed as an alternative to hydraulic and precipitation modeling in sewers which demonstrates its great potential to be used in online sulfide control harpaz et al 2022 li et al 2022a the biggest challenge for the use of ml and ai assisted algorithms in sewer modeling is the insufficient monitoring data for model training the existing sewer models such as bism and sewex are therefore important and need to be further developed because they could provide unlimited training data for ml or ai assisted models for every sewer section in a sewer system in the future ml and ai assisted algorithms shall deal with the comprehensive simulation of both hydraulics and wastewater transformation processes to provide accurate swift and reliable prediction results for online sulfide control systems 7 h2s control via ventilation and gas treatment ventilation of sewers is effective in corrosion mitigation by controlling the gaseous h2s concentration and humidity if well designed according to early engineering experiences and recent field studies pomeroy and bowlus 1946 lawrance 1965 vollertsen et al 2008 matos et al 2019 matos et al 2020 it is defined as the introduction of fresh air and removal of stale gasses including natural and forced ventilation pescod and price 1982 madsen et al 2006 natural ventilation is caused by water drag fluctuation of wastewater buoyancy and gradient of air pressure with the assistance of induct and educt vents madsen et al 2006 for instance natural ventilation occurs along with variations of air pressure caused by wind pescod and price 1982 olson et al 1997 drop structures guo et al 2018 ma et al 2019 operation of pump stations guo et al 2018 matos et al 2019 qian et al 2021b and abrupt changes in sewer slopes or sizes qian et al 2017 it was reported that the increased natural ventilation caused by an opened manhole cover decreased the average relative humidity by over 70 in the headspace of a gravity sewer in ericeira portugal matos et al 2019 a further field study matos et al 2020 described that the increased ventilation resulting from opening a manhole cover induced a 38 increase in the peak air velocity accompanied by a 20 increase in the h2s removal rate although the gaseous h2s concentration was still above the safe level for human entry matos et al 2020 compared to natural ventilation which is not always reliable to mitigate the corrosion problem forced ventilation delivers higher air velocities driven by dramatic negative pressure gradients produced by blowers and fans pomeroy 1945 corsi et al 1989 edwini bonsu and steffler 2006 qian et al 2021a it is usually applied to sewer pipes with low slopes and large diameters where natural ventilation is insufficient to provide a favorable air renewal rate corsi et al 1989 despite its wide application ventilation is normally designed and operated based on rules of thumb hurse and ochre 2008 matos et al 2020 one generally used indicator for sewer ventilation design is tpd turnovers per day which refers to renewal rates of the sewer air matos et al 2020 some early engineering experience found that the h2s induced corrosion of sewer structures was effectively controlled by ventilation with a tpd of 120 thistlethwayte 1972 but this empirical indicator likely varies between sewers the airflow rate required for tpd estimation is normally estimated based on wind speed wastewater velocity or power of forced ventilators using empirical equations olson et al 1997 madsen et al 2006 ward et al 2011a however more elaborated methods based on a comprehensive understanding of interrelated physical chemical and biological processes in sewers have also been proposed wang et al 2012 in the last twenty years numerical simulations have been implemented to solve the continuity and momentum equations to calculate the airflow rates in sewers under steady state ward et al 2011b qian et al 2018 zhang et al 2020 zobeyer et al 2020 or dynamic conditions wang et al 2012 with the latter being computational demanding a dynamic airflow model that is computationally efficient is yet to be developed it has been shown in earlier studies that the bacteria induced h2s oxidation on sewer walls stops with a relative humidity of the sewer air below 85 thistlethwayte 1972 the ventilation systems generally need to achieve this target the modeling of the in sewer heat and moisture transfer processes related to the condensation and corrosion processes have been investigated in several studies jiang et al 2014a abdel aal et al 2021 figueroa et al 2021 these models are able to predict the spatial and temporal variations of sewer air temperature and relative humidity and sewer wall temperature which can be fed to corrosion models to estimate the corrosion rate see section 8 in general the humidity of the vented air increases along the ventilated pipe which increases the absorption of moisture by the sewer wall at downstream locations it is apparent that humidity control becomes more difficult with a higher inlet air humidity especially on hot and humid summer days hurse and ochre 2008 under this circumstance with inadequate ventilation the corrosion will possibly accelerate near the outlets owing to the condensation of moisture from the sewer air to enhance the drying effect under unfavorable climatic conditions a more powerful forced ventilator will be needed which also means higher costs since the electricity consumption of the forced ventilators may be a power function of its effective drying distance pomeroy 1945 it may be an economical alternative to divide a long sewer main into several areas and apply multiple mechanical fans flexible bulkheads or curtains need to be installed to isolate different areas and avoid short circuiting airflows it should also be noted that it is better to keep the airflow in the same direction as the wastewater flow and maintain a small relative speed to reduce the rate of water evaporation and h2s transfer on the wastewater surface thistlethwayte 1972 the hazardous gasses vented from sewers often require treatment with activated carbon chemical scrubbing and biofiltration and biotrickling filtration these methods have been discussed in detail in several recent reviews jiang et al 2015a shammay et al 2016 bu et al 2021 8 sewer concrete corrosion control 8 1 concrete surface treatments surface treatments are primarily achieved via concrete surface coating which can form a protective layer to prevent the ingress of aggressive substances to improve the concrete durability of existing sewers de muynck et al 2009 the coating includes cement mortar coatings polymer coating epoxy resins acrylic polyurethane polymethacrylate geopolymer coating pacheco torgal et al 2012 and metal loaded zeolites coating e g ag zn cu de muynck et al 2009 for instance almusallam et al 2003 reported that the time to initiation of corrosion of concrete coated with materials e g acrylic epoxy polyurethane was approximately 2 5 27 times longer than that observed in the uncoated one haile et al 2008 found that the leaching rates of ca2 and si4 in the mortar specimens with silver loaded zeolite coating were only 28 6 and 38 5 of the uncoated mortar specimens it is because the antimicrobial traits of silver loaded zeolite inhibited microbial activities especially the sulfide oxidizing activity it should be pointed out that the effectiveness of these measures highly depends on the quality of workmanship and the integrity of a system namely whether the system is completely sealed wang et al 2020 this is because the presence of defects may lead to the debonding of coating the debonded area and defects could serve as living habits of microorganisms resulting in the rapid buildup of corrosion in such area kopteva et al 2004 the difficulty of surface coating for corroded sewers is to prepare the concrete surface before coating matthews et al 2014 in the past decade spraying nitrite on the acidic concrete surface to form fna has been proposed as an alternative measure of surface treatment since it does not need surface preparation sun et al 2015b the feasibility of this approach was demonstrated in a field trial which was conducted in a real sewer manhole in the city of gold coast australia showing that one spray of nitrite solution fna concentration 100 1000 mg hno2 n l on the active corrosion surfaces of concrete coupons reduced the corrosion loss by 40 90 for six months and the corrosion mitigation effect lasted 15 months li et al 2022b of note these strategies are temporary methods to retard concrete corrosion which means that regular reapplication is needed 8 2 improving corrosion resistance of new concrete materials supplementary cementitious materials alternative aggregates and cements as well as antimicrobial additives have been trialed to strengthen the concrete corrosion resistance of sewers grengg et al 2018 wu et al 2020 blast furnace slag fly ash silica fume are often used as the supplementary cementitious materials to reduce the concrete permeability and hinder the ingress of aggressive substances under acidic conditions such supplementary cementitious materials are not effective in improving concrete corrosion resistance de muynck et al 2009 siliceous e g granite and gabbro and calcareous e g limestone and dolomite aggregates are commonly employed compare to the former the latter exerts better performance owing to its higher alkalinity which can react with sulfuric acid with less degree of ph reduction alexander and fourie 2011 calcium aluminate cement cac and geopolymer cement are the potential alternatives to the commonly used ordinary portland cement alexander and fourie 2011 provis et al 2015 kiliswa 2016 grengg et al 2018 antimicrobial additives e g metals zeolites ag zn cu ni nawo4 etc and calcium nitrite and antimicrobial fibers antimicrobial agents used in fiber grengg et al 2018 li et al 2020 have bacteriostatic effects on microorganisms however the information on the long term corrosion protective effectiveness of these antimicrobial agents is still missing except for calcium nitrite admixed concrete li et al 2020 for more comprehensive information on the design operation mechanisms advantages and disadvantages of these technologies readers can refer to grengg et al 2018 wang et al 2020 and wu et al 2020 9 conclusions and future perspectives hydrogen sulfide generated by sulfate reducing bacteria is the culprit of sewer corrosion and odorous emission from sewer systems the underlying mechanisms towards sulfate reducing activity and sulfide producing patterns in sewers have been thoroughly unveiled in the past decades demonstrating that the sulfate reducing bacterial activities in biofilms and or sediments are the main driving factor such knowledge substantially promoted the development of various chemical dosing strategies and their optimization for controlling odor emission and sewer corrosion while the chemical dosing measures have been proven to be effective to control sulfide and methane production high operational costs and the side effects on the microbial communities of the downstream ecosystems become the main concerns ventilation is also an effective approach for corrosion control via reducing the gaseous h2s concentration and humidity but its design so far largely relies on experiences and empirical models surface treatments of concrete pipes is another useful way to improve the concrete corrosion resistance but with high maintenance costs although the in depth understanding of effectiveness advantages fundamental mechanisms of sulfide and corrosion control strategies has already been achieved more cost effective approaches are still in need thus the following future research directions are proposed 1 exploring new chemicals and new dosing strategies for sulfide control with higher cost effectiveness many chemicals are effective to control sulfide production and or emission but the effect relies on continuous chemical dosing incurring high costs studying on new biocides to inhibit sulfate reducing bacterial activity could be a promising solution as continuous dosing is not needed however as urban water ecosystems share the same microbiota the side effects of biocide dosing on the downstream water ecosystems in wwtps and rivers should be carefully considered with this approach 2 development of mathematical models and model based technologies mathematical models have been proven to be effective to identify the main cause of odor problem and to support the optimal use of chemical dosing with online sensors model based chemical dosing systems have the potential to precisely suppress h2s emission without overdosing with the use of sewer models such as bism and sewex the sulfide control strategy can be extended from single pipes to large scale sewer networks the existing mathematical models are computationally demanding limiting their ability to support real time control machine learning algorithms could be a promising tool to simplify these models by learning from the simulation data generated by these complex models in addition mathematical models can be employed to optimize sewer design which could reduce srb abundance and h2s production and emission in sewers thereby protecting sewer systems from concrete corrosion to some extent 3 holistic management of urban water systems is highly recommended an urban water system consists of drinking water production systems water distribution networks sewer systems wwtps and the receiving urban rivers any corrosion and odor mitigating approach applied to sewers may exert side effects on wwtps and rivers especially on the microbial community in these systems the next generation technologies and strategies should consider their effects on the holistic urban water system also solutions to sewer corrosion and odor may reside in the upstream components activities namely drinking water production water distribution and water use by customers declaration of

14710,in sewer systems where anaerobic conditions are present sulfate reducing bacteria reduce sulfate to hydrogen sulfide h2s leading to sewer corrosion and odor emission various sulfide corrosion control strategies have been proposed demonstrated and optimized in the past decades these included 1 chemical addition to sewage to reduce sulfide formation to remove dissolved sulfide after its formation or to reduce h2s emission from sewage to sewer air 2 ventilation to reduce the h2s and humidity levels in sewer air and 3 amendments of pipe materials surfaces to retard corrosion this work aims to comprehensively review both the commonly used sulfide control measures and the emerging technologies and to shed light on their underlying mechanisms the optimal use of the above stated strategies is also analyzed and discussed in depth the key knowledge gaps and major challenges associated with these control strategies are identified and strategies dealing with these gaps and challenges are recommended finally we emphasize a holistic approach to sulfide control by managing sewer networks as an integral part of an urban water system graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords sewer odor and corrosion sulfate reducing bacteria sulfide oxidizing bacteria free nitrous acid electrochemical system online control of chemical dosing data availability no data was used for the research described in the article 1 introduction under anaerobic environments sulfate reducing bacteria srb reduce sulfate to sulfide in sewers which is present in the forms of h2s hs and s2 collectively called dissolved sulfide or sulfide in sewage sulfide could accumulate to high levels in sewers particularly in networks with a long transport time when transferred to sewer air hydrogen sulfide causes sewer corrosion via oxidation to sulfuric acid at the inner surface of concrete pipes odor nuisance and health hazards when emitted to the surrounding environments for instance concrete corrosion occurs at a dissolved sulfide concentration of 0 1 0 5 mg s l severe concrete corrosion occurs at a dissolved sulfide level of 2 mg s l or above hvitved jacobsen et al 2002 with a corrosion rate ranging from 1 1 to 10 mm year zhang et al 2008 sulfide induced sewer corrosion is a common cause of sewer deterioration around the world pikaar et al 2014 and results in a huge loss in sewer assets for instance the annual loss of sewer assets caused by concrete corrosion in the usa was estimated to be around us 14 billion brongers et al 2002 the estimated annual loss of sewer infrastructure assets due to sulfide induced corrosion was in the order of us 100 million in australia gutierrez et al 2016 and 4 5 million in belgium romanova et al 2014 accordingly it is imperative to control sulfide in sewers various chemical and biological technologies have been developed which can be primarily categorized into two groups based on the control mechanisms prevention inhibition of sulfide generation and reduction of sulfide release from sewage to sewer air the former is principally achieved by adding inhibitors or biocides e g caustic free nitrous acid fna to sewage to inactivate srb jiang et al 2011b gutierrez et al 2014 the latter is mainly based on the addition of oxidants e g oxygen and nitrate to oxidize sulfide usepa 1991 gutierrez et al 2008 jiang et al 2013b precipitants i e iron salts to convert sulfide into insoluble metal sulfides nielsen et al 2005b gutierrez et al 2010a zhang et al 2016 or alkali i e sodium hydroxide and magnesium hydroxide mg oh 2 to reduce the h2s fraction of dissolved sulfide and hence reduce the transfer of sulfide to sewer air gutierrez et al 2009 gutierrez et al 2014 alternative strategies include sewer ventilation to reduce the h2s and humidity levels in sewer air jiang et al 2015a and amendments of concrete materials or pipe surfaces to enhance pipe resistance to corrosion grengg et al 2018 wang et al 2020 due to the complexity of sewer systems different sewers may have different sulfide producing patterns and capacities the corrosion mitigation strategies need to be carefully selected taking into account the sewage characteristics configuration of the sewer network and in fact the requirements of the downstream wastewater treatment plants as well as such a comprehensive understanding of sulfide production and sewer corrosion control mechanisms is necessary for control strategy selection and optimization the most recent critical review of sulfide mitigation in sewer systems was published in 2008 zhang et al 2008 where the authors summarized and discussed the most commonly used sulfide control strategies since then a considerable amount of research work has been undertaken which not only substantially improved our understanding of the mechanisms of the conventional sulfide control measures but also delivered new technologies based on very different mechanisms this review is conducted to critically discuss these latest advances in knowledge and developments of new technologies based on the systematic review of the sulfide control measures and the underlying mechanisms we propose guidelines for selecting and applying suitable control strategies for specific cases in practice the key knowledge gaps and challenges are also discussed to provide perspectives for further development of sulfide and sewer corrosion control strategies 2 mechanisms underlying in sewer h2s production and sewer corrosion 2 1 sulfide production in sewers sewage generally contains 40 200 mg l of sulfate paing et al 2000 more than half of which in many cases is attributed to the use of aluminum sulfate as a coagulant during drinking water production pikaar et al 2014 in some cases sewage contains a high concentration of sulfate owing to seawater infiltration or seawater toilet flushing and sulfate concentration could reach up to 600 1000 mg l liang et al 2019b in the presence of abundant organics and sulfate sulfate reduction occurs in anaerobic areas of sewer biofilm growing on the inner surfaces of sewer wall jiang et al 2009a of note sewer biofilms are often present in rising mains while sediments are present in partially filled gravity sewers re aeration can occur since sewer sediments are biologically active sulfide is generated in the anaerobic fraction of sewer sediments schmitt and seyfried 1992 methanogenic archaea ma coexist with srb in sewer biofilms sediments fig 1 sun et al 2014a sulfide formation in sewers is influenced by many factors for the biological aspect the srb activity and growth are stimulated in the presence of sufficient electron donors and acceptors i e biodegradable organics sulfate as well as other favorable environmental factors e g low dissolved oxygen do neutral ph suitable temperature 25 35 c a low sewage flow velocity equivalent to a long hydraulic retention time hrt and weak turbulence create a favorable environment for sulfate reducing activity park et al 2014 the ratio of biofilm sediment surface to wastewater volume a v is also a critical parameter a high a v ratio generally indicates a more significant biofilm contribution to sulfide production hvitved jacobsen et al 2013 for the chemical aspect the presence of oxidants e g do nitrate can reduce sulfide concentration in sewage mainly via sulfide oxidation metals e g ferrous zinc copper manganese present in sewage immobilize sulfide and reduce h2s emission via forming metal sulfide precipitates in addition h2s and hs are the two main sulfide species in sewage under neutral ph yongsiri et al 2003 only molecular h2s can cross the air water interface to sewer air an increase in ph shifts the equilibrium to the ionized form of sulfide hs 2 2 sulfide induced sewer corrosion concrete is the most prevalent material utilized in sewers especially for large sewer pipes attributed to its good strength durability and relatively low cost vahidi et al 2016 grengg et al 2018 however corrosion of concrete pipes and the associated infrastructures e g manholes and pumping stations caused by the biogenic sulfuric acid derived from the oxidation of gaseous h2s has been widely recognized as a critical deterioration process fig 1 the abiotic and biotic corrosion processes involved in the sulfide induced concrete corrosion can be categorized into three stages i the acidification of carbonation co2 and h2s decreases the ph on the surface of cement from 13 to 9 9 5 satoh et al 2009 joseph et al 2012 ii the colonized sob i e neutrophilic sob oxidize sulfide and other sulfur species e g elemental sulfur and thiosulfate to sulfuric acid under moist conditions accompanying with a further decrease of the concrete surface ph to 2 4 eq 1 roberts et al 2002 iii the acidophilic sob e g acidithiobacillus predominate in the corrosion biofilms at such an extremely acidic environment and produce sulfuric acid via sulfide oxidation which subsequently reacts with alkaline cement materials while producing expansive sulfate salts e g gypsum eqs 2 4 and ettringite eq 5 thereby leading to structural destabilization and cracking formation and finally collapse of the concretes li et al 2017 1 h 2 s 2 o 2 h 2 s o 4 2 h 2 s o 4 cac o 3 cas o 4 h 2 c o 3 3 h 2 s o 4 ca oh 2 cas o 4 2 h 2 o 4 h 2 s o 4 cao si o 2 2 h 2 o

stations and can be influenced by h2s co2 relative humidity rh and temperature okabe et al 2007 vollertsen et al 2008 satoh et al 2009 jiang et al 2015b h2s is a principal contributor the h2s concentration in sewer air not only influences the initiation time of corrosion of fresh concrete sewers jiang et al 2015b li et al 2019b but also positively impacts the corrosion biofilm activity especially sob activity nielsen et al 2005a as stated above sob has a substantial effect on the concrete corrosion jiang et al 2014a although co2 was assumed to contribute to the initial concrete acidification in sewers the acidification is mainly attributed to h2s dissolution rather than carbonation co2 joseph et al 2012 sulfide oxidation rate both chemically and biologically positively correlates with gas temperature nielsen et al 2006 sun et al 2015b humidity provides moisture to the walls of sewers via vapor condensation rh in sewer air typically varies between 60 and 100 and a high rh shortens the initial time of corrosion and enhances the corrosion process jiang et al 2014a jiang et al 2015b rh only has substantial effects on the corrosion process in the region further away from wastewater level i e crown region as the tidal region is frequently inundated by sewage ensuring the saturated water content fig 1 frequent sewage flushing in the tidal region and occasional flooding also provide the inoculum and essential medium for microbial colonization li et al 2017 thus tidal regions are subject to more severe corrosion than crown regions jiang et al 2014a song et al 2019a apart from concrete corrosion the gaseous h2s in sewers also corrodes reinforcing steel bar rebar that is embedded in concrete pipes with diameters larger than 0 6 m joshi 2015 however not much attention has been paid to rebar corrosion in sewers until a recent laboratory chamber study song et al 2019b and a pilot sewer study song et al 2020 were conducted at the initiation of rebar corrosion oxygen plays a significant role in the corrosion process while gaseous h2s exerts minor effects forming multiple iron oxides eqs 6 and 7 as the corrosion developed the rebar surface starts to be acidified due to the accumulation of h2s with iron sulfide being the corrosion product eq 8 with the exacerbation of concrete corrosion the rust layers containing iron oxides oxyhydroxides and iron sulfides could dissolve eqs 9 11 the dissolution diffusion and deposition of fe from the rebar rusts towards the corroded concrete layer could facilitate the micro cracking of the concrete corrosion front to better understand the mechanism of sulfide induced concrete and rebar corrosion in sewers conceptual models focusing on the physicochemical conditions within the corrosion layer ph mineral compositions and distributions together with the chemical and biological corrosion reactions have been proposed jiang et al 2014b song et al 2019b song et al 2020 it was suggested that the ph profile along the depth from the exposed surface could be responsible for the distribution of various concrete corrosion products i e iron oxides iron oxyhydroxides iron sulfides iron chlorides and iron sulfate and the micro cracking caused by the expansion of corrosion products overall rebar corrosion is accelerated by the acidic concrete corrosion layer which in turn would stimulate the concrete cracking at both macro and micro levels 6 4 fe 3 o 2 2 f e 2 o 3 7 3 fe 2 o 2 f e 3 o 4 8 fe h 2 s fes h 2 9 f e 2 o 3 6 h 2 f e 3 3 h 2 o 10 f e 3 o 4 8 h 2 f e 3 f e 2 4 h 2 o 11 fes 2 h f

wells and melchers 2015 artificial neural network models jiang et al 2016 and hybrid gaussian processes regression gpr model liu et al 2017 most of them showed the high correlations between corrosion rates and the levels of h2s in the sewer air however the ability of these models for prediction in a broad range of environmental conditions remains to be fully verified 3 advanced knowledge of conventional sulfide mitigation measures mitigation of sulfide emission in sewers is often conducted via dosing chemicals the conventional measures include air oxygen injection addition of nitrate salts iron salts and or alkali the effectiveness underlying mechanisms potential issues and corresponding solutions of these control strategies are discussed in this section it should be noted that strong oxidants such as hydrogen peroxide h2o2 chlorine and potassium permanganate kmno4 were also used for sulfide control in sewers waltrip and snyder 1985 usepa 1991 tomar and abdullah 1994 zhang et al 2008 however owing to the high operational costs and or undesirable control effectiveness zhang et al 2008 these strategies are now rarely employed in practice thus they are not discussed in this review 3 1 injection of air or pure oxygen oxygen is an accessible oxidant for sulfide oxidation in the case of air injection 0 2 1 mg l of do was reported in the terminal point of sewers tanaka and takenaka 1995 ochi et al 1998 however the occurrence of sulfide in sewage can be avoided only when do is above 0 5 mg l talaiekhozani et al 2016 thus undesirable sulfide control effectiveness was often reported due to the limited oxygen solubility zhang et al 2008 this strategy is mainly utilized in rising mains rather than gravity sewers and pressurized air is required to increase do concentration in sewage alternatively pure oxygen is used which would deliver an oxygen concentration five fold that of air under the same pressure zhang et al 2008 in pressure mains the solubility of pure oxygen can reach up to 40 50 mg l hvitved jacobsen et al 2013 thus dosing oxygen during the pumping period in rising mains could achieve better sulfide removal than air injection gutierrez et al 2008 although oxygen can inhibit srb activity it does not have any long lasting or irreversible inhibitory effects on srb resulting in sulfur rebound occurring immediately after oxygen depletion gutierrez et al 2008 it may be attributed to the high oxygen uptake rate of biofilms limiting the penetration of oxygen to the deep layers of sewer biofilms as a result srb keep active in the anaerobic inner layer of sewer biofilms and continuously produce sulfide even when dissolved oxygen is present in the bulk liquid gutierrez et al 2008 as reported by gutierrez et al 2008 when the bulk oxygen concentration in the laboratory scale rising mains increased from 3 1 to 6 5 mg o2 l the average sulfide production rate of the sewer biofilm only decreased from 54 4 to 39 9 mg s m2 h complete oxygen penetration can be achieved only when the organics e g volatile fatty acids is depleted oxygen injection also favors the growth of aerobic heterotrophs in biofilm which in return increases the oxygen uptake rate by sewer biofilms for instance gutierrez et al 2008 observed in the laboratory scale rising mains that repeated oxygen exposure in a time period of 120 days increased oxygen uptake rates to an average of 50 8 mg o2 l h from 11 5 mg o2 l h on average at the period of pre oxygen injection rathnayake et al 2019 and rathnayake et al 2021 reported that ferrous could serve as a catalyst to selectively oxidize sulfide with oxygen batch experiment results showed that addition of a small amount of ferrous salts 20 stoichiometric requirement to precipitate sulfide could improve the sulfide control effectiveness of oxygen injection in sewers and reduce oxygen consumption rathnayake et al 2019 as such for pipes with a long hrt e g 1 h oxygen injection at pumping stations is often less effective for such pipes it is more effective to inject oxygen at locations close to the end of a rising main or the target point a sufficient hrt should be allowed between the injection location and the ring main end or the target point to allow complete oxidation of sulfide produced in the upstream pipe section also a sufficient amount of oxygen should be injected to maintain oxic conditions between the injection location and the rising main end or the target point gutierrez et al 2008 to avoid sulfide rebound following depletion of oxygen multiple injection locations may be required in large sewer networks hvitved jacobsen et al 2013 considering the relatively short transport distance of oxygen following its injection 3 2 nitrate salt addition nitrate salts e g nano3 ca no3 2 fe no3 3 are commonly used for sulfide control in sewers bentzen et al 1995 jiang et al 2013b auguet et al 2015 in the presence of nitrate sulfide oxidizing nitrate reducing bacteria oxidize sulfide to elemental sulfur or sulfate eqs 12 and 13 liang et al 2016 heterotrophic nitrate reducing bacteria hnrb communities may also outcompete srb for organic matter resulting in the exclusion of srb jiang et al 2013b considering the higher aqueous solubility than oxygen nitrate with appropriate dosage could achieve effective sulfide control over a longer distance compared to oxygen for example previous studies demonstrated that dosing nitrate salt at a concentration of 10 to 40 mg n l has been observed to efficiently suppress sulfide concentration to 0 2 3 0 mg s l yang et al 2005 saracevic et al 2007 mohanakrishnan et al 2009 12 5 s 2 2 n o 3 12 h 5 s 0 n 2 6 h 2 o 13 5 s 0 6 n o 3 2 h 2 o 5 s o 4 2 3 n 2 4 h sulfide rebounds immediately after nitrate depletion constituting a main drawback of this strategy liang et al 2016 compared to the case where no nitrate dosing was employed sulfide production was even greater between the dosing events in the case of intermittent dosing liang et al 2016 this is because elemental sulfur generated during sulfide oxidation accumulated in the sewer biofilm and was then bio reduced back to sulfide jiang et al 2009b auguet et al 2015 of note although the aqueous solubility of elemental sulfur is low 5 μg l at 25 c it can react with the biogenic sulfide to generate polysulfide which in return improves the bioaccessibility of sulfur thereby accelerating sulfur reduction liang et al 2016 zhang et al 2021 as in the case of oxygen injection downstream nitrate dosage dnd namely dosing nitrate at a point close to the end of the sewer or close to the point of sulfide control is an optimal nitrate dosing strategy for minimizing sulfide concentration at the discharging point of a rising main gutierrez et al 2010b auguet et al 2015 although sulfide can be produced in the upstream sections of a sewer pipe not receiving nitrate dosing the produced sulfide can be efficiently oxidized in the downstream sections where nitrate becomes available the nitrate dosing rate is critical to avoid sulfide rebound following its dosage nitrate should persist in the remaining section of the pipe to prevent anaerobic condition from forming in addition to efficient sulfide control the dnd strategy could reduce methane production presumably via outcompeting methanogens in the use of organic carbon jiang et al 2013b of note when the dnd strategy is employed in a partially filled gravity sewer the sulfide produced in the upstream could cause concrete corrosion which needs to be paid attention nitrate stimulates the growth of hnrb in sewer biofilm resulting in nitrate consumption not coupled to sulfide oxidation this process increases the nitrate demand for sulfide control liang et al 2019b it should be noted that the residual nitrate in sewage would increase the nitrogen loading of the downstream wastewater treatment plants wwtps 3 3 iron salt addition different iron salts feso4 fecl2 fecl3 fe no3 3 fe2 so4 3 have been utilized to control sulfide in sewers ferric ion fe3 chemically oxidizes sulfide to elemental sulfur with itself being reduced to fe2 which can subsequently precipitate sulfide as fes precipitates eqs 14 and 15 firer et al 2008 in light of the high effectiveness approximately 66 of the total sewage receiving chemical dosing was treated by iron salts in australia ganigue et al 2011 fe3 has inhibitory effects on sulfate reducing and methanogenic activities of sewer biofilms zhang et al 2009 however the inhibitory effects were limited in sewer sediments cao et al 2019 14 f e 2 h s fe s s h 15 2 f e 3 h s 2 f e 2 s s 0 h a low sewage ph significantly increases the fe demand which results in high operational costs ganigue et al 2011 jiang et al 2011a this is because ph has a substantial influence on sulfide precipitation reaction and such a reaction is negatively influenced by lower ph especially around the sewage ph levels e g 6 8 firer et al 2008 nielsen et al 2008a for example firer et al 2008 reported that the fe2 to s2 molar ratio was 3 5 fold higher to achieve sulfide concentration of 0 1 mg s l when the ph decreased from 8 1 to 6 5 in practice owing to the presence of other anions in sewage such as co3 2 nitrilotriacetate and ethylenediaminetetraacetate iliuta and larachi 2003 nielsen et al 2005b iron salts need to be provided in excess to meet the demand by these competing anions as recommended by firer et al 2008 a minimal molar ratio of fe s 1 3 1 for ferrous salts fe s 0 9 1 for ferric salts or a mixture of both salts at a ratio of fe3 fe2 2 1 is required to reduce sulfide to 0 1 mg s l at ph around 7 0 the iron rich sludge generated in the drinking water production process dwpp could be a cheap alternative source of iron for sulfide control in sewers as iron salts are widely used in dwpp as coagulants pikaar et al 2014 sun et al 2015a demonstrated that such iron rich sludge mainly fe3 significantly reduced sulfide concentration from 15 5 to 19 8 mg s l to 0 7 2 3 mg s l in a laboratory scale rising main sewer at a sludge dosing rate giving an fe to s molar ratio of 1 1 the volume ratio of sludge to wastewater was 0 26 this strategy also reduced methane generation by 20 which was attributed to a loss in soluble organics via iron sludge adsorption the iron salt addition in sewage benefits not only corrosion control but also wastewater treatment in the downstream wwtp the formed fes precipitates in the sewage enhance the phosphate precipitation in the wwtps via forming insoluble iron phosphate hydroxide complexes gutierrez et al 2010a rebosura et al 2018 2020 in the anaerobic sludge digester iron in the iron phosphate hydroxide complexes becomes available for sulfide control thus reducing h2s in biogas ge et al 2013 these results were later confirmed in two field studies salehin et al 2019 kulandaivelu et al 2020 as shown in fig 2 an integrated iron cycle could be beneficial for sustainable water and wastewater management in an urban water system which implies that an urban water system should be managed holistically to maximize its performance 3 4 alkali addition alkali increases sewage ph which reduces the fraction of h2s molecules in wastewater and in turn decreases h2s release to the sewer air mg oh 2 and caustic soda naoh are the two types of alkali used in sewer applications gutierrez et al 2009 2014 mg oh 2 is a weak base and is safe to handle and store due to the limited water solubility of mg oh 2 0 009 g l 18 c it can only increase sewage ph to a maximum level of around 9 0 typically 8 5 9 0 its self buffering feature allows a sewer to be loaded with residual or unreacted mg oh 2 which extends the effectiveness of mg oh 2 in sulfide mitigation to areas far down from the dosing point gutierrez et al 2009 this is because the residual mg oh 2 dissolves when the sewage ph becomes lower than 9 0 due to the on going re acidification ph elevation to 8 5 9 0 has been found to reduce the srb activity in sewer biofilm by 25 50 gutierrez et al 2009 an even stronger inhibitory effect on the ma activity was observed it is attributed to the fact that an increase in free ammonia fa concentration sharma et al 2014 with elevated sewage ph could disrupt cell homeostasis after fa pass through the cellular membrane gutierrez et al 2009 in a laboratory sewer reactor operated at ph 8 5 9 0 no ma activity was observed during its 6 month operation in contrast to the reactor operated at a neutral ph gutierrez et al 2009 considering these inhibitory effects mg oh 2 should be dosed upstream to simultaneously benefit from its abilities to reduce h2s production and liquid air transfer different from mg oh 2 which is typically dosed continuously naoh dosed intermittently to cause periodic ph shocks above 10 0 for a short period hours gutierrez et al 2009 o gorman et al 2011 gutierrez et al 2014 in a laboratory study sewer biofilms were exposed to ph 10 5 for 2 6 h the srb activity was reduced by 85 90 and the ma activity was completely inhibited gutierrez et al 2014 the re growth of srb started within 1 to 3 days after a dosing event and completely recovered within 3 to 14 days gutierrez et al 2009 2014 however in a field study conducted in a 1080 m long rising main gutierrez et al 2014 found that the recovery period of srb was much shorter than that observed in the lab scale studies likely due to the lower ph level 9 at the end of pipe achieved in the real sewer than expected owing to the dilution effect of wastewater it means that a much high dosage of naoh is required in the upstream pipe to maintain a high ph level of 10 5 at the end of pipe the practical and economic feasibility of dosing caustic needs to be further assessed in addition the high ph wastewater resulting from the ph shock strategy shall be neutralized before feeding into the downstream wwtps by chemical treatment or the use of a storage release strategy gutierrez et al 2009 4 emerging technologies for in sewer sulfide control biocides addition electrochemical methods and granular iron cycling have emerged as novel methods to mitigate in sewer sulfide production and emission in the past decade their feasibility effectiveness and cost benefit have been demonstrated 4 1 free nitrous acid and urine as biocides free nitrous acid fna has recently been shown an effective biocide to control sulfide and methane emission in sewers duan et al 2020 by deactivating sewer biofilm activity including the srb and ma activities jiang et al 2011b the biocidal effect of fna strongly depends on its concentration and exposure time jiang et al 2011b jiang et al 2011a reported that fna concentration of 0 26 mg n l with an exposure time of 12 h could substantially prohibit srb and ma activities in sewer biofilms the long term sulfide control effectiveness of fna was further assessed in a full scale rising main sewer in australia 150 mm in diameter and 1080 m in length showing intermittently dosing of fna or fna combined with h2o2 could have effective control of sulfide production in which one single dose 0 26 mg n l fna or 0 26 mg n l fna 60 mg l h2o2 with a dosing duration of 8 24 h reduced sulfide production by more than 80 with a recovery period of more than 10 days jiang et al 2013a meanwhile no biofilm adaption to fna or fna h2o2 was found during the 6 month trials in real applications the required level of fna can be achieved via simultaneous dosing of nitrite and acid jiang et al 2011b fna can also be cost effectively produced from urine via nitritation which converts ammonium to nitrite with simultaneous acid production lowering ph to 6 0 zheng et al 2017 the fna concentration is primarily influenced by the nitrite concentration the solution ph and temperature eqs 16 and 17 ph at 5 6 has been applied in practical applications leemon et al 2014 while an even lower ph could further increase the fna level for a given nitrite concentration it elevates the risk of low ph induced sewer corrosion indeed balancing sewage ph and nitrite concentration to achieve an ideal fna concentration while reducing the chemical costs and mitigating the potential adverse effect of a low ph requires further research similar to nitrate addition this strategy may also increase nitrogen loading in the downstream wwtps 16 c fna c n o 2 n k a 1 0 ph 17 k a e 2300 t 273 where cfna and cno2 n are the fna and nitrite concentrations mg n l respectively ka is the ionization constant of the nitrous acid weon et al 2002 t is the temperature c zuo et al 2020 recently found that urine could be dosed to achieve effective sulfide and methane control via a laboratory scale test in which dosing real urine wastewater at a dosing duration of 24 h with an interval time of 5 15 days can reduce approximately 60 sulfide production and 100 methane generation at a high fa concentration of 154 mg nh3 n l this is because urine is rich in ammonia nh3 and nh4 9 g n l udert et al 2003 the high proportion of fa 4 g nh3 n l at 25 c and ph 9 in urine has biocidal effects on srb and ma however urine wastewater at a high ph could release volatile ammonia causing an obnoxious odor problem additional control measures should be taken during the storage and use of urine wastewater its practical feasibility needs to be demonstrated by more investigations 4 2 in situ chemical production with electrochemical methods for sulfide control in situ chemical production with electrochemical ec methods is a novel and attractive method for sulfide abatement in sewers as it avoids the transport handling and storage of concentrated chemicals often with safety concerns pikaar et al 2013 lin et al 2015 2017b 2017c pikaar et al 2013 reported in situ production of caustic and oxygen in a two compartment ec cell in which a mesh shaped ru ir coated titanium anode and a stainless steel mesh cathode were used fig 3a results showed that a caustic solution of 3 wt was directly produced from sewage in this system however the universal bivalent cations i e ca2 mg2 in sewage caused the deposit of calcium and magnesium hydroxides on the surface of cation exchange membrane leading to membrane scaling and an increase in energy consumption to address this challenge the two compartment ec cell was upgraded into a three compartment ec cell where a middle compartment was added between the anode and cathode compartments and fed with a nacl solution lin et al 2015 fig 3b results showed that the system could effectively produce caustic solution of 3 wt from wastewater during a period of 12 weeks and biofouling did not occur lin et al 2015 in site generation of dissolved iron species primarily fe2 and hydroxyl anions was recently achieved with a single compartment membrane free electrochemical cell with parallel placed iron electrodes fig 3c lin et al 2017b compared to the conventional method of fecl2 or fecl3 addition which acidifies sewage this ec method elevates sewage ph via oh production which is an additional benefit a full scale demonstration of such an electrochemical system has been performed in a 1080 m rising main diameter 150 mm for three months in which the gaseous h2s concentration in the downstream manhole at the end of the rising main decreased from 173 ppm to 6 6 ppm 90 percentile peak when a current of 1 14 a m3 of sewage was applied pikaar et al 2019 the in situ production of a high strength solution of magnetite nanoparticles particle size in 120 160 nm with mild steel as sacrificial electrodes is another promising system for sulfide control fig 3d lin et al 2017a compared to the commercial magnetite powders the sulfide removal capacity of the magnetite nanoparticles was nearly doubled moreover the production of magnetite nanoparticles does not cause sewage acidification as observed in the case of conventional iron salt dosing nielsen et al 2005b lin et al 2017a the refined magnetite nanoparticles can also eliminate the potential adverse effects of commercial magnetite powder unrefined magnetite containing heavy metals e g cr zn ni sn on sewage and sludge quality zhang et al 2016 however these electrochemical systems are still in their infancy as most were only demonstrated in laboratory scale systems over a short period with the only exception of a full scale electrochemical system used for in situ generation of alkalinity and iron pikaar et al 2019 efforts are needed to demonstrate the long term engineering feasibility of this technology at larger scales on line control systems also need to be designed to control the production of chemicals based on the actual demand which varies with time 4 3 granular iron cycling approach granular iron cycling technology based on the iron sulfur redox cycle has been proposed as a sustainable and attractive approach for in situ sulfide control in the sewer sediments fig 4 iron hydr oxides in the granular form have been found to persistently retain in the sediments and suppress the release of sulfide with nearly no iron loss into the water phase sun et al 2013 2019 feiii in the granular iron hydr oxides partially inhibits the sulfide production by srb by stimulating microbial iron reduction eq 18 and also removes the formed sulfide via abiotic sulfide oxidation and precipitation eqs 19 21 zhang et al 2016 sun et al 2020 the used iron granules can be regenerated via oxidizing the feii products back into feiii eqs 22 and 23 and then reused sun et al 2013 2014b the granular iron cycling technology provides a long lasting and renewable alternative to the addition of conventional soluble chemicals e g iron salts for the in situ sulfide control in the sewer sediments 18 8 f e iii oo h s c h 3 cooh 2 h 2 o irb 8 f

e iii ooh s 0 h regeneration is crucial to the granular iron cycling technology sun et al 2013 reported that the oxygen supply via mechanical mixing recovered the sulfide removal capacities of granular ferric hydroxide granular ferric oxide and rusted waste iron crusts and even increased the capacities by 20 105 injection of chemical oxidants e g hydrogen peroxide in sediments was effective for regenerating the used granular ferric hydroxide yin et al 2018 magnetic separation followed by air exposure was a potential regeneration method in the large gravity sewers where the electromagnets can be used to regenerate the used iron granules sun et al 2019 in the combined sewer systems in tidal impacted cities a dam break flushing flow generated using tidal energy can also be used to periodically suspend and mix the used iron granules with the dissolved oxygen rich tidal water for regeneration kikkert et al 2015 the energy saving and cost effective regeneration methods can be developed based on specific sewer conditions however the feasibility of the granular iron cycling technology was demonstrated mainly in laboratory scale studies systematic investigations are needed to evaluate the applicability of the granular iron cycling technology in the actual sewer environments and its overall costs i e capital investment and energy and chemical consumption 5 chemical choices based on sewer condition the different chemical addition strategies have distinct sulfide control mechanisms suggesting their different application scopes in terms of effectiveness and cost benefit according to an industry survey about five chemicals i e naoh mg oh 2 no3 fe2 fe3 and o2 used for sulfide control in sewers by the australian water industry ganigue et al 2011 and the sulfide control mechanisms of above mentioned strategies a recommendation of chemical choices can be provided as summarized in fig 5 air oxygen is preferably employed in sewer systems with medium to large flows average dry weather flow adwf 0 5 ml d and pipe diameters d 0 3 m this is because chemical sulfide oxidation contributes a large proportion of total sulfide removal a large pipe diameter means a low a v ratio thereby reducing oxygen consumption by aerobic heterotrophs inhabited in biofilm sediments in theory nitrate addition could be used in all sizes of pipes however nitrate salts are expensive it would be cost prohibitive when used in large pipes sharma et al 2011 thus nitrate salts are preferably used in sewer systems with small diameters and low to medium flows adwf 1 ml d and d 0 3 m iron salts are suitable for both large and small sewers but they are widely used in large sewer systems adwf 1 ml d and d 0 3 m as other chemicals are less appropriate ganigue et al 2011 similarly mg oh 2 should be applicable to both large and small systems with low to medium flows the effectiveness of mg oh 2 addition primarily depends on sewage ph suggesting that it should be preferentially used in systems with a relatively short hrt e g up to several hours as a long hrt would lead to an excessive production of acids to be neutralized caustic fna and fa have biocidal effects on srb and other organisms given the fact that small systems have high a v ratios these three chemicals are preferably dosed in small systems with low flow rates adwf 0 5 ml d and d 0 3 m which can effectively suppress deactivate srb activity similarly the ec methods that directly treat sewage e g those used for oxygen production caustic production and fe2 fe3 production are more suitable for small systems as otherwise the ec system would be too large to be practically acceptable in contrast the ec system producing magnetite nanoparticles can be applied to large systems as it does not involve direct treatment of sewage instead magnetite nanoparticles are produced in high concentrations and dosed to sewage additionally all the control measures can be utilized in rising mains and gravity sewers except for oxygen injection which cannot be applied to gravity sewers this is because pressurized oxygen is generally used to achieve high do concentrations in sewage for controlling h2s emission at wet wells pumping stations iron salts and alkali mg oh 2 and naoh are the most appropriate methods as they can reduce h2s emission in a very short time 6 modeling and control of chemical dosing given the highly dynamic hydraulic flow patterns and wastewater quality along the sewer systems liang et al 2019a the constant dosing regime or flow paced dosing where the amount of chemical dosed is proportional to the wastewater flow rate often results in overdose in some periods and under dosing in other periods thereby causing unsatisfactory performance and high operational costs jiang et al 2015a on the contrary demand driven chemical dosing strategies can achieve better sulfide control the prerequisite is to predict dynamic variation in sulfide production or acidification mathematical models describing in sewer biotransformation processes which take into account the dynamics of sewage flow wastewater characteristics the effect of rainfall on sulfide production and acidification is essential several sewer process models have so far been developed and employed to predict sulfide formation and h2s emission these included among others the wastewater aerobic anaerobic transformation in sewers wats model hvitved jacobsen et al 2000 yongsiri et al 2003 nielsen et al 2008b vollertsen et al 2011 vollertsen et al 2015 the sewex model sharma et al 2008 guisasola et al 2009 sharma et al 2013 sharma et al 2014 and the biofilm initiated sewer process model bism liang et al 2019a liang et al 2019b liang et al 2023 different from the wats and sewex models which lumped biofilm mediated biological reactions into simple kinetic expressions bism considers biofilm activity variation along the length of a pipe as a result of varying wastewater conditions along the pipe these models have been applied to support the selection of chemicals and dosing locations as well as the offline optimization of dosing rates de haas et al 2008 sharma et al 2012 liang et al 2019a while able to support the evaluation of on line control systems the above mentioned models are overly complicated and computationally demanding for direct use as a part of an on line control algorithm instead much simplified computationally efficient models have been developed for on line prediction of sewage acidification and sulfide production to support the design of an mg oh 2 dosing ganigué et al 2016 and an iron dosing controller ganigué et al 2018 respectively in both studies an auto regressive moving average arma model was developed to predict sewage flow rates several hours ahead chen et al 2014 which supported the prediction of sewage hrt in a pipe the predicted hrt was then used to predict sewage acidification or sulfide production enabling the on line determination of the mg oh 2 or iron salts dosing rates results showed that in addition to sulfide control improvement they reduced the chemical consumption by 15 and 30 respectively ganigué et al 2016 ganigué et al 2018 the arma model was later extended to an armax model with real time rainfall data as an external input to predict the sewage flow rate more accurately li et al 2019a an online sulfide sensor was developed by sutherland stacey et al 2008 the sensor has so far been used to evaluate the performance of various sulfide mitigation strategies but in principle it can be used to support the design of feedback controllers recently machine learning ml has been employed as an alternative to hydraulic and precipitation modeling in sewers which demonstrates its great potential to be used in online sulfide control harpaz et al 2022 li et al 2022a the biggest challenge for the use of ml and ai assisted algorithms in sewer modeling is the insufficient monitoring data for model training the existing sewer models such as bism and sewex are therefore important and need to be further developed because they could provide unlimited training data for ml or ai assisted models for every sewer section in a sewer system in the future ml and ai assisted algorithms shall deal with the comprehensive simulation of both hydraulics and wastewater transformation processes to provide accurate swift and reliable prediction results for online sulfide control systems 7 h2s control via ventilation and gas treatment ventilation of sewers is effective in corrosion mitigation by controlling the gaseous h2s concentration and humidity if well designed according to early engineering experiences and recent field studies pomeroy and bowlus 1946 lawrance 1965 vollertsen et al 2008 matos et al 2019 matos et al 2020 it is defined as the introduction of fresh air and removal of stale gasses including natural and forced ventilation pescod and price 1982 madsen et al 2006 natural ventilation is caused by water drag fluctuation of wastewater buoyancy and gradient of air pressure with the assistance of induct and educt vents madsen et al 2006 for instance natural ventilation occurs along with variations of air pressure caused by wind pescod and price 1982 olson et al 1997 drop structures guo et al 2018 ma et al 2019 operation of pump stations guo et al 2018 matos et al 2019 qian et al 2021b and abrupt changes in sewer slopes or sizes qian et al 2017 it was reported that the increased natural ventilation caused by an opened manhole cover decreased the average relative humidity by over 70 in the headspace of a gravity sewer in ericeira portugal matos et al 2019 a further field study matos et al 2020 described that the increased ventilation resulting from opening a manhole cover induced a 38 increase in the peak air velocity accompanied by a 20 increase in the h2s removal rate although the gaseous h2s concentration was still above the safe level for human entry matos et al 2020 compared to natural ventilation which is not always reliable to mitigate the corrosion problem forced ventilation delivers higher air velocities driven by dramatic negative pressure gradients produced by blowers and fans pomeroy 1945 corsi et al 1989 edwini bonsu and steffler 2006 qian et al 2021a it is usually applied to sewer pipes with low slopes and large diameters where natural ventilation is insufficient to provide a favorable air renewal rate corsi et al 1989 despite its wide application ventilation is normally designed and operated based on rules of thumb hurse and ochre 2008 matos et al 2020 one generally used indicator for sewer ventilation design is tpd turnovers per day which refers to renewal rates of the sewer air matos et al 2020 some early engineering experience found that the h2s induced corrosion of sewer structures was effectively controlled by ventilation with a tpd of 120 thistlethwayte 1972 but this empirical indicator likely varies between sewers the airflow rate required for tpd estimation is normally estimated based on wind speed wastewater velocity or power of forced ventilators using empirical equations olson et al 1997 madsen et al 2006 ward et al 2011a however more elaborated methods based on a comprehensive understanding of interrelated physical chemical and biological processes in sewers have also been proposed wang et al 2012 in the last twenty years numerical simulations have been implemented to solve the continuity and momentum equations to calculate the airflow rates in sewers under steady state ward et al 2011b qian et al 2018 zhang et al 2020 zobeyer et al 2020 or dynamic conditions wang et al 2012 with the latter being computational demanding a dynamic airflow model that is computationally efficient is yet to be developed it has been shown in earlier studies that the bacteria induced h2s oxidation on sewer walls stops with a relative humidity of the sewer air below 85 thistlethwayte 1972 the ventilation systems generally need to achieve this target the modeling of the in sewer heat and moisture transfer processes related to the condensation and corrosion processes have been investigated in several studies jiang et al 2014a abdel aal et al 2021 figueroa et al 2021 these models are able to predict the spatial and temporal variations of sewer air temperature and relative humidity and sewer wall temperature which can be fed to corrosion models to estimate the corrosion rate see section 8 in general the humidity of the vented air increases along the ventilated pipe which increases the absorption of moisture by the sewer wall at downstream locations it is apparent that humidity control becomes more difficult with a higher inlet air humidity especially on hot and humid summer days hurse and ochre 2008 under this circumstance with inadequate ventilation the corrosion will possibly accelerate near the outlets owing to the condensation of moisture from the sewer air to enhance the drying effect under unfavorable climatic conditions a more powerful forced ventilator will be needed which also means higher costs since the electricity consumption of the forced ventilators may be a power function of its effective drying distance pomeroy 1945 it may be an economical alternative to divide a long sewer main into several areas and apply multiple mechanical fans flexible bulkheads or curtains need to be installed to isolate different areas and avoid short circuiting airflows it should also be noted that it is better to keep the airflow in the same direction as the wastewater flow and maintain a small relative speed to reduce the rate of water evaporation and h2s transfer on the wastewater surface thistlethwayte 1972 the hazardous gasses vented from sewers often require treatment with activated carbon chemical scrubbing and biofiltration and biotrickling filtration these methods have been discussed in detail in several recent reviews jiang et al 2015a shammay et al 2016 bu et al 2021 8 sewer concrete corrosion control 8 1 concrete surface treatments surface treatments are primarily achieved via concrete surface coating which can form a protective layer to prevent the ingress of aggressive substances to improve the concrete durability of existing sewers de muynck et al 2009 the coating includes cement mortar coatings polymer coating epoxy resins acrylic polyurethane polymethacrylate geopolymer coating pacheco torgal et al 2012 and metal loaded zeolites coating e g ag zn cu de muynck et al 2009 for instance almusallam et al 2003 reported that the time to initiation of corrosion of concrete coated with materials e g acrylic epoxy polyurethane was approximately 2 5 27 times longer than that observed in the uncoated one haile et al 2008 found that the leaching rates of ca2 and si4 in the mortar specimens with silver loaded zeolite coating were only 28 6 and 38 5 of the uncoated mortar specimens it is because the antimicrobial traits of silver loaded zeolite inhibited microbial activities especially the sulfide oxidizing activity it should be pointed out that the effectiveness of these measures highly depends on the quality of workmanship and the integrity of a system namely whether the system is completely sealed wang et al 2020 this is because the presence of defects may lead to the debonding of coating the debonded area and defects could serve as living habits of microorganisms resulting in the rapid buildup of corrosion in such area kopteva et al 2004 the difficulty of surface coating for corroded sewers is to prepare the concrete surface before coating matthews et al 2014 in the past decade spraying nitrite on the acidic concrete surface to form fna has been proposed as an alternative measure of surface treatment since it does not need surface preparation sun et al 2015b the feasibility of this approach was demonstrated in a field trial which was conducted in a real sewer manhole in the city of gold coast australia showing that one spray of nitrite solution fna concentration 100 1000 mg hno2 n l on the active corrosion surfaces of concrete coupons reduced the corrosion loss by 40 90 for six months and the corrosion mitigation effect lasted 15 months li et al 2022b of note these strategies are temporary methods to retard concrete corrosion which means that regular reapplication is needed 8 2 improving corrosion resistance of new concrete materials supplementary cementitious materials alternative aggregates and cements as well as antimicrobial additives have been trialed to strengthen the concrete corrosion resistance of sewers grengg et al 2018 wu et al 2020 blast furnace slag fly ash silica fume are often used as the supplementary cementitious materials to reduce the concrete permeability and hinder the ingress of aggressive substances under acidic conditions such supplementary cementitious materials are not effective in improving concrete corrosion resistance de muynck et al 2009 siliceous e g granite and gabbro and calcareous e g limestone and dolomite aggregates are commonly employed compare to the former the latter exerts better performance owing to its higher alkalinity which can react with sulfuric acid with less degree of ph reduction alexander and fourie 2011 calcium aluminate cement cac and geopolymer cement are the potential alternatives to the commonly used ordinary portland cement alexander and fourie 2011 provis et al 2015 kiliswa 2016 grengg et al 2018 antimicrobial additives e g metals zeolites ag zn cu ni nawo4 etc and calcium nitrite and antimicrobial fibers antimicrobial agents used in fiber grengg et al 2018 li et al 2020 have bacteriostatic effects on microorganisms however the information on the long term corrosion protective effectiveness of these antimicrobial agents is still missing except for calcium nitrite admixed concrete li et al 2020 for more comprehensive information on the design operation mechanisms advantages and disadvantages of these technologies readers can refer to grengg et al 2018 wang et al 2020 and wu et al 2020 9 conclusions and future perspectives hydrogen sulfide generated by sulfate reducing bacteria is the culprit of sewer corrosion and odorous emission from sewer systems the underlying mechanisms towards sulfate reducing activity and sulfide producing patterns in sewers have been thoroughly unveiled in the past decades demonstrating that the sulfate reducing bacterial activities in biofilms and or sediments are the main driving factor such knowledge substantially promoted the development of various chemical dosing strategies and their optimization for controlling odor emission and sewer corrosion while the chemical dosing measures have been proven to be effective to control sulfide and methane production high operational costs and the side effects on the microbial communities of the downstream ecosystems become the main concerns ventilation is also an effective approach for corrosion control via reducing the gaseous h2s concentration and humidity but its design so far largely relies on experiences and empirical models surface treatments of concrete pipes is another useful way to improve the concrete corrosion resistance but with high maintenance costs although the in depth understanding of effectiveness advantages fundamental mechanisms of sulfide and corrosion control strategies has already been achieved more cost effective approaches are still in need thus the following future research directions are proposed 1 exploring new chemicals and new dosing strategies for sulfide control with higher cost effectiveness many chemicals are effective to control sulfide production and or emission but the effect relies on continuous chemical dosing incurring high costs studying on new biocides to inhibit sulfate reducing bacterial activity could be a promising solution as continuous dosing is not needed however as urban water ecosystems share the same microbiota the side effects of biocide dosing on the downstream water ecosystems in wwtps and rivers should be carefully considered with this approach 2 development of mathematical models and model based technologies mathematical models have been proven to be effective to identify the main cause of odor problem and to support the optimal use of chemical dosing with online sensors model based chemical dosing systems have the potential to precisely suppress h2s emission without overdosing with the use of sewer models such as bism and sewex the sulfide control strategy can be extended from single pipes to large scale sewer networks the existing mathematical models are computationally demanding limiting their ability to support real time control machine learning algorithms could be a promising tool to simplify these models by learning from the simulation data generated by these complex models in addition mathematical models can be employed to optimize sewer design which could reduce srb abundance and h2s production and emission in sewers thereby protecting sewer systems from concrete corrosion to some extent 3 holistic management of urban water systems is highly recommended an urban water system consists of drinking water production systems water distribution networks sewer systems wwtps and the receiving urban rivers any corrosion and odor mitigating approach applied to sewers may exert side effects on wwtps and rivers especially on the microbial community in these systems the next generation technologies and strategies should consider their effects on the holistic urban water system also solutions to sewer corrosion and odor may reside in the upstream components activities namely drinking water production water distribution and water use by customers declaration of

14711,chemical dosing is the most used strategy for sulfide and methane abatement in urban sewer systems although conventional physicochemical methods such as sulfide oxidation e g oxygen nitrate precipitation e g iron salts and ph elevation e g magnesium hydroxide sodium hydroxide have been used since the last century the high chemical cost large environmental footprint and side effects on downstream treatment processes demand a sustainable and cost effective alternative to these approaches in this paper we aimed to review the currently used chemicals and significant progress made in sustainable sulfide and methane abatement technology including 1 the use of bio inhibitors 2 in situ chemical production and 3 an effective dosing strategy to enhance the cost effectiveness of chemical applications in urban sewer systems two research directions have emerged 1 online control and optimization of chemical dosing strategies and 2 integrated use of chemicals in urban sewer and wastewater treatment systems the integration of these approaches offers considerable system wide benefits however further development and comprehensive studies are required graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords sewer network sulfide and methane control chemical dosing chemical cost online control urban wastewater system integration data availability no data was used for the research described in the article 1 introduction the urban water system consists of multiple subsystems including water wastewater and stormwater collection storage treatment and distribution yuan et al 2019 these water services supply clean reliable and affordable water to households and industries and collect and treat the wastewater to meet health and environmental standards marlow et al 2013 water utilities in australia are projected to spend 5 billion aud every year on water and wastewater management urban wastewater systems of sewer networks and wastewater treatment plants wwtps contribute more than 50 of the total costs of urban water systems bureau of meterology 2022 despite huge investment urban wastewater systems still face several key challenges for instance several sewer networks are under serious threat of sulfide induced concrete corrosion the replacement and rehabilitation of damaged pipes involve a high cost estimated at hundreds of millions of dollars every year in australia taheri et al 2020 australasian corrosion association 2021 in addition the increasingly stringent nutrient removal requirements in wwtps result in a high level of chemical consumption this includes the addition of lime for ph control in the nitrification process and ferric chloride fec l 3 as well as methanol dosing for the advanced level of nitrogen n and phosphorous p removal metcalf et al 2014 besides the sludge produced in wwtp requires stabilization before disposal the cost of sludge treatment and disposal contributes 60 of operation expenditure pérez elvira et al 2006 dosing chemicals separately in different sectors of urban wastewater systems is the most common tactic employed by water utilities kulandaivelu et al 2020 however the continuous dosing of such chemicals is expensive for instance gutierrez et al 2011 reported that the oxygen o 2 injection to mitigate the formation of sulfide on 14 ml d 1 sewers in gold coast costs 1 million usd annually with the growing water demand costs are expected to increase correspondingly the global market of the chemicals used by the water industry is likely to reach 41 2 billion usd in 2030 bulk chemicals 2018 the high cost of chemical supplies raises the economic pressure on water utilities with limited budgets therefore we aimed to review the use of conventional and emerging chemicals in sewer systems and identify potential approaches to reduce chemical costs and improve urban wastewater system performance 2 major concerns in sewer systems the sewer system is a crucial part of an urban wastewater system its primary function is to collect and transport sewage from communities to the wwtp before discharge hvitved jacobsen et al 2013 depending on the topography wastewater is transported either through gravity or by pressurized mains rising mains typically biofilms are developed and attached to the pipe walls inducing a change in wastewater characteristics during transportation thus far hydrogen sulfide h 2 s and methane c h 4 emissions have been identified as the major problems in sewer systems liu et al 2015 zhang et al 2008 because of their effect on the integrity of sewers downstream wastewater treatment and the associated health and environmental risks park et al 2014 and liu et al 2015 have thoroughly analyzed the environmental parameters affecting h 2 s and c h 4 emissions the following sections thus detail the mechanisms and the environmental significance of h 2 s and c h 4 emissions 2 1 hydrogen sulfide emission within sewer systems the microbial sulfate so 4 2 reduction process takes place in the sewer biofilm and sediment of both rising mains and gravity pipes while sulfide has potential to be oxidized in gravity pipes where reaeration from gas phase can occur fig 1 sulfate reducing bacteria srb such as desulfovibrio get energy by oxidizing hydrogen h2 propionate acetate and many other organic compounds while reducing the incoming so 4 2 to form h 2 s sun et al 2014 jin et al 2018 as described in eq 1 carrera et al 2015 1 so 4 2 organic matter c o 2 h 2 s most of the srbs are anaerobic that inhabit the surface layer of biofilm and sediment i e 1 cm zuo et al 2021 fig 1 depending on ph the formed h 2 s diffuses into the water phase where it dissociates into three sulfide species h 2 s aq h s and s 2 eq 2 and eq 3 zhang et al 2008 in neutral sewage h 2 s aq and h s are the two key coexisting sulfide species while s 2 is negligible when anaerobic wastewater is transported to the gravity pipe sulfide in the water phase either gets oxidized reacts with metal ions to form insoluble metallic sulfide precipitation or emits into the sewer atmosphere 2 h 2 s aq h h s p k a 1 7 04 3 h s h s 2 p k a 2 11 96 h 2 s is the only sulfide species that can transfer between the air and water phases it may be adsorbed on aerobic biofilm in the tidal and crown zones li et al 2017 or emitted into the urban atmosphere due to ventilation causing odor nuisance nielsen et al 2005b the activity of sulfur oxidizing microorganisms som can biologically oxidize sulfide back into corrosive sulfuric acid h 2 s o 4 h 2 s o 4 then reacts with alkaline cement material to form gypsum and ettringite which are devoid of structural integrity resulting in the eventual collapse of the structure at the onset of concrete corrosion the abiotic processes of c o 2 carbonation and h 2 s acidification reduce the concrete surface ph from approximately 13 to 9 neutrophilic som nsom and acidophilic som asom are two types of soms that subsequently cause microbiologically induced sewer corrosion with a preferable growth environment at neutral and acidic ph respectively li et al 2017 after the ph of the concrete surface is abiotically reduced to 9 nsom e g thiobacillus thioparus and thiothrix spp li et al 2017 wu et al 2020 sun 2015 oxidize h 2 s to various sulfur s states depending on local ph conditions as the ph gradually decreases to 5 a suitable environment is created for the subsequent colonization by asom e g acidithiobacillus thiooxidans acidithiobacillus ferrooxidans acidithiobacillus caldus acidiphilium spp and mycobacterium spp okabe et al 2007 jiang et al 2016a hernandez et al 2002 li et al 2017 h 2 s o 4 produced by asom can penetrate to a depth of at least 2 mm and dissolve iron species from concrete or iron rebar the interaction of iron with o2 and h 2 s in concrete pores and microcracking causes rapid rusty precipitation hence aggravating concrete corrosion song et al 2020 heterotrophic bacteria and fungi have a symbiotic relationship with soms and utilize organic compounds exerted by nsom and asom li et al 2017 in addition to the concentration of h 2 s in the gas phase the water content of the concrete also affects the degree of corrosion by providing essential nutrients and microelements for the growth of soms that is the concrete surfaces periodically subjected to wastewater inoculation have greater microbial community diversity and richness which ultimately leading to severe corrosion song et al 2019 jiang et al 2016a h 2 s is identified as the leading source of microbial induced concrete corrosion an increase of h 2 s by 10 ppm will cause about 0 28 mm per year of corrosion rate increase reported by jiang et al 2016b considering other environmental factors the imminent concrete loss which can reach 10 mm per year endangers public safety by causing structure failure such as collapse li et al 2017 costs to repair and replace deteriorated sewer pipes are expected to reach several billion dollars annually worldwide jiang et al 2016a and hundreds of millions of dollars in australia alone taheri et al 2020 australasian corrosion association 2021 in addition to h 2 s several odorous compounds including volatile organic sulfur compounds and volatile organic compounds contribute to the unpleasant odors in the environment h 2 s and methanethiol mesh have the highest concentrations thousands of mg m 3 in melbourne and sydney sewer systems compared to other reduced s compounds tens of μ g m 3 wang et al 2014 the concentrations of h 2 s and mesh are typically above two exposure limit values i e the time averaged concentration over 8 hour h 2 s 7 14 mg m 3 mesh 1 3 mg m 3 and the short term exposure limit over 15 minutes h 2 s 14 21 mg m 3 mesh 1 25 mg m 3 posing potential hazards to humans jiang et al 2017 in general the problems associated with h 2 s emissions include foul odor in the vicinity of the sewer system health risks resulting from the substantial toxicity and corrosion of sewer systems and the inlet of wwtp 2 2 methane emission in addition to the microbial so 4 2 reduction process the methanogenic archea ma respiration process occurs in anaerobic sewer biofilm and sediment guisasola et al 2008 ma obligate anaerobes utilize the same substrates acetate h2 and propionate as srb although ma has a lower affinity for substrates than srb it is unlikely that methanogenesis precursors will be constrained and fail to penetrate the sewer biofilm fully consequently the production of methane continues in the deeper layer sun et al 2014 in a rising main pipeline filled with wastewater dissolved methane at a concentration of 5 30 mg l 1 is typically saturated and vented until a release point is reached this results in large greenhouse gas ghg emissions at the rising main and wwtp inlet gas release valves guisasola et al 2008 methane is a potent ghg with approximately 21 times the global warming potential of carbon dioxide c o 2 guisasola et al 2008 liu et al 2015 according to the findings of guisasola et al 2008 if a wwtp serves 100 000 person equivalents pe 23 ml d 1 50th percentile inflow 40 250 t methane will be discharged to the atmosphere per year at the wwtp s inlet which is equivalent to 900 5300 t c o 2 e annum this additional ghg provides around 12 100 more than the wwtp 5300 7400 t c o 2 e annum for a typical wwtp serving 100 000 pe guisasola et al 2008 this indicates that methane emissions from sewer systems contribute substantially to the overall carbon footprint of urban wastewater systems the accumulation of methane is explosive when exposed to air and poses a safety risk meanwhile its production consumes a great amount of chemical oxygen demand guisasola et al 2008 required for subsequent biological nutrient removal in wastewater treatment processes liu et al 2015 consequently an external carbon source addition may be necessary 3 chemical dosing in sewer systems oxygen o 2 nitrate no 3 iron salts magnesium hydroxide mg oh 2 and sodium hydroxide naoh are widely utilized in australia s water industry to treat the major problems in sewer networks ganigue et al 2011 continuous dosing of conventional chemicals except for naoh is required to control sulfide effectively resulting in high costs to address this issue the studies in the past decade have aimed to optimize the dosing strategy of conventional chemicals and propose innovative and low cost solutions for removing sulfide and methane in this regard this section focuses on various technologies that reduce sulfide and methane emissions through different control mechanisms including oxidation precipitation ph elevation and sewer biofilm activities inactivation additionally table 1 summarizes the cost effectiveness of dosing chemicals in controlling sulfide and methane in sewer systems 3 1 oxidation dissolved oxygen do concentration and oxidation reduction potential orp above 0 5 mg l 1 and 180 mv respectively can attenuate sulfide formation hvitved jacobsen et al 2013 khanal and huang 2003 the addition of oxidizing compounds therefore oxidizes the formed sulfide prevents anaerobic conditions ultimately has negative impact on microbial species growing in anaerobic sewer biofilm among the oxidants oxygen and nitrate are commonly applied nowadays ganigue et al 2011 also iron salts have multiple sulfide and methane control pathways of which oxidation is discussed here 3 1 1 oxygen o 2 oxidizes sulfide chemically and biologically as a result it limits the availability of h2s transferring from liquid to gas phases reducing severe odor and corrosion problems in addition it enhances the aerobic respiration leading to a consumption of organic matter and o 2 three processes stimulated after air o 2 injection are chemical sulfide oxidation biological sulfide oxidation and heterotrophic consumption these processes consume o 2 at a rate of 107 g o 2 m 2 d 1 5 6 go 2 m 2 d 1 and 16 g o 2 m 2 d 1 respectively gutierrez et al 2008 ganigue et al 2011 fig 2 further demonstrates the contribution of total o 2 consumption in each process since biological sulfide oxidation and heterotrophic respiration occur predominantly in biofilm large pipes with a low a v area to volume ratio limit the contribution of biofilm processes and increase o 2 utilization efficiency for sulfide oxidation consequently air o 2 injection is more suitable for large sewer systems complex intermediates are formed during the oxidation process as described in eqs 4 7 below nielsen et al 2003 due to their high stability thiosulfate and elemental s are the end products of chemical sulfide oxidation kühl et al 1998 nielsen et al 2005a because of the mass transfer limitations of o 2 in the biofilm the deeper the biofilm the more the srb is protected from o 2 and its metabolism continues therefore achieving complete reduction of sulfide in a sewer system requires a continuous aerobic condition 4 2 h s o 2 2 s 0 2 o h 5 2 h s 2 o 2 s 2 o 3 2 h 2 o 6 2 h s 3 o 2 2 so 3 2 2 h 7 2 h s 4 o 2 2 so 4 2 2 h in laboratory scale sewer reactors gutierrez et al 2008 observed a 65 reduction in daily total sulfide production when the wastewater was aerated to a high do concentration 15 25 mg o 2 l 1 using o 2 injection this is reflected in o 2 depletion before wastewater discharge and re production of sulfide therefore o 2 injection site and concentration are the key to enhancing the efficacy of sulfide control however due to the low solubility of o 2 in water under atmospheric conditions o 2 injection is employed in rising main pipes when wastewater pumps are operating recently zhang et al 2022b presented a novel air nanobubble anb injection method that increases do concentration in wastewater and improves sulfide control in gravity sewers due to the ultra fine size and negative surface charge of nanobubbles anb injection increases the do concentration to 6 04 times higher than that of conventional air injection allowing more o 2 to penetrate sewer biofilms it changes the abundance and diversity of microbial communities resulting in a decrease in the relative abundance of srb and an increase in the relative abundance of sob in laboratory scale gravity sewer reactors an average sulfide reduction of 45 36 was attained after 60 minutes of anb injection this rate of sulfide reduction was 3 75 times higher than that of the conventional o 2 injection method although traditional o 2 injection has no discernible effect on dominant srb activities it has a suppressive effect on ma activities ganigue and yuan 2014 ganigue and yuan 2014 reported a reduced methane concentration of 15 47 at the initial stage of o 2 injection 15 25 mg o 2 l 1 as the microbial community adapted to o 2 and o 2 uptake rate increased due to heterotrophic respiration the innermost layer permitted the re development of ma activities supported by an enhanced methane production rate 13 days after o 2 injection overall the long term o 2 injection has a controlling effect on methane production reducing it by approximately 30 on average 3 1 2 nitrate in contrast to o 2 injection the biological sulfide oxidation process plays a crucial role in sulfide control through no 3 dosing yang et al 2005 which is primarily driven by sulfide oxidizing nitrate reducing bacteria sonrb the oxidation of elemental s eq 9 occurs after the oxidation of s 2 to elemental s eq 8 is completed jiang et al 2009 due to the slow s 2 oxidation rate of the second step eq 9 which is approximately 15 of the rate of the first step eq 8 insoluble elemental s accumulates on biofilm furthermore a part of elemental s transfers to polysulfide which is more bioavailable liang et al 2016 rabus et al 2013 yang et al 2005 since the dosed no 3 in sewage is also consumed by heterotrophic denitrification it is often depleted in a pipeline further downstream notably no 3 does not suppress srb activity under no 3 free conditions accumulated elemental s or polysulfide is further reduced mohanakrishnan et al 2009 jiang et al 2013b auguet et al 2015 liang et al 2016 furthermore long term nitrate dosing promotes thicker biofilm growth and reduces chemical penetration liang et al 2023 generally rapid sulfide rebound has long been considered a problem in nitrate receiving biofilms 8 5 s 2 2 no 3 12 h 5 s 0 n 2 6 h 2 o 9 5 s 0 6 no 3 2 h 2 o 5 so 4 2 3 n 2 4 h in the laboratory scale sewer reactor no 3 concentrations of 30 67 mgn l 1 initially induced a complete sulfide control and a quick sulfide recovery was observed after nitrate vanished mohanakrishnan et al 2009 jiang et al 2013b jiang et al 2009 yang et al 2021 the average sulfide discharges reduction is 46 66 methane control behaves similarly auguet et al 2015 jiang et al 2013b at the starting phase of no 3 dosing no 3 can fully penetrate biofilms resulting in negligible methane concentration in sewer effluent the complete methane control is a result of the instantaneous shock effect of redox potential elevation given that sonrb and hnrb consume no 3 the bulk no 3 concentration is expected to decrease it restricts nitrate penetration and promotes the restoration of ma activities in the innermost layer of the biofilm fig 3 therefore ma activities are partially suppressed and the concentration of methane discharged decreased by 42 from 77 7 mgcod l 1 to 45 mgcod l 1 jiang et al 2013b in most cases the considerable no 3 consumption by the heterotrophic process is inevitable consequently the rebound anaerobic conditions downstream of the dose point reduce the efficacy of sulfide and methane control to alleviate this drawback efforts have been made with a focus on the dosing sites and combination chemical dosing approaches dosing no 3 close to the hotspot of sulfide emission can sustain anoxic conditions between the site of dosing and the point of sulfide control in the laboratory scale system auguet et al 2015 yang et al 2021 the downstream no 3 dosing method 50 60 mgn l 1 successfully removed sulfide moreover the methane accumulated from upstream was oxidized by methanotrophs while reducing no 3 or no 2 auguet et al 2015 it was the first publication to describe methane oxidation in a no 3 dosing sewer system and the no 3 consumption between sulfide and methane oxidation was unknown the methane discharged was thus reduced to 50 additionally zhang et al 2022a evaluated the synergistic effect of no 3 and sodium nitroprusside snp on sulfide removal snp is a cardiovascular drug and is generally used for pulmonary hypertension treatment 100 sulfide control was achieved by combining 30 mgn l 1 no 3 and 20 mgn l 1 snp due to the selective inhibition of denitrification more no 3 is accessible for biological sulfide oxidation however the application of snp in sewer systems poses several concerns and challenges snp is toxic to human cells at concentrations 1000 μ m 298 mg l 1 although the recommended snp concentration 20 mg l 1 is lower than the safe concentration of snp the community s concern regarding environmental and health risks from the use of snp remains uncertain snp is unstable and decomposes into a toxic cyanide byproduct when exposed to light transport handling and storage of snp are therefore associated with serious safety concerns 3 1 3 iron salts dosing ferric ion f e 3 into sewer systems oxidizes dissolved sulfide while reducing itself to ferrous ion f e 2 for subsequent precipitation processes as discussed in section 3 2 under the typical ph and redox potential in sewer systems elemental s is the final oxidation product which is less bioavailable for srb compared to so 4 2 firer et al 2008 3 2 precipitation iron salts particularly fec l 2 and fec l 3 have been widely used to control sulfide build up in sewer systems ganigue et al 2011 haaning nielsen et al 2005 ferrous ion f e 2 removes dissolved sulfide through precipitation as ferrous sulfide fes eq 11 whereas ferric ion f e 3 oxidizes sulfide and reduces itself to f e 2 which can subsequently precipitate dissolved sulfide eq 10 zhang et al 2009 firer et al 2008 saracevic et al 2007 in the investigation conducted by rebosura and co workers adding f e 3 10 mgfe l 1 in sewer reactors removed 3 9 0 4 mgs l 1 with a molar ratio of 1 33 f e 3 s 2 indicating a relatively 47 9 decrease in sulfide concentration in sewer effluent compared to the control without iron dosing rebosura et al 2018 10 2 f e 3 s 2 2 f e 2 s s 0 11 f e 2 s 2 fe s s while iron dosing is a reliable measure the overall sulfide removal effectiveness is dependent on the ph of the sewage only s 2 among the three soluble sulfide forms may react with f e 3 to form insoluble metallic sulfide therefore alkaline ph circumstances are more favorable for sulfide precipitation however it should be noted that ferric salts are acidic compounds and their addition can decrease the ph of wastewater it has been reported that a minimum of 200 additional iron dosing is required to reach a sulfide concentration of 0 1 mg l 1 at the sewer effluent when the ph drops from 7 to 6 5 firer et al 2008 moreover iron salts are liquid chemicals the transport storage and handling of the hazardous iron salts are associated with the occupational health and safety concerns and chemical spillage risk pikaar et al 2015 lin et al 2017b haas et al 2008 the removal of sulfide through the use of electrochemically generated f e 2 f e 3 has recently attracted considerable interest lin et al 2017b proposed a unique method for simultaneously generating iron cations and hydroxyl anions in sewer using electrochemical cells a comprehensive full scale study has proved the feasibility of such an alternative approach pikaar et al 2019 another iron derived electrochemical product is nanoparticle magnetite f e 3 o 4 lin et al 2017a from practical and economic perspectives the in situ generated chemical achieves a comparable sulfide control a reduction of h 2 s concentration by 95 4 98 to the conventional iron dosing and reduces chemical cost from 10 9 170 6 aud m l 1 ganigue et al 2011 to 17 9 36 2 aud m l 1 lin et al 2017b lin et al 2017a 3 3 ph elevation as previously stated in sewer systems h 2 s and h s are the predominant sulfide species at neutral ph at ph values less than 7 04 h 2 s predominates and at ph 8 5 only 8 of the sulfide is h 2 s at ph 9 0 h 2 s level is less than 1 ph affects the amount of h 2 s that can be vented to the headspace mg oh 2 and naoh are two alkali chemical options for raising the ph in sewer systems dosage of mg oh 2 raises the ph of sewage between 8 5 and 9 0 due to its poor solubility k s p 10 11 1 morel et al 1993 the slow mg oh 2 dissolution rate leaves residual and unreacted alkalinity in sewers these components are available in reacidification gutierrez et al 2009 and by increasing the ph they prolong the efficacy of the sulfide control technique compared to mg oh 2 naoh is a strong alkali that instantly raises the ph of a sewer system ganigue et al 2011 additionally the use of alkali chemicals can inhibit the activities of srb and ma regardless of whether a gradual or instant ph elevation strategy these effects will be further discussed in section 3 4 3 4 inactivation of sewer biofilm activities the inactivation of srb and ma activities is preferable compared to the subsequent removal after sulfide and methane production beside alkali compounds and iron salts the intermittent dosing of fna ferrate fe vi or fa has recently emerged as a potential technology in sulfide and methane abatement this approach aims to minimize economic costs and environmental impacts 3 4 1 sodium hydroxide naoh produces a ph shock 10 5 12 5 to deactivate sewer biofilms and reduces srb and ma activities gutierrez et al 2014 in the laboratory scale investigation a 6 hour ph shock reduced srb activity by 85 90 recovery began within 1 3 days and was completed within 3 14 days this indicated that the ph shock s effect on sulfide production lasted for 3 4 days this recovery process also applies to the field study gutierrez et al 2014 in the field study naoh was dosed twice weekly for six hours in the sewer it elevated the ph to 11 5 and decreased sulfide concentration by 67 the partial removal of sulfide was attributed to a ph reduction resulting from the plug flow nature of sewer pipes and the biological activity along the sewer pipes gutierrez et al 2014 since ma activity was effectively inhibited even with a moderate ph elevation e g ph 9 gutierrez et al 2009 it was effectively managed at ph 11 5 gutierrez et al 2014 it is important to note that the transportation storage and use of concentrated caustic compounds purchased as 50 w w always have inherent safety risks ganigue et al 2011 in situ caustic compound generation from wastewater through electrochemical systems may be the preferred method since it not only eliminates the requirement for handling but also minimizes the chemical costs indeed 2 5 0 0 w w naoh was produced directly from sewer at an average coulombic efficiency of 84 1 1 1 while the cost of naoh for ph elevation ph 11 decreased from aud 39 6 99 1 ml of wastewater to aud 11 9 ml lin et al 2015 ganigue et al 2011 pikaar et al 2013 the o2 generated from the anode compartment improved sulfide control performance and prolonged the recovery period compared to ph shock alone lin et al 2017c 3 4 2 iron salts cao et al 2019 proposed an alternative control mechanism where a low frequency high dose f e 3 dosing technique was utilized in addition to the precipitation reactions between s 2 and f e 3 excess f e 3 can diffuse into biofilms and inhibit srb and ma activities it is probably due to three factors i f e 3 toxicity ii the high orp induced by f e 3 and iii the deposition of sulfide precipitation on the top layer of biofilm which hinders so 4 2 and organic matter penetration the specific mechanism underlying the inhibitory effect has not been identified rebosura et al 2018 reported adding f e 3 10 mgfe l 1 at an interval of 6 h did not cause an inhibition effect in sewer biofilm activity the control of sulfide was primarily attributed to sulfide precipitation and a significant methane control was absent rebosura et al 2018 however zhang et al 2009 observed an 80 reduction in c h 4 production rate in a sewer reactor modified to f e 3 addition 21 mgfe l 1 this indicated that iron has a considerable inhibitory effect on ma activities the inconsistency is possible due to the different doses of f e 3 in these two studies resulting in different control mechanisms 3 4 3 free nitrous acid in studies conducted by jiang et al 2010 and mohanakrishnan et al 2008 srb and ma activities were completely suppressed after three weeks of continuous nitrite dosing at 40 120 mgn l 1 the slow recovery rate is responsible for the regrowth of srb and ma this harmful effect was generated by the formation of free nitrous acid fna as opposed to nitrite itself due to the strong biocidal effect of fna it has been extensively studied for decades and implemented in numerous wastewater management applications duan et al 2020 zhou et al 2011 many small molecules such as dinitrogen trioxide nitrogen dioxide and nitric oxide derived from fna are permeable to cell membranes they affect the intracellular environment interrupt metabolism and destroy cell membranes the effectiveness of fna in controlling sulfide and methane formation is dependent on three key parameters dosing concentration dosage duration and dosing interval jiang et al 2011a since it is a biofilm removal method successive dose will permanently deactivate biofilm activities considering the cost an intermittent fna dose of 0 26 mgn l 1 for 12 h every 4 5 days is sufficient to lower sulfide and methane production by 80 and 90 respectively jiang et al 2011a other field studies conducted in australia usa and germany have confirmed the full scale application of the fna dosing strategy jiang et al 2013a nguyen and marano 2016 despot et al 2021 jiang et al 2013a reported that during the 6 month study no biofilm adaption was observed in fna receiving sewers in addition a single dose of fna 0 26 mgn l 1 reduced average sulfide levels by 80 for 10 days after administration this was consistent with the findings of despot et al 2021 and nguyen and marano 2016 importantly intermittently dosing of fna is a cost effective strategy compared to the general cost of chemicals applied 40 180 aud m l 1 reported by ganigue et al 2011 the lower cost of fna application 10 aud m l 1 highlights the opportunity to replace the conventionally used commodity chemicals jiang et al 2013a in light of the successful fna application zheng et al 2017 proposed a waste to value technology that provides the same benefits as a chemical fna agent by separating urine and then converting it by 50 to nitrite economically and environmentally urine derived nitrite reduces chemical costs by 69 although this approach has not been validated through a field experiment the positive results make it even more competitive as a fna dosing strategy 3 4 4 free ammonia free ammonia fa has been reported as an inhibitor of srb and ma activities dai et al 2017 dosing ammonia n h 3 rich solution is expected to prevent sulfide and c h 4 formation zuo et al 2020 reported that an fa concentration of 154 mgn l 1 induced a microbial cellular viability response of 35 3 after a 24 hour exposure with a maximum value of 28 irrespective of additional increase in fa concentration thus certain microorganisms developed fa resistance the analysis of the microbial community indicated that desulfobulbus is highly resistant to n h 3 compared to other srb genera zuo et al 2020 therefore dosing urine or fa results in the modification of the microbial community structure desulfobulbus is likely to become a relatively abundant srb genera contributing to the residual sulfide production future detailed studies may shed light on how those microorganisms adapted to high strength fa conditions urine contains 4 gn l 1 of fa at a ph of 9 making it a suitable replacement for chemical fa agents such as ammonium chloride after each dose of diluted urine equivalent to 154 mgn l 1 over 24 h the concentrations of sulfide and methane decreased rapidly from 13 2 2 2 mgs l 1 and 6 5 2 7 mgc h 4 l 1 to 5 mgs l 1 and 3 mgc h 4 l 1 respectively notably the srb activity gradually recovered after each dose in this respect successive dosing of urine from sewage was thought to be more effective zuo et al 2020 unlike the other urine based approach zheng et al 2017 this proposed fa derived from urine approach does not require on site nitrification or a nitritation reactor which contributes to 50 of the total cost regarding this it is crucial to reduce the operational cost from 1145 aud y 1 to 142 aud y 1 zuo et al 2020 in addition reusing urine for sulfide and methane control reduces life cycle energy assumptions and greenhouse gas emissions during the production and transportation of chemicals by 96 97 and 80 93 respectively zuo et al 2020 zuo et al 2023 although the economic and life cycle assessment analysis showed the viability of using fa from urine in sewers there is still cause for concern regarding long exposure time urine availability and odor issue caused by high strength fa alternatively a high fa concentration in wastewater can be achieved by ph elevation since the concentration of n h 3 is strongly ph sensitive with a pka of 9 25 for n h 4 n h 3 h gutierrez et al 2009 a higher fa concentration from a higher ph suppresses microbial activity gutierrez et al 2009 revealed that at ph 8 6 fa concentration of 7 7 mgn l 1 and 9 0 fa concentration of 15 3 mgn l 1 achievable by doing mg oh 2 the sulfide production rate decreased by 30 and 50 respectively above 8 6 ph the methanogenic activity was minimal however the mechanism has not been elucidated in detail gutierrez et al 2009 sharma et al 2014 3 4 5 ferrate fe vi is usually used as a green chemical for emerging organic pollutant removal due to its multifunctional oxidation disinfection and coagulation properties lee et al 2009 wang et al 2021 recent research has successfully established for the first time its potent inactivation of srb and ma activities yan et al 2020 the inactivation rate viability of 17 6 of microorganisms exposed to 120 mgfe l 1 was comparable to that reported by jiang et al 2011b for fna dosing viability 15 there are several potential contributing factors to the inactivation of microorganisms first among oxidants fe vi is recognized as the one with the highest redox potential e 0 2 2 v through the rapid decomposition of fe vi the generation of reactive oxygen species of o 2 and h 2 o 2 cause cellular membrane damage and dysfunction second fe vi degrades extracellular polymeric substance components in sewer biofilms via charge neutralization and adsorption of hydrolyzed f e 3 zhang et al 2016 it loosens sewer biofilm structure and consequently aids the chemical penetration and reinforces the biocidal effect after the first dose of fe vi sulfide and methane productions were completely inactivated and the subsequent recovery resembled to microbial regrowth this was consistent with the other biocidal agents mentioned above a fe vi dosage of 180 mgfe l 1 within 15 min of exposure every 4 5 days yields an effective sulfide control of 80 and a complete methane control it should be noted that fe vi treatment requires a shorter contact time compared to other biocidal agents 6 24 h in this way it decreased the amount of chemicals required for each dosing event yan et al 2020 4 dosing control and optimization chemical dosing of sewage is universally recognized as an efficient approach for sulfide control in sewers with annual chemical usage costing billions of dollars worldwide ganigue et al 2011 the scheme for chemical dosing which determines not only the sulfide control performance but also the capital cost is important water industries commonly use chemical dosing via the following approaches 1 constant chemical dosing which maintains the dosing rate at a constant value regardless of the flow and extent of biological processes occurring in sewers 2 flow paced dosing which regulates the chemical dosage based on sewage flow rate to maintain a constant chemical concentration at the dosing location and 3 profiled dosing in which the dosing rates are varied according to a predefined profile which was designed based on empirical formula li et al 2019 such predetermined profiles or empirical methods may yield satisfactory performance if real world conditions closely resemble the planned scenarios however the sewage hydraulics and compositions fluctuate from time to time leading to deviations from the conventional scenarios which were considered for profile based dosing design resulting in unsatisfactory control performance and a high chemical cost therefore chemical dosing should be controlled online by regulating the sewage pumping stations spss and dosing units rather than predetermined regimes depending on the current and future changes of sewage flow and compositions multiple controllers have been proposed and demonstrated for sulfide management in a single sewer pipe an online control strategy for chemical dosing for sulfide mitigation in a rising main was developed ganigué et al 2016 the control objective was to maintain a predetermined ph setpoint at the end of a rising main pipe by dynamically controlling the mg oh 2 dosing rate at the spss furthermore this method has been successfully demonstrated through real world case studies for dosing fec l 2 in a single sewer pipe ganigué et al 2018 however sewer corrosion and odor problems are rarely confined to a single pipe but are widely distributed across an intricate network of connecting pipes and distributed spss the intermittent operation of spss subjected to prespecified wet well duty levels results in sewage slugs dominated by certain sewage streams which considerably disrupt chemical delivery to provide effective sulfide control across the network sewage flows should be regulated by scheduling the operation of at least certain spss so that sewage without dosed chemicals can be adequately mixed with sewage streams from the dosing location carrying the dosed chemical the first step is to identify the target location of chemical dosing i e corrosion and odor hotspots which is generally the discharge manhole after a rising main network or manholes and junction nodes along the gravity sewers the next task is to predict sulfide methane generation across the network including the hotspots comprehensive models based on prior knowledge have been developed to simulate the physical chemical and biological processes in the sewer system such as wastewater aerobic anaerobic transformation in sewers wats model nielsen et al 2008 and sewex model sharma et al 2008 to support real time prediction of sewage states simplified models or data driven models are established which greatly accelerate the computation efficiency while ensuring competitive accuracy with mechanistic models li et al 2022a li et al 2022b both types of models are applied to provide the distribution of sulfide methane based on sewage flow and composition such information is used in turn to determine the most appropriate chemical requirement for the target locations the final step is deciding the most cost effective dosing actions to achieve the desired chemical distribution this is the most important as well as most difficult section involved in dosing optimization which has drawn increasing interest from the water industry and academia during the past years liu et al 2016 developed an event driven model predictive control empc strategy for regulating the distribution of mg oh 2 in a sewer system with rising mains using a greedy algorithm the pumping rates of the controlled sps with mg oh 2 dosage were optimized to maintain the chemical concentration at the target locations at a predetermined level this method is efficient and can be executed in real time it can find solutions to achieve the chemical concentration above the level which however may not be close to the control objective li et al 2022a for the first time proposed a real time optimization methodology to conduct mg oh 2 dosing in a sewer network through scheduling multiple spss an improved elephant optimization ieho algorithm was developed to search for the optimal decision variables dosing quantities by considering the current network states sewage flow rate and chemical distribution and projecting the future network states the control objective of this study was to maintain a constant chemical concentration at the discharge point of a rising main sewer system compared to the empc approach this control strategy saved 36 on chemicals to improve the online control method for dosing chemicals in a sewer network consisting of both rising mains and gravity mains li et al 2022b developed a swift hydraulic model for predicting the free surface flow in gravity sewers and integrated the model with the ieho algorithm the control strategy was demonstrated in a simulation study of dosing naoh in a real world sewer system in south australia which accelerated the speed of decision making by thousands of times and reduced the chemical cost by 40 compared to the industry used flow paced dosing real time control rtc which optimizes dosing actions based on the dynamic flow of sewage and sulfide production has been shown to outperform conventional dosing methods regarding sulfide control performance and chemical usage also as for control performance evaluation measurement of sulfide and methane based on manual sampling with off line laboratory based chromatography analysis is replacing by online sensors for monitoring the compounds in both gas phase and liquid phase at more interested locations in higher frequency ye et al 2022 liu et al 2014 pikaar et al 2019 fig 4 demonstrates a diagram of the digital platform for real time dosing control li et al 2022b chemical dosing is triggered by the start of sewage pumps and historical data recorded by the online sensors are retrieved and sent to the central computer through a wireless network at the same moment these data are used as model input by the sewer process model to determine the control objective and predict the control performance for each potential dosing action followed by the optimization algorithm to pick the most efficient one in the digital era to implement rtc strategies for chemical dosing first and foremost is to ensure the data quality directly retrieved from the sensors because these data are the source of offline models and algorithms and online chemical dosage decisions data driven techniques can be developed for data assurance fault diagnosis for quick scanning of the sewer infrastructure can also be integrated at this stage moreover decision making models should be able to accurately predict the physical chemical and biological processes involved in sewer systems under various weather conditions hybrid models consisting of both prior knowledge and data driven approaches may be a strong alternative for the complex environment in addition the optimization algorithm software must provide a satisfactory set of control actions in a limited time usually seconds the issue arises in the vast search space of potential actions and the control horizon must encompass the time between the dosed chemical entering the sewer network and its arrival at the control point e g corrosion or odor hotspots advanced computing paradigms such as parallel computing and distributed computing can improve optimization from the hardware perspective importantly it should be noted that the proposed rtc may not achieve its full potential in practice that is the dosing location or the controllable dosing units may differ from the theoretically optimal options because the sewer system is operated under stringent security regulations for widespread adoption of rtc a generic optimization algorithm for dosage control must be able to deliver the optimal dosing actions under varied control conditions without requiring excessive modification 5 integrated use of sewer dosed chemicals in urban wastewater systems although the above mentioned chemicals has been identified as effective measure to control sulfide and methane production in sewer systems continuous or intermittent dosing of such chemicals imposes high economic costs on water utilities gutierrez et al 2011 therefore finding an optimal solution regarding performance and cost is essential integrated wastewater management is an emerging approach that considers its effects on the downstream treatment processes sharma et al 2012 pikaar et al 2014 hence optimizing system wide performance and providing environmental and social benefits to the communities iron salts are widely used chemicals to control sulfide in approximately 66 of treated sewage apart from being applied to sewer systems they are commonly dosed in downstream treatment processes for phosphorous and sulfide removal as well as for sludge settleability dewaterability enhancement however it is important to note fec l 3 is an acidic compound which can affect sewage ph and sulfide control effectiveness in sewer systems pikaar et al 2019 lin et al 2017b recently there has been a new perspective on acidification effect of fec l 3 in urban wastewater management the use of fec l 3 in chemically enhanced primary treatment cept or side stream returned sludge can consume alkalinity and lead to an acidic condition that selectively suppressed nitrite oxidizing bacteria nob achieving mainstream short cut nitrogen removal process hu et al 2021 hu et al 2023a hu et al 2023b additionally in anaerobic sludge treatment pre treating thickened waste activated sludge twas with combined dosing of fec l 3 and nitrite yields better sludge degradability destruction and recovery enabling the conversion of organic matters to methane and phosphorus rich biosolids for use as fertilizers calderon et al 2021 apart from the generally accepted coagulation and precipitation mechanisms of fec l 3 it plays a beneficial role in pushing urban wastewater treatment towards energy neutrality practical implementation of the integrated concept from laboratory to full scale studies has demonstrated that the multifaced benefits of iron salts can be achieved at once by dosing iron salts in sewer systems however it should be emphasized that iron salts are the only chemicals that have been comprehensively investigated and evaluated current studies confine to the cost effectiveness of chemicals on sulfide and methane control in sewer systems and overlook the interconnection of each process unit in urban wastewater systems when developing a solution therefore future studies should orient towards the integrated management of chemicals enabling sustainable improvement of performance and reduction of chemical footprint of an entire urban wastewater system this section aims to review the current progress on integrated use of iron salts and to discuss the main effects of other chemicals on downstream treatment processes which require further studies in the past five years extensive research on the integrated use of iron salt dosing in sewers has been done through the use of laboratory scale continuous flow reactors including sewers wastewater treatment reactors and anaerobic sludge digesters rebosura et al 2018 found that iron dosing in sewers not only effectively precipitates 4 3 0 5 mgs l 1 sulfide in sewer discharge but it also reduces p concentration by 4 7 0 5 mgp l 1 in wwtp effluent improves sludge settleability digested sludge dewaterability by 17 7 1 0 and decreases sulfide concentration by 88 5 1 0 in anaerobic digestion long term field studies confirm the various beneficial uses of iron in urban wastewater system salehin et al 2019 kulandaivelu et al 2020 additionally due to the adsorbing property of fes the f e 3 dosing in sewers facilitates rapid removal of organic micropollutants within minutes in this regard it reduces the organic micropollutant load in wastewater which adds an extra value to the wwtp kulandaivelu et al 2019 in addition to fec l 3 injecting iron rich drinking water sludge fe dws into sewers can improve overall system wide performance rebosura et al 2020 however the sludge aging time and primary clarifier impair the capacity and reactivity of fe dws salehin et al 2020 showed that the fe dws with a 30 day storage period has a lower sulfide removal capacity 0 60 0 01 mmol s mmol fe than the fresh fe dws day 1 1 30 0 02 mmol s mmol fe in this regard the discharge of fe dws into sewers becomes feasible when a wwtp is located near a hotspot where sewer corrosion and odor complaints are high due to the coagulating nature of iron salts 85 of fe is retained in the primary sludge for anaerobic digestion whereas only 15 remains for further downstream phosphorus removal rebosura et al 2021 it consequently reduces the availability of iron for downstream phosphate removal compared to the previous study when the primary clarifier absents rebosura et al 2020 utilizing a synergistic combination of magnetic separation and alkaline washing the fe rich anaerobic digested sludge is subsequently reused and recycled salehin et al 2019 the installation of a neodymium magnet can recover 11 15 3 of the vivianite found in digested sewage sludge of which 92 2 was present as vivianite after alkaline washing vivianite transforms into ferrihydrite an effective iron oxide adsorbent it can also be further used for sulfide control in sewers although this proposed solution has a low recovery rate it sheds light on a circular iron management strategy the above mentioned studies demonstrate the fate of iron salts in complete urban wastewater systems and their potential flow on effects on downstream processes fig 5 through the precipitation of fes fec l 3 or fe dws doses removes sulfide in sewer networks under aerobic circumstances when fes enters activated sludge bioreactors fe2 is released and re oxidized the oxidized iron can precipitate p in the form of vivianite and can be retained in waste activated sludge subsequently adding fe rich sludge to anaerobic sludge digestion decreases the level of dissolved sulfide by a mechanism similar to that of conventional iron salts dosing in sewers the vivianite content in the solid phase of digested sludge can be partially recovered to another type of iron salt ferrihydrite thus the integrated approach to iron salts improves the performance of wwtps and promotes the sustainability of sewer networks however the integrated approach has not been applied thoroughly to other chemicals hence fig 6 demonstrates the potential impacts of the sewer dosing chemicals on sewer system wastewater compositions and wastewater treatment plants for instance adding o 2 no 3 to sewage transforms anaerobic conditions into aerobic anoxic conditions the primary control mechanisms weaken srb and ma metabolism and chemically and biologically oxidize sulfide meanwhile the development of heterotrophic bacteria and the redevelopment of srb and ma at deeper layers of biofilm use high levels of carbon sources bentzen et al 1995 which has a negative effect on downstream biological n and p removal while bio inhibitors or alkalis fundamentally impair srb and ma function more carbon sources are saved wastewater is also sensitive to physicochemical process changes such as ph after adding alkalis or fna fa which are the key factors influencing the nitrification rate fe vi and mg oh 2 may serve as solids in the sewer system and provide the beneficial effects of divalent cations f e 2 or m g 2 on sludge treatment such as dewaterability destruction and stabilization 6 conclusions and perspectives sulfide and methane emissions in urban sewer systems contribute to severe sewer odor corrosion and ghg emission issues although conventional chemical strategies such as o 2 no 3 injection use of iron salts mg oh 2 and naoh have been widely used in sewer systems there are still concerns regarding the high economic costs considerable environmental impacts and downstream side effects in this review it provides a comprehensive overview of chemical uses in sewer systems with a particular attention given to sulfide and methane control mechanism and effectiveness chemical dosing control and optimization and the flow on effects of sewer dosed chemicals on wwtps recent research has focused on developing innovative techniques such as in situ chemical generation via electrochemical cells intensive biofilm inactivation and the combination of two different chemicals to reduce the cost and energy consumption associated with chemical production and transportation however current sewer chemical application lacks widespread implementation of the real time chemical dosing control and optimization due to the complexity nature of sewer systems in addition the integrated urban wastewater management concept limits on the use of iron salts it is critical to develop an integrated chemical assessment and implement this valuable concept with multiple chemical options therefore further development on real time control and optimization and integrated application on chemical uses may provide the sustainable tools necessary to improve the management of urban sewer systems this could substantially reduce environmental concerns and economic burdens in

14711,chemical dosing is the most used strategy for sulfide and methane abatement in urban sewer systems although conventional physicochemical methods such as sulfide oxidation e g oxygen nitrate precipitation e g iron salts and ph elevation e g magnesium hydroxide sodium hydroxide have been used since the last century the high chemical cost large environmental footprint and side effects on downstream treatment processes demand a sustainable and cost effective alternative to these approaches in this paper we aimed to review the currently used chemicals and significant progress made in sustainable sulfide and methane abatement technology including 1 the use of bio inhibitors 2 in situ chemical production and 3 an effective dosing strategy to enhance the cost effectiveness of chemical applications in urban sewer systems two research directions have emerged 1 online control and optimization of chemical dosing strategies and 2 integrated use of chemicals in urban sewer and wastewater treatment systems the integration of these approaches offers considerable system wide benefits however further development and comprehensive studies are required graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords sewer network sulfide and methane control chemical dosing chemical cost online control urban wastewater system integration data availability no data was used for the research described in the article 1 introduction the urban water system consists of multiple subsystems including water wastewater and stormwater collection storage treatment and distribution yuan et al 2019 these water services supply clean reliable and affordable water to households and industries and collect and treat the wastewater to meet health and environmental standards marlow et al 2013 water utilities in australia are projected to spend 5 billion aud every year on water and wastewater management urban wastewater systems of sewer networks and wastewater treatment plants wwtps contribute more than 50 of the total costs of urban water systems bureau of meterology 2022 despite huge investment urban wastewater systems still face several key challenges for instance several sewer networks are under serious threat of sulfide induced concrete corrosion the replacement and rehabilitation of damaged pipes involve a high cost estimated at hundreds of millions of dollars every year in australia taheri et al 2020 australasian corrosion association 2021 in addition the increasingly stringent nutrient removal requirements in wwtps result in a high level of chemical consumption this includes the addition of lime for ph control in the nitrification process and ferric chloride fec l 3 as well as methanol dosing for the advanced level of nitrogen n and phosphorous p removal metcalf et al 2014 besides the sludge produced in wwtp requires stabilization before disposal the cost of sludge treatment and disposal contributes 60 of operation expenditure pérez elvira et al 2006 dosing chemicals separately in different sectors of urban wastewater systems is the most common tactic employed by water utilities kulandaivelu et al 2020 however the continuous dosing of such chemicals is expensive for instance gutierrez et al 2011 reported that the oxygen o 2 injection to mitigate the formation of sulfide on 14 ml d 1 sewers in gold coast costs 1 million usd annually with the growing water demand costs are expected to increase correspondingly the global market of the chemicals used by the water industry is likely to reach 41 2 billion usd in 2030 bulk chemicals 2018 the high cost of chemical supplies raises the economic pressure on water utilities with limited budgets therefore we aimed to review the use of conventional and emerging chemicals in sewer systems and identify potential approaches to reduce chemical costs and improve urban wastewater system performance 2 major concerns in sewer systems the sewer system is a crucial part of an urban wastewater system its primary function is to collect and transport sewage from communities to the wwtp before discharge hvitved jacobsen et al 2013 depending on the topography wastewater is transported either through gravity or by pressurized mains rising mains typically biofilms are developed and attached to the pipe walls inducing a change in wastewater characteristics during transportation thus far hydrogen sulfide h 2 s and methane c h 4 emissions have been identified as the major problems in sewer systems liu et al 2015 zhang et al 2008 because of their effect on the integrity of sewers downstream wastewater treatment and the associated health and environmental risks park et al 2014 and liu et al 2015 have thoroughly analyzed the environmental parameters affecting h 2 s and c h 4 emissions the following sections thus detail the mechanisms and the environmental significance of h 2 s and c h 4 emissions 2 1 hydrogen sulfide emission within sewer systems the microbial sulfate so 4 2 reduction process takes place in the sewer biofilm and sediment of both rising mains and gravity pipes while sulfide has potential to be oxidized in gravity pipes where reaeration from gas phase can occur fig 1 sulfate reducing bacteria srb such as desulfovibrio get energy by oxidizing hydrogen h2 propionate acetate and many other organic compounds while reducing the incoming so 4 2 to form h 2 s sun et al 2014 jin et al 2018 as described in eq 1 carrera et al 2015 1 so 4 2 organic matter c o 2 h 2 s most of the srbs are anaerobic that inhabit the surface layer of biofilm and sediment i e 1 cm zuo et al 2021 fig 1 depending on ph the formed h 2 s diffuses into the water phase where it dissociates into three sulfide species h 2 s aq h s and s 2 eq 2 and eq 3 zhang et al 2008 in neutral sewage h 2 s aq and h s are the two key coexisting sulfide species while s 2 is negligible when anaerobic wastewater is transported to the gravity pipe sulfide in the water phase either gets oxidized reacts with metal ions to form insoluble metallic sulfide precipitation or emits into the sewer atmosphere 2 h 2 s aq h h s p k a 1 7 04 3 h s h s 2 p k a 2 11 96 h 2 s is the only sulfide species that can transfer between the air and water phases it may be adsorbed on aerobic biofilm in the tidal and crown zones li et al 2017 or emitted into the urban atmosphere due to ventilation causing odor nuisance nielsen et al 2005b the activity of sulfur oxidizing microorganisms som can biologically oxidize sulfide back into corrosive sulfuric acid h 2 s o 4 h 2 s o 4 then reacts with alkaline cement material to form gypsum and ettringite which are devoid of structural integrity resulting in the eventual collapse of the structure at the onset of concrete corrosion the abiotic processes of c o 2 carbonation and h 2 s acidification reduce the concrete surface ph from approximately 13 to 9 neutrophilic som nsom and acidophilic som asom are two types of soms that subsequently cause microbiologically induced sewer corrosion with a preferable growth environment at neutral and acidic ph respectively li et al 2017 after the ph of the concrete surface is abiotically reduced to 9 nsom e g thiobacillus thioparus and thiothrix spp li et al 2017 wu et al 2020 sun 2015 oxidize h 2 s to various sulfur s states depending on local ph conditions as the ph gradually decreases to 5 a suitable environment is created for the subsequent colonization by asom e g acidithiobacillus thiooxidans acidithiobacillus ferrooxidans acidithiobacillus caldus acidiphilium spp and mycobacterium spp okabe et al 2007 jiang et al 2016a hernandez et al 2002 li et al 2017 h 2 s o 4 produced by asom can penetrate to a depth of at least 2 mm and dissolve iron species from concrete or iron rebar the interaction of iron with o2 and h 2 s in concrete pores and microcracking causes rapid rusty precipitation hence aggravating concrete corrosion song et al 2020 heterotrophic bacteria and fungi have a symbiotic relationship with soms and utilize organic compounds exerted by nsom and asom li et al 2017 in addition to the concentration of h 2 s in the gas phase the water content of the concrete also affects the degree of corrosion by providing essential nutrients and microelements for the growth of soms that is the concrete surfaces periodically subjected to wastewater inoculation have greater microbial community diversity and richness which ultimately leading to severe corrosion song et al 2019 jiang et al 2016a h 2 s is identified as the leading source of microbial induced concrete corrosion an increase of h 2 s by 10 ppm will cause about 0 28 mm per year of corrosion rate increase reported by jiang et al 2016b considering other environmental factors the imminent concrete loss which can reach 10 mm per year endangers public safety by causing structure failure such as collapse li et al 2017 costs to repair and replace deteriorated sewer pipes are expected to reach several billion dollars annually worldwide jiang et al 2016a and hundreds of millions of dollars in australia alone taheri et al 2020 australasian corrosion association 2021 in addition to h 2 s several odorous compounds including volatile organic sulfur compounds and volatile organic compounds contribute to the unpleasant odors in the environment h 2 s and methanethiol mesh have the highest concentrations thousands of mg m 3 in melbourne and sydney sewer systems compared to other reduced s compounds tens of μ g m 3 wang et al 2014 the concentrations of h 2 s and mesh are typically above two exposure limit values i e the time averaged concentration over 8 hour h 2 s 7 14 mg m 3 mesh 1 3 mg m 3 and the short term exposure limit over 15 minutes h 2 s 14 21 mg m 3 mesh 1 25 mg m 3 posing potential hazards to humans jiang et al 2017 in general the problems associated with h 2 s emissions include foul odor in the vicinity of the sewer system health risks resulting from the substantial toxicity and corrosion of sewer systems and the inlet of wwtp 2 2 methane emission in addition to the microbial so 4 2 reduction process the methanogenic archea ma respiration process occurs in anaerobic sewer biofilm and sediment guisasola et al 2008 ma obligate anaerobes utilize the same substrates acetate h2 and propionate as srb although ma has a lower affinity for substrates than srb it is unlikely that methanogenesis precursors will be constrained and fail to penetrate the sewer biofilm fully consequently the production of methane continues in the deeper layer sun et al 2014 in a rising main pipeline filled with wastewater dissolved methane at a concentration of 5 30 mg l 1 is typically saturated and vented until a release point is reached this results in large greenhouse gas ghg emissions at the rising main and wwtp inlet gas release valves guisasola et al 2008 methane is a potent ghg with approximately 21 times the global warming potential of carbon dioxide c o 2 guisasola et al 2008 liu et al 2015 according to the findings of guisasola et al 2008 if a wwtp serves 100 000 person equivalents pe 23 ml d 1 50th percentile inflow 40 250 t methane will be discharged to the atmosphere per year at the wwtp s inlet which is equivalent to 900 5300 t c o 2 e annum this additional ghg provides around 12 100 more than the wwtp 5300 7400 t c o 2 e annum for a typical wwtp serving 100 000 pe guisasola et al 2008 this indicates that methane emissions from sewer systems contribute substantially to the overall carbon footprint of urban wastewater systems the accumulation of methane is explosive when exposed to air and poses a safety risk meanwhile its production consumes a great amount of chemical oxygen demand guisasola et al 2008 required for subsequent biological nutrient removal in wastewater treatment processes liu et al 2015 consequently an external carbon source addition may be necessary 3 chemical dosing in sewer systems oxygen o 2 nitrate no 3 iron salts magnesium hydroxide mg oh 2 and sodium hydroxide naoh are widely utilized in australia s water industry to treat the major problems in sewer networks ganigue et al 2011 continuous dosing of conventional chemicals except for naoh is required to control sulfide effectively resulting in high costs to address this issue the studies in the past decade have aimed to optimize the dosing strategy of conventional chemicals and propose innovative and low cost solutions for removing sulfide and methane in this regard this section focuses on various technologies that reduce sulfide and methane emissions through different control mechanisms including oxidation precipitation ph elevation and sewer biofilm activities inactivation additionally table 1 summarizes the cost effectiveness of dosing chemicals in controlling sulfide and methane in sewer systems 3 1 oxidation dissolved oxygen do concentration and oxidation reduction potential orp above 0 5 mg l 1 and 180 mv respectively can attenuate sulfide formation hvitved jacobsen et al 2013 khanal and huang 2003 the addition of oxidizing compounds therefore oxidizes the formed sulfide prevents anaerobic conditions ultimately has negative impact on microbial species growing in anaerobic sewer biofilm among the oxidants oxygen and nitrate are commonly applied nowadays ganigue et al 2011 also iron salts have multiple sulfide and methane control pathways of which oxidation is discussed here 3 1 1 oxygen o 2 oxidizes sulfide chemically and biologically as a result it limits the availability of h2s transferring from liquid to gas phases reducing severe odor and corrosion problems in addition it enhances the aerobic respiration leading to a consumption of organic matter and o 2 three processes stimulated after air o 2 injection are chemical sulfide oxidation biological sulfide oxidation and heterotrophic consumption these processes consume o 2 at a rate of 107 g o 2 m 2 d 1 5 6 go 2 m 2 d 1 and 16 g o 2 m 2 d 1 respectively gutierrez et al 2008 ganigue et al 2011 fig 2 further demonstrates the contribution of total o 2 consumption in each process since biological sulfide oxidation and heterotrophic respiration occur predominantly in biofilm large pipes with a low a v area to volume ratio limit the contribution of biofilm processes and increase o 2 utilization efficiency for sulfide oxidation consequently air o 2 injection is more suitable for large sewer systems complex intermediates are formed during the oxidation process as described in eqs 4 7 below nielsen et al 2003 due to their high stability thiosulfate and elemental s are the end products of chemical sulfide oxidation kühl et al 1998 nielsen et al 2005a because of the mass transfer limitations of o 2 in the biofilm the deeper the biofilm the more the srb is protected from o 2 and its metabolism continues therefore achieving complete reduction of sulfide in a sewer system requires a continuous aerobic condition 4 2 h s o 2 2 s 0 2 o h 5 2 h s 2 o 2 s 2 o 3 2 h 2 o 6 2 h s 3 o 2 2 so 3 2 2 h 7 2 h s 4 o 2 2 so 4 2 2 h in laboratory scale sewer reactors gutierrez et al 2008 observed a 65 reduction in daily total sulfide production when the wastewater was aerated to a high do concentration 15 25 mg o 2 l 1 using o 2 injection this is reflected in o 2 depletion before wastewater discharge and re production of sulfide therefore o 2 injection site and concentration are the key to enhancing the efficacy of sulfide control however due to the low solubility of o 2 in water under atmospheric conditions o 2 injection is employed in rising main pipes when wastewater pumps are operating recently zhang et al 2022b presented a novel air nanobubble anb injection method that increases do concentration in wastewater and improves sulfide control in gravity sewers due to the ultra fine size and negative surface charge of nanobubbles anb injection increases the do concentration to 6 04 times higher than that of conventional air injection allowing more o 2 to penetrate sewer biofilms it changes the abundance and diversity of microbial communities resulting in a decrease in the relative abundance of srb and an increase in the relative abundance of sob in laboratory scale gravity sewer reactors an average sulfide reduction of 45 36 was attained after 60 minutes of anb injection this rate of sulfide reduction was 3 75 times higher than that of the conventional o 2 injection method although traditional o 2 injection has no discernible effect on dominant srb activities it has a suppressive effect on ma activities ganigue and yuan 2014 ganigue and yuan 2014 reported a reduced methane concentration of 15 47 at the initial stage of o 2 injection 15 25 mg o 2 l 1 as the microbial community adapted to o 2 and o 2 uptake rate increased due to heterotrophic respiration the innermost layer permitted the re development of ma activities supported by an enhanced methane production rate 13 days after o 2 injection overall the long term o 2 injection has a controlling effect on methane production reducing it by approximately 30 on average 3 1 2 nitrate in contrast to o 2 injection the biological sulfide oxidation process plays a crucial role in sulfide control through no 3 dosing yang et al 2005 which is primarily driven by sulfide oxidizing nitrate reducing bacteria sonrb the oxidation of elemental s eq 9 occurs after the oxidation of s 2 to elemental s eq 8 is completed jiang et al 2009 due to the slow s 2 oxidation rate of the second step eq 9 which is approximately 15 of the rate of the first step eq 8 insoluble elemental s accumulates on biofilm furthermore a part of elemental s transfers to polysulfide which is more bioavailable liang et al 2016 rabus et al 2013 yang et al 2005 since the dosed no 3 in sewage is also consumed by heterotrophic denitrification it is often depleted in a pipeline further downstream notably no 3 does not suppress srb activity under no 3 free conditions accumulated elemental s or polysulfide is further reduced mohanakrishnan et al 2009 jiang et al 2013b auguet et al 2015 liang et al 2016 furthermore long term nitrate dosing promotes thicker biofilm growth and reduces chemical penetration liang et al 2023 generally rapid sulfide rebound has long been considered a problem in nitrate receiving biofilms 8 5 s 2 2 no 3 12 h 5 s 0 n 2 6 h 2 o 9 5 s 0 6 no 3 2 h 2 o 5 so 4 2 3 n 2 4 h in the laboratory scale sewer reactor no 3 concentrations of 30 67 mgn l 1 initially induced a complete sulfide control and a quick sulfide recovery was observed after nitrate vanished mohanakrishnan et al 2009 jiang et al 2013b jiang et al 2009 yang et al 2021 the average sulfide discharges reduction is 46 66 methane control behaves similarly auguet et al 2015 jiang et al 2013b at the starting phase of no 3 dosing no 3 can fully penetrate biofilms resulting in negligible methane concentration in sewer effluent the complete methane control is a result of the instantaneous shock effect of redox potential elevation given that sonrb and hnrb consume no 3 the bulk no 3 concentration is expected to decrease it restricts nitrate penetration and promotes the restoration of ma activities in the innermost layer of the biofilm fig 3 therefore ma activities are partially suppressed and the concentration of methane discharged decreased by 42 from 77 7 mgcod l 1 to 45 mgcod l 1 jiang et al 2013b in most cases the considerable no 3 consumption by the heterotrophic process is inevitable consequently the rebound anaerobic conditions downstream of the dose point reduce the efficacy of sulfide and methane control to alleviate this drawback efforts have been made with a focus on the dosing sites and combination chemical dosing approaches dosing no 3 close to the hotspot of sulfide emission can sustain anoxic conditions between the site of dosing and the point of sulfide control in the laboratory scale system auguet et al 2015 yang et al 2021 the downstream no 3 dosing method 50 60 mgn l 1 successfully removed sulfide moreover the methane accumulated from upstream was oxidized by methanotrophs while reducing no 3 or no 2 auguet et al 2015 it was the first publication to describe methane oxidation in a no 3 dosing sewer system and the no 3 consumption between sulfide and methane oxidation was unknown the methane discharged was thus reduced to 50 additionally zhang et al 2022a evaluated the synergistic effect of no 3 and sodium nitroprusside snp on sulfide removal snp is a cardiovascular drug and is generally used for pulmonary hypertension treatment 100 sulfide control was achieved by combining 30 mgn l 1 no 3 and 20 mgn l 1 snp due to the selective inhibition of denitrification more no 3 is accessible for biological sulfide oxidation however the application of snp in sewer systems poses several concerns and challenges snp is toxic to human cells at concentrations 1000 μ m 298 mg l 1 although the recommended snp concentration 20 mg l 1 is lower than the safe concentration of snp the community s concern regarding environmental and health risks from the use of snp remains uncertain snp is unstable and decomposes into a toxic cyanide byproduct when exposed to light transport handling and storage of snp are therefore associated with serious safety concerns 3 1 3 iron salts dosing ferric ion f e 3 into sewer systems oxidizes dissolved sulfide while reducing itself to ferrous ion f e 2 for subsequent precipitation processes as discussed in section 3 2 under the typical ph and redox potential in sewer systems elemental s is the final oxidation product which is less bioavailable for srb compared to so 4 2 firer et al 2008 3 2 precipitation iron salts particularly fec l 2 and fec l 3 have been widely used to control sulfide build up in sewer systems ganigue et al 2011 haaning nielsen et al 2005 ferrous ion f e 2 removes dissolved sulfide through precipitation as ferrous sulfide fes eq 11 whereas ferric ion f e 3 oxidizes sulfide and reduces itself to f e 2 which can subsequently precipitate dissolved sulfide eq 10 zhang et al 2009 firer et al 2008 saracevic et al 2007 in the investigation conducted by rebosura and co workers adding f e 3 10 mgfe l 1 in sewer reactors removed 3 9 0 4 mgs l 1 with a molar ratio of 1 33 f e 3 s 2 indicating a relatively 47 9 decrease in sulfide concentration in sewer effluent compared to the control without iron dosing rebosura et al 2018 10 2 f e 3 s 2 2 f e 2 s s 0 11 f e 2 s 2 fe s s while iron dosing is a reliable measure the overall sulfide removal effectiveness is dependent on the ph of the sewage only s 2 among the three soluble sulfide forms may react with f e 3 to form insoluble metallic sulfide therefore alkaline ph circumstances are more favorable for sulfide precipitation however it should be noted that ferric salts are acidic compounds and their addition can decrease the ph of wastewater it has been reported that a minimum of 200 additional iron dosing is required to reach a sulfide concentration of 0 1 mg l 1 at the sewer effluent when the ph drops from 7 to 6 5 firer et al 2008 moreover iron salts are liquid chemicals the transport storage and handling of the hazardous iron salts are associated with the occupational health and safety concerns and chemical spillage risk pikaar et al 2015 lin et al 2017b haas et al 2008 the removal of sulfide through the use of electrochemically generated f e 2 f e 3 has recently attracted considerable interest lin et al 2017b proposed a unique method for simultaneously generating iron cations and hydroxyl anions in sewer using electrochemical cells a comprehensive full scale study has proved the feasibility of such an alternative approach pikaar et al 2019 another iron derived electrochemical product is nanoparticle magnetite f e 3 o 4 lin et al 2017a from practical and economic perspectives the in situ generated chemical achieves a comparable sulfide control a reduction of h 2 s concentration by 95 4 98 to the conventional iron dosing and reduces chemical cost from 10 9 170 6 aud m l 1 ganigue et al 2011 to 17 9 36 2 aud m l 1 lin et al 2017b lin et al 2017a 3 3 ph elevation as previously stated in sewer systems h 2 s and h s are the predominant sulfide species at neutral ph at ph values less than 7 04 h 2 s predominates and at ph 8 5 only 8 of the sulfide is h 2 s at ph 9 0 h 2 s level is less than 1 ph affects the amount of h 2 s that can be vented to the headspace mg oh 2 and naoh are two alkali chemical options for raising the ph in sewer systems dosage of mg oh 2 raises the ph of sewage between 8 5 and 9 0 due to its poor solubility k s p 10 11 1 morel et al 1993 the slow mg oh 2 dissolution rate leaves residual and unreacted alkalinity in sewers these components are available in reacidification gutierrez et al 2009 and by increasing the ph they prolong the efficacy of the sulfide control technique compared to mg oh 2 naoh is a strong alkali that instantly raises the ph of a sewer system ganigue et al 2011 additionally the use of alkali chemicals can inhibit the activities of srb and ma regardless of whether a gradual or instant ph elevation strategy these effects will be further discussed in section 3 4 3 4 inactivation of sewer biofilm activities the inactivation of srb and ma activities is preferable compared to the subsequent removal after sulfide and methane production beside alkali compounds and iron salts the intermittent dosing of fna ferrate fe vi or fa has recently emerged as a potential technology in sulfide and methane abatement this approach aims to minimize economic costs and environmental impacts 3 4 1 sodium hydroxide naoh produces a ph shock 10 5 12 5 to deactivate sewer biofilms and reduces srb and ma activities gutierrez et al 2014 in the laboratory scale investigation a 6 hour ph shock reduced srb activity by 85 90 recovery began within 1 3 days and was completed within 3 14 days this indicated that the ph shock s effect on sulfide production lasted for 3 4 days this recovery process also applies to the field study gutierrez et al 2014 in the field study naoh was dosed twice weekly for six hours in the sewer it elevated the ph to 11 5 and decreased sulfide concentration by 67 the partial removal of sulfide was attributed to a ph reduction resulting from the plug flow nature of sewer pipes and the biological activity along the sewer pipes gutierrez et al 2014 since ma activity was effectively inhibited even with a moderate ph elevation e g ph 9 gutierrez et al 2009 it was effectively managed at ph 11 5 gutierrez et al 2014 it is important to note that the transportation storage and use of concentrated caustic compounds purchased as 50 w w always have inherent safety risks ganigue et al 2011 in situ caustic compound generation from wastewater through electrochemical systems may be the preferred method since it not only eliminates the requirement for handling but also minimizes the chemical costs indeed 2 5 0 0 w w naoh was produced directly from sewer at an average coulombic efficiency of 84 1 1 1 while the cost of naoh for ph elevation ph 11 decreased from aud 39 6 99 1 ml of wastewater to aud 11 9 ml lin et al 2015 ganigue et al 2011 pikaar et al 2013 the o2 generated from the anode compartment improved sulfide control performance and prolonged the recovery period compared to ph shock alone lin et al 2017c 3 4 2 iron salts cao et al 2019 proposed an alternative control mechanism where a low frequency high dose f e 3 dosing technique was utilized in addition to the precipitation reactions between s 2 and f e 3 excess f e 3 can diffuse into biofilms and inhibit srb and ma activities it is probably due to three factors i f e 3 toxicity ii the high orp induced by f e 3 and iii the deposition of sulfide precipitation on the top layer of biofilm which hinders so 4 2 and organic matter penetration the specific mechanism underlying the inhibitory effect has not been identified rebosura et al 2018 reported adding f e 3 10 mgfe l 1 at an interval of 6 h did not cause an inhibition effect in sewer biofilm activity the control of sulfide was primarily attributed to sulfide precipitation and a significant methane control was absent rebosura et al 2018 however zhang et al 2009 observed an 80 reduction in c h 4 production rate in a sewer reactor modified to f e 3 addition 21 mgfe l 1 this indicated that iron has a considerable inhibitory effect on ma activities the inconsistency is possible due to the different doses of f e 3 in these two studies resulting in different control mechanisms 3 4 3 free nitrous acid in studies conducted by jiang et al 2010 and mohanakrishnan et al 2008 srb and ma activities were completely suppressed after three weeks of continuous nitrite dosing at 40 120 mgn l 1 the slow recovery rate is responsible for the regrowth of srb and ma this harmful effect was generated by the formation of free nitrous acid fna as opposed to nitrite itself due to the strong biocidal effect of fna it has been extensively studied for decades and implemented in numerous wastewater management applications duan et al 2020 zhou et al 2011 many small molecules such as dinitrogen trioxide nitrogen dioxide and nitric oxide derived from fna are permeable to cell membranes they affect the intracellular environment interrupt metabolism and destroy cell membranes the effectiveness of fna in controlling sulfide and methane formation is dependent on three key parameters dosing concentration dosage duration and dosing interval jiang et al 2011a since it is a biofilm removal method successive dose will permanently deactivate biofilm activities considering the cost an intermittent fna dose of 0 26 mgn l 1 for 12 h every 4 5 days is sufficient to lower sulfide and methane production by 80 and 90 respectively jiang et al 2011a other field studies conducted in australia usa and germany have confirmed the full scale application of the fna dosing strategy jiang et al 2013a nguyen and marano 2016 despot et al 2021 jiang et al 2013a reported that during the 6 month study no biofilm adaption was observed in fna receiving sewers in addition a single dose of fna 0 26 mgn l 1 reduced average sulfide levels by 80 for 10 days after administration this was consistent with the findings of despot et al 2021 and nguyen and marano 2016 importantly intermittently dosing of fna is a cost effective strategy compared to the general cost of chemicals applied 40 180 aud m l 1 reported by ganigue et al 2011 the lower cost of fna application 10 aud m l 1 highlights the opportunity to replace the conventionally used commodity chemicals jiang et al 2013a in light of the successful fna application zheng et al 2017 proposed a waste to value technology that provides the same benefits as a chemical fna agent by separating urine and then converting it by 50 to nitrite economically and environmentally urine derived nitrite reduces chemical costs by 69 although this approach has not been validated through a field experiment the positive results make it even more competitive as a fna dosing strategy 3 4 4 free ammonia free ammonia fa has been reported as an inhibitor of srb and ma activities dai et al 2017 dosing ammonia n h 3 rich solution is expected to prevent sulfide and c h 4 formation zuo et al 2020 reported that an fa concentration of 154 mgn l 1 induced a microbial cellular viability response of 35 3 after a 24 hour exposure with a maximum value of 28 irrespective of additional increase in fa concentration thus certain microorganisms developed fa resistance the analysis of the microbial community indicated that desulfobulbus is highly resistant to n h 3 compared to other srb genera zuo et al 2020 therefore dosing urine or fa results in the modification of the microbial community structure desulfobulbus is likely to become a relatively abundant srb genera contributing to the residual sulfide production future detailed studies may shed light on how those microorganisms adapted to high strength fa conditions urine contains 4 gn l 1 of fa at a ph of 9 making it a suitable replacement for chemical fa agents such as ammonium chloride after each dose of diluted urine equivalent to 154 mgn l 1 over 24 h the concentrations of sulfide and methane decreased rapidly from 13 2 2 2 mgs l 1 and 6 5 2 7 mgc h 4 l 1 to 5 mgs l 1 and 3 mgc h 4 l 1 respectively notably the srb activity gradually recovered after each dose in this respect successive dosing of urine from sewage was thought to be more effective zuo et al 2020 unlike the other urine based approach zheng et al 2017 this proposed fa derived from urine approach does not require on site nitrification or a nitritation reactor which contributes to 50 of the total cost regarding this it is crucial to reduce the operational cost from 1145 aud y 1 to 142 aud y 1 zuo et al 2020 in addition reusing urine for sulfide and methane control reduces life cycle energy assumptions and greenhouse gas emissions during the production and transportation of chemicals by 96 97 and 80 93 respectively zuo et al 2020 zuo et al 2023 although the economic and life cycle assessment analysis showed the viability of using fa from urine in sewers there is still cause for concern regarding long exposure time urine availability and odor issue caused by high strength fa alternatively a high fa concentration in wastewater can be achieved by ph elevation since the concentration of n h 3 is strongly ph sensitive with a pka of 9 25 for n h 4 n h 3 h gutierrez et al 2009 a higher fa concentration from a higher ph suppresses microbial activity gutierrez et al 2009 revealed that at ph 8 6 fa concentration of 7 7 mgn l 1 and 9 0 fa concentration of 15 3 mgn l 1 achievable by doing mg oh 2 the sulfide production rate decreased by 30 and 50 respectively above 8 6 ph the methanogenic activity was minimal however the mechanism has not been elucidated in detail gutierrez et al 2009 sharma et al 2014 3 4 5 ferrate fe vi is usually used as a green chemical for emerging organic pollutant removal due to its multifunctional oxidation disinfection and coagulation properties lee et al 2009 wang et al 2021 recent research has successfully established for the first time its potent inactivation of srb and ma activities yan et al 2020 the inactivation rate viability of 17 6 of microorganisms exposed to 120 mgfe l 1 was comparable to that reported by jiang et al 2011b for fna dosing viability 15 there are several potential contributing factors to the inactivation of microorganisms first among oxidants fe vi is recognized as the one with the highest redox potential e 0 2 2 v through the rapid decomposition of fe vi the generation of reactive oxygen species of o 2 and h 2 o 2 cause cellular membrane damage and dysfunction second fe vi degrades extracellular polymeric substance components in sewer biofilms via charge neutralization and adsorption of hydrolyzed f e 3 zhang et al 2016 it loosens sewer biofilm structure and consequently aids the chemical penetration and reinforces the biocidal effect after the first dose of fe vi sulfide and methane productions were completely inactivated and the subsequent recovery resembled to microbial regrowth this was consistent with the other biocidal agents mentioned above a fe vi dosage of 180 mgfe l 1 within 15 min of exposure every 4 5 days yields an effective sulfide control of 80 and a complete methane control it should be noted that fe vi treatment requires a shorter contact time compared to other biocidal agents 6 24 h in this way it decreased the amount of chemicals required for each dosing event yan et al 2020 4 dosing control and optimization chemical dosing of sewage is universally recognized as an efficient approach for sulfide control in sewers with annual chemical usage costing billions of dollars worldwide ganigue et al 2011 the scheme for chemical dosing which determines not only the sulfide control performance but also the capital cost is important water industries commonly use chemical dosing via the following approaches 1 constant chemical dosing which maintains the dosing rate at a constant value regardless of the flow and extent of biological processes occurring in sewers 2 flow paced dosing which regulates the chemical dosage based on sewage flow rate to maintain a constant chemical concentration at the dosing location and 3 profiled dosing in which the dosing rates are varied according to a predefined profile which was designed based on empirical formula li et al 2019 such predetermined profiles or empirical methods may yield satisfactory performance if real world conditions closely resemble the planned scenarios however the sewage hydraulics and compositions fluctuate from time to time leading to deviations from the conventional scenarios which were considered for profile based dosing design resulting in unsatisfactory control performance and a high chemical cost therefore chemical dosing should be controlled online by regulating the sewage pumping stations spss and dosing units rather than predetermined regimes depending on the current and future changes of sewage flow and compositions multiple controllers have been proposed and demonstrated for sulfide management in a single sewer pipe an online control strategy for chemical dosing for sulfide mitigation in a rising main was developed ganigué et al 2016 the control objective was to maintain a predetermined ph setpoint at the end of a rising main pipe by dynamically controlling the mg oh 2 dosing rate at the spss furthermore this method has been successfully demonstrated through real world case studies for dosing fec l 2 in a single sewer pipe ganigué et al 2018 however sewer corrosion and odor problems are rarely confined to a single pipe but are widely distributed across an intricate network of connecting pipes and distributed spss the intermittent operation of spss subjected to prespecified wet well duty levels results in sewage slugs dominated by certain sewage streams which considerably disrupt chemical delivery to provide effective sulfide control across the network sewage flows should be regulated by scheduling the operation of at least certain spss so that sewage without dosed chemicals can be adequately mixed with sewage streams from the dosing location carrying the dosed chemical the first step is to identify the target location of chemical dosing i e corrosion and odor hotspots which is generally the discharge manhole after a rising main network or manholes and junction nodes along the gravity sewers the next task is to predict sulfide methane generation across the network including the hotspots comprehensive models based on prior knowledge have been developed to simulate the physical chemical and biological processes in the sewer system such as wastewater aerobic anaerobic transformation in sewers wats model nielsen et al 2008 and sewex model sharma et al 2008 to support real time prediction of sewage states simplified models or data driven models are established which greatly accelerate the computation efficiency while ensuring competitive accuracy with mechanistic models li et al 2022a li et al 2022b both types of models are applied to provide the distribution of sulfide methane based on sewage flow and composition such information is used in turn to determine the most appropriate chemical requirement for the target locations the final step is deciding the most cost effective dosing actions to achieve the desired chemical distribution this is the most important as well as most difficult section involved in dosing optimization which has drawn increasing interest from the water industry and academia during the past years liu et al 2016 developed an event driven model predictive control empc strategy for regulating the distribution of mg oh 2 in a sewer system with rising mains using a greedy algorithm the pumping rates of the controlled sps with mg oh 2 dosage were optimized to maintain the chemical concentration at the target locations at a predetermined level this method is efficient and can be executed in real time it can find solutions to achieve the chemical concentration above the level which however may not be close to the control objective li et al 2022a for the first time proposed a real time optimization methodology to conduct mg oh 2 dosing in a sewer network through scheduling multiple spss an improved elephant optimization ieho algorithm was developed to search for the optimal decision variables dosing quantities by considering the current network states sewage flow rate and chemical distribution and projecting the future network states the control objective of this study was to maintain a constant chemical concentration at the discharge point of a rising main sewer system compared to the empc approach this control strategy saved 36 on chemicals to improve the online control method for dosing chemicals in a sewer network consisting of both rising mains and gravity mains li et al 2022b developed a swift hydraulic model for predicting the free surface flow in gravity sewers and integrated the model with the ieho algorithm the control strategy was demonstrated in a simulation study of dosing naoh in a real world sewer system in south australia which accelerated the speed of decision making by thousands of times and reduced the chemical cost by 40 compared to the industry used flow paced dosing real time control rtc which optimizes dosing actions based on the dynamic flow of sewage and sulfide production has been shown to outperform conventional dosing methods regarding sulfide control performance and chemical usage also as for control performance evaluation measurement of sulfide and methane based on manual sampling with off line laboratory based chromatography analysis is replacing by online sensors for monitoring the compounds in both gas phase and liquid phase at more interested locations in higher frequency ye et al 2022 liu et al 2014 pikaar et al 2019 fig 4 demonstrates a diagram of the digital platform for real time dosing control li et al 2022b chemical dosing is triggered by the start of sewage pumps and historical data recorded by the online sensors are retrieved and sent to the central computer through a wireless network at the same moment these data are used as model input by the sewer process model to determine the control objective and predict the control performance for each potential dosing action followed by the optimization algorithm to pick the most efficient one in the digital era to implement rtc strategies for chemical dosing first and foremost is to ensure the data quality directly retrieved from the sensors because these data are the source of offline models and algorithms and online chemical dosage decisions data driven techniques can be developed for data assurance fault diagnosis for quick scanning of the sewer infrastructure can also be integrated at this stage moreover decision making models should be able to accurately predict the physical chemical and biological processes involved in sewer systems under various weather conditions hybrid models consisting of both prior knowledge and data driven approaches may be a strong alternative for the complex environment in addition the optimization algorithm software must provide a satisfactory set of control actions in a limited time usually seconds the issue arises in the vast search space of potential actions and the control horizon must encompass the time between the dosed chemical entering the sewer network and its arrival at the control point e g corrosion or odor hotspots advanced computing paradigms such as parallel computing and distributed computing can improve optimization from the hardware perspective importantly it should be noted that the proposed rtc may not achieve its full potential in practice that is the dosing location or the controllable dosing units may differ from the theoretically optimal options because the sewer system is operated under stringent security regulations for widespread adoption of rtc a generic optimization algorithm for dosage control must be able to deliver the optimal dosing actions under varied control conditions without requiring excessive modification 5 integrated use of sewer dosed chemicals in urban wastewater systems although the above mentioned chemicals has been identified as effective measure to control sulfide and methane production in sewer systems continuous or intermittent dosing of such chemicals imposes high economic costs on water utilities gutierrez et al 2011 therefore finding an optimal solution regarding performance and cost is essential integrated wastewater management is an emerging approach that considers its effects on the downstream treatment processes sharma et al 2012 pikaar et al 2014 hence optimizing system wide performance and providing environmental and social benefits to the communities iron salts are widely used chemicals to control sulfide in approximately 66 of treated sewage apart from being applied to sewer systems they are commonly dosed in downstream treatment processes for phosphorous and sulfide removal as well as for sludge settleability dewaterability enhancement however it is important to note fec l 3 is an acidic compound which can affect sewage ph and sulfide control effectiveness in sewer systems pikaar et al 2019 lin et al 2017b recently there has been a new perspective on acidification effect of fec l 3 in urban wastewater management the use of fec l 3 in chemically enhanced primary treatment cept or side stream returned sludge can consume alkalinity and lead to an acidic condition that selectively suppressed nitrite oxidizing bacteria nob achieving mainstream short cut nitrogen removal process hu et al 2021 hu et al 2023a hu et al 2023b additionally in anaerobic sludge treatment pre treating thickened waste activated sludge twas with combined dosing of fec l 3 and nitrite yields better sludge degradability destruction and recovery enabling the conversion of organic matters to methane and phosphorus rich biosolids for use as fertilizers calderon et al 2021 apart from the generally accepted coagulation and precipitation mechanisms of fec l 3 it plays a beneficial role in pushing urban wastewater treatment towards energy neutrality practical implementation of the integrated concept from laboratory to full scale studies has demonstrated that the multifaced benefits of iron salts can be achieved at once by dosing iron salts in sewer systems however it should be emphasized that iron salts are the only chemicals that have been comprehensively investigated and evaluated current studies confine to the cost effectiveness of chemicals on sulfide and methane control in sewer systems and overlook the interconnection of each process unit in urban wastewater systems when developing a solution therefore future studies should orient towards the integrated management of chemicals enabling sustainable improvement of performance and reduction of chemical footprint of an entire urban wastewater system this section aims to review the current progress on integrated use of iron salts and to discuss the main effects of other chemicals on downstream treatment processes which require further studies in the past five years extensive research on the integrated use of iron salt dosing in sewers has been done through the use of laboratory scale continuous flow reactors including sewers wastewater treatment reactors and anaerobic sludge digesters rebosura et al 2018 found that iron dosing in sewers not only effectively precipitates 4 3 0 5 mgs l 1 sulfide in sewer discharge but it also reduces p concentration by 4 7 0 5 mgp l 1 in wwtp effluent improves sludge settleability digested sludge dewaterability by 17 7 1 0 and decreases sulfide concentration by 88 5 1 0 in anaerobic digestion long term field studies confirm the various beneficial uses of iron in urban wastewater system salehin et al 2019 kulandaivelu et al 2020 additionally due to the adsorbing property of fes the f e 3 dosing in sewers facilitates rapid removal of organic micropollutants within minutes in this regard it reduces the organic micropollutant load in wastewater which adds an extra value to the wwtp kulandaivelu et al 2019 in addition to fec l 3 injecting iron rich drinking water sludge fe dws into sewers can improve overall system wide performance rebosura et al 2020 however the sludge aging time and primary clarifier impair the capacity and reactivity of fe dws salehin et al 2020 showed that the fe dws with a 30 day storage period has a lower sulfide removal capacity 0 60 0 01 mmol s mmol fe than the fresh fe dws day 1 1 30 0 02 mmol s mmol fe in this regard the discharge of fe dws into sewers becomes feasible when a wwtp is located near a hotspot where sewer corrosion and odor complaints are high due to the coagulating nature of iron salts 85 of fe is retained in the primary sludge for anaerobic digestion whereas only 15 remains for further downstream phosphorus removal rebosura et al 2021 it consequently reduces the availability of iron for downstream phosphate removal compared to the previous study when the primary clarifier absents rebosura et al 2020 utilizing a synergistic combination of magnetic separation and alkaline washing the fe rich anaerobic digested sludge is subsequently reused and recycled salehin et al 2019 the installation of a neodymium magnet can recover 11 15 3 of the vivianite found in digested sewage sludge of which 92 2 was present as vivianite after alkaline washing vivianite transforms into ferrihydrite an effective iron oxide adsorbent it can also be further used for sulfide control in sewers although this proposed solution has a low recovery rate it sheds light on a circular iron management strategy the above mentioned studies demonstrate the fate of iron salts in complete urban wastewater systems and their potential flow on effects on downstream processes fig 5 through the precipitation of fes fec l 3 or fe dws doses removes sulfide in sewer networks under aerobic circumstances when fes enters activated sludge bioreactors fe2 is released and re oxidized the oxidized iron can precipitate p in the form of vivianite and can be retained in waste activated sludge subsequently adding fe rich sludge to anaerobic sludge digestion decreases the level of dissolved sulfide by a mechanism similar to that of conventional iron salts dosing in sewers the vivianite content in the solid phase of digested sludge can be partially recovered to another type of iron salt ferrihydrite thus the integrated approach to iron salts improves the performance of wwtps and promotes the sustainability of sewer networks however the integrated approach has not been applied thoroughly to other chemicals hence fig 6 demonstrates the potential impacts of the sewer dosing chemicals on sewer system wastewater compositions and wastewater treatment plants for instance adding o 2 no 3 to sewage transforms anaerobic conditions into aerobic anoxic conditions the primary control mechanisms weaken srb and ma metabolism and chemically and biologically oxidize sulfide meanwhile the development of heterotrophic bacteria and the redevelopment of srb and ma at deeper layers of biofilm use high levels of carbon sources bentzen et al 1995 which has a negative effect on downstream biological n and p removal while bio inhibitors or alkalis fundamentally impair srb and ma function more carbon sources are saved wastewater is also sensitive to physicochemical process changes such as ph after adding alkalis or fna fa which are the key factors influencing the nitrification rate fe vi and mg oh 2 may serve as solids in the sewer system and provide the beneficial effects of divalent cations f e 2 or m g 2 on sludge treatment such as dewaterability destruction and stabilization 6 conclusions and perspectives sulfide and methane emissions in urban sewer systems contribute to severe sewer odor corrosion and ghg emission issues although conventional chemical strategies such as o 2 no 3 injection use of iron salts mg oh 2 and naoh have been widely used in sewer systems there are still concerns regarding the high economic costs considerable environmental impacts and downstream side effects in this review it provides a comprehensive overview of chemical uses in sewer systems with a particular attention given to sulfide and methane control mechanism and effectiveness chemical dosing control and optimization and the flow on effects of sewer dosed chemicals on wwtps recent research has focused on developing innovative techniques such as in situ chemical generation via electrochemical cells intensive biofilm inactivation and the combination of two different chemicals to reduce the cost and energy consumption associated with chemical production and transportation however current sewer chemical application lacks widespread implementation of the real time chemical dosing control and optimization due to the complexity nature of sewer systems in addition the integrated urban wastewater management concept limits on the use of iron salts it is critical to develop an integrated chemical assessment and implement this valuable concept with multiple chemical options therefore further development on real time control and optimization and integrated application on chemical uses may provide the sustainable tools necessary to improve the management of urban sewer systems this could substantially reduce environmental concerns and economic burdens in

14712,benzethonium chloride bec is one of emerging bacteriostatic agents bec bearing wastewater generated during sanitary applications in food and medication is easily combined with other wastewater streams to flow into wastewater treatment plants this study focused on the long term 231 days impacts of bec on the sequencing moving bed biofilm nitrification system nitrification performance was tolerant to low concentration of bec 0 2 mg l but the nitrite oxidation was severely inhibited when the concentration of bec was 1 0 2 0 mg l partial nitrification maintained about 140 days with nitrite accumulation ratio over 80 mainly caused by the inhibition of nitrospira nitrotoga and comammox notably bec exposure in the system might cause the co selection of antibiotic resistance genes args and disinfectant resistance genes drgs and the resistance of biofilm system to bec was strengthened by efflux pumps mechanism qacedelta1 and qach and antibiotic deactivation mechanism aada aac 6 ib and blatem extracellular polymeric substances secretion and bec biodegradation were also contributed to the system microorganisms resisting bec exposure in addition klebsiella enterobacter citrobacter and pseudomonas were isolated and identified as bec degrading bacteria the metabolites of n n dimethylbenzylamine n benzylmethylamine and benzoic acid were identified and the biodegradation pathway of bec was proposed this study brought new knowledge about the fate of bec in biological treatment units and laid a foundation for its elimination from wastewater graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords benzethonium chloride partial nitrification inhibitor resistance genes co selection biodegradation strains data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction since the late 1930s quaternary ammonium compounds quats have been widely used in a variety of industrial agricultural clinical and consumer products and applications zhang et al 2015 the influence of the covid 19 pandemic has increased the use of bacteriostatic agents with the excellent virucidal efficacy agathokleous et al 2022 benzethonium chloride bec is the member of the group ii quat cluster classified by united states environmental protection agency usepa 1988 which is often used in everyday products such as disinfectant wipes and cosmetics for instance bec is one of the main ingredients in mouthwashes with concentration of 0 004 which is used to disinfect the oral cavity and oropharyngeal regions iwamura et al 2016 extensive usage would increase the detection of bec in wastewater treatment plants wwtps according to pati and arnold 2020 13 wastewater effluent samples were collected at wwtps bec was detected above the limit of quantification in two samples at concentration of 20 and 70 ng l respectively in the study of östman et al 2017 bec was found in digested sludge with the concentration of 0 120 mg kg d w moreover it has been reported that quats mass load at a wwtp increases more than threefold compared to the pre covid 19 era which would inevitably discharge into the aquatic environment due to incomplete removal and further affect the normal survival of organisms mohapatra et al 2023 therefore wwtps are the main sources and sinks of quats notably biological nitrogen removal is a vital process in wwtps it is necessary to explore the response of biological nitrogen removal processes to quats exposure such as nitrification process the biofilm process as important wastewater treatment system possesses the advantages of high terminal settling velocity of solids high biofilm surface area stronger resistance to adverse impact etc compared to the suspended growth system nicolella et al 2000 xiao et al 2015 therefore it is necessary to carry out research based on biofilm system for quats previous studies reported their effects on biological treatment processes of wwtps yang et al 2015 confirmed that 5 mg l benzalkonium chloride bac shows the negative impact on the nitrification process chen et al 2018 observed that the inhibition on activated sludge increases with the concentration of dodecyl dimethyl benzyl ammonium chloride increasing leading to a decrease in the removal efficiency of ammonia hajaya and pavlostathis 2012 investigated the impact of bacs on the biological nitrogen removal processes showing that nitrification process is more sensitive to bacs than denitrification process nevertheless it is difficult to fully elucidate the responses of aerobic biological treatment processes to quats based on the current researches bec has a paucity of environmental data and might warrant further study and the extremely limited toxicity data of bec on environmental organisms has been available from the current literature sreevidya et al 2018 therefore more related studies are necessary to elucidate the interactions between quats and biological nitrogen removal processes for example it is vital to further focus on the effects of long term bec exposure on nitrification process regarding its environmental implications and potential ecotoxicity on the one hand the effects of bec on nitrification performance in biofilm microbial community structure remain unclear which were worthwhile to explore on the other hand biological removal has the advantages of large processing capacity and low cost so it is necessary to explore effective biological removal of bec and lessen the environmental risk of bec it has been reported that quats not only lead to negative impacts on the microorganisms but also cause the variations of resistance genes in engineered environment yang and wang 2018 found that the bacteria abundance quats resistant gene qaca b and nitrogen cycle related genes in natural water from eutrophic lake change to varying degrees when exposed to 10 1000 µg l benzyldimethyldodecyl ammonium chloride tandukar et al 2013 found that the reduction of community diversity and the increase of antibiotic resistance penicillin g tetracycline ciprofloxacin of river sediment occur under 50 mg l bacs exposure in addition antibacterial biocides possess the ability to co select for antibiotic resistant bacteria scenihr 2009 the promoted selection and spread of resistant bacterial strains and genes by quats can restrict the treatment methods for microbial infections and threaten human health hegstad et al 2010 perceptibly few studies focused on resistance genes succession in the biological treatment processes of wwtps affected by bec one of common quats moreover disinfectants may induce potentially pathogenic bacteria and promote the evolution and transmission of drug resistance due to the hormetic effects aslam et al 2018 however there was a lack of studies on relationships between bec and resistance genes thus this study simultaneously explored the impacts of bec on microbial diversity and resistance genes transmission in nitrification process it is great meaningful to fill the gap in the insights of interaction mechanism between bec and biological treatment processes based on the above elaboration this study evaluated the responses of the nitrification performance in the sequencing moving bed biofilm system at different levels of bec exposure the response mechanisms of microorganisms in the system were revealed by quantitative polymerase chain reaction qpcr extracellular polymeric substances eps and high throughput sequencing meantime the variation of the resistance genes abundance in different classes was discussed the possible host bacteria of resistance genes were identified combined with the shifts of microbial community in the system and the co selection mode of resistance genes and microbial populations was evaluated in addition the enriched bacteria were isolated and identified under high concentration of bec and the bec degrading bacteria were identified by pure culture method the bec intermediates were detected using liquid chromatography and tandem mass spectrometry lc ms proposing bec biodegradation pathway this study would bring a comprehensive insight into the interactions between bec and biofilm nitrification system from different perspectives especially the evolutions of resistance genes and the identification of bec degrading bacteria in the nitrification process 2 materials and methods 2 1 reactor set up and experimental framework a sequencing moving bed biofilm reactor smbbr was used to carry out the experiment with a packing ratio of 30 and the biofilm carriers were highly porous plastic foam cubes polyurethane the effective volume of smbbr was 3 0 l and the discharge volume was 1 5 l the activated sludge from gaobeidian wastewater treatment plant beijing china was inoculated as the seed sludge synthetic wastewater was applied in this study with the influent compositions consisting of 39 10 3 95 mg l nh4 n and 170 71 16 52 mg l chemical oxygen demand the biomass of the smbbr fluctuated at 4000 6000 mg l the sludge retention time of smbbr was about 23 24 days each cycle was carried out 4 h composing of 6 min feeding 180 min aerating 30 min depositing 1 min draining and 23 min idle which was conducted six cycles per day the dissolved oxygen do was 2 5 mg l the temperature of the whole reaction process was maintained at 22 2 c and the influent ph of smbbr was around 7 5 without any regulation the long term operation was conducted to explore the impact of bec and divided into five phases depending on the concentration of bec from day 0 to day 40 phase i smbbr was run as activated sludge acclimation and biofilm growth stage the biomass all grew on the carriers with almost no suspended sludge at the end of phase i concentrations of quats detected worldwide in surface water and wastewater effluent range from 1 μg l to 60 μg l and quats have been found to be up to 10 times these levels in influent wastewater zhang et al 2015 moreover concentrations of quats detected in effluent of hospital wastewater up to mg l di nica et al 2017 hora and arnold 2020 since bec is a type of quats the environmental concentration of quats was used as a reference according to the levels of quats in different environment smbbr were operated for 231 days consisting of five phases start up phase phase i 0 2 mg l bec exposure from day 41 to day 68 phase ii 1 0 mg l bec exposure from day 69 to day 102 phase iii 2 0 mg l bec exposure from day 103 to day 141 phase iv and 0 mg l bec exposure from day 142 to day 231 phase v there was almost no suspended sludge during the phase ii v in smbbr the impacts of bec on nitrification system from low to high concentration were studied in addition the response of nitrification system after cessation of bec exposure was also investigated 2 2 samples preparation eps detection and qpcr analysis the biofilm samples of the smbbr on day 0 40 68 84 102 131 141 184 and 231 were collected which was named as d0 d40 d68 d84 d102 d131 d141 d184 and d231 representing that the initial sample and samples from the interval or the end of the five phases collected biofilm samples were stored at 20 c for subsequent eps and dna extraction in addition nitrifying bacteria activities were tested by batch experiments at the end of each phase and the specific process were depicted in previous literatures wang et al 2017 zhao et al 2023 the modified heat extraction method was applied to obtain eps li and yang 2007 specifically the loosely bound eps lb eps and tightly bound eps tb eps were divided and analyzed in this study in addition the phenol sulfuric acid method and modified lowry method were adopted to detect the amount of polysaccharide ps and protein pn in eps respectively fastdna spin kit for soil qiagen usa was used to extract total dna of each freeze dried sample in accordance with the manufacturer s instructions the purity and concentration of the extracted dna were detected by nanodrop onec thermo fisher scientific usa then ammonium oxidizing bacteria aob amoa gene nitrobacter nxrb gene nitrospira nxrb gene nirotoga 16s gene complete ammonia oxidizers comammox amoa gene and total bacterial 16s rrna gene were analyzed by qpcr and the primers were referred to that of previous study wu et al 2022 a total of 11 resistance genes were selected to investigate their evolutions of the smbbr including four main classes of antibiotic resistance genes args which contained tetracycline tetg sulfonamides sul2 beta lactam blatem and aminoglycosides aada and aac 6 ib resistance genes three disinfectant resistance genes drgs of qacedelta1 qach and qace were also detected besides the integron integrase genes inti1 and inti3 and transposase gene tnpa 06 were quantified to investigate the transfer or propagation of mobile genetic elements mges the primers information of these resistance genes was listed in table s1 the detailed qpcr operation process was described in the previous literature cui et al 2023 and the details of high throughput sequencing and bioinformation data analysis were shown in method s1 2 3 isolation and identification of bec degrading bacteria in the smbbr system the bec degrading bacteria was isolated from the smbbr specifically the supernatant of biofilm taken from the end of phase iv was diluted using sterile water into different concentration gradients and then uniformly coated on solid mineral salt culture medium including bec in sterile environment the solid mineral salt culture medium composited by 2 0 g l nh4 2so4 1 5 g l na2hpo4 12h2o 1 5 g l kh2po4 0 01 g l cacl2 2h2o 0 2 g l mgso4 7h2o 0 001 g l feso4 7h2o and 18 0 g l agar the medium was added 5 0 mg l bec as the sole carbon nitrogen and energy source the culture was inverted in the constant temperature incubator 37 c and the single colonies with different shapes sizes and colors were selected the isolated pure strains were identified using 16s rrna gene cloning method the gene sequences were input to the gene bank of the national center for biotechnology information ncbi for blasting and analyzing with the 16s r rna sequences and the phylogenetic tree was constructed using mega 7 0 other analytical methods used in this study were summarized in method s2 3 results and discussion 3 1 effects of bec exposure on nitrification performance in smbbr the smbbr was operated for 231 days and its performance variation was shown in fig 1 a b during phase i the smbbr possessed good full nitrification performance without bec exposure the ammonium of the effluent was below 0 50 mg l and the effluent nitrate was above 28 08 mg l at 0 2 mg l bec exposure stage phase ii nitrification performance was maintained well with the effluent average ammonium and nitrate of 0 90 mg l and 34 05 mg l respectively but aob and nitrite oxidizing bacteria nob activities decreased from 6 02 and 4 70 mg n g biomass h at the end of phase i to 5 09 and 3 19 mg n g biomass h at the end of phase ii respectively fig 1 c single sample t test did not reveal any significant difference in nitrifying bacteria activities between phase i and phase ii p aob 0 054 p nob 0 121 therefore the effect of 0 2 mg l bec on the nitrification capacity of smbbr was not significant at the initial adding 1 0 mg l bec phase iii the ammonia oxidation was inhibited and the ammonium removal efficiency decreased to 17 10 subsequently the ammonia oxidation gradually recovered and nitrite accumulation occurred with the nitrite accumulation ratio nar around 85 00 suggesting that the exposure of 1 0 mg l bec eventually inhibited nob activity as shown in fig 1c nob activity decreased to 2 78 mg n g biomass h at the end of phase iii previous studies found that bec can selectively eliminate nob in activated sludge under the condition of addition 1 2 mg l or immersion 70 mg l cui et al 2020 wu et al 2022 at 2 0 mg l bec exposure stage phase iv the ammonia oxidation was inhibited at the initial adding stage with the highest effluent ammonia of 22 42 mg l but recovered completely within 3 days implying that aob showed excellent adaptability to bec and the smbbr maintained partial nitrification with nar of 89 28 during the phase iv correspondingly aob activity and nob activity were 4 32 and 1 33 mg n g biomass h respectively at the end of phase iv nob activity showed a further downward trend interestingly the partial nitrification remained stable for 87 days when the exposure of bec was ceased phase v which might be caused by the persistent inhibition of nob by bec and the long generation time of nob mulder et al 2001 as shown in fig 1c nob activity kept the low value of 0 47 mg n g biomass h on day 185 on day 231 the nitrification performance recovered completely with the effluent nitrate of 26 86 mg l predictably aob activity and nob activity increased to 6 18 and 2 79 mg n g biomass h at the end of phase v respectively in general smbbr system showed tolerant to low concentration of bec 0 2 mg l but the nitrite oxidation ability of smbbr showed serious inhibition when the concentration of bec was 1 0 2 0 mg l between phase iii and phase v partial nitrification maintained about 140 days nar 80 from the view of the recovery ammonia oxidation performance smbbr system could execute ammonia oxidation while resisting bec which might be caused by the development and transmission of multi drug resistant genes or the degradation of bec from the perspective of the accumulation of nitrite nob showed more fragile than aob under bec exposure demonstrating that bec could be used as a novel partial nitrification inhibitor 3 2 responses of nitrification functional genes abundance to bec exposure to better illustrate the reasons of system performance variations nitrifying bacteria abundance of the smbbr was detected and shown in fig 2 a for total bacteria the absolute abundance of bacteria 16s increased from 2 33 1013 copies g biomass d0 to 2 43 1013 copies g biomass d40 in phase i which had no statistically significant difference p 0 88 in phase ii its abundance rose to 2 63 1013 copies g biomass d68 suggesting that low concentration of bec 0 2 mg l had no inhibition on the number of total bacteria in phase iii total bacteria abundance reduced from 7 42 1013 copies g biomass d84 to 2 83 1013 copies g biomass d102 in phase iv the bacteria 16s abundance decreased from 4 50 1013 copies g biomass d131 to 6 21 1011 copies g biomass d141 it could be found that 2 0 mg l bec exposure affected the abundance of total bacteria more seriously compared to 1 0 mg l bec in phase v the bacteria 16s abundance increased to 1 32 1012 copies g biomass d185 and 1 27 1012 copies g biomass d231 after ceasing bec exposure for aob the absolute abundance showed an increasing trend compared to that of seed sludge however its abundance first decreased from 6 40 109 copies g biomass d84 to 5 29 108 copies g biomass d102 then increased to 2 71 109 copies g biomass d131 suggesting that bec led to the temporary inhibitory effect on aob overall the activity and abundance of aob showed the similar trend for nob nitrospira abundance increased from 7 27 1012 copies g biomass d0 in phase i to 2 62 1013 copies g biomass d68 in phase ii indicating that low concentration of bec 0 2 mg l showed hormesis effect on nitrospira in phase iii the nitrospira abundance significantly reduced to 2 21 1010 copies g biomass d84 with the p value less than 0 01 which was the reason for the increase of effluent nitrite concentration after adding 1 0 mg l bec and its abundance increased to 9 53 1011 copies g biomass d102 indicating nitrospira had the potential to adapt to 1 0 mg l bec exposure in phase iv the nitrospira abundance decreased to 4 07 1010 copies g biomass d131 and 1 34 109 copies g biomass d141 its abundance gradually rose to 4 10 109 copies g biomass d184 and 3 95 1010 copies g biomass d231 in phase v these results indicated that 2 0 mg l bec could continuously inhibit nob and its inhibition would slowly disappear after ceasing bec exposure in phase i to iii the nitrobacter abundance fluctuated within the scope of 9 10 1010 copies g biomass d0 and 1 76 1011 copies g biomass d68 indicating that 0 2 1 0 mg l bec showed mild to nitrobacter at the end of phase iv nitrobacter decreased significantly to 2 85 1010 copies g biomass d141 with the p value less than 0 01 indicating that nitrobacter could not tolerate long term exposure to 2 0 mg l bec for nitrotoga its abundance was unaffected by 0 2 mg l bec with 7 71 107 copies g biomass d68 after the exposure of 1 0 2 0 mg l bec its abundance reduced to 1 59 107 copies g biomass d102 in phase iii and maintained at 2 23 107 copies g biomass d141 in phase iv when the exposure of bec was ceased the nitrotoga abundance increased gradually to 1 38 109 copies g biomass d231 significantly exceeded its original level with the p value less than 0 01 similarly comammox was unaffected by 0 2 mg l bec but showed a downward trend after adding higher concentration of bec whose abundance reduced from 1 09 1011 copies g biomass d68 to 1 06 1010 copies g biomass d102 at the end of phase iii and 2 04 1010 copies g biomass d141 at the end of phase iv after ceasing exposure of bec comammox abundance slightly increased to 4 35 1010 copies g biomass d231 overall the inhibitory effect of 1 0 2 0 mg l bec on aob was temporary and recoverable but on nob was destructive and irreversible especially nitrospira nitrotoga and comammox which perfectly explained the phenomenon of nitrite accumulation and low nob activity phase iii to phase iv in smbbr fig 1 the decisive factors resulting in the instability of partial nitrification in phase v were the increase of nitrotoga followed by nitrobacter the changes of nitrification performance and functional bacteria abundance not only showed the effect of bec on the smbbr system but also highlight the resistance of the system to bec 3 3 fate of bec and eps production in smbbr the batch tests of mass balance were performed at each stage to clarify the variation of bec removal pathway as shown in fig 2b biosorption was the main removal pathway in phase ii and iii with the removal efficiency of 87 76 and 84 84 which was consistent with that quats are easily adsorbed onto sewage sludge brycki et al 2014 martínez carballo et al 2007 the biodegradation efficiency was only 2 78 and 9 93 respectively however biodegradation became the main pathway to remove bec with the extension of operation time the biodegradation efficiency was 82 00 in phase iv which also remained around 80 00 after ceasing bec exposure phase v indicating that there might enrich the bec degrading bacteria in the smbbr the ratio of biosorption decreased to 2 70 in phase iv and 5 40 in phase v quats are generally considered to be biodegradable in activated sludge system nishihara et al 2000 tezel et al 2012 for example takenaka et al 2007 discovered biodegradation through long term exposure of n dodecyltrimethylammonium chloride to activated sludge bac degradation was observed in aerobic microbial communities after the long term exposure to the bac mixture tandukar et al 2013 these results illustrated that the suppression effect of bec on microorganisms in the smbbr could be reduced through biodegradation eps is a kind of polymer secreted by microorganisms in the face of external pressure of the environment as shown in fig 2c d the variations of pn in lb eps and tb eps had the same trend and the level of pn in lb eps was much lower than that in tb eps the maximum value of pn in lb and tb was 145 02 and 196 89 mg g ss on day 141 respectively pn rose with increasing bec concentration and the content of lb pn in d68 d102 and d141 were 1 40 2 97 and 10 63 times as much as d40 respectively the content of tb pn in d68 d102 and d141 were 0 90 1 24 and 3 18 times as large as d40 respectively the content of ps fluctuated up and down with the operation of smbbr but it was not obvious indicating that the effect of bec on ps was not obvious pn ps ratios ranged from 0 to 37 22 in lb and 2 03 to 7 48 in tb respectively the level of pn was more than that of ps the results indicated microorganisms were sensitive to bec and secreted more pn to protect the system from the impacts of external environmental factors when the microorganism is in the environment containing toxic substances they can secrete more eps especially pn forming protective external layer to avoid the impact of toxic substances rodriguez sanchez et al 2017 in general bec biodegradation and eps secretion especially pn could relieve the toxic inhibition of bec on microorganisms in the smbbr system ensuring the normal ammonia oxidation performance accordingly it was reasonable to predict that resistance genes and microbial community evolutions in smbbr varied with the variations of bec removal pathway and eps 3 4 evolution of bacterial community structure with bec exposure pcoa was displayed to assess the shift of bacterial community structure under different concentrations of bec exposure fig 3 a the two principal coordinates explained 73 51 of the total variance d0 d40 and d68 clustered together which meant that their microbial community structure was similar with the increase of bec concentration the samples gradually moved away from d0 d40 and d68 indicating that the smbbr system adapted to bec exposure through the migration and evolution of bacterial community structure fig 3b showed the abundance variation of phyla with the relative abundance 1 in the system under different bec concentration proteobacteria and bacteroidetes were the main phyla during the entire operation which accounted for 53 63 78 19 and 9 16 18 41 respectively the abundance of nitrospirae decreased significantly during the exposure of 1 0 and 2 0 mg l bec which decreased from 6 48 d68 to 0 81 d102 and 0 d141 in genus level fig 3c nitrospira showed the same trend as nitrospirae whose abundance decreased from 6 45 d68 to 0 81 d102 and 0 d141 the results explained the phenomenon of the smbbr performance from complete nitrification to partial nitrification fig 1 nitrosomonas also showed the decrease trend whose abundance decreased from 1 98 d68 to 1 28 d102 and 0 25 d141 the results manifested nob and aob were sensitive to 1 0 and 2 0 mg l bec which was same as that of previous study wu et al 2022 notably the abundance of aeromonas chiayiivirga and shinella increased from 0 20 0 004 and 0 15 in d0 to 6 03 23 37 and 10 94 in d131 with the increase of bec concentration among them aeromonas has been isolated as benzyldimethylalkylammonium chloride degrader from polluted soil patrauchan and oriel 2003 chiayiivirga is identified as an autotrophic denitrifier in the system of iron electrolysis integrated aerobic granular sludge guo et al 2021 and as a triclosan degrader in the nitrification systems with surfactants jia et al 2020 combined with the increase of bec biodegradation in the system fig 2b it was reasonable to speculate that aeromonas chiayiivirga and shinella might be bec resistant or biodegradation strains in the smbbr in addition rda was applied to clarify the correlations between bacterial community structure genus level and environment variables the eigenvalues of rda1 and rda2 were 77 77 and 7 90 as shown in fig 3d the more complicated relationships were discovered in the quadrant where the samples were located after exposure to bec indicating bacterial community evolution was discovered in response to bec exposure concretely nitrospira piscinibacter and dechlormonas showed an obvious negative correlation with bec proving that they were vulnerable to bec rhodobacter shinella proteobacteria chiayiivirga and aeromonas showed positive correlations with bec finding that these genera might play a vital role in resistance to bec the results indicated that smbbr system adapted to bec exposure through species shifts apparently shinella proteobacteria and chiayiivirga were positively correlated with eps especially pn in tb indicating that these microorganisms might secrete more pn to defense the toxic of bec it was agreed that eps can take major role in several environmental pollution control strategies more et al 2014 overall the shifts of microbial community in smbbr were observed in response to bec exposure 3 5 succession of resistance genes and the relevant resistance mechanisms the production of resistance genes is also a defense mechanism for microorganisms to resist the toxic effects of contaminants the resistance genes detected in this study have three resistance mechanisms including efflux pumps qacedelta1 qace qach and tetg cellular protection sul2 and antibiotic deactivation aac 6 ib aada and blatem fig 4 a the resistance genes related to efflux pumps mechanism were significantly rose with the increase of bec concentration which was the main mechanism of systemic resistance to bec tandukar et al 2013 also demonstrated that efflux pumps mechanism plays a vital role in the resistance of quats the resistance genes related to antibiotic deactivation mechanism also showed an upward trend indicating that they also contributed to resisting bec exposure differently resistance genes with mechanism of cellular protection showed a downward trend specifically the resistance of smbbr system to bec was strengthened mainly through efflux pumps mechanism and antibiotic deactivation mechanism the specific variations of each resistance gene abundance were shown in fig 4b args were the most dominant resistance genes in the system primary phase followed by drgs and mges for args sul2 and blatem were the dominant resistance genes in phase i but tetg and aada became the dominant resistance genes with the increase of bec concentration phase iii and iv in addition the abundance of aac 6 ib also rose with the increase of bec concentration so the increase of sul2 blatem and aac 6 ib might relieve the toxic effects of bec on the smbbr system for drgs qacedelta1 and qach abundance increased as the concentration of bec increasing which were increased by 1 88 and 48 53 times in phase iii and increased by 2 73 and 96 05 times in phase iv compared with those of phase ii the abundance of qace did not change significantly during the whole operation period these results indicated qacedelta1 and qach might play a vital role in the adaptation of bacteria exposed to bec antiseptic resistance genes can contribute to reduced susceptibility to certain antiseptic agents shamsudin et al 2012 the results showed that the bacteria in this nitrification system mainly resisted the toxic effect of bec through the acquisition of qacedelta1 and qach qacedelta1 and qach are quaternary ammonium compounds specific efflux determinants braga et al 2011 tezel and pavlostathis 2015 indicating that the expression of efflux pump was the major mechanism of adaptation to bec notably drgs abundance exceeded args abundance and became the dominant resistance genes in phases iii v fig 4a for mges inti1 was dominant but its abundance decreased eventually with the exposure of bec consistently zhang et al 2016 found that inti1 decreases with the addition of surfactant tween 80 during chicken manure composting li et al 2022 indicated that the relative abundance of inti1 shows reducing trend under the pressure of hexadecyl trimethyl ammonium chloride in partial nitrification anammox system quats may be as major selective agents for the promotion of inti1 gillings et al 2009 but this study found that bec was not in this study mges inti1 inti3 and tnpa 06 did not change significantly during the whole operation suggesting that the main pathway of resistance genes transmission in the smbbr was not horizontal gene transfer hgt in general args and drgs showed different selective pressures to bec and the system resisted bec exposure mainly by increasing drgs the corresponding correlations between resistance genes bec concentration and eps were analyzed fig 4c interestingly mges inti1 inti3 and tnpa 06 had no positive correlation with other resistance genes indicating that these resistance genes detected in this study did not coexist with mges hgt might not act as the main mode of most resistance genes spread in the smbbr system under bec exposure qach showed positive correlation with bec suggesting that microorganism resisted bec exposure mainly by acquiring qach also qach showed significantly positive correlations with qacedelta1 and qace p 0 05 indicating that there might be a cooccurrence relationship between them in addition tetg showed positive correlations with drgs qacedelta1 qach and qace and aminoglycosides resistance genes aada and aac 6 ib these results indicated that bec exposure in the system might cause the co selection of args and drgs previous studies also indicated that the presence of quats contributed to the prevalence of quaternary ammonium resistance genes and the co selection of args tezel and pavlostathis 2015 there was a positive correlation between protein tb pn and lb pn and resistance genes tetg aac 6 ib qacedelta1 and qach indicating that the eps is conducive to the proliferation of resistance genes to some extent huang et al 2014b to further explore the possible hosts of resistance genes in the smbbr the relevant correlation between resistance genes and bacteria the top 10 identified genera was further studied rda showed the relationship between key bacterial populations and resistance genes with rda1 and rda2 of 76 79 and 15 06 as shown in fig s1 partial args tetg aada and aac 6 ib and drgs qacedelta1 qace qach showed positive correlations with chiayiivirga shinella proteobacteria buchnera and filimons suggesting that these bacterial genera might play important roles in the succession and spread of resistance genes furthermore network analysis suggested that total of 26 bacteria showed the significantly positive correlation with the resistance genes fig 4d shinella prosthecobacter filimonas chiayiivirga and buchnera showed the positive correlations with drgs qacedelta1 qace qach p 0 05 which verified the speculation that chiayiivirga might possess bec resistance dokdonella and piscinibacter showed significantly positive correlations with sul2 p 0 01 shinella filimonas buchnera and prosthecobacter were positively correlated with tetg p 0 05 similarly prosthecobacter has been identified as the potential tetracycline resistant bacteria in the activated sludge of sewage treatment plants huang et al 2014a filimonas were positively correlated with aada and aac 6 ib p 0 01 dechloromonas candidatus competibacter mycobacterium piscinibacter and nitrosomonas showed significantly positive correlations with blatem p 0 01 moreover nitrosomonas was positively correlated with sul2 p 0 05 nitrosomonas might act as the host of blatem and sul2 to resist bec however nitrospira showed no positive correlation with any resistance genes quantified in the study which could be the key reason for the vulnerability of nitrospira overall filimonas prosthecobacter and buchnera were top three potential hosts which linked the most resistance genes as each of them linked to over six different resistance genes indicating that they could tolerate a variety of toxic substances 3 6 isolation of bec degrading bacteria and analysis of biodegradation pathway fig 2b illustrated that the biodegradation of bec was gradually rose in the smbbr system for further identifying bec degrading bacteria of the smbbr system four strains were isolated through pure culture using bec as the sole carbon nitrogen and energy source the 16s rrna gene sequences of these organisms were determined using sanger s sequencing method using blast strain bec 1 was closely related to members of the genus klebsiella in which klebsiella oxytoca strain lrc162 had the highest similarity 100 the homology between strain bec 2 and enterobacter cloacae strain was 99 the strain bec 6 has 99 homology with citrobacter freundii the strain bec 7 has 99 homology with pseudomonas putida phylogenetic relationship analysis of the bec metabolizing isolate indicated that the four strains were assigned to the genera of klebsiella enterobacter citrobacter and pseudomonas respectively fig 5 a previous studies found that pseudomonas species can enrich in the microbial communities during continuous exposure to quats which are capable of quats resistance and degradation oh et al 2013 tandukar et al 2013 four strains belonged to gram negative bacteria and proved to be capable of degrading bec fig s2 the relative abundance of klebsiella enterobacter citrobacter and pseudomonas were below 0 91 in the smbbr system among them pseudomonas had the relative higher abundance 0 17 0 91 moreover the relationships between bec degrading bacteria and resistance genes were also been explored fig 5b enterobacter was positively correlated with qacedeltal qace qach aac 6 ib and blatem p 0 05 citrobacter was positively correlated with qach p 0 05 pseudomonas showed positive correlation with qach and blatem p 0 05 qacedelta1 qach and qace are quats specific efflux determinants braga et al 2011 tezel and pavlostathis 2015 in general these three strains of enterobacter citrobacter and pseudomonas possessed the ability of bec degradation and resistance as previously reported the isolates of enterobacter and klebsiella carry biocide resistance genes in their genomes pal et al 2015 additionally bec intermediate metabolites were detected via lc ms using standard materials a total of three metabolites were identified including n n dimethylbenzylamine n benzylmethylamine and benzoic acid fig s3 s5 the biodegradation pathway of bec was inferred based on detected intermediate metabolites which was shown in fig 6 the first step of degradation occurred with the central fission of c n bond marked in red producing the metabolite of n n dimethylbenzylamine and 5 4 tert octyl phenoxy 3 oxapentane 1 ol similarly patrauchan and oriel 2003 indicated that the calkyl n bond cleavage reaction is observed as the first step of bac with benzyl group biodegradation for branch i intermediates were produced consecutively by n demethylation reactions and benzylamine oxidation such as n benzylmethylamine and benzoic acid a similar pathway has been reported in the biodegradation of several quats including bac patrauchan and oriel 2003 and n tetradecylbenzyldimethylammonium chloride tezel et al 2012 which can be degraded by microorganisms for branch ii it was a hypothesized degradation pathway and had no direct documentation further intermediates were needed to be analyzed and proved nonylbenzene a structurally related compound is attacked via ω β oxidation of the side chain sariaslani et al 1974 similarly the degradation of 5 4 tert octyl phenoxy 3 oxapentane 1 ol probably proceeded through the breakdown of the side chain the products of bond fission are correspondent alkanals which might be further converted via beta oxidation pathway van ginkel 1996 this study not only provided a broader view of the degradation of bec by mixed bacteria but also proposed a biodegradation pathway of bec and laid a foundation for its elimination from wastewater 4 conclusions this study revealed the interaction mechanism between bec and smbbr nitrification performance of smbbr was almost not affected with 0 2 mg l bec exposure nitrite oxidation process was serious damaged under the stress of 1 0 2 0 mg l bec when genus nitrospira was significantly inhibited smbbr also made resistance response to bec the main bec metabolic pathway in smbbr changed from biosorption to biodegradation and the microorganisms resisted bec by enriching efflux pumps and antibiotic deactivation encoding genes qacedelta1 qach and aada network analysis confirmed that filimonas prosthecobacter and buchnera were the potential hosts of resistance genes in addition klebsiella enterobacter citrobacter and pseudomonas were isolated as bec degrading bacteria which made it possible for biological treatment to be used in bec removal this study provided a new perspective for disinfectant bec usage and its potential ecological risks which would be an important reference for real bec wastewater treatment credit authorship contribution statement yingchao cui

14712,benzethonium chloride bec is one of emerging bacteriostatic agents bec bearing wastewater generated during sanitary applications in food and medication is easily combined with other wastewater streams to flow into wastewater treatment plants this study focused on the long term 231 days impacts of bec on the sequencing moving bed biofilm nitrification system nitrification performance was tolerant to low concentration of bec 0 2 mg l but the nitrite oxidation was severely inhibited when the concentration of bec was 1 0 2 0 mg l partial nitrification maintained about 140 days with nitrite accumulation ratio over 80 mainly caused by the inhibition of nitrospira nitrotoga and comammox notably bec exposure in the system might cause the co selection of antibiotic resistance genes args and disinfectant resistance genes drgs and the resistance of biofilm system to bec was strengthened by efflux pumps mechanism qacedelta1 and qach and antibiotic deactivation mechanism aada aac 6 ib and blatem extracellular polymeric substances secretion and bec biodegradation were also contributed to the system microorganisms resisting bec exposure in addition klebsiella enterobacter citrobacter and pseudomonas were isolated and identified as bec degrading bacteria the metabolites of n n dimethylbenzylamine n benzylmethylamine and benzoic acid were identified and the biodegradation pathway of bec was proposed this study brought new knowledge about the fate of bec in biological treatment units and laid a foundation for its elimination from wastewater graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords benzethonium chloride partial nitrification inhibitor resistance genes co selection biodegradation strains data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction since the late 1930s quaternary ammonium compounds quats have been widely used in a variety of industrial agricultural clinical and consumer products and applications zhang et al 2015 the influence of the covid 19 pandemic has increased the use of bacteriostatic agents with the excellent virucidal efficacy agathokleous et al 2022 benzethonium chloride bec is the member of the group ii quat cluster classified by united states environmental protection agency usepa 1988 which is often used in everyday products such as disinfectant wipes and cosmetics for instance bec is one of the main ingredients in mouthwashes with concentration of 0 004 which is used to disinfect the oral cavity and oropharyngeal regions iwamura et al 2016 extensive usage would increase the detection of bec in wastewater treatment plants wwtps according to pati and arnold 2020 13 wastewater effluent samples were collected at wwtps bec was detected above the limit of quantification in two samples at concentration of 20 and 70 ng l respectively in the study of östman et al 2017 bec was found in digested sludge with the concentration of 0 120 mg kg d w moreover it has been reported that quats mass load at a wwtp increases more than threefold compared to the pre covid 19 era which would inevitably discharge into the aquatic environment due to incomplete removal and further affect the normal survival of organisms mohapatra et al 2023 therefore wwtps are the main sources and sinks of quats notably biological nitrogen removal is a vital process in wwtps it is necessary to explore the response of biological nitrogen removal processes to quats exposure such as nitrification process the biofilm process as important wastewater treatment system possesses the advantages of high terminal settling velocity of solids high biofilm surface area stronger resistance to adverse impact etc compared to the suspended growth system nicolella et al 2000 xiao et al 2015 therefore it is necessary to carry out research based on biofilm system for quats previous studies reported their effects on biological treatment processes of wwtps yang et al 2015 confirmed that 5 mg l benzalkonium chloride bac shows the negative impact on the nitrification process chen et al 2018 observed that the inhibition on activated sludge increases with the concentration of dodecyl dimethyl benzyl ammonium chloride increasing leading to a decrease in the removal efficiency of ammonia hajaya and pavlostathis 2012 investigated the impact of bacs on the biological nitrogen removal processes showing that nitrification process is more sensitive to bacs than denitrification process nevertheless it is difficult to fully elucidate the responses of aerobic biological treatment processes to quats based on the current researches bec has a paucity of environmental data and might warrant further study and the extremely limited toxicity data of bec on environmental organisms has been available from the current literature sreevidya et al 2018 therefore more related studies are necessary to elucidate the interactions between quats and biological nitrogen removal processes for example it is vital to further focus on the effects of long term bec exposure on nitrification process regarding its environmental implications and potential ecotoxicity on the one hand the effects of bec on nitrification performance in biofilm microbial community structure remain unclear which were worthwhile to explore on the other hand biological removal has the advantages of large processing capacity and low cost so it is necessary to explore effective biological removal of bec and lessen the environmental risk of bec it has been reported that quats not only lead to negative impacts on the microorganisms but also cause the variations of resistance genes in engineered environment yang and wang 2018 found that the bacteria abundance quats resistant gene qaca b and nitrogen cycle related genes in natural water from eutrophic lake change to varying degrees when exposed to 10 1000 µg l benzyldimethyldodecyl ammonium chloride tandukar et al 2013 found that the reduction of community diversity and the increase of antibiotic resistance penicillin g tetracycline ciprofloxacin of river sediment occur under 50 mg l bacs exposure in addition antibacterial biocides possess the ability to co select for antibiotic resistant bacteria scenihr 2009 the promoted selection and spread of resistant bacterial strains and genes by quats can restrict the treatment methods for microbial infections and threaten human health hegstad et al 2010 perceptibly few studies focused on resistance genes succession in the biological treatment processes of wwtps affected by bec one of common quats moreover disinfectants may induce potentially pathogenic bacteria and promote the evolution and transmission of drug resistance due to the hormetic effects aslam et al 2018 however there was a lack of studies on relationships between bec and resistance genes thus this study simultaneously explored the impacts of bec on microbial diversity and resistance genes transmission in nitrification process it is great meaningful to fill the gap in the insights of interaction mechanism between bec and biological treatment processes based on the above elaboration this study evaluated the responses of the nitrification performance in the sequencing moving bed biofilm system at different levels of bec exposure the response mechanisms of microorganisms in the system were revealed by quantitative polymerase chain reaction qpcr extracellular polymeric substances eps and high throughput sequencing meantime the variation of the resistance genes abundance in different classes was discussed the possible host bacteria of resistance genes were identified combined with the shifts of microbial community in the system and the co selection mode of resistance genes and microbial populations was evaluated in addition the enriched bacteria were isolated and identified under high concentration of bec and the bec degrading bacteria were identified by pure culture method the bec intermediates were detected using liquid chromatography and tandem mass spectrometry lc ms proposing bec biodegradation pathway this study would bring a comprehensive insight into the interactions between bec and biofilm nitrification system from different perspectives especially the evolutions of resistance genes and the identification of bec degrading bacteria in the nitrification process 2 materials and methods 2 1 reactor set up and experimental framework a sequencing moving bed biofilm reactor smbbr was used to carry out the experiment with a packing ratio of 30 and the biofilm carriers were highly porous plastic foam cubes polyurethane the effective volume of smbbr was 3 0 l and the discharge volume was 1 5 l the activated sludge from gaobeidian wastewater treatment plant beijing china was inoculated as the seed sludge synthetic wastewater was applied in this study with the influent compositions consisting of 39 10 3 95 mg l nh4 n and 170 71 16 52 mg l chemical oxygen demand the biomass of the smbbr fluctuated at 4000 6000 mg l the sludge retention time of smbbr was about 23 24 days each cycle was carried out 4 h composing of 6 min feeding 180 min aerating 30 min depositing 1 min draining and 23 min idle which was conducted six cycles per day the dissolved oxygen do was 2 5 mg l the temperature of the whole reaction process was maintained at 22 2 c and the influent ph of smbbr was around 7 5 without any regulation the long term operation was conducted to explore the impact of bec and divided into five phases depending on the concentration of bec from day 0 to day 40 phase i smbbr was run as activated sludge acclimation and biofilm growth stage the biomass all grew on the carriers with almost no suspended sludge at the end of phase i concentrations of quats detected worldwide in surface water and wastewater effluent range from 1 μg l to 60 μg l and quats have been found to be up to 10 times these levels in influent wastewater zhang et al 2015 moreover concentrations of quats detected in effluent of hospital wastewater up to mg l di nica et al 2017 hora and arnold 2020 since bec is a type of quats the environmental concentration of quats was used as a reference according to the levels of quats in different environment smbbr were operated for 231 days consisting of five phases start up phase phase i 0 2 mg l bec exposure from day 41 to day 68 phase ii 1 0 mg l bec exposure from day 69 to day 102 phase iii 2 0 mg l bec exposure from day 103 to day 141 phase iv and 0 mg l bec exposure from day 142 to day 231 phase v there was almost no suspended sludge during the phase ii v in smbbr the impacts of bec on nitrification system from low to high concentration were studied in addition the response of nitrification system after cessation of bec exposure was also investigated 2 2 samples preparation eps detection and qpcr analysis the biofilm samples of the smbbr on day 0 40 68 84 102 131 141 184 and 231 were collected which was named as d0 d40 d68 d84 d102 d131 d141 d184 and d231 representing that the initial sample and samples from the interval or the end of the five phases collected biofilm samples were stored at 20 c for subsequent eps and dna extraction in addition nitrifying bacteria activities were tested by batch experiments at the end of each phase and the specific process were depicted in previous literatures wang et al 2017 zhao et al 2023 the modified heat extraction method was applied to obtain eps li and yang 2007 specifically the loosely bound eps lb eps and tightly bound eps tb eps were divided and analyzed in this study in addition the phenol sulfuric acid method and modified lowry method were adopted to detect the amount of polysaccharide ps and protein pn in eps respectively fastdna spin kit for soil qiagen usa was used to extract total dna of each freeze dried sample in accordance with the manufacturer s instructions the purity and concentration of the extracted dna were detected by nanodrop onec thermo fisher scientific usa then ammonium oxidizing bacteria aob amoa gene nitrobacter nxrb gene nitrospira nxrb gene nirotoga 16s gene complete ammonia oxidizers comammox amoa gene and total bacterial 16s rrna gene were analyzed by qpcr and the primers were referred to that of previous study wu et al 2022 a total of 11 resistance genes were selected to investigate their evolutions of the smbbr including four main classes of antibiotic resistance genes args which contained tetracycline tetg sulfonamides sul2 beta lactam blatem and aminoglycosides aada and aac 6 ib resistance genes three disinfectant resistance genes drgs of qacedelta1 qach and qace were also detected besides the integron integrase genes inti1 and inti3 and transposase gene tnpa 06 were quantified to investigate the transfer or propagation of mobile genetic elements mges the primers information of these resistance genes was listed in table s1 the detailed qpcr operation process was described in the previous literature cui et al 2023 and the details of high throughput sequencing and bioinformation data analysis were shown in method s1 2 3 isolation and identification of bec degrading bacteria in the smbbr system the bec degrading bacteria was isolated from the smbbr specifically the supernatant of biofilm taken from the end of phase iv was diluted using sterile water into different concentration gradients and then uniformly coated on solid mineral salt culture medium including bec in sterile environment the solid mineral salt culture medium composited by 2 0 g l nh4 2so4 1 5 g l na2hpo4 12h2o 1 5 g l kh2po4 0 01 g l cacl2 2h2o 0 2 g l mgso4 7h2o 0 001 g l feso4 7h2o and 18 0 g l agar the medium was added 5 0 mg l bec as the sole carbon nitrogen and energy source the culture was inverted in the constant temperature incubator 37 c and the single colonies with different shapes sizes and colors were selected the isolated pure strains were identified using 16s rrna gene cloning method the gene sequences were input to the gene bank of the national center for biotechnology information ncbi for blasting and analyzing with the 16s r rna sequences and the phylogenetic tree was constructed using mega 7 0 other analytical methods used in this study were summarized in method s2 3 results and discussion 3 1 effects of bec exposure on nitrification performance in smbbr the smbbr was operated for 231 days and its performance variation was shown in fig 1 a b during phase i the smbbr possessed good full nitrification performance without bec exposure the ammonium of the effluent was below 0 50 mg l and the effluent nitrate was above 28 08 mg l at 0 2 mg l bec exposure stage phase ii nitrification performance was maintained well with the effluent average ammonium and nitrate of 0 90 mg l and 34 05 mg l respectively but aob and nitrite oxidizing bacteria nob activities decreased from 6 02 and 4 70 mg n g biomass h at the end of phase i to 5 09 and 3 19 mg n g biomass h at the end of phase ii respectively fig 1 c single sample t test did not reveal any significant difference in nitrifying bacteria activities between phase i and phase ii p aob 0 054 p nob 0 121 therefore the effect of 0 2 mg l bec on the nitrification capacity of smbbr was not significant at the initial adding 1 0 mg l bec phase iii the ammonia oxidation was inhibited and the ammonium removal efficiency decreased to 17 10 subsequently the ammonia oxidation gradually recovered and nitrite accumulation occurred with the nitrite accumulation ratio nar around 85 00 suggesting that the exposure of 1 0 mg l bec eventually inhibited nob activity as shown in fig 1c nob activity decreased to 2 78 mg n g biomass h at the end of phase iii previous studies found that bec can selectively eliminate nob in activated sludge under the condition of addition 1 2 mg l or immersion 70 mg l cui et al 2020 wu et al 2022 at 2 0 mg l bec exposure stage phase iv the ammonia oxidation was inhibited at the initial adding stage with the highest effluent ammonia of 22 42 mg l but recovered completely within 3 days implying that aob showed excellent adaptability to bec and the smbbr maintained partial nitrification with nar of 89 28 during the phase iv correspondingly aob activity and nob activity were 4 32 and 1 33 mg n g biomass h respectively at the end of phase iv nob activity showed a further downward trend interestingly the partial nitrification remained stable for 87 days when the exposure of bec was ceased phase v which might be caused by the persistent inhibition of nob by bec and the long generation time of nob mulder et al 2001 as shown in fig 1c nob activity kept the low value of 0 47 mg n g biomass h on day 185 on day 231 the nitrification performance recovered completely with the effluent nitrate of 26 86 mg l predictably aob activity and nob activity increased to 6 18 and 2 79 mg n g biomass h at the end of phase v respectively in general smbbr system showed tolerant to low concentration of bec 0 2 mg l but the nitrite oxidation ability of smbbr showed serious inhibition when the concentration of bec was 1 0 2 0 mg l between phase iii and phase v partial nitrification maintained about 140 days nar 80 from the view of the recovery ammonia oxidation performance smbbr system could execute ammonia oxidation while resisting bec which might be caused by the development and transmission of multi drug resistant genes or the degradation of bec from the perspective of the accumulation of nitrite nob showed more fragile than aob under bec exposure demonstrating that bec could be used as a novel partial nitrification inhibitor 3 2 responses of nitrification functional genes abundance to bec exposure to better illustrate the reasons of system performance variations nitrifying bacteria abundance of the smbbr was detected and shown in fig 2 a for total bacteria the absolute abundance of bacteria 16s increased from 2 33 1013 copies g biomass d0 to 2 43 1013 copies g biomass d40 in phase i which had no statistically significant difference p 0 88 in phase ii its abundance rose to 2 63 1013 copies g biomass d68 suggesting that low concentration of bec 0 2 mg l had no inhibition on the number of total bacteria in phase iii total bacteria abundance reduced from 7 42 1013 copies g biomass d84 to 2 83 1013 copies g biomass d102 in phase iv the bacteria 16s abundance decreased from 4 50 1013 copies g biomass d131 to 6 21 1011 copies g biomass d141 it could be found that 2 0 mg l bec exposure affected the abundance of total bacteria more seriously compared to 1 0 mg l bec in phase v the bacteria 16s abundance increased to 1 32 1012 copies g biomass d185 and 1 27 1012 copies g biomass d231 after ceasing bec exposure for aob the absolute abundance showed an increasing trend compared to that of seed sludge however its abundance first decreased from 6 40 109 copies g biomass d84 to 5 29 108 copies g biomass d102 then increased to 2 71 109 copies g biomass d131 suggesting that bec led to the temporary inhibitory effect on aob overall the activity and abundance of aob showed the similar trend for nob nitrospira abundance increased from 7 27 1012 copies g biomass d0 in phase i to 2 62 1013 copies g biomass d68 in phase ii indicating that low concentration of bec 0 2 mg l showed hormesis effect on nitrospira in phase iii the nitrospira abundance significantly reduced to 2 21 1010 copies g biomass d84 with the p value less than 0 01 which was the reason for the increase of effluent nitrite concentration after adding 1 0 mg l bec and its abundance increased to 9 53 1011 copies g biomass d102 indicating nitrospira had the potential to adapt to 1 0 mg l bec exposure in phase iv the nitrospira abundance decreased to 4 07 1010 copies g biomass d131 and 1 34 109 copies g biomass d141 its abundance gradually rose to 4 10 109 copies g biomass d184 and 3 95 1010 copies g biomass d231 in phase v these results indicated that 2 0 mg l bec could continuously inhibit nob and its inhibition would slowly disappear after ceasing bec exposure in phase i to iii the nitrobacter abundance fluctuated within the scope of 9 10 1010 copies g biomass d0 and 1 76 1011 copies g biomass d68 indicating that 0 2 1 0 mg l bec showed mild to nitrobacter at the end of phase iv nitrobacter decreased significantly to 2 85 1010 copies g biomass d141 with the p value less than 0 01 indicating that nitrobacter could not tolerate long term exposure to 2 0 mg l bec for nitrotoga its abundance was unaffected by 0 2 mg l bec with 7 71 107 copies g biomass d68 after the exposure of 1 0 2 0 mg l bec its abundance reduced to 1 59 107 copies g biomass d102 in phase iii and maintained at 2 23 107 copies g biomass d141 in phase iv when the exposure of bec was ceased the nitrotoga abundance increased gradually to 1 38 109 copies g biomass d231 significantly exceeded its original level with the p value less than 0 01 similarly comammox was unaffected by 0 2 mg l bec but showed a downward trend after adding higher concentration of bec whose abundance reduced from 1 09 1011 copies g biomass d68 to 1 06 1010 copies g biomass d102 at the end of phase iii and 2 04 1010 copies g biomass d141 at the end of phase iv after ceasing exposure of bec comammox abundance slightly increased to 4 35 1010 copies g biomass d231 overall the inhibitory effect of 1 0 2 0 mg l bec on aob was temporary and recoverable but on nob was destructive and irreversible especially nitrospira nitrotoga and comammox which perfectly explained the phenomenon of nitrite accumulation and low nob activity phase iii to phase iv in smbbr fig 1 the decisive factors resulting in the instability of partial nitrification in phase v were the increase of nitrotoga followed by nitrobacter the changes of nitrification performance and functional bacteria abundance not only showed the effect of bec on the smbbr system but also highlight the resistance of the system to bec 3 3 fate of bec and eps production in smbbr the batch tests of mass balance were performed at each stage to clarify the variation of bec removal pathway as shown in fig 2b biosorption was the main removal pathway in phase ii and iii with the removal efficiency of 87 76 and 84 84 which was consistent with that quats are easily adsorbed onto sewage sludge brycki et al 2014 martínez carballo et al 2007 the biodegradation efficiency was only 2 78 and 9 93 respectively however biodegradation became the main pathway to remove bec with the extension of operation time the biodegradation efficiency was 82 00 in phase iv which also remained around 80 00 after ceasing bec exposure phase v indicating that there might enrich the bec degrading bacteria in the smbbr the ratio of biosorption decreased to 2 70 in phase iv and 5 40 in phase v quats are generally considered to be biodegradable in activated sludge system nishihara et al 2000 tezel et al 2012 for example takenaka et al 2007 discovered biodegradation through long term exposure of n dodecyltrimethylammonium chloride to activated sludge bac degradation was observed in aerobic microbial communities after the long term exposure to the bac mixture tandukar et al 2013 these results illustrated that the suppression effect of bec on microorganisms in the smbbr could be reduced through biodegradation eps is a kind of polymer secreted by microorganisms in the face of external pressure of the environment as shown in fig 2c d the variations of pn in lb eps and tb eps had the same trend and the level of pn in lb eps was much lower than that in tb eps the maximum value of pn in lb and tb was 145 02 and 196 89 mg g ss on day 141 respectively pn rose with increasing bec concentration and the content of lb pn in d68 d102 and d141 were 1 40 2 97 and 10 63 times as much as d40 respectively the content of tb pn in d68 d102 and d141 were 0 90 1 24 and 3 18 times as large as d40 respectively the content of ps fluctuated up and down with the operation of smbbr but it was not obvious indicating that the effect of bec on ps was not obvious pn ps ratios ranged from 0 to 37 22 in lb and 2 03 to 7 48 in tb respectively the level of pn was more than that of ps the results indicated microorganisms were sensitive to bec and secreted more pn to protect the system from the impacts of external environmental factors when the microorganism is in the environment containing toxic substances they can secrete more eps especially pn forming protective external layer to avoid the impact of toxic substances rodriguez sanchez et al 2017 in general bec biodegradation and eps secretion especially pn could relieve the toxic inhibition of bec on microorganisms in the smbbr system ensuring the normal ammonia oxidation performance accordingly it was reasonable to predict that resistance genes and microbial community evolutions in smbbr varied with the variations of bec removal pathway and eps 3 4 evolution of bacterial community structure with bec exposure pcoa was displayed to assess the shift of bacterial community structure under different concentrations of bec exposure fig 3 a the two principal coordinates explained 73 51 of the total variance d0 d40 and d68 clustered together which meant that their microbial community structure was similar with the increase of bec concentration the samples gradually moved away from d0 d40 and d68 indicating that the smbbr system adapted to bec exposure through the migration and evolution of bacterial community structure fig 3b showed the abundance variation of phyla with the relative abundance 1 in the system under different bec concentration proteobacteria and bacteroidetes were the main phyla during the entire operation which accounted for 53 63 78 19 and 9 16 18 41 respectively the abundance of nitrospirae decreased significantly during the exposure of 1 0 and 2 0 mg l bec which decreased from 6 48 d68 to 0 81 d102 and 0 d141 in genus level fig 3c nitrospira showed the same trend as nitrospirae whose abundance decreased from 6 45 d68 to 0 81 d102 and 0 d141 the results explained the phenomenon of the smbbr performance from complete nitrification to partial nitrification fig 1 nitrosomonas also showed the decrease trend whose abundance decreased from 1 98 d68 to 1 28 d102 and 0 25 d141 the results manifested nob and aob were sensitive to 1 0 and 2 0 mg l bec which was same as that of previous study wu et al 2022 notably the abundance of aeromonas chiayiivirga and shinella increased from 0 20 0 004 and 0 15 in d0 to 6 03 23 37 and 10 94 in d131 with the increase of bec concentration among them aeromonas has been isolated as benzyldimethylalkylammonium chloride degrader from polluted soil patrauchan and oriel 2003 chiayiivirga is identified as an autotrophic denitrifier in the system of iron electrolysis integrated aerobic granular sludge guo et al 2021 and as a triclosan degrader in the nitrification systems with surfactants jia et al 2020 combined with the increase of bec biodegradation in the system fig 2b it was reasonable to speculate that aeromonas chiayiivirga and shinella might be bec resistant or biodegradation strains in the smbbr in addition rda was applied to clarify the correlations between bacterial community structure genus level and environment variables the eigenvalues of rda1 and rda2 were 77 77 and 7 90 as shown in fig 3d the more complicated relationships were discovered in the quadrant where the samples were located after exposure to bec indicating bacterial community evolution was discovered in response to bec exposure concretely nitrospira piscinibacter and dechlormonas showed an obvious negative correlation with bec proving that they were vulnerable to bec rhodobacter shinella proteobacteria chiayiivirga and aeromonas showed positive correlations with bec finding that these genera might play a vital role in resistance to bec the results indicated that smbbr system adapted to bec exposure through species shifts apparently shinella proteobacteria and chiayiivirga were positively correlated with eps especially pn in tb indicating that these microorganisms might secrete more pn to defense the toxic of bec it was agreed that eps can take major role in several environmental pollution control strategies more et al 2014 overall the shifts of microbial community in smbbr were observed in response to bec exposure 3 5 succession of resistance genes and the relevant resistance mechanisms the production of resistance genes is also a defense mechanism for microorganisms to resist the toxic effects of contaminants the resistance genes detected in this study have three resistance mechanisms including efflux pumps qacedelta1 qace qach and tetg cellular protection sul2 and antibiotic deactivation aac 6 ib aada and blatem fig 4 a the resistance genes related to efflux pumps mechanism were significantly rose with the increase of bec concentration which was the main mechanism of systemic resistance to bec tandukar et al 2013 also demonstrated that efflux pumps mechanism plays a vital role in the resistance of quats the resistance genes related to antibiotic deactivation mechanism also showed an upward trend indicating that they also contributed to resisting bec exposure differently resistance genes with mechanism of cellular protection showed a downward trend specifically the resistance of smbbr system to bec was strengthened mainly through efflux pumps mechanism and antibiotic deactivation mechanism the specific variations of each resistance gene abundance were shown in fig 4b args were the most dominant resistance genes in the system primary phase followed by drgs and mges for args sul2 and blatem were the dominant resistance genes in phase i but tetg and aada became the dominant resistance genes with the increase of bec concentration phase iii and iv in addition the abundance of aac 6 ib also rose with the increase of bec concentration so the increase of sul2 blatem and aac 6 ib might relieve the toxic effects of bec on the smbbr system for drgs qacedelta1 and qach abundance increased as the concentration of bec increasing which were increased by 1 88 and 48 53 times in phase iii and increased by 2 73 and 96 05 times in phase iv compared with those of phase ii the abundance of qace did not change significantly during the whole operation period these results indicated qacedelta1 and qach might play a vital role in the adaptation of bacteria exposed to bec antiseptic resistance genes can contribute to reduced susceptibility to certain antiseptic agents shamsudin et al 2012 the results showed that the bacteria in this nitrification system mainly resisted the toxic effect of bec through the acquisition of qacedelta1 and qach qacedelta1 and qach are quaternary ammonium compounds specific efflux determinants braga et al 2011 tezel and pavlostathis 2015 indicating that the expression of efflux pump was the major mechanism of adaptation to bec notably drgs abundance exceeded args abundance and became the dominant resistance genes in phases iii v fig 4a for mges inti1 was dominant but its abundance decreased eventually with the exposure of bec consistently zhang et al 2016 found that inti1 decreases with the addition of surfactant tween 80 during chicken manure composting li et al 2022 indicated that the relative abundance of inti1 shows reducing trend under the pressure of hexadecyl trimethyl ammonium chloride in partial nitrification anammox system quats may be as major selective agents for the promotion of inti1 gillings et al 2009 but this study found that bec was not in this study mges inti1 inti3 and tnpa 06 did not change significantly during the whole operation suggesting that the main pathway of resistance genes transmission in the smbbr was not horizontal gene transfer hgt in general args and drgs showed different selective pressures to bec and the system resisted bec exposure mainly by increasing drgs the corresponding correlations between resistance genes bec concentration and eps were analyzed fig 4c interestingly mges inti1 inti3 and tnpa 06 had no positive correlation with other resistance genes indicating that these resistance genes detected in this study did not coexist with mges hgt might not act as the main mode of most resistance genes spread in the smbbr system under bec exposure qach showed positive correlation with bec suggesting that microorganism resisted bec exposure mainly by acquiring qach also qach showed significantly positive correlations with qacedelta1 and qace p 0 05 indicating that there might be a cooccurrence relationship between them in addition tetg showed positive correlations with drgs qacedelta1 qach and qace and aminoglycosides resistance genes aada and aac 6 ib these results indicated that bec exposure in the system might cause the co selection of args and drgs previous studies also indicated that the presence of quats contributed to the prevalence of quaternary ammonium resistance genes and the co selection of args tezel and pavlostathis 2015 there was a positive correlation between protein tb pn and lb pn and resistance genes tetg aac 6 ib qacedelta1 and qach indicating that the eps is conducive to the proliferation of resistance genes to some extent huang et al 2014b to further explore the possible hosts of resistance genes in the smbbr the relevant correlation between resistance genes and bacteria the top 10 identified genera was further studied rda showed the relationship between key bacterial populations and resistance genes with rda1 and rda2 of 76 79 and 15 06 as shown in fig s1 partial args tetg aada and aac 6 ib and drgs qacedelta1 qace qach showed positive correlations with chiayiivirga shinella proteobacteria buchnera and filimons suggesting that these bacterial genera might play important roles in the succession and spread of resistance genes furthermore network analysis suggested that total of 26 bacteria showed the significantly positive correlation with the resistance genes fig 4d shinella prosthecobacter filimonas chiayiivirga and buchnera showed the positive correlations with drgs qacedelta1 qace qach p 0 05 which verified the speculation that chiayiivirga might possess bec resistance dokdonella and piscinibacter showed significantly positive correlations with sul2 p 0 01 shinella filimonas buchnera and prosthecobacter were positively correlated with tetg p 0 05 similarly prosthecobacter has been identified as the potential tetracycline resistant bacteria in the activated sludge of sewage treatment plants huang et al 2014a filimonas were positively correlated with aada and aac 6 ib p 0 01 dechloromonas candidatus competibacter mycobacterium piscinibacter and nitrosomonas showed significantly positive correlations with blatem p 0 01 moreover nitrosomonas was positively correlated with sul2 p 0 05 nitrosomonas might act as the host of blatem and sul2 to resist bec however nitrospira showed no positive correlation with any resistance genes quantified in the study which could be the key reason for the vulnerability of nitrospira overall filimonas prosthecobacter and buchnera were top three potential hosts which linked the most resistance genes as each of them linked to over six different resistance genes indicating that they could tolerate a variety of toxic substances 3 6 isolation of bec degrading bacteria and analysis of biodegradation pathway fig 2b illustrated that the biodegradation of bec was gradually rose in the smbbr system for further identifying bec degrading bacteria of the smbbr system four strains were isolated through pure culture using bec as the sole carbon nitrogen and energy source the 16s rrna gene sequences of these organisms were determined using sanger s sequencing method using blast strain bec 1 was closely related to members of the genus klebsiella in which klebsiella oxytoca strain lrc162 had the highest similarity 100 the homology between strain bec 2 and enterobacter cloacae strain was 99 the strain bec 6 has 99 homology with citrobacter freundii the strain bec 7 has 99 homology with pseudomonas putida phylogenetic relationship analysis of the bec metabolizing isolate indicated that the four strains were assigned to the genera of klebsiella enterobacter citrobacter and pseudomonas respectively fig 5 a previous studies found that pseudomonas species can enrich in the microbial communities during continuous exposure to quats which are capable of quats resistance and degradation oh et al 2013 tandukar et al 2013 four strains belonged to gram negative bacteria and proved to be capable of degrading bec fig s2 the relative abundance of klebsiella enterobacter citrobacter and pseudomonas were below 0 91 in the smbbr system among them pseudomonas had the relative higher abundance 0 17 0 91 moreover the relationships between bec degrading bacteria and resistance genes were also been explored fig 5b enterobacter was positively correlated with qacedeltal qace qach aac 6 ib and blatem p 0 05 citrobacter was positively correlated with qach p 0 05 pseudomonas showed positive correlation with qach and blatem p 0 05 qacedelta1 qach and qace are quats specific efflux determinants braga et al 2011 tezel and pavlostathis 2015 in general these three strains of enterobacter citrobacter and pseudomonas possessed the ability of bec degradation and resistance as previously reported the isolates of enterobacter and klebsiella carry biocide resistance genes in their genomes pal et al 2015 additionally bec intermediate metabolites were detected via lc ms using standard materials a total of three metabolites were identified including n n dimethylbenzylamine n benzylmethylamine and benzoic acid fig s3 s5 the biodegradation pathway of bec was inferred based on detected intermediate metabolites which was shown in fig 6 the first step of degradation occurred with the central fission of c n bond marked in red producing the metabolite of n n dimethylbenzylamine and 5 4 tert octyl phenoxy 3 oxapentane 1 ol similarly patrauchan and oriel 2003 indicated that the calkyl n bond cleavage reaction is observed as the first step of bac with benzyl group biodegradation for branch i intermediates were produced consecutively by n demethylation reactions and benzylamine oxidation such as n benzylmethylamine and benzoic acid a similar pathway has been reported in the biodegradation of several quats including bac patrauchan and oriel 2003 and n tetradecylbenzyldimethylammonium chloride tezel et al 2012 which can be degraded by microorganisms for branch ii it was a hypothesized degradation pathway and had no direct documentation further intermediates were needed to be analyzed and proved nonylbenzene a structurally related compound is attacked via ω β oxidation of the side chain sariaslani et al 1974 similarly the degradation of 5 4 tert octyl phenoxy 3 oxapentane 1 ol probably proceeded through the breakdown of the side chain the products of bond fission are correspondent alkanals which might be further converted via beta oxidation pathway van ginkel 1996 this study not only provided a broader view of the degradation of bec by mixed bacteria but also proposed a biodegradation pathway of bec and laid a foundation for its elimination from wastewater 4 conclusions this study revealed the interaction mechanism between bec and smbbr nitrification performance of smbbr was almost not affected with 0 2 mg l bec exposure nitrite oxidation process was serious damaged under the stress of 1 0 2 0 mg l bec when genus nitrospira was significantly inhibited smbbr also made resistance response to bec the main bec metabolic pathway in smbbr changed from biosorption to biodegradation and the microorganisms resisted bec by enriching efflux pumps and antibiotic deactivation encoding genes qacedelta1 qach and aada network analysis confirmed that filimonas prosthecobacter and buchnera were the potential hosts of resistance genes in addition klebsiella enterobacter citrobacter and pseudomonas were isolated as bec degrading bacteria which made it possible for biological treatment to be used in bec removal this study provided a new perspective for disinfectant bec usage and its potential ecological risks which would be an important reference for real bec wastewater treatment credit authorship contribution statement yingchao cui

14713,membrane distillation md is a thermally driven process that can treat high concentration streams and provide a dual barrier for rejection and reduction of pathogens thus md has potential applications in treating concentrated wastewater brines for enhancing water recovery and potable water reuse in bench scale studies it was demonstrated that md can provide high rejection of ms2 and phix174 bacteriophage viruses and when operating at temperatures greater than 55 c can reduce virus levels in the concentrate however bench scale md results cannot directly be used to predict pilot scale contaminant rejection and removal of viruses because of the lower water flux and higher transmembrane hydraulic pressure difference in pilot scale systems thus far virus rejection and removal have not been quantified in pilot scale md systems in this work the rejection of ms2 and phix174 at low 40 c and high 70 c inlet temperatures is quantified in a pilot scale air gap md system using tertiary treated wastewater both viruses were detected in the distillate which suggests the presence of pore flow the virus rejection at a hot inlet temperature of 40 c for ms2 and phix174 were 1 6 log10 and 3 1 log10 respectively at 70 c virus concentrations in the brine decreased and were below the detection limit 1 pfu per 100 ml after 4 5 h however viruses were also detected in the distillate in that duration results demonstrate that virus rejection is lower in pilot scale experiments because of increased pore flow that is not captured in bench scale experiments graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords membrane distillation pilot scale virus rejection potable water reuse reverse osmosis concentrate concentrate management data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction membrane distillation md is a thermally driven process in which a microporous hydrophobic membrane is the separating interface between a heated impaired feed stream and a chilled product stream the resulting temperature difference across the membrane creates a vapor pressure difference that acts as the driving force for water vapor transport across the membrane from the impaired feed stream brine to a pure distillate stream md has been demonstrated as a potential process to treat municipal wastewater and other unconventional water sources and enhance water recovery deshmukh et al 2018 naidu et al 2017 cath et al 2005 hickenbottom and cath 2014 morrow et al 2018 balis et al 2022 glover et al 2022 presson et al 2023 because vapor pressure is a weak function of salinity and the driving force in md is proportional to the transmembrane vapor pressure difference md can treat high concentration streams in the presence of a sufficiently large temperature difference hardikar et al 2020 md can also achieve high rejection of non volatile contaminants because only the vapor phase permeates through the membrane md therefore can potentially be used in water reuse to recover water with high purity additionally md can aid in reducing the concentration of pathogens in the concentrate because it is operated at elevated temperatures 40 80 c hardikar et al 2021 seo et al 2012 bertrand et al 2012 a recent study using a bench scale system demonstrated that md provides a dual barrier for virus removal and rejection when treating ro concentrate from reclaimed wastewater hardikar et al 2021 the study reported 6 log10 rejection of ms2 and phix174 bacteriophages and a rapid decrease in virus concentration in the feed stream at 65 c because of virus inactivation at elevated temperatures while the study reported a high rejection of both viruses phix174 was detected in the distillate which suggests the presence of pore flow pore flow in md occurs because of loss in pore hydrophobicity or pore wetting which enables the liquid phase to permeate from the feed stream to the distillate side pore wetting may occur if the maximum liquid entry pressure of the pore is exceeded by either the presence of large pores that are wetted at low operating pressure and or by salt precipitation within the pore chamani et al 2021 rezaei et al 2018 chang et al 2021 guillen burrieza et al 2016 horseman et al 2021 straub and elimelech 2017 pore flow is proportional to the transmembrane hydraulic pressure difference across the membrane which is a function of the system size therefore results from bench scale studies may not be directly translatable to pilot scale because of differences in membrane size temperature profile and hydraulic pressure between the two systems hardikar et al 2020 hardikar et al 2023 bench scale md systems fig 1 a are beneficial for the rapid testing of new membranes and generally allow for the assessment of small membrane coupons order of cm2 bush et al 2016 mcgaughey et al 2017 tang et al 2022 tan et al 2022 hu et al 2022 gustafson et al 2016 the direct contact membrane distillation dcmd configuration is most commonly used for bench scale studies in which both the feed and distillate streams are in direct contact with either side of the membrane hardikar et al 2022 couto et al 2019 because of a small membrane area and short flow channel the temperature in the channel remains almost constant along the direction of flow and the temperature difference across the membrane is uniform as shown in fig 1a the short flow channel also results in a small less than 50 mbar transmembrane hydraulic pressure difference across the membrane when operated with similar flow rates on either side of the membrane a lower transmembrane hydraulic pressure difference would result in reduced transport of non volatile contaminants through convective pore flow pilot scale md systems fig 1b are designed to be energy efficient by maximizing heat recovery during operation andrés mañas et al 2020 swaminathan et al 2018 a commonly used pilot scale configuration for its energy efficiency and simplicity is air gap md agmd zaragoza et al 2018 in the agmd configuration the evaporator and condenser channels are separated by an air gap to minimize conductive heat loss schwantes et al 2018 bindels et al 2018 in a pilot scale agmd configuration the temperature in the evaporator channel drops in the direction of flow and the evaporator channel loses heat in the form of latent heat of evaporation water vapor production and conductive heat losses the heat lost by the evaporator channel is recovered and used to preheat the condenser stream thus minimizing the thermal input required for operating the system as a result the transmembrane temperature difference and the water vapor flux are lower in pilot scale systems compared to bench scale systems swaminathan et al 2016 additionally the transmembrane hydraulic pressure difference is higher in pilot scale systems because of the longer flow channel which results in greater hydraulic pressure within the evaporator channel compared to bench scale configurations as convective pore flow is proportional to the hydraulic pressure difference atangana 2018 the transport of non volatile contaminants through convective pore flow is elevated relative to bench scale systems a lower water flux and higher transmembrane hydraulic pressure convective pore flow could both lead to an increase in the concentration of non volatile contaminants in the distillate and reduced contaminant and pathogen rejection few pilot scale studies have reported transport of contaminants across the membrane with an increase in the pressure difference across the membrane andrés mañas et al 2020 ruiz aguirre et al 2019 hardikar et al 2020 pilot scale md studies to date have mainly explored the biocidal effects of membrane surface modification for the removal of pathogens in water i gupta et al 2021 i gupta et al 2021 i gupta et al 2021 however virus rejection and removal in a pilot scale agmd has thus far not been reported the objective of this study is to quantify the virus rejection and removal in a pilot scale agmd configuration non enveloped ms2 and phix174 bacteriophages were used as surrogate pathogens and tertiary treated wastewater was used as the brine to replicate conditions used in a previous bench scale study and evaluate rejection of ions and organics hardikar et al 2021 membrane rejection of viruses was first measured at a low brine temperature of 40 c to ensure constant virus concentration in the brine after which the temperature was increased to 70 c to determine the rate of reduction in virus concentration because of inactivation at higher temperatures in the pilot scale system in comparison to bench top experiments 2 materials and methods 2 1 pilot scale air gap membrane distillation system pilot scale experiments were performed using a vacuum assisted agmd system aquastill sittard the netherlands a schematic of the agmd system is illustrated in fig 2 the membrane module area was 25 92 m2 with 12 hot and cold brine channels and a channel length of 2 7 m the brine from the brine tank was first chilled recirculated through the condenser channel and then heated before entering the evaporator channel and returning to the brine tank water vapor that permeated through the membrane was condensed on the condenser plate in the air gap and collected in the distillate tank the air gap pressure was maintained at 500 mbar vacuum using a venturi brine and distillate samples were collected for subsequent analysis when the distillate was discharged from its tank in 3 liter increments permeate from a pilot scale ultrafiltration uf system was used as the feed solution to the agmd system and delivered to the constant volume brine tank because of the low single pass recovery rate approximately 3 in the present study md systems are generally designed to operate in recirculation mode batch or pseudo steady state semi batch modes hence the conductivity of the solution in the brine tank is generally higher than the conductivity of the system feed solution thus the uf permeate is the system feed solution while the brine in the brine tank is the feed to the membrane module to maintain a constant conductivity in the brine tank while brine was periodically discharged qb d from the brine tank using the brine discharge pump uf permeate was added back to the brine tank to maintain a constant volume and lower the brine conductivity in the brine tank the incoming uf permeate qf therefore exits this system either through distillate production qd or brine discharge qb d as shown in the mass balance in eq 1 the conductivity of the brine in the brine tank relative to the uf permeate determines the system recovery yield y which is the ratio of distillate production rate to the rate of addition of the uf permeate feed solution shown in eq 2 1 q f q d q b d 2 y q d q f 2 2 membrane properties a symmetric polyethylene pe membrane with a nominal pore diameter of 0 3 μm thickness of 96 μm and porosity of 85 as reported by aquastill was utilized in the study the surface charge of the membrane was analyzed by determining the zeta potential with an anton paar surpass 3 analyzer anton paar graz austria zeta potential of the membrane was analyzed in deionized water by adding kcl to achieve a conductivity of 15 ms m and adjusting the ph to 8 3 to match the ph of the brine 2 3 virus rejection experiments pilot scale virus rejection experiments were conducted using ms2 atcc 15 597 b1 and phix174 atcc 13 706 b1 as surrogates for enteric pathogenic viruses permeate from a pilot scale uf system treating tertiary effluent from a municipal water reclamation facility co located with the water and energy sustainable technology center tucson usa was used as the feed solution further details on the uf permeate water quality can be found in a previous publication alhussaini 2023 the agmd system was operated at approximately 75 water recovery with a resulting 3 400 μs cm brine conductivity and approximately 14 mg l of dissolved organic carbon doc concentration the typical composition of the brine is shown in table 1 ms2 and phix174 were inoculated into the brine tank and into a brine control volume 1 l within an erlenmeyer flask held at room temperature the control volume was then mixed on a stir plate at slow speed and the md system was recirculated at room temperature to ensure uniform concentration of the viruses in the brine the condenser temperature was decreased to 10 c and the distillate brine and brine control samples were collected when the distillate pump switched on after 30 min the evaporator was then gradually heated to 40 c and the chiller was set to 20 c for 1 5 h at 50 mbar air gap vacuum the air gap vacuum was then increased to 500 mbar and the system was operated at 40 20 c for 1 5 h samples were collected from the distillate brine and brine control volume every 30 min after 1 5 h the evaporator inlet temperature was increased to 70 c and operated for 3 h to study the rate of virus inactivation at high temperatures in the pilot scale agmd system the system reached 70 c within one hour after which samples were collected from the distillate brine and brine control volume every 1 5 h 2 4 virus membrane affinity analysis bench top tests were conducted to qualitatively compare the adsorption of ms2 and phix174 to the pe membrane used in the pilot scale module and the polytetrafluoroethylene ptfe membranes used in a previous bench scale md experiment hardikar et al 2021 the viruses were co spiked at a target concentration of 6 log10 pfu ml plaque forming unit into a bulk volume of brine 3400 μs cm at room temperature the solution was then mixed on an orbital rotator for 15 min and 25 ml aliquots of the spiked brine were pipetted into glass petri dishes that were designated as brine control volume no filter brine with ptfe or brine with pe membrane coupons measuring 6 5 cm in diameter were then placed in contact with the designated spiked brine virus suspensions for 3 h and rotated slowly on an orbital rotator set to low speed 50 rpm after 3 h spiked brine samples were collected from each of the glass petri dishes to assay for virus infectivity the membrane coupons were treated to extract adsorbed viruses using the method described by katayama et al katayama et al 2002 briefly the membranes were rinsed with 200 ml of 0 5 mm h2so4 to remove salts and weakly attached viruses on the surface of the membrane the membrane coupon was then placed into a conical tube with 10 ml of 1 mm naoh and vortexed to elute the viruses adsorbed to membrane the eluate was then added to a conical tube containing 50 μl of 100 mm h2so4 and 100 μl of 100x tris edta buffer and the neutralized filtrate was assayed to determine the levels of infectious viruses adsorbed to the membrane 2 5 sample analysis concentration of the cations was measured using an inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry agilent 7800x series agilent santa clara ca in helium collision gas mode samples were filtered and acidified with a 2 solution of hno3 trace metal grade fisher scientific fair lawn nj concentration of anions was measured using ion chromatography mass spectrometry with a dionex ion chromatography ics 5000 dionex ion pac 2 250 mm as 11 microbore analytical column using 22 mm of potassium hydroxide as eluent 0 35 ml min flow rate and 240 μl injection volume size exclusion chromatography sec was used to determine the average molecular weight amw of organic matter dissolved in samples and was measured using an agilent 1260 ii high performance liquid chromatography hplc agilent santa clara ca followed by a sievers m9 portable total organic carbon analyzer suez water technologies and solutions trevose pa the sec data was also used to calculate the doc prior to virus inoculation the free chlorine concentration in the brine and distillate tanks were measured using the hach pocket colorimeter ii and dpd free chlorine powder pillows with 10 ml sample volume to ensure the concentration was below 0 02 mg l the procedure for virus quantification can be found in a previous bench scale study with the same viruses hardikar et al 2021 the rejection and log10 rejection of cations anions doc and the two bacteriophages were calculated using 3 rejection 1 c d c b 100 4 lo g 10 rejection 1 rejection 100 where cd and cb is the concentration of the contaminant in the distillate and brine respectively it is worth noting that the rejection and log10 rejection calculated with eqs 3 and 4 is the membrane rejection based on the specific recovery condition and not the system rejection which is a function of recovery and can be calculated by substituting cb with the feed solution cf concentration in general system rejection decreases as recovery increases 3 results and discussion 3 1 pilot scale virus and contaminant rejection experiments the rejection of viruses ms2 and phix174 conductivity cations anions and doc were measured in the pilot scale agmd system at an air gap vacuum pressure of 500 mbar fig 3 in general cations anions organics and both viruses were detected in the distillate and their respective concentrations in the distillate varied as a function of their concentration in the brine as shown in fig 3 the similarity in rejection of inorganic and organic contaminants suggests that their transport across the membrane was not influenced by charge or hydrophobic hydrophobic interaction with the membrane respectively and was caused by pore flow virus rejections were observed to be higher than the rejection of conductivity and other contaminants the larger size of ms2 and phix174 20 30 nm in comparison to inorganic and organic contaminants could have resulted in increased mass transfer resistance or diffusion resistance to virus transport through the pore and can explain the higher rejection of viruses hardikar et al 2021 soussan et al 2011 kuzmanovic et al 2003 phix174 showed large variation between experiments which may have been a result of aggregation of viruses in the brine that would increase mass transport resistance and rejection notably the bench scale study reported complete rejection of ms2 and a higher rejection of na than what was measured in this study hardikar et al 2021 increased convective pore flow in the pilot scale system thus resulted in a lower virus and na rejection the complete rejection of ms2 but not phix174 in the previous bench scale study suggests differences in membrane virus interactions hardikar et al 2021 the affinity of both viruses to the ptfe used in the bench scale study and pe membranes used in the current pilot scale module was compared in bench top virus membrane affinity tests based on the virus count pfu extracted from the membrane surface as shown in fig 4 in general both viruses had a lower affinity to the ptfe membrane than the pe membrane ptfe and pe are both hydrophobic membranes with a negatively charged surface at ph 8 3 and zeta potentials of 57 mv and 37 mv respectively based on the zeta potentials the pe membrane has a lower surface charge because of charge screening in the presence of brine the membranes zeta potential further reduces to 19 mv and 13 mv for the ptfe and pe membranes respectively additionally ms2 and phix174 have an isoelectric point at ph 3 5 and ph 6 6 respectively making both viruses negatively charged at the brine ph of 8 3 elhadidy et al 2013 michen and graule 2010 the negative charge of both the ptfe membrane and the test viruses would result in greater levels of electrostatic repulsion and would therefore explain why both viruses demonstrated lesser affinity to the ptfe membrane also ms2 generally had a higher affinity to both membranes compared to phix174 ms2 is reported to be more hydrophobic than phix174 huang et al 2012 therefore in the presence of electrostatic repulsion stronger hydrophobic hydrophobic interactions between ms2 and the membranes could have resulted in higher affinity of ms2 to both membranes van voorthuizen et al 2001 the complete rejection of ms2 and not phix174 in the previous bench scale study hardikar et al 2021 can be explained by the results of the bench top tests that indicate that ms2 has a higher affinity to the ptfe membrane than phix174 as in a bench scale dcmd configuration the transmembrane hydraulic pressure difference is generally lower or even negligible because of circulating fluid on both sides of the membrane and transport of viruses across the membrane is mainly controlled by diffusion thus with insufficient transmembrane hydraulic pressure to overcome the affinity of ms2 to the membrane ms2 transport was inhibited while phix174 was diffused across the pore flow path guillen burrieza et al 2016 in pilot scale systems a larger membrane area increases the probability of pore flow and elevates the hydraulic pressure in the evaporator channel the greater transmembrane hydraulic pressure difference in pilot scale systems can overcome interactive forces between the virus and the membrane and thus the rate of virus transport is a function of the mass transport resistance through the pore only 3 2 thermal destruction of virus in pilot scale agmd previous studies have demonstrated that high temperatures including those at which md is operated can cause inactivation of traditional pathogen surrogates hardikar et al 2021 bertrand et al 2012 feng et al 2003 a previous bench top study using ro concentrate reported that the concentration of ms2 and phix174 dropped by more 6 log10 in less than 2 h and 4 h respectively at 65 c hardikar et al 2021 following the results of the bench scale study the pilot scale was operated at an evaporator inlet temperature of 70 c in duplicate experiments to quantify virus reduction at the high operating temperatures employed in md thermal inactivation of ms2 and phix174 over time for duplicate experiments test 1 and test 2 in the pilot scale system are shown in fig 5 the initial values at 0 h correspond to the last measured concentration in the rejection experiments conducted at the evaporator inlet temperature of 40 c after which the temperature was increased to 70 c at 1 5 h the concentration of both viruses had reduced by more than 3 log10 and continued to decrease for the duration of the experiment in test 2 when operating at 70 c 4 h were sufficient to decrease the virus concentrations in the brine to levels below the detection limit 1 pfu per 100 ml however in test 1 both viruses were detected in the brine tank even after 4 5 h the difference in the time required for reduction of viruses between test 1 and test 2 may be because of the difference in initial concentration in the brine between the experiments notably while the initial concentration of ms2 and phix174 in the distillate tank also varied between experiments viruses were also detected in the distillate in the following 4 5 h although the pilot scale system was operated at a temperature greater than 65 c the time required for reduction of ms2 and phix174 to below the detection limit was greater than the time measured in the previous bench top tests hardikar et al 2021 this is because in pilot scale systems the brine is at a high temperature only for a fraction of the residence time in the hot side heat exchanger and the evaporator channel heat utilization in the evaporator channel reduces the brine temperature to below 65 c as it returns to the brine tank thus the operating time required to inactivate all the viruses in the brine is longer than the bench top test measurements previously reported the log10 of normalized virus concentration survival ratio in the brine for ms2 and phix174 in duplicate experiments once the evaporator inlet temperature reached 70 c is shown in fig 6 in general the log10 of the survival ratio of ms2 and phix174 in both experiments was similar and decreased as a linear function of time the inactivation rate of both viruses follows pseudo first order hiatt 1964 5 log 10 n n 0 2 303 kt where n0 is the initial virus concentration n is the virus concentration at time t and k is a rate constant of inactivation which a function of the type of virus and temperature in general in a continuous operation of a pilot scale md system viruses continue to enter the md system through the feed stream and exit the system via brine discharge and pore flow jl through pore defects to the distillate to ensure that virus concentration in the brine tank remains negligible the total residence time of the brine in the pilot scale system must be greater than the time required for inactivation of viruses the residence time

rate based on the measured rejection of non volatile solutes the rate of pore flow is significantly smaller than the rate of brine discharge and thus the residence time is mainly a function of the volume of the brine tank and the recovery rate a large brine tank volume and high recovery increases the residence time of the viruses in the md system and ensures sufficient time for thermal inactivation thus while md can potentially reject and remove viruses in the brine appropriate selection of operating temperature air gap vacuum transmembrane hydraulic pressure difference and production rate for an agmd system must be considered to ensure complete thermal inactivation and rejection of viruses 4 conclusion in this study the rejection of ms2 and phix174 and their respective rate of inactivation at a high evaporator temperature of 70 c was quantified in a pilot scale agmd system during the rejection experiments both viruses were detected in the distillate and virus rejection was observed to be lower than that reported in a previous bench scale study the results in this study indicate that an increase in membrane area increases the contribution of convective pore flow and thus reduces virus rejection in md therefore selection of operating parameters than minimizes hydraulic pressure difference in pilot scale md is important to minimize convective pore flow the virus inactivation rate of ms2 and phix174 was observed to be lower than bench top results because of the limited residence time at higher temperature the rate of inactivation of viruses in the pilot scale system at 70 c was found to follow pseudo first order kinetics brine in pilot scale agmd cycles between low and high temperatures and hence the rate of inactivation of viruses is lower than that observed in constant temperature bench top virus inactivation experiments for an accurate prediction of virus inactivation rate the temperature profile in the pilot scale md module must be

14713,membrane distillation md is a thermally driven process that can treat high concentration streams and provide a dual barrier for rejection and reduction of pathogens thus md has potential applications in treating concentrated wastewater brines for enhancing water recovery and potable water reuse in bench scale studies it was demonstrated that md can provide high rejection of ms2 and phix174 bacteriophage viruses and when operating at temperatures greater than 55 c can reduce virus levels in the concentrate however bench scale md results cannot directly be used to predict pilot scale contaminant rejection and removal of viruses because of the lower water flux and higher transmembrane hydraulic pressure difference in pilot scale systems thus far virus rejection and removal have not been quantified in pilot scale md systems in this work the rejection of ms2 and phix174 at low 40 c and high 70 c inlet temperatures is quantified in a pilot scale air gap md system using tertiary treated wastewater both viruses were detected in the distillate which suggests the presence of pore flow the virus rejection at a hot inlet temperature of 40 c for ms2 and phix174 were 1 6 log10 and 3 1 log10 respectively at 70 c virus concentrations in the brine decreased and were below the detection limit 1 pfu per 100 ml after 4 5 h however viruses were also detected in the distillate in that duration results demonstrate that virus rejection is lower in pilot scale experiments because of increased pore flow that is not captured in bench scale experiments graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords membrane distillation pilot scale virus rejection potable water reuse reverse osmosis concentrate concentrate management data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction membrane distillation md is a thermally driven process in which a microporous hydrophobic membrane is the separating interface between a heated impaired feed stream and a chilled product stream the resulting temperature difference across the membrane creates a vapor pressure difference that acts as the driving force for water vapor transport across the membrane from the impaired feed stream brine to a pure distillate stream md has been demonstrated as a potential process to treat municipal wastewater and other unconventional water sources and enhance water recovery deshmukh et al 2018 naidu et al 2017 cath et al 2005 hickenbottom and cath 2014 morrow et al 2018 balis et al 2022 glover et al 2022 presson et al 2023 because vapor pressure is a weak function of salinity and the driving force in md is proportional to the transmembrane vapor pressure difference md can treat high concentration streams in the presence of a sufficiently large temperature difference hardikar et al 2020 md can also achieve high rejection of non volatile contaminants because only the vapor phase permeates through the membrane md therefore can potentially be used in water reuse to recover water with high purity additionally md can aid in reducing the concentration of pathogens in the concentrate because it is operated at elevated temperatures 40 80 c hardikar et al 2021 seo et al 2012 bertrand et al 2012 a recent study using a bench scale system demonstrated that md provides a dual barrier for virus removal and rejection when treating ro concentrate from reclaimed wastewater hardikar et al 2021 the study reported 6 log10 rejection of ms2 and phix174 bacteriophages and a rapid decrease in virus concentration in the feed stream at 65 c because of virus inactivation at elevated temperatures while the study reported a high rejection of both viruses phix174 was detected in the distillate which suggests the presence of pore flow pore flow in md occurs because of loss in pore hydrophobicity or pore wetting which enables the liquid phase to permeate from the feed stream to the distillate side pore wetting may occur if the maximum liquid entry pressure of the pore is exceeded by either the presence of large pores that are wetted at low operating pressure and or by salt precipitation within the pore chamani et al 2021 rezaei et al 2018 chang et al 2021 guillen burrieza et al 2016 horseman et al 2021 straub and elimelech 2017 pore flow is proportional to the transmembrane hydraulic pressure difference across the membrane which is a function of the system size therefore results from bench scale studies may not be directly translatable to pilot scale because of differences in membrane size temperature profile and hydraulic pressure between the two systems hardikar et al 2020 hardikar et al 2023 bench scale md systems fig 1 a are beneficial for the rapid testing of new membranes and generally allow for the assessment of small membrane coupons order of cm2 bush et al 2016 mcgaughey et al 2017 tang et al 2022 tan et al 2022 hu et al 2022 gustafson et al 2016 the direct contact membrane distillation dcmd configuration is most commonly used for bench scale studies in which both the feed and distillate streams are in direct contact with either side of the membrane hardikar et al 2022 couto et al 2019 because of a small membrane area and short flow channel the temperature in the channel remains almost constant along the direction of flow and the temperature difference across the membrane is uniform as shown in fig 1a the short flow channel also results in a small less than 50 mbar transmembrane hydraulic pressure difference across the membrane when operated with similar flow rates on either side of the membrane a lower transmembrane hydraulic pressure difference would result in reduced transport of non volatile contaminants through convective pore flow pilot scale md systems fig 1b are designed to be energy efficient by maximizing heat recovery during operation andrés mañas et al 2020 swaminathan et al 2018 a commonly used pilot scale configuration for its energy efficiency and simplicity is air gap md agmd zaragoza et al 2018 in the agmd configuration the evaporator and condenser channels are separated by an air gap to minimize conductive heat loss schwantes et al 2018 bindels et al 2018 in a pilot scale agmd configuration the temperature in the evaporator channel drops in the direction of flow and the evaporator channel loses heat in the form of latent heat of evaporation water vapor production and conductive heat losses the heat lost by the evaporator channel is recovered and used to preheat the condenser stream thus minimizing the thermal input required for operating the system as a result the transmembrane temperature difference and the water vapor flux are lower in pilot scale systems compared to bench scale systems swaminathan et al 2016 additionally the transmembrane hydraulic pressure difference is higher in pilot scale systems because of the longer flow channel which results in greater hydraulic pressure within the evaporator channel compared to bench scale configurations as convective pore flow is proportional to the hydraulic pressure difference atangana 2018 the transport of non volatile contaminants through convective pore flow is elevated relative to bench scale systems a lower water flux and higher transmembrane hydraulic pressure convective pore flow could both lead to an increase in the concentration of non volatile contaminants in the distillate and reduced contaminant and pathogen rejection few pilot scale studies have reported transport of contaminants across the membrane with an increase in the pressure difference across the membrane andrés mañas et al 2020 ruiz aguirre et al 2019 hardikar et al 2020 pilot scale md studies to date have mainly explored the biocidal effects of membrane surface modification for the removal of pathogens in water i gupta et al 2021 i gupta et al 2021 i gupta et al 2021 however virus rejection and removal in a pilot scale agmd has thus far not been reported the objective of this study is to quantify the virus rejection and removal in a pilot scale agmd configuration non enveloped ms2 and phix174 bacteriophages were used as surrogate pathogens and tertiary treated wastewater was used as the brine to replicate conditions used in a previous bench scale study and evaluate rejection of ions and organics hardikar et al 2021 membrane rejection of viruses was first measured at a low brine temperature of 40 c to ensure constant virus concentration in the brine after which the temperature was increased to 70 c to determine the rate of reduction in virus concentration because of inactivation at higher temperatures in the pilot scale system in comparison to bench top experiments 2 materials and methods 2 1 pilot scale air gap membrane distillation system pilot scale experiments were performed using a vacuum assisted agmd system aquastill sittard the netherlands a schematic of the agmd system is illustrated in fig 2 the membrane module area was 25 92 m2 with 12 hot and cold brine channels and a channel length of 2 7 m the brine from the brine tank was first chilled recirculated through the condenser channel and then heated before entering the evaporator channel and returning to the brine tank water vapor that permeated through the membrane was condensed on the condenser plate in the air gap and collected in the distillate tank the air gap pressure was maintained at 500 mbar vacuum using a venturi brine and distillate samples were collected for subsequent analysis when the distillate was discharged from its tank in 3 liter increments permeate from a pilot scale ultrafiltration uf system was used as the feed solution to the agmd system and delivered to the constant volume brine tank because of the low single pass recovery rate approximately 3 in the present study md systems are generally designed to operate in recirculation mode batch or pseudo steady state semi batch modes hence the conductivity of the solution in the brine tank is generally higher than the conductivity of the system feed solution thus the uf permeate is the system feed solution while the brine in the brine tank is the feed to the membrane module to maintain a constant conductivity in the brine tank while brine was periodically discharged qb d from the brine tank using the brine discharge pump uf permeate was added back to the brine tank to maintain a constant volume and lower the brine conductivity in the brine tank the incoming uf permeate qf therefore exits this system either through distillate production qd or brine discharge qb d as shown in the mass balance in eq 1 the conductivity of the brine in the brine tank relative to the uf permeate determines the system recovery yield y which is the ratio of distillate production rate to the rate of addition of the uf permeate feed solution shown in eq 2 1 q f q d q b d 2 y q d q f 2 2 membrane properties a symmetric polyethylene pe membrane with a nominal pore diameter of 0 3 μm thickness of 96 μm and porosity of 85 as reported by aquastill was utilized in the study the surface charge of the membrane was analyzed by determining the zeta potential with an anton paar surpass 3 analyzer anton paar graz austria zeta potential of the membrane was analyzed in deionized water by adding kcl to achieve a conductivity of 15 ms m and adjusting the ph to 8 3 to match the ph of the brine 2 3 virus rejection experiments pilot scale virus rejection experiments were conducted using ms2 atcc 15 597 b1 and phix174 atcc 13 706 b1 as surrogates for enteric pathogenic viruses permeate from a pilot scale uf system treating tertiary effluent from a municipal water reclamation facility co located with the water and energy sustainable technology center tucson usa was used as the feed solution further details on the uf permeate water quality can be found in a previous publication alhussaini 2023 the agmd system was operated at approximately 75 water recovery with a resulting 3 400 μs cm brine conductivity and approximately 14 mg l of dissolved organic carbon doc concentration the typical composition of the brine is shown in table 1 ms2 and phix174 were inoculated into the brine tank and into a brine control volume 1 l within an erlenmeyer flask held at room temperature the control volume was then mixed on a stir plate at slow speed and the md system was recirculated at room temperature to ensure uniform concentration of the viruses in the brine the condenser temperature was decreased to 10 c and the distillate brine and brine control samples were collected when the distillate pump switched on after 30 min the evaporator was then gradually heated to 40 c and the chiller was set to 20 c for 1 5 h at 50 mbar air gap vacuum the air gap vacuum was then increased to 500 mbar and the system was operated at 40 20 c for 1 5 h samples were collected from the distillate brine and brine control volume every 30 min after 1 5 h the evaporator inlet temperature was increased to 70 c and operated for 3 h to study the rate of virus inactivation at high temperatures in the pilot scale agmd system the system reached 70 c within one hour after which samples were collected from the distillate brine and brine control volume every 1 5 h 2 4 virus membrane affinity analysis bench top tests were conducted to qualitatively compare the adsorption of ms2 and phix174 to the pe membrane used in the pilot scale module and the polytetrafluoroethylene ptfe membranes used in a previous bench scale md experiment hardikar et al 2021 the viruses were co spiked at a target concentration of 6 log10 pfu ml plaque forming unit into a bulk volume of brine 3400 μs cm at room temperature the solution was then mixed on an orbital rotator for 15 min and 25 ml aliquots of the spiked brine were pipetted into glass petri dishes that were designated as brine control volume no filter brine with ptfe or brine with pe membrane coupons measuring 6 5 cm in diameter were then placed in contact with the designated spiked brine virus suspensions for 3 h and rotated slowly on an orbital rotator set to low speed 50 rpm after 3 h spiked brine samples were collected from each of the glass petri dishes to assay for virus infectivity the membrane coupons were treated to extract adsorbed viruses using the method described by katayama et al katayama et al 2002 briefly the membranes were rinsed with 200 ml of 0 5 mm h2so4 to remove salts and weakly attached viruses on the surface of the membrane the membrane coupon was then placed into a conical tube with 10 ml of 1 mm naoh and vortexed to elute the viruses adsorbed to membrane the eluate was then added to a conical tube containing 50 μl of 100 mm h2so4 and 100 μl of 100x tris edta buffer and the neutralized filtrate was assayed to determine the levels of infectious viruses adsorbed to the membrane 2 5 sample analysis concentration of the cations was measured using an inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry agilent 7800x series agilent santa clara ca in helium collision gas mode samples were filtered and acidified with a 2 solution of hno3 trace metal grade fisher scientific fair

technologies and solutions trevose pa the sec data was also used to calculate the doc prior to virus inoculation the free chlorine concentration in the brine and distillate tanks were measured using the hach pocket colorimeter ii and dpd free chlorine powder pillows with 10 ml sample volume to ensure the concentration was below 0 02 mg l the procedure for virus quantification can be found in a previous bench scale study with the same viruses hardikar et al 2021 the rejection and log10 rejection of cations anions doc and the two bacteriophages were calculated using 3 rejection 1 c d c b 100 4 lo g 10 rejection 1 rejection 100 where cd and cb is the concentration of the contaminant in the distillate and brine respectively it is worth noting that the rejection and log10 rejection calculated with eqs 3 and 4 is the membrane rejection based on the specific recovery condition and not the system rejection which is a function of recovery and can be calculated by substituting cb with the feed solution cf concentration in general system rejection decreases as recovery increases 3 results and discussion 3 1 pilot scale virus and contaminant rejection experiments the rejection of viruses ms2 and phix174 conductivity cations anions and doc were measured in the pilot scale agmd system at an air gap vacuum pressure of 500 mbar fig 3 in general cations anions organics and both viruses were detected in the distillate and their respective concentrations in the distillate varied as a function of their concentration in the brine as shown in fig 3 the similarity in rejection of inorganic and organic contaminants suggests that their transport across the membrane was not influenced by charge or hydrophobic hydrophobic interaction with the membrane respectively and was caused by pore flow virus rejections were observed to be higher than the rejection of conductivity and other contaminants the larger size of ms2 and phix174 20 30 nm in comparison to inorganic and organic contaminants could have resulted in increased mass transfer resistance or diffusion resistance to virus transport through the pore and can explain the higher rejection of viruses hardikar et al 2021 soussan et al 2011 kuzmanovic et al 2003 phix174 showed large variation between experiments which may have been a result of aggregation of viruses in the brine that would increase mass transport resistance and rejection notably the bench scale study reported complete rejection of ms2 and a higher rejection of na than what was measured in this study hardikar et al 2021 increased convective pore flow in the pilot scale system thus resulted in a lower virus and na rejection the complete rejection of ms2 but not phix174 in the previous bench scale study suggests differences in membrane virus interactions hardikar et al 2021 the affinity of both viruses to the ptfe used in the bench scale study and pe membranes used in the current pilot scale module was compared in bench top virus membrane affinity tests based on the virus count pfu extracted from the membrane surface as shown in fig 4 in general both viruses had a lower affinity to the ptfe membrane than the pe membrane ptfe and pe are both hydrophobic membranes with a negatively charged surface at ph 8 3 and zeta potentials of 57 mv and 37 mv respectively based on the zeta potentials the pe membrane has a lower surface charge because of charge screening in the presence of brine the membranes zeta potential further reduces to 19 mv and 13 mv for the ptfe and pe membranes respectively additionally ms2 and phix174 have an isoelectric point at ph 3 5 and ph 6 6 respectively making both viruses negatively charged at the brine ph of 8 3 elhadidy et al 2013 michen and graule 2010 the negative charge of both the ptfe membrane and the test viruses would result in greater levels of electrostatic repulsion and would therefore explain why both viruses demonstrated lesser affinity to the ptfe membrane also ms2 generally had a higher affinity to both membranes compared to phix174 ms2 is reported to be more hydrophobic than phix174 huang et al 2012 therefore in the presence of electrostatic repulsion stronger hydrophobic hydrophobic interactions between ms2 and the membranes could have resulted in higher affinity of ms2 to both membranes van voorthuizen et al 2001 the complete rejection of ms2 and not phix174 in the previous bench scale study hardikar et al 2021 can be explained by the results of the bench top tests that indicate that ms2 has a higher affinity to the ptfe membrane than phix174 as in a bench scale dcmd configuration the transmembrane hydraulic pressure difference is generally lower or even negligible because of circulating fluid on both sides of the membrane and transport of

14714,developing strategic plans for the remediation and mitigation of pre and polyfluoroalkyl substances pfas in soil groundwater and surface water requires an understanding of the fate and transport of these chemicals on a regional scale to fill this knowledge gap we developed a distributed hydrogeochemical model and applied it to a large scale watershed with various point and non point sources of a long chain highly persistent pfas compound known as perfluorooctane sulfonic acid pfos the results showed that the developed model could reproduce the spatiotemporal concentration of pfos across a large and diverse watershed herein our first objective was to quantify the pfos transport from the unsaturated zone to the groundwater and surface water via leaching surface runoff lateral flow and sediment transport the second objective was to identify factors influencing pfos release from confirmed and suspected pfas sites and urban and agricultural areas the modeling results show that surface runoff played a significant role in pfos transport with urban areas and industrial sites being major contributors in addition sediment transport was found to be a notable pathway for pfos release particularly from sites with biosolids application further analysis revealed the relative importance of topography soil water retention and water solid adsorption factors in determining pfos transport

contaminant source for gw and sw for decades sunderland et al 2019 as such pfas fate and transport in the unsaturated zone strongly depend on several factors such as local hydrogeological processes climate conditions pfas chain length functional groups and physiochemical properties of the subsurface materials for instance the leaching of perfluorooctane sulfonic acid pfos a long chain pfas from the vadose zone to the gw is relatively slow due to the strong adsorption of pfos at the air water and water solid interfaces høisæter et al 2019 stahl et al 2013 however climate conditions and soils physiochemical properties alter the magnitude of pfos leaching guo et al 2020 liu et al 2020 therefore remediation and cleanup projects need to consider numerous environmental factors as well as the physiochemical properties of targeted pfas for implementing successful mitigation strategies as the need to identify and remediate soils and aquifers contaminated by pfas chemicals grew several studies investigated different aspects of pfas fate and transport sima and jaffé 2021 however thus far many modeling studies have been conducted for field scale and isolated porous media under controlled environmental conditions e g guo et al 2020 silva et al 2020 the previous studies have shortcomings in evaluating pfas transport via runoff and sediment from surficial sources to sw brusseau et al 2019 guo et al 2020 silva et al 2020 or oversimplified pfas fate mechanisms such as the adsorption at the air water interface shin et al 2011 in addition pfas pollution in the environment is not only limited to point source contributors e g contaminated sites or the effluents of wwtps but also non point sources such as biosolids application in agricultural lands add to the difficulty of predicting the source of contamination xiao et al 2012 naidu et al 2020 therefore large scale modeling studies must include different soil sw and gw pathways to identify and prioritize remediation strategies beyond field scale investigation raschke 2022 tokranov et al 2021a this research aims to contribute to understanding pfas fate and transport in large scale heterogeneous watersheds where point and non point sources complicate identifying pfas origins and quantifying pfas loads to waterways to fill the knowledge gap we developed a distributed physically based hydrogeochemical model this model simulates pfas fate and transport in the surface soil unsaturated zone rivers and lakes here we selected the pfos compound as it is one of the most persistent with historical usage and release to the environment once we validated the performance of the model for reproducing the spatiotemporal pfos concentrations in streams across the watershed we examined the following objectives 1 quantification of pfos mass fluxes transported by surface runoff lateral flow and sediment as well as pfas leaching to the gw 2 identification of the primary factors influencing pfos fate and transport from contaminated sources urban areas and agricultural fields that can be used for strategic monitoring and remediation planning at large scale the novelty of this work includes two main aspects 1 the development of the first distributed watershed scale pfas model 2 the characterization of the locations where the pfos transport with surface runoff sediment transport and leaching is at the maximum level 2 methodology in this section we described the theories and tools we implemented for the simulation of pfos fate and transport in the surface soil unsaturated zone rivers and lakes and subsequently introduced the case study model specifications and calibration 2 1 pfas fate and transport in the surface soil and the unsaturated zone the unsaturated zone which is the focus of this study encompasses the soil moisture zone that extends from the surface soil or topsoil down to the bottom of the root zone national research council 2004 the unsaturated zone is under atmospheric pressure and pore spaces are not filled here we assumed that the pfas fate and transport in the unsaturated zone like other families of synthetic organic chemicals can be formulated by an advection dispersion equation as with prior studies we assumed that the adsorption at the air water and water solid interfaces are the most significant pfas fate mechanisms in the unsaturated zone sima and jaffé 2021 following the assumptions we considered the water movement in the horizontal surface runoff lateral flow and vertical infiltration and leaching directions we also accounted for sediment transport from soil erosion considering these factors we formulated the pfas fate and transport in the unsaturated zone by eq 1 in addition we considered a distributed and heterogenous soil profile for the unsaturated zone with several layers different land use and topography the pfas transport with surface runoff and soil erosion occurs in the first soil layer the top 10 mm layer hereafter referred to as surface soil while the lateral flow in the underlying layers with varying depths therefore water and pfas that percolates out of the root zone are considered leaching in this study also the unsaturated zone is assumed to be a dynamic system with variable water content and pfas concentration over time and space 1 c t ρ b c s t c a w t v q c z v l c z v p c h y s e d c s z 0 where c m l3 is the concentration of pfas in solution aqueous concentration cs m m is the solid phase adsorbed concentration of pfas ρb m l3 is the bulk density of the soil layer caw m l3 is the concentration of pfas at the air water interface the υq l t is the water velocity in surface runoff the first soil layer υl l t is the water velocity with the lateral flow soil layers below the first one υp l t is the water velocity with percolation and ysed m l2 t is sediment yield via erosion processes pfas adsorption at the water solid interface prior experimental studies showed that the non linear freundlich isotherm eq 2 could reasonably estimate the solid equilibrium phase concentration cs in porous media for a wide range of concentrations and different types of pfas and soil materials li et al 2019 therefore we adopted the freundlich isotherm for simulating pfas adsorption at the water solid interface also we disregarded the kinetic form of adsorption because pfas chemicals can reach the equilibrium concentration within 24 48 h li et al 2019 which is consistent with the one day time step simulation in our hydrogeological model 2 c s k f c n where kf m m m l3 n is the freundlich distribution coefficient and n dimensionless is the freundlich exponent pfas adsorption at the air water interface as surfactants pfas chemicals strongly tend to adsorb at the air water interface brusseau and guo 2022 as presented by eq 3 the air water concentration caw for a pfas compound can be estimated by approximating the surface concentration and the air water interfacial area aaw l2 l3 of the porous media the former can be approximated by the non linear langmuir isotherm eq 4 which is the most common approach applied for surfactants chang and franses 1995 including pfas compounds silva et al 2021 the aaw on the other hand depends on saturation porosity soil grain size and other soil texture properties that define the porewater volume in the porous media lyu et al 2018 we approximate the aaw using soil physical properties such as water content saturation capacity and geometric surface area gsa as introduced by silva et al 2022 eq 5 3 4 5 a aw gsa 1 s sw s sa 6 1 θ d 50 1 s sw s sa where θ l3 l3 is the soil porosity d50 l is the soil median particle diameter ssw m is the maximum saturation capacity of the soil ssa m is the soil water content m l2 is the maximum surface concentration of the chemical and kl l2 m is the concentration independent langmuir coefficient note that the kl and can be estimated by measuring the surface tension and fitting the langmuir szyszkowski equation for different pfas e g costanza et al 2019 2 2 pfas fate and transport in rivers and lakes once the sorbed and dissolved pfas loads were routed from the unsaturated zone to rivers by surface runoff sediment transport and lateral flow the model simulates pfas fate and transport in the water column and sediment layer in rivers and lakes herein we adopted the lake and in stream simulation approach from chapra 1997 this approach partitions pfas into sorbed and dissolved forms in the water column with eq 6 and in the sediment layer with eq 7 6 f d w 1 1 k d c s e d 1 f p w 7 f d s e d 1 ø 1 ø ρ s k d 1 f p where kd l3 m is the pfas partition coefficient fp w and fd w are the fractions of the sorbed and solution phases of pfas in the water column respectively ø l3 l3 is the sediment porosity ρs m l3 is the bulk density of the sediment layer fp sed and fd sed are the fractions of the sorbed and solution phases of pfas in the sediment layer next we simulated the pfas mass balance in the sediment layer and water column assuming that the bulk of the gas and liquid phases in the rivers and lakes are well mixed and homogeneous chapra 1997 then according to chapra 1997 for the water column and sediment layer we simulated the processes of deposition to the sediment layer resuspension from the sediment layer to the water column and diffusion between the water column and sediment layer by two mass balances eqs 8 and 9 also unlike other families of synthetic organic chemicals pfos volatilization and degradation are negligible russell et al 2008 therefore we ignored these processes for the in stream simulation 8 δ δ w r t δ w r t i n δ w r t o u t v r δ s e d f p w r t v s δ w r t v d f d s e d δ s e d f d w r t δ w r t t h 9 δ δ s e d δ s e d v b δ s e d

and transport in an integrated sw gw model we implemented the pfas fate and transport theories sections 2 1 and 2 2 in the smr w model rafiei et al 2022a the latest version of the integrated swat modflow rt3d model bailey et al 2016 the smr w model simulates sw hydrology with swat neitsch et al 2011 gw hydro geochemistry with modflow rt3d and the interactions of these two systems at the land river and lake interfaces through a linking module rafiei et al 2022a bailey et al 2016 we added and modified more than seventy subroutines within the swat model source code and incorporated more than one hundred fifty global and local variables for the pfas fate and transport simulation these modules and subroutines perform the following tasks in the integrated model 1 read the model inputs for the targeted pfas in soil including the size number and concentration level of the contaminated sites background pfas in different land use and the pfas related parameters 2 add daily pfas loads from wwtps to streams 3 apply biosolids application in selected croplands 4 computes the fate and transport of pfas in soil layers 5 route the pfas loads by surface runoff sediment transport and lateral flow to the hydrograph storage network of the model and 6 simulate pfas fate and transport in lakes and streams by considering pfas deposition resuspension diffusion and burial processes in water and sediment layer fig 1 shows a conceptual model diagram for simulating pfas fate and transport in our model the model s source code a detailed description of the pfas fate and transport implementation in the smr w model for developers and instructions for executing the model for end users are provided in the following repository https github com vahidr32 pfas fate and transport model git 2 4 case study huron river watershed the huron river watershed is in southeast michigan usa fig 2 the total area of the watershed is 2292 km2 and contains nearly 738 km of river network that eventually drains into lake erie over 31 7 of the watershed is urbanized 13 7 is cropland and 9 7 is pasture forests cover 21 8 and wetlands and glacial lakes cover 23 1 pfos has been detected in 79 of sw and stormwater samples from the watershed with concentrations ranging from below the detection limit to 5600 ng l egle 2019 according to the usepa pfas analytical tool dataset usepa 2021 more than 148 facilities that may handle pfas are within the watershed these facilities are from a variety of industries including but not limited to 28 facilities related to chemical manufacturing 20 metal machinery manufacturing 19 metal coating 18 waste management 17 plastics and resins eight paints and coatings seven cleaning product manufacturing four petroleum and four airports as of march 2021 a pfas site is a property where the michigan department of environment great lakes and energy egle have a valid gw monitoring well sample result that exceeds one or more of michigan s seven pfas gw cleanup criteria and egle has determined that the property is the source of pfas contamination based on data egle 2022d as of august 2022 ten pfas sites have been confirmed based on the above definition egle 2022d these confirmed pfas sites within the watershed are former firefighting foam discharge sites industrial sites e g a former chrysler plant airports and landfill and dump sites egle 2022d 2019 fig 2 depicts the location of the confirmed and suspected sites of pfas and seven wwtps in different townships across the watershed moreover several farms in the watershed have received biosolids from the wwtps with varying pfos concentrations in their effluent and biosolids brown 2022 the most recent permitting and compliance reports show that over 160 sites with a history of biosolids application exist within the watershed fig 2 egle 2022c 2 5 defining the extent and sources of pfos pollution in the watershed model 2 5 1 pfos non point sources to represent the initial pfos concentration in the soil profile of the watershed we classified the hydrologic response units hrus in the swat model into three groups and defined their representative soil pfos concentration range note that hrus are homogenous units of the surface water model each having a distinct combination of land use soil type and topography within the watershed s subbasins the characterizations of these hrus are as follows 1 potential pfas contamination ppc sites the hrus representing ppc sites are considered areas that might be directly impacted by high concentrations of pfas chemicals to include these sites in the model we selected the hrus corresponding to the location of suspected and confirmed pfas contaminated sites as shown in fig 2 also we set a limit on the maximum and minimum size of an hru that represents a ppc site for estimating pfos loads between 0 5 to 1 3 ha according to the characterizations by adamson et al 2022 on pfas impacted sites accordingly the total area selected to represent the 148 ppc sites is 176 ha further the representative pfos concentration for ppc sites is selected within the range of 100 to 4000 ug kg as supported by the soil sample reports in the watershed conducted by limnotech 2021 this assumption is further supported by previous studies such as those conducted by adamson et al 2022 and brusseau et al 2020 2 biosolids sites the second category comprises agricultural hrus that receive biosolids these hrus location corresponds to the locations of permitting and compliance reports as shown in fig 2 like ppc sites the land size is limited but between 10 ha to 100 ha representing the minimum and maximum farmland size in the watershed accordingly the total area of the biosolids site is 1540 ha or 2 8 of the total agricultural and pasture in the watershed based on previous studies the representative pfos concentration for the agricultural lands receiving biosolids is between 4 and 40 ug kg pepper et al 2021 johnson 2022 based on available data pfos concentrations in biosolids across the state range from 0 97 to 2150 µg kg with application rates of 6725 to 26 900 kg ha egle 2022a in the huron river watershed recent wwtp sampling revealed average pfos concentrations of 24 00 15 20 5 95 6 35 and 2150 µg kg at milford ann arbor dexter lyon and wixom wwtps respectively egle 2021a 2022c notably the high concentration observed at wixom 2150 µg kg is an outlier as biosolids land application ceased there in 2018 egle 2021a therefore we considered representative annual biosolids application rates between 6725 and 13 450 kg ha year with pfos concentrations from 6 00 to 24 00 µg kg 1 background pfos in agricultural urban and natural areas these hrus represent areas indirectly impacted by pfas chemicals through wind erosion wet deposition or irrigation the representative pfos concentration of the hrus with natural land use forests and wetlands is determined based on the research conducted by rankin et al 2016 on pfas concentration in surficial soil in areas with no apparent human presence moreover the representative pfos concentration was set for urban areas between 0 20 to 40 00 ug kg the selected range was considered based on the study conducted by xiao et al 2015 which reported a similar range for pfos concentration in surficial soil in the us metropolitan area table 1 presents a summary of pfos source configurations including the area number of sites corresponding hrus and representative pfos concentrations within the watershed 2 5 2 pfos point sources table 2 displays the discharge rate and pfos concentrations in effluents for 2018 and 2019 2021 among seven wwtps in the watershed egle 2021b the industrial pretreatment program ipp pfas initiative began in 2018 focusing on identifying and controlling pfos sources from industrial users discharging to publicly owned treatment works potw egle 2020 since 2018 pfos concentrations in effluents of two wwtps that regularly tested their effluent pfos concentration have decreased significantly for example the wixom wwtp reduced its average pfos concentration by as much as 90 percent to estimate daily pfos loads from the wwtps we multiplied the median pfos concentrations of each wwtp by their respective flow discharges for the wixom wwtp which substantially reduced its pfos concentration in effluent we reduced the daily pfos loads by a factor of ten for the simulation period after 2019 2 6 pfos parameterization for the model simulation as described in section 2 1 four parameters are associated with pfas physicochemical properties that limit the pfas adsorption at the air water and water soil interfaces regarding the former we adopted kl 0 137 l nmol and 2500 nmol m2 parameters for pfos air water adsorption from silva et al 2021 it should be noted that kl and are independent of the physiochemical properties of the soil therefore based on the pfas type the adsorption at the air water interface has two parameters for the model meanwhile the water solid adsorption parameters should be defined based on the soil properties of the model for instance li et al 2019 estimated and validated the kf and n for pfos in six soils with distinct physicochemical properties the soil database for the swat model of the huron river watershed nrcs 2021 has 18 soil profiles up to a horizon with 1500 mm depth and up to four layers with often different physical properties in order to estimate kf and n for different soil types in the model we have examined the organic carbon fig s1 a and texture table s1 of the soil layers and then classified them into six groups fig s1 b that closely resemble the soil properties of the six soil groups reported by li et al 2019 table s1 details the watershed soil profiles and their respective groups in every layer furthermore table s2 details the soil properties the estimated kf and n related to the six groups in our model finally figs s1 c and s2 b show the average initial kf and n estimated for the unsaturated zone across the watershed regarding in stream simulation parameters table 3 summarizes key input pfos parameters in rivers and lakes and their respective references 2 7 hydrological model calibration and performance evaluation to prepare the model for pfas fate and transport simulation we first calibrated and validated the hydrogeological processes in the model the input data for the swat modflow model setup such as aquifer depth estimated gw head elevation waterbodies land use elevation and climate data are provided in fig s2 and table s3 the established swat model has 189 sub watersheds and 9451 hrus the average size of the hrus is 24 ha with a median size of 4 ha and the standard deviation is 56 ha the gw layers were reconstructed in the modflow model using 78 130 gw lithological data the lithological data were used to calculate the semi variogram and estimate the gw bedrock elevation fig s3 the established modflow model has a grid size of 25 ha 500 500 m with 149 rows 168 columns and three convertible layers the gw and sw interact by linking seventy one major lakes and all rivers defined in the swat model to the modflow model the general approach for linking lakes to the gw model is described by rafiei et al 2022a and for linking rivers to the gw is described by baily et al 2016 further details regarding the swat modflow model setup are described in section s1 in the supplementary material the model was calibrated by two streamflow monitoring stations three transient gw head monitoring stations and more than 36 thousand static gw head elevation measurements during the calibration we selected 90 parameters for modflow gw hydraulic properties 12 for the modflow river package 12 for the modflow drain package parameters and 11 for the swat model the description of the calibration along with the parameters selected for calibration are provided in section s1 2 and table s4 the calibration was carried out utilizing the multi memory particle swarm optimization technique which is particularly tailored to handle the high dimensional and non linear gw sw models rafiei et al 2022b the calibration period was between 2001 and 2004 for which we have both gw and streamflow data no transient gw data was available after 2004 the final model evaluation was performed between 2001 and 2021 and compared with streamflow monitoring data we used two statistical indexes to evaluate the model s performance for simulating gw head and streamflow nash sutcliffe efficiency nse and the root mean square error ratio to the standard deviation rsr the nse range is between minus infinite to 1 and the rsr range is between 0 to infinite for these two parameters the perfect matches between observation and simulation are presented as nse of 1 or rsr of 0 for the streamflow and gw head in a transient state the acceptance range for the goodness of fit for nse is over 0 5 and rsr is below 0 7 rafiei et al 2022b the performance of the calibrated model exhibits that the nse for streamflow at both gauging stations is above 0 65 for daily simulation and over 0 74 for monthly simulation table 4 also the rsr for both daily and monthly simulations is below 0 6 table 4 the daily and monthly figures of streamflow and gw heads with additional statistical indexes for measuring the goodness of fit are provided in fig s4 s9 also fig s6 shows the model s performance for reproducing streamflow for the entire simulation period 1999 2021 the model s performance in simulating streamflow transient gw head and static gw head is described in detail with additional statistical indexes in section s2 of the supplementary material 2 8 pfos data analysis and model calibration 2 8 1 pfos sample collection and selection the pfos concentration samples were collected between 2018 and 2021 by egle egle 2022b to date egle gathered 2047 pfas samples throughout michigan 147 of which were from the huron river watershed ten of these samples came from water bodies such as lakes and wetlands and 32 samples were from drainage areas potentially linked to pfas emitting facilities these 32 samples were removed from the dataset because the model only provides results for a sub watershed s main channel not the facilities drainage system also samples related to wetlands and lakes were excluded from the model calibration due to their limited number in total 103 samples were deemed suitable for model calibration of these 23 fell below the detection threshold hereafter referred to as non detected and were consequently assigned the detection level by egle the detection level varied among samples ranging from 0 48 ng l to 3 ng l additionally 29 samples were situated between the detection level and the laboratory limit with egle providing estimates with higher confidence compared to non detect hereafter we refer to these samples as trace the concentrations of trace samples spanned from 0 58 to 6 4 ng l the remaining samples qualified exhibited concentrations between 5500 ng l and 2 05 ng l characterized by a median value of 12 2 ng l a mean of 249 ng l and a standard deviation of 843 ng l 2 8 2 pfos model calibration and parameters uncertainty analysis for calibrating the pfos fate and transport model the watershed was divided into nine regions fig s10 to define calibration parameters representing pfos concentration and coefficients in soil based on five major land uses ppc sites biosolids sites urban areas agricultural areas including pasture and natural land uses consequently 54 calibration parameters for adjusting pfos soil concentration were chosen for model calibration with an allowable range based on the representative concentrations presented in table 1 similarly another 54 parameters were designated for the purpose of modifying the estimated value of kf the allowable kf range were limited to 30 of the initial values as defined in section 2 6 other calibration parameters were related to the biosolid application rate with an allowable variation between 400 mg ha year to 200 mg ha year corresponding to the concentration and rate described in section 2 5 1 regarding calibration parameters in rivers and lakes first we grouped the sub watersheds into two categories to distinguish between the huron river and its tributary creeks for these two categories six calibration parameters relatively alter by 30 the parameters include the resuspension settling and diffusion velocities in rivers and lakes compared to the initial values estimated and presented in table 3 two other calibration parameters were set to adjust the kl and model parameters relative to their initial estimated values by 30 given these parameters the model was calibrated with the mmpso algorithm rafiei et al 2022b for optimal performance by reducing the root mean square error rmse between log transformed simulations and observations the model was executed for an initial 300 simulations with latin hypercube sampling which were used to 1 evaluate the 95th prediction uncertainty 95ppu in the model simulations and 2 allow the mmpso algorithm to search the solution space before starting the calibration subsequently the mmpso was allowed another 300 model evaluations to calibrate the model parameters the simulation period spanned from 1999 to 2021 and the performance was evaluated based on the available pfos data between 2018 and 2021 note that the first three years 1999 2021 were considered warm up periods allowing the pfos distribution in the soil profile to reach a dynamic equilibrium state as recommended in water quality modeling guidelines daggupati et al 2015 2 8 3 feature importance analysis of pfos fate and transport parameters to identify the parameters affecting pfos simulation transport among different land uses we conducted a feature importance analysis pedregosa et al 2011 using relevant stationary parameters from three distinct groups topography factors soil water retention parameters and water solid adsorption factors topography factors were derived from the modified universal soil loss equation musle parameters including uslels slope length and slope steepness and uslek soil erodibility williams 1975 soil water retention parameters comprised curve number cn2 accounting for runoff saturated hydraulic conductivity ksat influencing percolation rate as well as bulk density pb and particle size distribution d50 affecting saturation and air water interfacial area the water solid adsorption parameters included freundlich adsorption coefficients kf and freundlich exponents n that limit water solid adsorption to account for soil layer heterogeneity parameters such as kf n ksat pb and d50 were considered for surface soil the bottom layer and the average of the soil profile given the parameters we trained a gradient boosting regressor gbr pedregosa et al 2011 on the calibrated simulation dataset and calculated the importance of each parameter and their respective groups for different land use across the watershed the gbr algorithm can handle non linear relationships between variables and does not require normality assumptions for the variables and outcomes friedman 2001 here we only incorporated land uses in our analysis with non zero values for the leaching surface runoff sediment and lateral flow for fine tuning the gbr model a grid search cross validation approach was implemented with 10 fold cross validation using grid search allows us to systematically explore a wide range of hyperparameter combinations ensuring that we identify the optimal configuration for the model the hyperparameters explored in the grid search included the number of estimators learning rate maximum depth minimum samples for splitting minimum samples per leaf and the maximum number of features to be considered when looking for the best split upon completing the 10 fold cross validation and fine tuning process the best trained model was chosen based on the average r 2 scores obtained from the 10 fold cross validation 3 results 3 1 pfos model performance fig 3 compares the simulated and observed pfos across the huron river watershed alongside the 95ppu and sample categories trace non detected and qualified the scatter plot fig 3 a displays the logged transfer of all observations and simulations accompanied by a one order magnitude error range for evaluating the overall simulation error and identifying outliers with r² and rmse values of 0 64 and 0 61 respectively most simulation errors fall below half an order of magnitude taking the outlet of the watershed as the checkpoint of overall load estimation the model captured eleven available observations for the outlet with an average residual error of 2 8 ng l all observations fell within the 95ppu range fig 3b and c also the pbias score of 35 indicates an underestimation in the simulation compared to the observations however most underestimations were related to high pfos fluctuations near the downstream of some wwtps or the detection limit in the observations in terms of underestimations related to the detection limit for example fig 3e represents simulated pfos concentrations against nine recorded ones eight of which were non detected these samples were recorded in a sub watershed receiving pfos loads from a mix of suspected and confirmed contaminated sources the model similarly predicted pfos concentrations below the detection limit which was reasonable as the actual values of these samples were expected to be lower in addressing the underestimations related to wwtps with high pfos fluctuations fig 3f represents the simulated and observed pfos concentrations downstream of wixom wwtp which had considerable variations in pfos effluents before 2019 1164 1450 ng l table 4 under these circumstances four out of ten observations were outside the 95ppu model confidence level and had more than one order magnitude error despite this the pfos simulated for the sub watersheds located upstream of wixom wwtp see fig 3d and e displayed less than half an order of magnitude error consequently the underestimations were primarily due to the high fluctuations in the wwtp effluent rather than simulation errors also the simulation results for downstream of wwtps with minor effluent pfos variations like brighton wwtp 17 5 54 ng l table 4 closely matched observations with minimal errors 0 5 ng l fig 3g further on fig 3d illustrates pfos simulations and observations in an urbanized sub watershed containing ten suspected sites in this sub watershed the calibrated soil pfos concentrations for ppc sites were 3700 µg kg and 40 µg kg in urban areas the model simulations captured all three observations with less than half an order of magnitude error given the overall tendency of the calibration for selecting higher concentrations for ppc sites and urban areas plus the higher pfos concentrations recorded for this sub watershed stream the results suggested a higher probability of finding major contaminated sites at this sub watershed the findings from the simulation of sub watersheds that mainly produce agricultural runoff from fields where biosolids were utilized align with the measured concentrations for instance fig 3h shows the simulation results for agriculture dominated sub watersheds two observations were recorded from this subbasin one non detected and one trace sample both of which fall within the 95ppu confidence level in the model in addition the pfos concentration for biosolids at the upper streams was calibrated at 4 ug kg suggesting a lower possibility of finding biosolids sites as a significant source of surface water contamination at these sub watersheds in summary the model exhibits satisfactory performance with over 93 of observations and simulations falling within the same order of magnitude the underestimations primarily stemmed from sample quality and extreme spikes downstream of a wwtp with high variation in effluent pfos concentrations additionally the model showed its reasonable predictability for identifying sources and guiding monitoring efforts 3 2 simulated pfos transport dynamics in this study we analyzed the pfos transport in the huron watershed during the simulation period of 2001 2022 the results indicate that urban areas and ppc sites significantly contribute to pfos release through surface runoff and sediment transport meanwhile ppc sites accounted for the largest proportion of pfos release via leaching as do biosolids sites for pfos release via sediments the detailed findings including annual release rates and their contribution percentages can be found in table 5 given runoff and soil erosion as major pfos contributors to streams fig 4 a and b illustrate the spatial average annual pfos transport by surface runoff and soil erosion from background sources e g urban agriculture biosolids and ppc sites the predictive model uncertainty in estimating pfos load transport with surface runoff and sediment subject to the representative pfos concentrations table 4 is shown for different land uses in fig 4c and d 3 3 factors influencing pfos fate and transport simulations fig 5 a and b show each parameter s feature importance and their groups in pfos simulations across different land uses and transport processes parameters such as usle ls cn2 ksat and kf were among the top five influential factors in multiple land uses and processes regarding the groups impact soil water adsorption parameters kf and n explained most variations in pfos transport simulation with leaching whereas water retention groups e g cn2 and ksat had the highest impact on pfos simulation with runoff moreover the topography group had the highest percentage of explaining variations in pfos transport simulations with sediment and lateral flow usle ls consistently influenced variations in runoff and sediment pfos transport from biosolid sites urban areas and ppc sites fig 5a to quantify the impact we categorized pfos sediment transport among different land uses based on their usle ls percentiles into three groups less than 25 between 25 and 75 and greater than 75 as shown in fig 6 the land uses with steeper slopes uslels 75th significantly contributed more pfos than those with moderate or low slopes uslels 75th in addition the kruskal wallis test showed that for every land use category the p value was less than 0 05 indicating significant differences between the average pfos contribution among these groups similarly ksat and kf were influential factors in the leaching process for almost every land use therefore to further show the impact of these two parameters on pfos leaching we grouped the hrus soils into four groups based on the average ksat and kf of the soil profile 1 soils with relatively high mobility kf 50th percentile and high permeability ksat 50th percentile represented as hm hp 2 soils with the relatively high mobility and low permeability kf 50th percentile presented as hm lp 3 soils with the relatively low mobility and low permeability represented as lm lp 4 soils with the low mobility and high permeability represented as lm hp based on this classification fig 7 shows that the lowest and highest pfos leaching occurred respectively in lm lp and hm hp groups with significantly different average annual rates p value 0 05 with the kruskal wallis test 4 discussion 4 1 implication for planning and prioritizing remediation strategies this study provided preliminary insights into the spatiotemporal distribution and transport dynamics of pfos at the watershed scale focusing on the contributions from different land uses and sources subject to the limitations of the data and methods used the results highlighted the significant role of surface runoff in pfos transport with urban areas and ppc sites as significant contributors in this study area urban land use contributed 52 2 of the total pfos released through surface runoff table 5 with a median release rate of 6 mg ha year and a maximum rate of 80 mg ha year fig 4 these findings are supported by xiao et al 2012 who estimated an annual pfos transport of 3 2 kg via surface runoff from the minneapolis metropolitan area 680 km2 which experienced a similar annual rainfall compared to our case study moreover ppc sites accounted for 35 4 of the pfos released via surface runoff with a median release rate of 1621 mg ha year table 5 these findings are consistent with other studies that have reported higher pfos contributions from ppc sites dauchy et al 2019 the substantial contribution of pfos loads from urban and ppc sites with runoff along with variation in release due to environmental factors e g topography soil property underscores the necessity and effectiveness of implementing targeted mitigation strategies also as shown in table 5 most pfos mass leaching 93 of total with a median rate of 1034 mg ha year occurred in ppc sites to compare the leaching rates simulated in this study with those from previous research høisæter et al 2019 estimated pfos leaching rates between 20 ng l and 2200 ng l at an infiltration rate of 9 7 mm in soil with a maximum pfos concentration of 1000 ug l for comparison purposes the pfos leaching rates from høisæter et al 2019 can be converted to a range of 730 mg ha year to 77 745 mg ha day in this study the median leaching rate was 1034 mg ha year for the concentration range between 800 ug kg to 1200 ug kg and the maximum leaching rate was 73 000 mg ha year matching the minimum and maximum reported by høisæter et al 2019 additionally when comparing the simulated leaching with an actual pfas site in michigan in terms of mass discharge quinnan et al 2021 estimated the current annual leaching rate of an airport site approximately 1 ha at 400 mg ha year for the present pfos leaching and 83 585 mg ha year for the maximum historic pfos leaching the 400 mg ha year pfos leaching at the current rate aligns with the ppc sites simulated in this study which have less than 1000 ug kg pfos concentration in the unsaturated zone furthermore the pfos leaching at the maximum rate 83 586 mg ha year is consistent with the ppc sites simulated in this study with over 3000 ug kg pfos concentration in soil however it is important to emphasize that due to the modeling conceptualization at the watershed scale and initial pfas soil distribution in soil profiles the simulated leaching rates should be regarded as approximate values of the order of magnitude which are subject to initial assumptions and sites specific conditions nevertheless our simulation results showed a significant difference of at least two orders of magnitude between the average annual leaching from lm lp soils poor drainage with high organic carbon and hm hp soils well drained with low organic carbon fig 7 these findings are in line with richardson et al 2022 which demonstrated that pfas transport is primarily downward in well drained soils and more prone to runoff in poorly drained soils our results suggest that prioritizing remediation efforts based on soil properties could lead to more effective management of pfas contamination sediment transport was the notable pathway for pfos release particularly from biosolids sites in our study the modeling suggests that biosolids sites contributed 65 65 of the total pfos released through sediment transport with a median release rate of 43 73 mg ha year fig 4 although further research is required to investigate biosolids impact on surface water quality these results suggest considering a higher standard for management practices in biosolids sites in particular the significant role of slope length and degree in pfos transport with sediment suggests that erosion control measures e g vegetation cover and contour farming could help minimize pfos release from biosolids sites 4 2 limitations and further strategies for model development we recognize that this study has certain limitations the model calibration and parameter uncertainty analysis were based on observations with limited spatial and temporal scope to improve the model s accuracy we suggest incorporating more extensive datasets for calibration and validation including gw pfas data however obtaining pfas data at the watershed scale can be challenging due to privacy concerns for instance while pfas data have been collected in public drinking water supplies throughout michigan egle 2022e the coordinates of water boreholes were not disclosed therefore could not be incorporated into this study additionally the scarcity of data led to assumptions regarding the locations of ppc sites the application of biosolids and representative pfos concentrations which contribute to the model s epistemic uncertainties to address these uncertainties and further refine the model we recommend conducting a comprehensive sensitivity analysis in future research the model s performance in capturing spatiotemporal pfos variability despite the limitations demonstrated its potential for further development and application in pfas fate and transport studies especially in the following areas 1 even though pfos transport with the gw flow system might span decades gefell et al 2021 farhat et al 2022 incorporating pfos exchange between gw sw might enhance model accuracy at the watershed scale for example tokranov et al 2021b showed that pfas contamination in surface water bodies like lakes and rivers can impact a broad area when discharging downgradient to gw or river outlets influencing seasonal pfas concentrations in rivers therefore future studies might consider linking modflow rt3d with swat to address pfos exchange between gw and sw components and their influence on seasonal pfos transport 2 in this study we focused on the fate and transport of pfos as a proxy for understanding long chain pfas fate and transport meanwhile future studies can include short chain pfas compounds that are relatively mobile in the subsurface environment it is important to note that the developed model in this study is capable of stimulating both long and short chain pfas compounds 3 pfas compounds exhibit competition for adsorption at the air water interface also pfas precursors can influence the concentrations of terminal pfas compounds such as pfos silva et al 2021 therefore future studies should consider multi component mixtures in the unsaturated zone to enhance the overall predictive capabilities of the model 5 conclusions this study developed a novel distributed hydrogeochemical model for the first time to evaluate the fate and transport of pfos in a large watershed with diverse sources of pfas the results from the watershed scale analysis yielded practical and policy relevant findings which are as follows to significantly reduce pfos contamination from surface runoff it is crucial to implement stringent regulations and management practices targeting urban areas and ppc sites which collectively contribute to approximately 90 of the total pfos discharge ppc sites are also the primary source of pfas release via lateral flow and leaching accounting for more than 90 of the total pfos released in the watershed therefore prioritizing remediation efforts based on soil properties could result in more cost effective watershed management of pfas contamination in terms of sediment transport biosolids sites contribute the most pfos accounting for 66 of the total amount discharged therefore prioritizing erosion control measures in biosolids sites could contribute to further watershed scale pfos contamination reduction to optimize source identification and develop targeted management strategies it is essential to account for the influences of topography soil water retention and water solid adsorption factors in guiding policy and decision making processes related to pfos contamination mitigation finally we suggest collecting and incorporating larger monitoring information e g pfas gw concentrations and soil distribution especially at ppc sites to improve model

14714,developing strategic plans for the remediation and mitigation of pre and polyfluoroalkyl substances pfas in soil groundwater and surface water requires an understanding of the fate and transport of these chemicals on a regional scale to fill this knowledge gap we developed a distributed hydrogeochemical model and applied it to a large scale watershed with various point and non point sources of a long chain highly persistent pfas compound known as perfluorooctane sulfonic acid pfos the results showed that the developed model could reproduce the spatiotemporal concentration of pfos across a large and diverse watershed herein our first objective was to quantify the pfos transport from the unsaturated zone to the groundwater and surface water via leaching surface runoff lateral flow and sediment transport the second objective was to identify factors influencing pfos release from confirmed and suspected pfas sites and urban and agricultural areas the modeling results show that surface runoff played a significant role in pfos transport with urban areas and industrial sites being major contributors in addition sediment transport was found to be a notable pathway for pfos release particularly from sites with biosolids application further analysis revealed the relative importance of topography soil water retention and water solid adsorption factors in determining pfos transport dynamics at the watershed scale for better source identification and targeted management graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords swat modflow huron river biosolids wastewater treatment plant groundwater surface water modeling michigan data availability https github com vahidr32 pfas fate and transport model git 1 introduction per and polyfluoroalkyl substances pfas are a group of synthetic organic chemicals with a wide range of applications in various industries and consumer products glenn et al 2021 glüge et al 2020 since the beginning of pfas manufacturing in the 1940s materials and discarded waste containing pfas have been released into the environment from various sources such as airports firefighting training areas industrial sites landfills agricultural lands and wastewater treatment plants wwtps stoiber et al 2020 the carbon fluorine bonds in long chain pfas chemicals are highly stable in normal environmental conditions with limited degradation under specialized conditions huang and jaffé 2019 as a result the discarded pfas compounds in the environment have been circulated and accumulated in the soil surface water sw groundwater gw and living organisms brusseau et al 2020 given the extent of the pfas pollution and their adverse impacts on humans and the environment several pfas were listed among persistent organic pollutants and emerging contaminants of critical concern dean et al 2020 stockholm convention 2009 meanwhile controlling pfas pollution is a longstanding challenge since numerous pfas chemicals have varying mobility persistence and an uncertain level of environmental contamination newell et al 2020 simon et al 2019 generally pfas chemicals are surface active i e surfactants and except for precursors they have extreme resistance to biotic chemical and mechanical degradation wang et al 2017 therefore in the unsaturated zone pfas compounds accumulate at the air water and water solid interfaces becoming a contaminant source for gw and sw for decades sunderland et al 2019 as such pfas fate and transport in the unsaturated zone strongly depend on several factors such as local hydrogeological processes climate conditions pfas chain length functional groups and physiochemical properties of the subsurface materials for instance the leaching of perfluorooctane sulfonic acid pfos a long chain pfas from the vadose zone to the gw is relatively slow due to the strong adsorption of pfos at the air water and water solid interfaces høisæter et al 2019 stahl et al 2013 however climate conditions and soils physiochemical properties alter the magnitude of pfos leaching guo et al 2020 liu et al 2020 therefore remediation and cleanup projects need to consider numerous environmental factors as well as the physiochemical properties of targeted pfas for implementing successful mitigation strategies as the need to identify and remediate soils and aquifers contaminated by pfas chemicals grew several studies investigated different aspects of pfas fate and transport sima and jaffé 2021 however thus far many modeling studies have been conducted for field scale and isolated porous media under controlled environmental conditions e g guo et al 2020 silva et al 2020 the previous studies have shortcomings in evaluating pfas transport via runoff and sediment from surficial sources to sw brusseau et al 2019 guo et al 2020 silva et al 2020 or oversimplified pfas fate mechanisms such as the adsorption at the air water interface shin et al 2011 in addition pfas pollution in the environment is not only limited to point source contributors e g contaminated sites or the effluents of wwtps but also non point sources such as biosolids application in agricultural lands add to the difficulty of predicting the source of contamination xiao et al 2012 naidu et al 2020 therefore large scale modeling studies must include different soil sw and gw pathways to identify and prioritize remediation strategies beyond field scale investigation raschke 2022 tokranov et al 2021a this research aims to contribute to understanding pfas fate and transport in large scale heterogeneous watersheds where point and non point sources complicate identifying pfas origins and quantifying pfas loads to waterways to fill the knowledge gap we developed a distributed physically based hydrogeochemical model this model simulates pfas fate and transport in the surface soil unsaturated zone rivers and lakes here we selected the pfos compound as it is one of the most persistent with historical usage and release to the environment once we validated the performance of the model for reproducing the spatiotemporal pfos concentrations in streams across the watershed we examined the following objectives 1 quantification of pfos mass fluxes transported by surface runoff lateral flow and sediment as well as pfas leaching to the gw 2 identification of the primary factors influencing pfos fate and transport from contaminated sources urban areas and agricultural fields that can be used for strategic monitoring and remediation planning at large scale the novelty of this work includes two main aspects 1 the development of the first distributed watershed scale pfas model 2 the characterization of the locations where the pfos transport with surface runoff sediment transport and leaching is at the maximum level 2 methodology in this section we described the theories and tools we implemented for the simulation of pfos fate and transport in the surface soil unsaturated zone rivers and lakes and subsequently introduced the case study model specifications and calibration 2 1 pfas fate and transport in the surface soil and the unsaturated zone the unsaturated zone which is the focus of this study encompasses the soil moisture zone that extends from the surface soil or topsoil down to the bottom of the root zone national research council 2004 the unsaturated zone is under atmospheric pressure and pore spaces are not filled here we assumed that the pfas fate and transport in the unsaturated zone like other families of synthetic organic chemicals can be formulated by an advection dispersion equation as with prior studies we assumed that the adsorption at the air water and water solid interfaces are the most significant pfas fate mechanisms in the unsaturated zone sima and jaffé 2021 following the assumptions we considered the water movement in the horizontal surface runoff lateral flow and vertical infiltration and leaching directions we also accounted for sediment transport from soil erosion considering these factors we formulated the pfas fate and transport in the unsaturated zone by eq 1 in addition we considered a distributed and heterogenous soil profile for the unsaturated zone with several layers different land use and topography the pfas transport with surface runoff and soil erosion occurs in the first soil layer the top 10 mm layer hereafter referred to as surface soil while the lateral flow in the underlying layers with varying depths therefore water and pfas that percolates out of the root zone are considered leaching in this study also the unsaturated zone is assumed to be a dynamic system with variable water content and pfas concentration over time and space 1 c t ρ b c s t c a w t v q c z v l c z v p c h y s e d c s z 0 where c m l3 is the concentration of pfas in solution aqueous concentration cs m m is the solid phase adsorbed concentration of pfas ρb m l3 is the bulk density of the soil layer caw m l3 is the concentration of pfas at the air water interface the υq l t is the water velocity in surface runoff the first soil layer υl l t is the water velocity with the lateral flow soil layers below the first one υp l t is the water velocity with percolation and ysed m l2 t is sediment yield via erosion processes pfas adsorption at the water solid interface prior experimental studies showed that the non linear freundlich isotherm eq 2 could reasonably estimate the solid equilibrium phase concentration cs in porous media for a wide range of concentrations and different types of pfas and soil materials li et al 2019 therefore we adopted the freundlich isotherm for simulating pfas adsorption at the water solid interface also we disregarded the kinetic form of adsorption because pfas chemicals can reach the equilibrium concentration within 24 48 h li et al 2019 which is consistent with the one day time step simulation in our hydrogeological model 2 c s k f c n where kf m m m l3 n is the freundlich distribution coefficient and n dimensionless is the freundlich exponent pfas adsorption at the air water interface as surfactants pfas chemicals strongly tend to adsorb at the air water interface brusseau and guo 2022 as presented by eq 3 the air water concentration caw for a pfas compound can be estimated by approximating the surface concentration and the air water interfacial area aaw l2 l3 of the porous media the former can be approximated by the non linear langmuir isotherm eq 4 which is the most common approach applied for surfactants chang and franses 1995 including pfas compounds silva et al 2021 the aaw on the other hand depends on saturation porosity soil grain size and other soil texture properties that define the porewater volume in the porous media lyu et al 2018 we approximate the aaw using soil physical properties such as water content saturation capacity and geometric surface area gsa as introduced by silva et al 2022 eq 5 3 4 5 a aw gsa 1 s sw s sa 6 1 θ d 50 1 s sw s sa where θ l3 l3 is the soil porosity d50 l is the soil median particle diameter ssw m is the maximum saturation capacity of the soil ssa m is the soil water content m l2 is the maximum surface concentration of the chemical and kl l2 m is the concentration independent langmuir coefficient note that the kl and can be estimated by measuring the surface tension and fitting the langmuir szyszkowski equation for different pfas e g costanza et al 2019 2 2 pfas fate and transport in rivers and lakes once the sorbed and dissolved pfas loads were routed from the unsaturated zone to rivers by surface runoff sediment transport and lateral flow the model simulates pfas fate and transport in the water column and sediment layer in rivers and lakes herein we adopted the lake and in stream simulation approach from chapra 1997 this approach partitions pfas into sorbed and dissolved forms in the water column with eq 6 and in the sediment layer with eq 7 6 f d w 1 1 k d c s e d 1 f p w 7 f d s e d 1 ø 1 ø ρ s k d 1 f p where kd l3 m is the pfas partition coefficient fp w and fd w are the fractions of the sorbed and solution phases of pfas in the water column respectively ø l3 l3 is the sediment porosity ρs m l3 is the bulk density of the sediment layer fp sed and fd sed are the fractions of the sorbed and solution phases of pfas in the sediment layer next we simulated the pfas mass balance in the sediment layer and water column assuming that the bulk of the gas and liquid phases in the rivers and lakes are well mixed and homogeneous chapra 1997 then according to chapra 1997 for the water column and sediment layer we simulated the processes of deposition to the sediment layer resuspension from the sediment layer to the water column and diffusion between the water column and sediment layer by two mass balances eqs 8 and 9 also unlike other families of synthetic organic chemicals pfos volatilization and degradation are negligible russell et al 2008 therefore we ignored these processes for the in stream simulation 8 δ δ w r t δ w r t i n δ w r t o u t v r δ s e d f p w r t v s δ w r t v d f d s e d δ s e d f d w r t δ w r t t h 9 δ δ s e d δ s e d v b δ s e d

and transport in an integrated sw gw model we implemented the pfas fate and transport theories sections 2 1 and 2 2 in the smr w model rafiei et al 2022a the latest version of the integrated swat modflow rt3d model bailey et al 2016 the smr w model simulates sw hydrology with swat neitsch et al 2011 gw hydro geochemistry with modflow rt3d and the interactions of these two systems at the land river and lake interfaces through a linking module rafiei et al 2022a bailey et al 2016 we added and modified more than seventy subroutines within the swat model source code and incorporated more than one hundred fifty global and local variables for the pfas fate and transport simulation these modules and subroutines perform the following tasks in the integrated model 1 read the model inputs for the targeted pfas in soil including the size number and concentration level of the contaminated sites background pfas in different land use and the pfas related parameters 2 add daily pfas loads from wwtps to streams 3 apply biosolids application in selected croplands 4 computes the fate and transport of pfas in soil layers 5 route the pfas loads by surface runoff sediment transport and lateral flow to the hydrograph storage network of the model and 6 simulate pfas fate and transport in lakes and streams by considering pfas deposition resuspension diffusion and burial processes in water and sediment layer fig 1 shows a conceptual model diagram for simulating pfas fate and transport in our model the model s source code a detailed description of the pfas fate and transport implementation

study huron river watershed the huron river watershed is in southeast michigan usa fig 2 the total area of the watershed is 2292 km2 and contains nearly 738 km of river network that eventually drains into lake erie over 31 7 of the watershed is urbanized 13 7 is cropland and 9 7 is pasture forests cover 21 8 and wetlands and glacial lakes cover 23 1 pfos has been detected in 79 of sw and stormwater samples from the watershed with concentrations ranging from below the detection limit to 5600 ng l egle 2019 according to the usepa pfas analytical tool dataset usepa 2021 more than 148 facilities that may handle pfas are within the watershed these facilities are from a variety of industries including but not limited to 28 facilities related to chemical manufacturing 20 metal machinery manufacturing 19 metal coating 18 waste management 17 plastics and resins eight paints and coatings seven cleaning product manufacturing four petroleum and four airports as of march 2021 a pfas site is a property where the michigan department of environment great lakes and energy egle have a valid gw monitoring well sample result that exceeds one or more of michigan s seven pfas gw cleanup criteria and egle has determined that the property is the source of pfas contamination based on data egle 2022d as of august 2022 ten pfas sites have been confirmed based on the above definition egle 2022d these confirmed pfas sites within the watershed are former firefighting foam discharge sites industrial sites e g a former chrysler plant airports and landfill and dump sites egle 2022d 2019 fig 2 depicts the location of the confirmed and suspected sites of pfas and seven wwtps in different townships across the watershed moreover several farms in the watershed have received biosolids from the wwtps with varying pfos concentrations in their effluent and biosolids brown 2022 the most recent permitting and compliance reports show that over 160 sites with a history of biosolids application exist within the watershed fig 2 egle 2022c 2 5 defining the extent and sources of pfos pollution in the watershed model 2 5 1 pfos non point sources to represent the initial pfos concentration in the soil profile of the watershed we classified the hydrologic response units hrus in the swat model into three groups and defined their representative soil pfos concentration range note that hrus are homogenous units of the surface water model each having a distinct combination of land use soil type and topography within the watershed s subbasins the characterizations of these hrus are as follows 1 potential pfas contamination ppc sites the hrus representing ppc sites are considered areas that might be directly impacted by high concentrations of pfas chemicals to include these sites in the model we selected the hrus corresponding to the location of suspected and confirmed pfas contaminated sites as shown in fig 2 also we set a limit on the maximum and minimum size of an hru that represents a ppc site for estimating pfos loads between 0 5 to 1 3 ha according to the characterizations by adamson et al 2022 on pfas impacted sites accordingly the total area selected to represent the 148 ppc sites is 176 ha further the representative pfos concentration for ppc sites is selected within the range of 100 to 4000 ug kg as supported by the soil sample reports in the watershed conducted by limnotech 2021 this assumption is further supported by previous studies such as those conducted by adamson et al 2022 and brusseau et al 2020 2 biosolids sites the second category comprises agricultural hrus that receive biosolids these hrus location corresponds to the locations of permitting and compliance reports as shown in fig 2 like ppc sites the land size is limited but between 10 ha to 100 ha representing the minimum and maximum farmland size in the watershed accordingly the total area of the biosolids site is 1540 ha or 2 8 of the total agricultural and pasture in the watershed based on previous studies the representative pfos concentration for the agricultural lands receiving biosolids is between 4 and 40 ug kg pepper et al 2021 johnson 2022 based on available data pfos concentrations in biosolids across the state range from 0 97 to 2150 µg kg with application rates of 6725 to 26 900 kg ha egle 2022a in the huron river watershed recent wwtp sampling revealed average pfos concentrations of 24 00 15 20 5 95 6 35 and 2150 µg kg at milford ann arbor dexter lyon and wixom wwtps respectively egle 2021a 2022c notably the high concentration observed at wixom 2150 µg kg is an outlier as biosolids land application ceased there in 2018 egle 2021a therefore we considered representative annual biosolids application rates between 6725 and 13 450 kg ha year with pfos concentrations from 6 00 to 24 00 µg kg 1 background pfos in agricultural urban and natural areas these hrus represent areas indirectly impacted by pfas chemicals through wind erosion wet deposition or irrigation the representative pfos concentration of the hrus with natural land use forests and wetlands is determined based on the research conducted by rankin et al 2016 on pfas concentration in surficial soil in areas with no apparent human presence moreover the representative pfos concentration was set for urban areas between 0 20 to 40 00 ug kg the selected range was considered based on the study conducted by xiao et al 2015 which reported a similar range for pfos concentration in surficial soil in the us metropolitan area table 1 presents a summary of pfos source configurations including the area number of sites corresponding hrus and representative pfos concentrations within the watershed 2 5 2 pfos point sources table 2 displays the discharge rate and pfos concentrations in effluents for 2018 and 2019 2021 among seven wwtps in the watershed egle 2021b the industrial pretreatment program ipp pfas initiative began in 2018 focusing on identifying and controlling pfos sources from industrial users discharging to publicly owned treatment works potw egle 2020 since 2018 pfos concentrations in effluents of two wwtps that regularly tested their effluent pfos concentration have decreased significantly for example the wixom wwtp reduced its average pfos concentration by as much as 90 percent to estimate daily pfos loads from the wwtps we multiplied the median pfos concentrations of each wwtp by their respective flow discharges for the wixom wwtp which substantially reduced its pfos concentration in effluent we reduced the daily pfos loads by a factor of ten for the simulation period after 2019 2 6 pfos parameterization for the model simulation as described in section 2 1 four parameters are associated with pfas physicochemical properties that limit the pfas adsorption at the air water and water soil interfaces regarding the former we adopted kl 0 137 l nmol and 2500 nmol m2 parameters for pfos air water adsorption from silva et al 2021 it should be noted that kl and are independent of the physiochemical properties of the soil therefore based on the pfas type the adsorption at the air water interface has two parameters for the model meanwhile the water solid adsorption parameters should be defined based on the soil properties of the model for instance li et al 2019 estimated and validated the kf and n for pfos in six soils with distinct physicochemical properties the soil database for the swat model of the huron river watershed nrcs 2021 has 18 soil profiles up to a horizon with 1500 mm depth and up to four layers with often different physical properties in order to estimate kf and n for different soil types in the model we have examined the organic carbon fig s1 a and texture table s1 of the soil layers and then classified them into six groups fig s1 b that closely resemble the soil properties of the six soil groups reported by li et al 2019 table s1 details the watershed soil profiles and their respective groups in every layer furthermore table s2 details the soil properties the estimated kf and n related to the six groups in our model finally figs s1 c and s2 b show the average initial kf and n estimated for the unsaturated zone across the watershed regarding in stream simulation parameters table 3 summarizes key input pfos parameters in rivers and lakes and their respective references 2 7 hydrological model calibration and performance evaluation to prepare the model for pfas fate and transport simulation we first calibrated and validated the hydrogeological processes in the model the input data for the swat modflow model setup such as aquifer depth estimated gw head elevation waterbodies land use elevation and climate data are provided in fig s2 and table s3 the established swat model has 189 sub watersheds and 9451 hrus the average size of the hrus is 24 ha with a median size of 4 ha and the standard deviation is 56 ha the gw layers were reconstructed in the modflow model using 78 130 gw lithological data the lithological data were used to calculate the semi variogram and estimate the gw bedrock elevation fig s3 the established modflow model has a grid size of 25 ha 500 500 m with 149 rows 168 columns and three convertible layers the gw and sw interact by linking seventy one major lakes and all rivers defined in the swat model to the modflow model the general approach for linking lakes to the gw model is described by rafiei et al 2022a and for linking rivers to the gw is described by baily et al 2016 further details regarding the swat modflow model setup are described in section s1 in the supplementary material the model was calibrated by two streamflow monitoring stations three transient gw head monitoring stations and more than 36 thousand static gw head elevation measurements during the calibration we selected 90 parameters for modflow gw hydraulic properties 12 for the modflow river package 12 for the modflow drain package parameters and 11 for the swat model the description of the calibration along with the parameters selected for calibration are provided in section s1 2 and table s4 the calibration was carried out utilizing the multi memory particle swarm optimization technique which is particularly tailored to handle the high dimensional and non linear gw sw models rafiei et al 2022b the calibration period was between 2001 and 2004 for which we have both gw and streamflow data no transient gw data was available after 2004 the final model evaluation was performed between 2001 and 2021 and compared with streamflow monitoring data we used two statistical indexes to evaluate the model s performance for simulating gw head and streamflow nash sutcliffe efficiency nse and the root mean square error ratio to the standard deviation rsr the nse range is between minus infinite to 1 and the rsr range is between 0 to infinite for these two parameters the perfect matches between observation and simulation are presented as nse of 1 or rsr of 0 for the streamflow and gw head in a transient state the acceptance range for the goodness of fit for nse is over 0 5 and rsr is below 0 7 rafiei et al 2022b the performance of the calibrated model exhibits that the nse for streamflow at both gauging stations is above 0 65 for daily simulation and over 0 74 for monthly simulation table 4 also the rsr for both daily and monthly simulations is below 0 6 table 4 the daily and monthly figures of streamflow and gw heads with additional statistical indexes for measuring the goodness of fit are provided in fig s4

is described in detail with additional statistical indexes in section s2 of the supplementary material 2 8 pfos data analysis and model calibration 2 8 1 pfos sample collection and selection the pfos concentration samples were collected between 2018 and 2021 by egle egle 2022b to date egle gathered 2047 pfas samples throughout michigan 147 of which were from the huron river watershed ten of these samples came from water bodies such as lakes and wetlands and 32 samples were from drainage areas potentially linked to pfas emitting facilities these 32 samples were removed from the dataset because the model only provides results for a sub watershed s main channel not the facilities drainage system also samples related to wetlands and lakes were excluded from the model calibration due to their limited number in total 103 samples were deemed suitable for model calibration of these 23 fell below the detection threshold hereafter referred to as non detected and were consequently assigned the detection level by egle the detection level varied among samples ranging from 0 48 ng l to 3 ng l additionally 29 samples were situated between the detection level and the laboratory limit with egle providing estimates with higher confidence compared to non detect hereafter we refer to these samples as trace the concentrations of trace samples spanned from 0 58 to 6 4 ng l the remaining samples qualified exhibited concentrations between 5500 ng l and 2 05 ng l characterized by a median value of 12 2 ng l a mean of 249 ng l and a standard deviation of 843 ng l 2 8 2 pfos model calibration and parameters uncertainty analysis for calibrating the pfos fate and transport model the watershed was divided into nine regions fig s10 to define calibration parameters representing pfos concentration and coefficients in soil based on five major land uses ppc sites biosolids sites urban areas agricultural areas including pasture and natural land uses consequently 54 calibration parameters for adjusting pfos soil concentration were chosen for model calibration with an allowable range based on the representative concentrations presented in table 1 similarly another 54 parameters were designated for the purpose of modifying the estimated value of kf the allowable kf range were limited to 30 of the initial values as defined in section 2 6 other calibration parameters were related to the biosolid application rate with an allowable variation between 400 mg ha year to 200 mg ha year corresponding to the concentration and rate described in section 2 5 1 regarding calibration parameters in rivers and lakes first we grouped the sub watersheds into two categories to distinguish between the huron river and its tributary creeks for these two categories six calibration parameters relatively alter by 30 the parameters include the resuspension settling and diffusion velocities in rivers and lakes compared to the initial values estimated and presented in table 3 two other calibration parameters were set to adjust the kl and model parameters relative to their initial estimated values by 30 given these parameters the model was calibrated with the mmpso algorithm rafiei et al 2022b for optimal performance by reducing the root mean square error rmse between log transformed simulations and observations the model was executed for an initial 300 simulations with latin hypercube sampling which were used to 1 evaluate the 95th prediction uncertainty 95ppu in the model simulations and 2 allow the mmpso algorithm to search the solution space before starting the calibration subsequently the mmpso was allowed another 300 model evaluations to calibrate the model parameters the simulation period spanned from 1999 to 2021 and the performance was evaluated based on the available pfos data between 2018 and 2021 note that the first three years 1999 2021 were considered warm up periods allowing the pfos distribution in the soil profile to reach a dynamic equilibrium state as recommended in water quality modeling guidelines daggupati et al 2015 2 8 3 feature importance analysis of pfos fate and transport parameters to identify the parameters affecting pfos simulation transport among different land uses we conducted a feature importance analysis pedregosa et al 2011 using relevant stationary parameters from three distinct groups topography factors soil water retention parameters and water solid adsorption factors topography factors were derived from the modified universal soil loss equation musle parameters including uslels slope length and slope steepness and uslek soil erodibility williams 1975 soil water retention parameters comprised curve number cn2 accounting for runoff saturated hydraulic conductivity ksat influencing percolation rate as well as bulk density pb and particle size distribution d50 affecting saturation and air water interfacial area the water solid adsorption parameters included freundlich adsorption coefficients kf and freundlich exponents n that limit water solid adsorption to account for soil layer heterogeneity parameters such as kf n ksat pb and d50 were considered for surface soil the bottom layer and the average of the soil profile given the parameters we trained a gradient boosting regressor gbr pedregosa et al 2011 on the calibrated simulation dataset and calculated the importance of each parameter and their respective groups for different land use across the watershed the gbr algorithm can handle non linear relationships between variables and does not require normality assumptions for the variables and outcomes friedman 2001 here we only incorporated land uses in our analysis with non zero values for the leaching surface runoff sediment and lateral flow for fine tuning the gbr model a grid search cross validation approach was implemented with 10 fold cross validation using grid search allows us to systematically explore a wide range of hyperparameter combinations ensuring that we identify the optimal configuration for the model the hyperparameters explored in the grid search included the number of estimators learning rate maximum depth minimum samples for splitting minimum samples per leaf and the maximum number of features to be considered when looking for the best split upon completing the 10 fold cross validation and fine tuning process the best trained model was chosen based on the average r 2 scores obtained from the 10 fold cross validation 3 results 3 1 pfos model performance fig 3 compares the simulated and observed pfos across the huron river watershed alongside the 95ppu and sample categories trace non detected and qualified the scatter plot fig 3 a displays the logged transfer of all observations and simulations accompanied by a one order magnitude error range for evaluating the overall simulation error and identifying outliers with r² and rmse values of 0 64 and 0 61 respectively most simulation errors fall below half an order of magnitude taking the outlet of the watershed as the checkpoint of overall load estimation the model captured eleven available observations for the outlet with an average residual error of 2 8 ng l all observations fell within the 95ppu range fig 3b and c also the pbias score of 35 indicates an underestimation in the simulation compared to the observations however most underestimations were related to high pfos fluctuations near the downstream of some wwtps or the detection limit in the observations in terms of underestimations related to the detection limit for example fig 3e represents simulated pfos concentrations against nine recorded ones eight of which were non detected these samples were recorded in a sub watershed receiving pfos loads from a mix of suspected and confirmed contaminated sources the model similarly predicted pfos concentrations below the detection limit which was reasonable as the actual values of these samples were expected to be lower in addressing the underestimations related to wwtps with high pfos fluctuations fig 3f represents the simulated and observed pfos concentrations downstream of wixom wwtp which had considerable variations in pfos effluents before 2019 1164 1450 ng l table 4 under these circumstances four out of ten observations were outside the 95ppu model confidence level and had more than one order magnitude error despite this the pfos simulated for the sub watersheds located upstream of wixom wwtp see fig 3d and e displayed less than half an order of magnitude error consequently the underestimations were primarily due to the high fluctuations in the wwtp effluent rather than simulation errors also the simulation results for downstream of wwtps with minor effluent pfos variations like brighton wwtp 17 5 54 ng l table 4 closely matched observations with minimal errors 0 5 ng l fig 3g further on fig 3d illustrates pfos simulations and observations in an urbanized sub watershed containing ten suspected sites in this sub watershed the calibrated soil pfos concentrations for ppc sites were 3700 µg kg and 40 µg kg in urban areas the model simulations captured all three observations with less than half an order of magnitude error given the overall tendency of the calibration for selecting higher concentrations for ppc sites and urban areas plus the higher pfos concentrations recorded for this sub watershed stream the results suggested a higher probability of finding major contaminated sites at this sub watershed the findings from the simulation of sub watersheds that mainly produce agricultural runoff from fields where biosolids were utilized align with the measured concentrations for instance fig 3h shows the simulation results for agriculture dominated sub watersheds two observations were recorded from this subbasin one non detected and one trace sample both of which fall within the 95ppu confidence level in the model in addition the pfos concentration for biosolids at the upper streams was calibrated at 4 ug kg suggesting a lower possibility of finding biosolids sites as a significant source of surface water contamination at these sub watersheds in summary the model exhibits satisfactory performance with over 93 of observations and simulations falling within the same order of magnitude the underestimations primarily stemmed from sample quality and extreme spikes downstream of a wwtp with high variation in effluent pfos concentrations additionally the model showed its reasonable predictability for identifying sources and guiding monitoring efforts 3 2 simulated pfos transport dynamics in this study we analyzed the pfos transport in the huron watershed during the simulation period of 2001 2022 the results indicate that urban areas and ppc sites significantly contribute to pfos release through surface runoff and sediment transport meanwhile ppc sites accounted for the largest proportion of pfos release via leaching as do biosolids sites for pfos release via sediments the detailed findings including annual release rates and their contribution percentages can be found in table 5 given runoff and soil erosion as major pfos contributors to streams fig 4 a and b illustrate the spatial average annual pfos transport by surface runoff and soil erosion from background sources e g urban agriculture biosolids and ppc sites the predictive model uncertainty in estimating pfos load transport with surface runoff and sediment subject to the representative pfos concentrations table 4 is shown for different land uses in fig 4c and d 3 3 factors influencing pfos fate and transport simulations fig 5 a and b show each parameter s feature importance and their groups in pfos simulations across different land uses and transport processes parameters such as usle ls cn2 ksat and kf were among the top five influential factors in multiple land uses and processes regarding the groups impact soil water adsorption parameters kf and n explained most variations in pfos transport simulation with leaching whereas water retention groups e g cn2 and ksat had the highest impact on pfos simulation with runoff moreover the topography group had the highest percentage of explaining variations in pfos transport simulations with sediment and lateral flow usle ls consistently influenced variations in runoff and sediment pfos transport from biosolid sites urban areas and ppc sites fig 5a to quantify the impact we categorized pfos sediment transport among different land uses based on their usle ls percentiles into three groups less than 25 between 25 and 75 and greater than 75 as shown in fig 6 the land uses with steeper slopes uslels 75th significantly contributed more pfos than those with moderate or low slopes uslels 75th in addition the kruskal wallis test showed that for every land use category the p value was less than 0 05 indicating significant differences between the average pfos contribution among these groups similarly ksat and kf were influential factors in the leaching process for almost every land use therefore to further show the impact of these two parameters on pfos leaching we grouped the hrus soils into four groups based on the average ksat and kf of the soil profile 1 soils with relatively high mobility kf 50th percentile and high permeability ksat 50th percentile represented as hm hp 2 soils with the relatively high mobility and low permeability kf 50th percentile presented as hm lp 3 soils with the relatively low mobility and low permeability represented as lm lp 4 soils with the low mobility and high permeability represented as lm hp based on this classification fig 7 shows that the lowest and highest pfos leaching occurred respectively in lm lp and hm hp groups with significantly different average annual rates p value 0 05 with the kruskal wallis test 4 discussion 4 1 implication for planning and prioritizing remediation strategies this study provided preliminary insights into the spatiotemporal distribution and transport dynamics of pfos at the watershed scale focusing on the contributions from different land uses and sources subject to the limitations of the data and methods used the results highlighted the significant role of surface runoff in pfos transport with urban areas and ppc sites as significant contributors in this study area urban land use contributed 52 2 of the total pfos released through surface runoff table 5 with a median release rate of 6 mg ha year and a maximum rate of 80 mg ha year fig 4 these findings are supported by xiao et al 2012 who estimated an annual pfos transport of 3 2 kg via surface runoff from the minneapolis metropolitan area 680 km2 which experienced a similar annual rainfall compared to our case study moreover ppc sites accounted for 35 4 of the pfos released via surface runoff with a median release rate of 1621 mg ha year table 5 these findings are consistent with other studies that have reported higher pfos contributions from ppc sites dauchy et al 2019 the substantial contribution of pfos loads from urban and ppc sites with runoff along with variation in release due to environmental factors e g topography soil property underscores the necessity and effectiveness of implementing targeted mitigation strategies also as shown in table 5 most pfos mass leaching 93 of total with a median rate of 1034 mg ha year occurred in ppc sites to compare the leaching rates simulated in this study with those from previous research høisæter et al 2019 estimated pfos leaching rates between 20 ng l and 2200 ng l at an infiltration rate of 9 7 mm in soil with a maximum pfos concentration of 1000 ug l for comparison purposes the pfos leaching rates from høisæter et al 2019 can be converted to a range of 730 mg ha year to 77 745 mg ha day in this study the median leaching rate was 1034 mg ha year for the concentration range between 800 ug kg to 1200 ug kg and the maximum leaching rate was 73 000 mg ha year matching the minimum and maximum reported by høisæter et al 2019 additionally when comparing the simulated leaching with an actual pfas site in michigan in terms of mass discharge quinnan et al 2021 estimated the current annual leaching rate of an airport site approximately 1 ha at 400 mg ha year for the present pfos leaching and 83 585 mg ha year for the maximum historic pfos leaching the 400 mg ha year pfos leaching at the current rate aligns with the ppc sites simulated in this study which have less than 1000 ug kg pfos concentration in the unsaturated zone furthermore the pfos leaching at the maximum rate 83 586 mg ha year is consistent with the ppc sites simulated in this study with over 3000 ug kg pfos concentration in soil however it is important to emphasize that due to the modeling conceptualization at the watershed scale and initial pfas soil distribution in soil profiles the simulated leaching rates should be regarded as approximate values of the order of magnitude which are subject to initial assumptions and sites specific conditions nevertheless our simulation results showed a significant difference of at least two orders of magnitude between the average annual leaching from lm lp soils poor drainage with high organic carbon and hm hp soils well drained with low organic carbon fig 7 these findings are in line with richardson et al 2022 which demonstrated that pfas transport is primarily downward in well drained soils and more prone to runoff in poorly drained soils our results suggest that prioritizing remediation efforts based on soil properties could lead to more effective management of pfas contamination sediment transport was the notable pathway for pfos release particularly from biosolids sites in our study the modeling suggests that biosolids sites contributed 65 65 of the total pfos released through sediment transport with a median release rate of 43 73 mg ha year fig 4 although further research is required to investigate biosolids impact on surface water quality these results suggest considering a higher standard for management practices in biosolids sites in particular the significant role of slope length and degree in pfos transport with sediment suggests that erosion control measures e g vegetation cover and contour farming could help minimize pfos release from biosolids sites 4 2 limitations and further strategies for model development we recognize that this study has certain limitations the model calibration and parameter uncertainty analysis were based on observations with limited spatial and temporal scope to improve the model s accuracy we suggest incorporating more extensive datasets for calibration and validation including gw pfas data however obtaining pfas data at the watershed scale can be challenging due to privacy concerns for instance while pfas data have been collected in public drinking water supplies throughout michigan egle 2022e the coordinates of water boreholes were not disclosed therefore could not be incorporated into this study additionally the scarcity of data led to assumptions regarding the locations of ppc sites the application of biosolids and representative pfos concentrations which contribute to the model s epistemic uncertainties to address these uncertainties and further refine the model we recommend conducting a comprehensive sensitivity analysis in future research the model s performance in capturing spatiotemporal pfos variability despite the limitations demonstrated its potential for further development and application in pfas fate and transport studies especially in the following areas 1 even though pfos transport with the gw flow system might span decades gefell et al 2021 farhat et al 2022 incorporating pfos exchange between gw sw might enhance model accuracy at the watershed scale for example tokranov et al 2021b showed that pfas contamination in surface water bodies like lakes and rivers can impact a broad area when discharging downgradient to gw or river outlets influencing seasonal pfas concentrations in rivers therefore future studies might consider linking modflow rt3d with swat to address pfos exchange between gw and sw components and their influence on seasonal pfos transport 2 in this study we focused on the fate and transport of pfos as a proxy for understanding long chain pfas fate and transport meanwhile future studies can include short chain pfas compounds that are relatively mobile in the subsurface environment it is important to note that the developed model in this study is capable of stimulating both long and short chain pfas compounds 3 pfas compounds exhibit competition for adsorption at the air water interface also pfas precursors can influence the concentrations of terminal pfas compounds such as pfos silva et al 2021 therefore future studies should consider multi component mixtures in the unsaturated zone to enhance the overall predictive capabilities of the model 5 conclusions this study developed a novel distributed hydrogeochemical model for the first time to evaluate the fate and transport of pfos in a large watershed with diverse sources of pfas the results from the watershed scale analysis yielded practical and policy relevant findings which are as follows to significantly reduce pfos contamination from surface runoff it is crucial to implement stringent regulations and management practices targeting urban areas and ppc sites which collectively contribute to approximately 90 of the total pfos discharge ppc sites are also the primary source of pfas release via lateral flow and leaching accounting for more than 90 of the total pfos released in the watershed therefore prioritizing remediation efforts based on soil properties could result in more cost effective watershed management of pfas contamination in terms of sediment transport biosolids sites contribute the most pfos accounting for 66 of the total amount discharged therefore prioritizing erosion control measures in biosolids sites could contribute to further watershed scale pfos contamination reduction to optimize source identification and develop targeted management strategies it is essential to account for the influences of topography soil water retention and water solid adsorption factors in guiding policy and decision making processes related to pfos contamination mitigation finally we suggest collecting and incorporating larger monitoring information e g pfas gw concentrations and soil distribution especially at ppc sites to improve model accuracy the results can be further improved by executing a comprehensive sensitivity analysis in future research declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known
