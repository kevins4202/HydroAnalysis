4340,hydrological models have many parameters representing various hydrological processes these parameters are effective at different spatial and temporal resolution most of the parameters can be measured such as slope elevation area vegetation type etc but others cannot be estimated from the available data thus they remain unknown in a hydrological simulation local and global sensitivity analyses lsa and gsa respectively are therefore used to reduce the number of parameters that need to be equipped with input output data gsa also improves the efficiency of the model calibration and validation which in turn increases the reliability of the model in this paper we investigate into the effect of size of a catchment small medium and large time steps of simulation daily and monthly and the choice of gsa method in performing sensitivity analysis a soil and water assessment tool swat hydrologic model is developed for 10 subbasins of narmada river basin at daily and monthly temporal simulations from january 1991 to december 2000 the sensitivity of 29 input parameters have been analysed with two gsa methods the multilinear regression sa used by sequential uncertainty fitting algorithm sufi 2 in swat calibration and uncertainty procedure swat cup and the first order sensitivity indices driven by fourier amplitude sensitivity test fast our results show that a hydrological model set up with only sensitive parameters can also produce similar results as when all the parameters are considered we concluded that the selection of catchment size and simulation time step strongly influence the parameter sensitivity our results show that the sensitivity of some of the parameters like curve number for moisture condition cn2 mgt baseflow alpha factor for bank storage alpha bnk rte and lateral flow travel time lat ttime hru are independent of catchment size and simulation time step moreover baseflow alpha factor for the recession constant alpha bf gw manning s value for overland flow ov n hru and soil erodibility factor usle k sol are not sensitive for large and medium range watersheds but those are sensitive for small watershed at a monthly time step ground water delay gw delay gw average slope steepness hru slp hru and support practice p factor of usle soil equation usle p mgt are not sensitive for large watersheds but sensitive for small and medium range watersheds at a daily time step our results strongly recommends that a detailed parameter sensitivity analysis is an important step in setting up any hydrological model to reduce the number of parameters while addressing all relevant hydrological processes keywords parameter sensitivity analysis hydrological modelling swat sufi 2 algorithm catchment size narmada river basin 1 introduction the parameters of a hydrological model represent different hydrological processes in a basin in developing a hydrological model for a basin we need an optimum set of parameters to represent all relevant hydrological processes while avoiding over parametrization which is one of the main sources of errors in the simulated results sensitivity analysis approaches are used to reduce the number of parameters that need to be equipped with input output data guo and su 2019 kumar et al 2017 me et al 2015 sudheer et al 2011 van griensven et al 2006 the research questions related to parameter sensitivity in a hydrological model have been explored by many researchers since last several decades mccuen 1973 discussed the importance of parameter sensitivity analysis to reduce the number of parameters and avoid complexity in a hydrological model bahremand and smedt 2008 used wetspa hydrological model in the torysa river basin eastern slovakia to assess the sensitivity of the model parameter and concluded that only by using sensitive parameters one can produce accurate results da silva et al 2015 also demonstrated the use of parameter sensitivity analysis in a swat model to select a set of parameters for poxim river basin in northeastern brazil to identify a set of sensitive parameters in a hydrological model for a basin different sensitivity analysis techniques can be used broadly the sensitivity analysis techniques can be divided into two categories local sensitivity analysis lsa and global sensitivity analysis gsa local sensitivity analysis such as one variable at a time oat and differential analysis da methods are less reliable because lsa considers one parameter at one time and keep the other parameters as constant douglas smith et al 2020 murphy et al 2004 nossent and bauwens 2012 saltelli and annoni 2010 gsa is an advanced version of sensitivity analysis that overcomes the drawbacks of lsa regression analysis ra morris screening sobol s methods fourier amplitude sensitivity test fast and regional sensitivity analysis rsa are some of the examples of gsa bilotta et al 2012 gamerith et al 2013 guse et al 2014 himanshu et al 2017 norton 2015 van griensven et al 2008 lenhart et al 2002 compared two different sensitivity analysis methods to find out the sensitivity of different parameters of a swat hydrological model they concluded that both methods show the same result cibin et al 2010 used variance based sobol s sensitivity analysis with a swat hydrological model for parameters sensitivity analysis in st joseph river watershed and illinois river watershed they demonstrated that the sensitivity of paarameters also depend upon the climate of the study area further they found that the various flow regimes also affect the sensitivity of the model parameters yang 2011 examined five different sensitivity analysis methods on an environmental model and showed that the sobol s method of sensitivity analysis method is the robust there is another aspect to the research on the topic of parameter sensitivity which is related to time steps daily and monthly of simulation and size of the basin different parameters are effective at different time steps and for different sized basin most of the parameter like slope elevation area vegetation type etc can be estimated but some of the parameters are unknown the appropriate selection of a combination of parameters for different time steps and for different size of basins increases the complexity of the modelling sharma et al 1987 troch et al 2003 ye et al 2008 zhang et al 2012 hydrological features of a catchment such as imperviousness soil water property vegetation type and topographical features such as slope aspect elevation of the area have a wide range of possible values in a large basin on the other hand small basin subbasins are likely to have a similar type of hydrological and topographical features with less range of values baduna et al 2017 fang et al 2016 randhir and tsvetkova 2011 shriver and randhir 2006 zhang and montgomery 1994 it is a well known fact that hydrological variables such as rainfall runoff evaporation baseflow and groundwater recharge fluctuate over time and are constantly associated with their temporal fluctuations amenu et al 2005 godsey et al 2010 kirchner and neal 2013 pandey et al 1998 gond et al 2019 das et al 2016 to study the role of catchment size on the parameter sensitivity analysis the area of the basin can vary from a few square kilometers to the size of the continent gentine et al 2012 duan and mei 2014 argued that the practical behaviour of basins would differ significantly with the catchment size and many processes of the hydrological cycle vary with time hence it may not be recommended to use the same model parameters for simulation at different time steps and for different catchment size kumar and merwade 2009 pushpalatha et al 2011 region et al 2012 reusser et al 2011 veith et al 2010 thampi et al 2010 used catchments of two different sizes in chaliyar river basin in kerala india with the same land use soil type topography and management practices to demonstrate the effect of basin size on the sensitivity of parameters they found that the parameters related to curve number soil evaporation compensation factor available water holding capacity average slope length and baseflow alpha factor are the critical parameters tobin and bennett 2009 used three rainfall products over three different watersheds with a swat model to asses the sensitivity of parameters used in streamflow calculation muleta et al 2007 developed six diffent models to simulate streamflow and sediment transport in the big creek watershed with different numbers of subbasins and concluded that the streamflow simulation is comparatively less affected by the spatial distribution of subbasins than the sediment simulation based on the above literature review it is clear that there have been studies separately addressing three important aspects of the sensitivity analysis the effect of catchment size simulation time steps and the choice of gsa method however to the best of our knowledge an analysis explicitly looking at the effect of variation in watershed size simulation time step and gsa method is not available different hydrological processes may interact with each other by considering a combination of these three aspects in hydrological simulations therefore it is necessary that sensitivity analysis should be performed considering different spatial extent and simulation time steps to identify sensitive parameters in other words such analysis can provide guidance to the modellers to avoid omitting important parameters while reducing the complexity of the calibration process our aim in this study is to identify a set of parameters covering all the important hydrological processes when a particular combination of catchment size model time step and gsa method is used the specific objectives of this study are 1 to set up a swat hydrological model in small to large watersheds in order to analyse the effect of variation in catchment size on the sensitivity of model parameters 2 to set up swat hydrological models at daily and monthly time steps in small to large watersheds in order to analyse the effect of daily and monthly time step simulation on the sensitivity of model parameters 3 to apply two gsa techniques in objectives 1 and 2 and 4 to identify any notable variation where the sensitivity of model parameters is either independent or highly dependent on the catchment size and time step of simulation to achieve these objectives swat models are developed for 10 different sized watersheds of narmada river basin at daily and monthly time steps with two gsa techniques multiple regression method that is used by sequential uncertainty fitting algorithm sufi 2 and fourier amplitude sensitivity testing fast 2 study area our study area is upper and middle basin of narmada river in central india as shown in fig 1 narmada river is the largest west flowing non perennial rivers of india it originates from amarkantak plateau of maikala range in the shahdol district of madhya pradesh at an elevation of 1057 m above mean sea level the latitude and longitude of the origin of narmada river are 22 40 north and 81 45 east the total length of the river from amarkantak plateau to the arabian sea is 1312 km some of the main tributaries of narmada river are shakkar river ganjal river chhota tawa river hiran river jamtara river kolar river orsang river sher river and tawa river the narmada river basin covers the states of madhya pradesh maharashtra and gujarat with a total area of 98 796 km2 the whole basin is divided into three parts i e upper narmada basin from origin to the sandiya middle narmada basin from sandiya to sardarsarovar dam and lower narmada basin from sardar sarovar dam to arabian sea for the current study only the upper and middle narmada basin is considered the geographical extent of upper and middle basin of narmada is from 75 33 e to 81 45 e and from 21 9 n to 23 50 n as shown in fig 1 the basin is located on the deccan plateau and is bounded by the vindhyas from the north maikala range from the east satpura range from the south and arabian sea from the west the high elevated regions of the basin are well forested while the plains are large and fertile the elevation of the basins varies from 131 m to 1317 m the basin is largely plain and has the elevation less than 500 m from the mean sea level only some parts of upper narmada river have elevation more than 1000 m from the mean sea level the climate of the basin is humid tropical ranging from sub humid in the east to semi arid in the west most of the rainfall received in the basin is due to the southwest monsoon that usually starts in june and ends in september temperature varies from 80c to 14 0c in winter and 30 0c to 40 0c in summer to study the effect of catchment size on the sensitivity of parameters narmada river basin has been divided into ten subbasins as shown in fig 1 3 model and methods 3 1 soil and water assessment tool swat swat is a semi distributed ecohydrological model arnold et al 1998 gassman et al 2007 swat divides the watershed into subbasins based on the topography further each subbasin is partitioned into hydrologic response unit hru which is a unique combination of land use soil and slope guse et al 2014 for this study swat version 2012 with its arcswat interface was used to simulate daily and monthly streamflow swat uses a typical setup with two phases a rainfall runoff phase based on a water balance for each subbasin equation 1 is taken from niehoff et al 2002 and a routing phase connecting all subbasins to produce spatially explicit outputs at the subbasin outlet 1 s w t s w t δ t r day t q surf t e a t w seep t q gw t where sw t is the soil water content in mm on day t sw t δt is the soil water content in mm on day t δt rday qsurf ea wseep and qgw represent precipitation mm surface runoff mm evapotranspiration mm percolation mm and groundwater flow mm respectively equation 1 determines the change in the soil water content for each day based on a daily calculation of the hydrological processes in the hru each soil type is divided into different soil layers and the soil water content is calculated for each soil layer separately and subsequently summed 3 2 sequential uncertainty fitting algorithm sufi 2 sufi 2 is a combined optimization approach that uses a global search method and the latin hypercube sampling technique to examine the behaviour of objective function abbaspour et al 2004 abbaspour et al 2007 first it identifies the range of parameters and then latin hypercube sampling is performed to generate multiple sets of parameters according to their range swat is run on each parameter set and objective function is calculated the parameter range gets updated every iteration and tries to find the best range of parameters boundary conditions parameters model structures and measured data are the sources of uncertainty in the sufi 2 after avoiding 5 of poor simulation 95 prediction uncertainty 95ppu is calculated from the cumulative distribution of an output obtained through latin hypercube sampling the accuracy of model calibration and validation is determined by r factor and p factor p factor shows the observed data that is captured by 95ppu range and accounted for all the uncertainties associated with the swat model the value of p factor ranges from 1 to 0 a value 1 indicates that 100 of measured data comes under the 95 ppu low value of p factor represents high uncertainty in the output and low percentage of measured data captured by 95 ppu the r factor is the average thickness of the 95ppu band divided by the standard deviation of the measured data it describes the quality of the calibration the value of r factor also varies from 1 to 0 where a low value shows the less uncertainty in the output to get an optimum result p and r factors have to be balanced for using sufi 2 we assume a wide range of values for the parameters so that large amount of data can come under the 95ppu we then start reducing the range of parameters to decrease the 95ppu range two basic criteria have to be satisfied in sufi 2 i most of the observed data should be bracted by the 95ppu band p factor and ii the band width r factor of the 95ppu must be smaller these two criteria are problem dependent for instance when we have a high quality data we achieve high p factor and vice versa for the second criterion the width of the 95ppu should be smaller than the standard deviation of the measured data a balance between p factor and r factor ensures bracketing most of the observed data within the 95ppu band abbaspour et al 2015 the detailed description of sufi 2 is given in the swat cup manual https swat tamu edu media 114860 usermanual swatcup pdf 3 3 global sensitivity analysis methods for selecting the sensitive parameters to identify the most sensitive parameter and to select a set of sensitive parameters that cover most of the hydrological processes we selected two different gsa methods a multiple regression method that is used by sufi 2 and b fourier amplitude sensitivity testing fast method fast method was introduced by cukier et al 1978 it is widely used by the scientific community for sensitivity analysis in many research fields 3 3 1 multiple regression method the sensitivity of parameters in sufi 2 is estimated by solving multiple regressions which regresses the parameters produced by the latin hypercube against the value of the objective function multiple regression method is considered as 2 g α i 1 m β i b i where g is the objective function b is a parameter α is a regression constant β corresponds to the technical coefficient attached to the variable b and m is equal to the number of parameters the mean estimates the sensitivity of the changes in the objective function it is determined one by one modifying each of the parameters while keeping all other parameters fixed the higher value of absolute t stat and a lower value of p stat indicate that the parameter is more sensitive 3 3 2 fourier amplitude sensitivity testing fast method fast method cukier et al 1978 reusser et al 2011 is a variance decomposition method that decomposes the total variance of the model s output into contributions of variance due to single factor i e parameters and inputs the method is described below 3 v i n v i i n j i 1 n v ij i n j i 1 n k j 1 n v ijk v 12 n where v is the total variance of the model outputs i j andkare the parameters used andnis the number of parameters vi andvij represent the variance described by the parameteri first order variance and the variance that is described by parametersi second order variance andj respectively the high order variance represents thecovariance due to multiple parameters the ratio of the variance induced by a single parameter and total variance is the first order sensitivity index si 4 s i v i v 3 4 swat model input data swat model requires many input data including topography land use land cover soil meteorological data and streamflow data the details of data along with the source are listed in table 1 topography data was used to delineate subbasins within the watershed while the crop data layer was used to represent the land use land cover in the basin the harmonized world soil database hwsd was used to provide physical and chemical properties of soil in the watershed the meteorological data consisted of daily precipitation and daily minimum and maximum temperature ten years 1991 2000 of daily precipitation and temperature data were used to simulate the climate in the watershed for this study the remaining weather data including relative humidity solar radiation and wind speed were auto simulated by swat weather generator the daily and monthly streamflow data were collected from central water commission cwc 3 5 swat set up the swat watershed delineation resulted in 43 watersheds for narmada river basin there are 18 discharge locations as shown in fig 1 but we selected only 10 discharge locations for watershed delineation due to proper data availability and size of the watersheds for this study these 10 watersheds are classified into three groups based on the area small watershed middle range watershed and large watershed 1 dindori 2 manot 3 mohgaon 4 belkhedi 5 gaderwara and 6 patan watershed were classified as small watershed 7 barmanghat and 8 sandiya as middle range watershed and 9 handiya and 10 mandleshwar as large watershed watersheds used in this study have almost similar type of land use and soil type as shown in table 2 range brush rngb forest mixed frst and irrigated groundwater double crop ri05 are the major part of all watersheds that covers approximately 60 to 75 percent of the total landuse furthermore the slope is classified in five classes i e 0 5 5 10 10 15 15 20 and 20 for all the watersheds the soil and land use classification and percentage area covered by them are shown in table 2 the distribution of soil and land use type after reclassification is shown in fig 2 the model was simulated from 1986 to 2000 first five years of warm up period 1986 1996 was assigned in the model to initialize model parameters daily and monthly simulated streamflow output from the swat model were compared against the observation data the calibration and validation periods were from 1991 to 1997 and 1998 to 2000 respectively 3 6 selection of swat parameters swat model contains more than 210 hydrological parameters all of them may not significantly contribute to the output therefore it is important to identify the most sensitive input parameters and their ranges for streamflow simulation based on the available literature 29 parameters were selected for this study garg et al 2012 narsimlu et al 2015 schmalz and fohrer 2009 to cover various relevant hydrological processes in the narmada river basin see table 3 a core description of these parameters is presented in appendix 1 see neitsch et al 2011 for more details since the average minimum temperature in the study area is always more than 4 c any snow related parameter is not considered in this study 3 7 calibration validation the calibration and validation were conducted using swat calibration and uncertainty procedure swat cup to handle a large number of simulations for the global sensitivity process 2000 simulations were conducted to identify the most sensitive input parameters the sequential uncertainty fitting sufi 2 optimization algorithm with nash sutcliffe efficiency nse as objective function was used to obtain the prediction accuracy in the model nse can be defined as 5 n s e 1 i q m q s i 2 i q m i q m 2 where q s is simulated discharge q m is measured discharge and q m is average of measured discharge nse value more than 0 5 is acceptable for rainfall runoff modelling swat cup uses t stat high absolute values suggest more sensitivity and p value values close to zero suggest a high level of significance to identify the relative significance of the individual parameter khatun et al 2018 kumar et al 2017 visakh et al 2019 a p factor of 1 and r factor of 0 indicate the simulated and observed data are equal fig 3 represents the overall approach used for the model development and parameter sensitivity analysis first we setup a swat model for narmada river basin then swat cup with sufi 2 algorithm is used for calibrating the arc swat generated output for 10 subbasins with 29 parameters hereafter we will refer as sa 29 after reaching a desirable calibration result we perform a global sensitivity analysis to estimate the sensitivity of sa 29 parameters by using multilinear regression sensitivity analysis after ranking all parameters we select first 16 sensitive parameters will refer as sa 16 for the fourier amplitude sensitivity testing fast analysis it is worth pointing out that there are a number of assumptions made in this study we have highlighted the main assumptions here due to restriction of the number of simulation in sufi 2 we could include only 2000 simulation for sa 29 we used only one landuse map for the entire calibration and validation time period the climatic condition is assumed to be same for all the ten watersheds because they are part of a single river the parameters are based on the literature and we did not consider exhaustive list of potential parameters to reduce the initial uncertainty we did not consider the error propagation through the algorithm and structure used by swat and uncertainty in the input data rainfall and temperature 4 results 4 1 calibration and validation of swat model with 29 parameters swat cup analysis tool with sufi 2 algorithm is used for calibration and validation generally 60 to 70 of data from the available data set is used for calibration and rest of the data is used for validation for this study daily and monthly average discharge data from 1stjanuary 1991 to 31st december 2000 is analysed fig 4 a j and 5 a j show the simulated and observed discharge values associated with 10 distinct subbasins i e belkhedi 1 gaderwara 2 patan 3 dindori 4 manot 5 mohagano 6 barman ghat 7 sandiya 8 handiya 9 and mandleshwar 10 at daily and monthly time steps fig 4 a to j show the hydrograph from january 1991 to december 2000 calibration period january 1991 to december 1997 and validation period january 1998 to december 2000 all 10 watersheds were considered to study the effect of catchment size on the simulation accuracy at a daily time step different watersheds are in the descending order from mandleshwar 10 watershed with entire study area with total area of 72173 km2 to belkhedi 1 watershed with total area of 1477 km2 with nse as the objective function by visual analysis of fig 4 a to j it is evident that the simulation with nse as an objective function produces reasonably good results except some of the high peaks simulated high and low flows are in good match with the observed flows since the patterns of simulated flow rise and fall of flow values duration of peak and low flows and overall variation in the time series are matching with the observed flows and all the statistical criteria such as nse show acceptable values we accepted the calibration results if we try to match all the peak flows in the simulation by modifying some of the parameters the baseflow will be altered the reasons for deviation in simulated and observed flow values could be many such as errors in the input data limitation of model structure limitation in the governing equations solved by swat error in neglecting the other parameters in the calibration etc to study the effect of daily and monthly time steps on the simulation accuracy the simulated and observed hydrograph associated with all ten watersheds at monthly time steps with nse objective functions are plotted in fig 5 a to j visual inspection of fig 5 a to j show that the simulation outputs are similar to the observed flows overall the variation between simulated and observed values at a daily time step is found to be more especially for the large catchments i e mandleshwar 10 handiya 9 and sandiya 8 as shown in fig 4 a to c the variation is less for monthly time step fig 5 a to j table 4 represents the model performance criteria i e p factor r factor and nse for different watersheds i e belkhedi 1 gaderwara 2 patan 3 dindori 4 manot 5 mohagano 6 barman ghat 7 sandiya 8 handiya 9 and mandleshwar 10 with sa 29 and sa 16 as shown in table 4 p factor varies from 0 72 to 0 95 and 0 55 to 0 95 for daily and monthly simulations respectively for the calibration period average p value for daily and monthly simulations is 0 89 and 0 82 respectively table 4 shows that for daily simulation for sa 29 nse varies from 0 58 to 0 75 with an average value of 0 67 for monthly simulation nse varies from 0 89 to 0 97 and the average value is 0 93 when we use only sa 16 nse values of the model performance of the watersheds don t deviate from those obtained from model with sa 29 sometimes nse value of the model with sa 16 is better than that of sa 29 for instance dindori 4 manot 5 and barman ghat 7 at monthly time step show high nse value with the set of sa 16 overall from table 4 we can say that the sa 16 also produce the accurate result compared to simulations with sa 29 the reduction of parameters is very helpful to reduce the complexity of the model 4 2 sensitivity analysis results 4 2 1 effect of catchment size on the sensitivity of parameters on daily simulation to study the variation in parameter sensitivity with catchment size the calibration was performed using 10 different sized watersheds fig 6 shows the parameter sensitivity results based on p value with sa 29 fig 6 a and fast indices with sa 16 fig 6 b for 10 different watersheds under three categories i e small watershed belkhedi 1 gaderwara 2 patan 3 dindori 4 manot 5 and mohagano 6 medium range watershed barman ghat 7 and sandiya 8 and large watershed handiya 9 and mandleshwar 10 in fig 6 parameters used for this study are shown on the y axis and the watersheds are listed on the x axis the sequence of these watersheds is in the increasing order of their area fast sensitivity analysis is performed on 16 most sensitive parameters sa 16 which were obtained from sufi 2 analysis it is worth repeating here that sufi 2 analysis was performed using 29 parameters selected from the literature sa 29 parameters which are not included in sa 16 for a watershed are represented by nan value shown in black colour in fig 6 b it is evident from the figures that the sensitivity of parameters for daily simulations depend upon the catchment size baseflow alpha factor for bank storage alpha bnk rte hydraulic conductivity in main channel ch k2 rte manning s value for main channel ch n2 rte average width of main channel bank ch w2 rte curve number cn2 hru threshold depth of water in shallow aquifer to return gwqmn gw and soil bulk density sol bd sol are the most sensitive parameters for all the watersheds our results indicate that the sensitivity of these parameters does not depend upon the catchment size at a daily simulation time step on the other hand following parameters are not sensitive in any watershed baseflow alpha factor for recession constant alpha bf gw maximum canopy storage canmax hru initial ground water height gwht gw lateral flow time lat ttime hru and threshold depth for exchange with deep aquifer revapmn gw we can conclude that these parameters can be ignored and thus the number of parameters can be minimized in daily simulations some of the parameters are sensitive only for a range of watershed size for instance average slope of tributary channel ch s1 sub soil bulk density sol bd sol and soil erodibilty factor usle k sol are sensitive for large watershed and middle range watershed sandiya 8 watershed ground water delay gw delay gw average slope steepness hru slp hru and support practice p factor of usle soil equation usle p mgt are not sensitive for large watersheds but sensitive for small and middle range watersheds 4 2 2 effect of catchment size on the sensitivity of parameters on monthly simulation fig 7 a and b show the sensitivity of sa 29 and sa 16 of ten distinct watersheds when monthly simulations were performed fig 7 shows that watershed size affects the parameter sensitivity overall baseflow alpha factor for bank storage alpha bnk rte curve number cn2 mgt groundwater delay gw delay gw ground water revap factor gw revap gw and available soil water sol awc sol are highly sensitive for almost all the watersheds at monthly time step which implies that these parameters are significant irrespective of selected catchment size in the monthly simulation furthermore average slope of tributary channels ch s1 sub lateral flow travel time lat ttime hru and support practice p factor of usle soil equation usle p mgt are least sensitive for almost all the watersheds at monthly simulation time step which implies that these parameters are not significant and can be ignored to avoid over parameterization in the monthly simulation some parameters are highly effective for some watersheds based on size for example baseflow alpha factor for recession constant alpha bf gw manning s value for overland flow ov n hru and soil erodibility factor usle k sol are sensitive for small watershed but not at all sensitive for large and medium range watersheds initial ground water height gwht gw and average slope length slsubbsn hru are sensitive in large watersheds but not sensitive in small watersheds 4 2 3 effect of daily and monthly simulations on the sensitivity of parameters figs 6 and 7 also show that the sensitivity of parameters depends on the time step of the simulation daily and monthly baseflow alpha factor for bank storage alpha bnk rte and curve number cn2 hru are the sensitive parameters and soil evaporation compensation factor esco hru soil erodibilty factor usle k sol and surface runoff lag time surlag bsn are the least sensitive parameters in both daily and monthly simulations ground water delay gw delay gw ground water revap factor gw revap gw and available soil water sol awc sol are sensitive in monhly simulation manning s value for main channel ch n2 rte average width of main channel bank ch w2 rte threshold depth of water in shallow aquifer to return gwqmn gw and soil bulk density sol bd sol are sensitive at daily simulation time step 5 discussion in this section we try to infer common points from the results presented in the previous section we now categorize the paperameters according to their association with a hydrological process such as groundwater surface runoff evapotranspiration etc further we attempt to explain the possible reasons behind a set of parameters being highly least sensitive to variation in the watershed size and simulation time step 5 1 sensitivity of groundwater related parameters the multilinear regression sensitivity analysis and the first order sensitivity indices derived from fast analysis for groundwater related parametres are shown in fig 8 a d at daily and monthly simulation time steps for sa 29 and sa 16 respectively it is worth pointing here that fig 8 is the subplot of figs 6 and 7 alpha bnk rte regulates the outflow of the ground soil water from the bank to the river it also directly contributes in the main channel flow as bank storage and groundwater thus the sensitivity of alpha bnk rte is more than other groundwater parameters for all watershedes and for both monthly and daily simulations similar results were also reported by nilawar and waikar 2018 and narsimlu et al 2015 in their studies for large watershedes at monthly time step initial groundwater height gwht gw shows high sensitivity in case of analysis with sufi 2 method with all 29 parameters but least sensitivity when we use only 16 parameters in the fast method this indicates that the sensitivity of gwht gw is affected by the presence of other ground water related parameters which we don t include in the fast method alpha bf gw regulates the outflow of the groundwater to the river the baseflow alpha factor is a function of the watershed topography drainage pattern and soil properties swat has the limitations in rigorously simulating the groundwater flow the interaction between groundwater flow and baseflow is high for smaller and mountainous region thus the small watersheds i e patan 3 dindori 4 and manot 5 show high sensitivity at both daily and monthly simulation time steps our results show that the sensitivity of alpha bf gw is more than the sensitivity of other groundwater parameters dhami et al 2018 also reported in their study that alpha bf gw is sensitive parameter in karnali river basin in a mountainous region of nepal our study area is also surrounded by different mountainous ranges see section 2 about the details of our study area groundwater starts transporting from shallow aquifer to river channel when the depth of water in the aquifer is equal or greater than the gwqmn perhaps this is one of the reasons why its sensitivity is independent of the size of the watershed in the daily simulations in monthly simulations change in the water level in the shallow aquifer is dependent on the area of the watershed therefore gwqmn gw is more sensitive in small watersheds but less sensitive in large watersheds our result is supported by the findings of guse et al 2014 who reported that the parameter gwqmn gw was highly sensitive in treene lowland catchment in northern germany ground water delay gw delay gw is the time required for water to reach the shallow aquifer from root zone it mainly depends on the soil property and height of the water table therefore its sensitivity is independent of the watershed size and simulation time steps which is also confirmed by other studies such as keery et al 2007 tolley et al 2019 and borgonovo et al 2017 5 2 sensitivity of runoff related parameters the sensitivity of runoff related parameters is shown in fig 9 a d the arrangement of the figure is similar to that of fig 8 the parameter cn2 mgt curve number for moisture condition has the primary influence on the amount of runoff generated from a hydrologic response unit hence a relatively greater sensitivity index for cn2 mgt can be expected for most of the watersheds the value of curve number depends on landuse and soil type it is not affected by the size of the watershed and simulation time step sharma et al 2019 mccuen 1973 large subbasins have more tributaries so the average slope of tributaries channel ch s1 sub is sensitive parameter for large subbasins at a daily time step emery et al 2016 pontes et al 2016 the contribution of the small tributaries varies frequently especially in a rainy day which could be the reason why the parameter is sensitive at a daily time step since the accumulated streamflow at monthly time step is more than that at a daily time step the parameter is not sensitive in case of monthly simulations the surface runoff lag time surlag bsn is sensitive when the time of concentration is high this parameter does not show significant sensitivity in daily simulations however in monthly simulations it is sensitive for almost all the watersheds for runoff the lag time is in days so in monthly simulations it is more uncertain compare to daily simulations rahman et al 2013 uniyal et al 2015 the value of saturated hydraulic conductivity sol k sol beven and germann 2013 pue et al 2019 depends on various factors like soil moisture soil hydro group etc therefore the sensitivity of these two parameters surlag bsn and sol k sol in case of sa 29 with more parameters is more as compared to sa 16 simulation 5 3 sensitivity of soilwater related parameters the sensitivity of soilwater related parameters is shown in fig 10 a to d moist bulk density sol bd sol and lateral flow from the soil lat ttime hru are directly affected by availabe water capacity of the soil sol awc sol the available soil water capacity sol awc is the amount of water that is available for plant uptake when the soil is at field capacity the available water capacity varies in three different soil layers since there is no role of the catchment size in transferring water from lower level of soil to the root zone our results show that the sensitivity of sol awc sol does not depend on the size of the watershed this parameter depends on the soil property like permeability of soil capillaries and macropores which are highly sensitive and changes frequently when the available water capacity of soil decreases the effect of evaporation decreases and the amount of subsurface flow increases within the soil profile the value of sol awc sol is more in dry months than in wet months the sensitivity of sol awc sol is more in daily simulations than in monthly simulations the other related studies also indicate that the available water capacity of soil is sensitive parameter in their study areas bosch et al 2004 ghasemizade et al 2017 zhang et al 2013 the amount of lateral flow discharged to the river on a particular day is controlled by lat ttime in our study area all the watersheds have such a shape that the lateral flow discharge to the river is small and almost constant in all the watersheds thus lat ttime is not sensitive in any watershed in daily and monthly simulations 5 4 sensitivity of evapotranspiration related parameters fig 11 a d summarizes the sensitivity of evapotranspiration related parametres soil water availability for evaporation is represented by esco hru the effect of soil capillary crust and cracking on soil is reflected by this parameter since the depth distribution of the water content in the layers is modified by esco hru it is sensitive for the clay loom soil clay loom soil is known to have high response towards the transfer of water from the soil in the form of evaporation guse et al 2014 schaake et al 1996 at a daily time step there is less time for water to evapotranspirate therefore it can be concluded that the evapotranspiration parameters are more sensitive at monthly time step but less sensitive at daily time step our results show that esco hru is sensitive in medium sized watersheds which is also reported by other researchers such as suryavanshi et al 2017 and spruill and taraba 2000 another parameter epco hru represent plant uptake compensation factor which is sensitive in small watershedes where there is less irrigation area watershed patan 3 dindori 4 and manot 5 maximum canopy storage canmx hru is not sensitive for any watershed in daily simulations 5 5 sensitivity of routing related parameters the sensitivity of routing related parameters are shown in fig 12 a d manning s cofficient of the main channel ch n2 rte is the key parameter that controls the flow in the river since this is the property of the channel itself it does not depend on the size of the watershed our results don t show any change in the sensitivity of ch n2 rte with respect to catchment size however it is sensitive at both monthly and daily time steps addressing daily changes in the channel s property is more challenging than monthly changes therefore all the parameters related to routing shows more sensitivity at daily time step compared to monthly time step shivhare et al 2018 himanshu et al 2017 effective hydraulic conductivity in the main channel ch k2 rte shows the movement of water from streambed to subsurface for any watershed therefore the sensitivity of ch k2 rte is independent of watershed size the average slope ch s2 rte and average top width ch w2 rte of the main channel are more sensitive when the sum of the length of main channel is more than the sum of the length of tributaries heuvelmans et al 2006 5 6 sensitivity of topographic related parameters the sensitivity of topographic related parameters is shown in fig 13 a d from the figure it is clear that the average slope steepness hru slp hru decreases with the increase in watershed size it could be attributed to fact that if the slope is steeper naturally less time is required for runoff to percolate from surface to subsurface also the steepness of the slope helps runoff water to reach the stream river therefore in small watersheds hru slp hru is showing high sensitivity average slope length of the subbasin slsubbsn hru directly affects the average streamflow amount and positively correlate with the streamflow as the size of watershed increases the slope length also increases we noticed that this parameter is sensitive for large watershed but not sensitive for small watershed a study on the tons river basin in india by kumar et al 2017 reported that slsubbsn hru is sensitive parameter for small sized watersheds the slope of the watershed for lateral flow in subsurface is shown by the parameter slsoil hru our results show that slsoil hru is sensitive at monthly time step when the time of flow is more in large watersheds our results are supported by the findings of kim and mohanty 2015 who reported that slsoil hru is sensitive parameter for large watersheds 5 7 sensitivity of erosion related parameters the sensitivity of erosion related parameters is shown in fig 14 a d the erodibility factor usle k sol depends on the property of the soil large watersheds have more variation in soil than the same in a small watershed the small watershed may have only one or two soil type which increases the sensitivity of usle k sol for large watershed the sensitivity of usle k sol is more at a daily time step compared to simulations with monthly time step in both sa 29 and sa 16 arabi et al 2006 misra and rose 1996 small watersheds have less varying slope than the large watersheds which need more support practice to control the soil loss therefore soil support practice factor usle p sol is more sensitive for small watersheds than for large watersheds usle p mgt is less sensitive as compared to usle k sol when we use less number of parameters sa 16 simulations than the simulations with more numbers of parameters sa 29 6 summary and conclusions in this paper we analysed the effect of catchment size simulation time steps and the type of global sensitivity analysis on the parameter sensitivity we developed swat hydrological model for ten watersheds in narmada river basin we conducted two types of global sensitivity analysis sa 29 and sa 16 i with 29 parameters using sufi 2 and ii with 16 most sensitive parameters using fast the summary of our results is presented in table 5 we have clearly indicated which parameters are sensitive in small and large watersheds at which simulation time step daily or monthly from the table we can easily identify the parameters which are not affected by the variation in both simulation time step and size of the watersheds the conclusions of this study are as follows sa 16 is efficient and reduces the complexity of semi distributed hydrological models for any watershed simulations with sa 16 produced better results than sa 29 in some watersheds dindori 4 manot 5 and barman ghat 7 at monthly time steps with sa 16 shows higher nse than in case of sa 29 our results show that parameter sensitivity depends heavily upon the selection of catchment size and time step used in the simulation however there are several parameters with their sensitivity independent of above mentioned selections for instance the curve number cn2 mgt and baseflow alpha factor for bank storage alpha bnk rte are highly sensitive for almost all the catchment size and time steps while lateral flow travel time lat ttime hru is least sensitive for almost all the catchment size and time steps these observations imply that many parameters may not be significant and can be ignored to avoid over parameterization of the model the sensitivity of several parameters significantly depends on catchment size for instance alpha bf gw ov n hru and usle k sol are sensitive for small watershed but not at all sensitive for large and medium sized watersheds gwht gw and slsubbsn hru are sensitive for large watershed but not sensitive for small watersheds at monthly time step sensitive parameters at daily time step for large and medium range watershed are ch s1 sub sol bd sol and usle k sol on the other hand gw delay gw hru slp and usle p mgt are not sensitive for large watershed but sensitive for other watersheds the sensitivity of several parameters primarily depends on time step used in the simulation for instance gw delay gw gw revap gw and sol awc sol are sensitive on monthly time step and ch k2 rte ch n2 rte ch w2 rte gwqmn gw and sol bd sol are sensitive at daily time step evapotranspiration parameters are less sensitive at monthly and daily time steps routing related parameters are also less sensitive when we reduce the number of parameters sa 16 to avoid complexity and uncertainty in any hydrological model reducing the number of parameters is important at the same time it is also necessary to select a parameter set that accounts for all the hydrological process our results indicate that depending on the size of the catchment and simulation time step suitable recommendations can be provided to the modeler for instance based on our results we can pick gw delay gw alpha bnk rte from ground water related parameters cn2 mgt from runoff related parameter sol awc sol from soil water related parameter epco hru from evapotranspiration related parameter ch n2 rte from routing related parameters and hru slp hru from topographic related parameters and that would hopefully be sufficient for the simulation of a small sized watershed erosion related parameters need not be considered based on our results we recommend that it is necessary to perform such analysis before selecting a set of parameters in a semi distributed hydrological model the encouraging results for the parameter sensitivity in swat hydrological model in this study seem to indicate that the approach has the potential to address the problems related to over parameterization hydrological modelling accuracy and spatio temporal variation of hydrological processes credit authorship contribution statement ankit singh data curation formal analysis methodology validation visualization writing original draft sanjeev

their valuable comments which improved the quality of the manuscript significantly appendix 1 descriptions of the parameters used in the sensivity analysis neitsch et al 2011 the surface runoff is characterized by the curve number cn2 mgt time of concentration surlag bsn lat ttime hru and slope hru slp hru slsubbsn hru the curve number cn2 mgt for distinct slopes is obtained from the average slope steepness parameter hru slp hru a reduction of the curve number results in a lower surface runoff which implies lower streamflow peak in the river the time of concentration relies on the timing parameters i e surlag bsn and lat ttime hru a time of concentration of more than 1 day implies that the cumulative amount of surface runoff does not reach the river on a given day average slope length slsubbsn hru and manning s roughness coefficient for the subbasin ov n hru contribute in the computation of the time of concentration of channel flow and average velocity the available soil water capacity sol awc sol moist bulk density sol bd sol and saturated hydraulic conductivity sol k sol are selected as the soil parameters sol awc sol is the estimation of the field capacity for each soil layer sol bd sol defines the relative amount of pore space and soil matrix travel time of water for percolation is calculated bysol k sol these soil water parameters regulate the percolation into the groundwater and the frequency of surface and lateral flows along with evaporation the evapotranspiration is represented by maximum canopy storage canmx hru soil evaporation compensation factor esco hru and plant uptake compensation factor epco hru canmx hru depicts the water capacity of the canopy storage and depends on the leaf area index of the specific crop precipitation only enters the soil once the canopy storage is completely filled once the canopy storage is empty soil water is utilized for the evaporation characterized by the depth of soil evaporation esco hru esco hru determines the contribution of each soil layer to the evaporation furthermore epco hru is the compensation factor for the water uptake by the plants as epco hru increases the water uptake from the lower zone of the soil also increases processes involving groundwater are represented by groundwater time delay gw delay gw baseflow recession constant alpha bf gw aquifer fraction coefficient rchrg dp gw groundwater revap coefficient gw revap gw threshold depth of water in the shallow aquifer for revap to occur revapmn gw initial groundwater height gwhtgw threshold depth of water in the shallow aquifer required for return flow to occur gwqmn gw and initial depth of water in shallow aquifer deepst gw the groundwater time delay gw delay gw and baseflow recession constant alpha bf gw are related to the timing of the process the gw delay gw measured in days regulates the time delay for recharging the shallow aquifer and increase in this delay factor leads to a slower recharging process the alpha bf gw delays the outflow of groundwater and estimates the time required by water to flow from groundwater to the river reach the aquifer fraction coefficient rchrg dp gw determines the splitting between deep and shallow aquifers the revap is defined as the movement of water from the lower soil surface to the overlying unsaturated layer for evapotranspiration which is done by deep root of plant the revap parameters majorly depend upon landuse and landcover the movement of water from shallow aquifer to evapotranspiration depends upon gw revap gw and revapmn gw parameters gwqmn gw is the threshold water level of shallow aquifer required for moving the water from the aquifer to the upper soil layer decreasing the value of gw revap gw and gwqmn gw reduces evapotranspiration and increases the base flow routing related parameter are represented by average width of main channel ch w2 rte channel slope ch s2 rte manning s value for the main channel ch n2 rte effective hydraulic conductivity in main channel ch k2 rte and base flow recession constant for bank storage alpha bnk rte discharge in the channel is calculated by cross sectional area of the channel channel slope ch s2 rte average width of the channel ch w2 rte and the flow velocity which is dependent upon ch n2 rte furthermore the transmission loss from channel is directly related to the hydraulic conductivity of the channel alluvium ch k2 rte alpha bnk rte measures the volume of water added to the channel from the bank storage usle k sol and usle p mgt are related to erosion usle p mgt is defined as the ratio of soil loss associated with a specific support practice to the corresponding losses with the varying slope culture whereas usle k sol is defined as the soil erodibility factor 
4340,hydrological models have many parameters representing various hydrological processes these parameters are effective at different spatial and temporal resolution most of the parameters can be measured such as slope elevation area vegetation type etc but others cannot be estimated from the available data thus they remain unknown in a hydrological simulation local and global sensitivity analyses lsa and gsa respectively are therefore used to reduce the number of parameters that need to be equipped with input output data gsa also improves the efficiency of the model calibration and validation which in turn increases the reliability of the model in this paper we investigate into the effect of size of a catchment small medium and large time steps of simulation daily and monthly and the choice of gsa method in performing sensitivity analysis a soil and water assessment tool swat hydrologic model is developed for 10 subbasins of narmada river basin at daily and monthly temporal simulations from january 1991 to december 2000 the sensitivity of 29 input parameters have been analysed with two gsa methods the multilinear regression sa used by sequential uncertainty fitting algorithm sufi 2 in swat calibration and uncertainty procedure swat cup and the first order sensitivity indices driven by fourier amplitude sensitivity test fast our results show that a hydrological model set up with only sensitive parameters can also produce similar results as when all the parameters are considered we concluded that the selection of catchment size and simulation time step strongly influence the parameter sensitivity our results show that the sensitivity of some of the parameters like curve number for moisture condition cn2 mgt baseflow alpha factor for bank storage alpha bnk rte and lateral flow travel time lat ttime hru are independent of catchment size and simulation time step moreover baseflow alpha factor for the recession constant alpha bf gw manning s value for overland flow ov n hru and soil erodibility factor usle k sol are not sensitive for large and medium range watersheds but those are sensitive for small watershed at a monthly time step ground water delay gw delay gw average slope steepness hru slp hru and support practice p factor of usle soil equation usle p mgt are not sensitive for large watersheds but sensitive for small and medium range watersheds at a daily time step our results strongly recommends that a detailed parameter sensitivity analysis is an important step in setting up any hydrological model to reduce the number of parameters while addressing all relevant hydrological processes keywords parameter sensitivity analysis hydrological modelling swat sufi 2 algorithm catchment size narmada river basin 1 introduction the parameters of a hydrological model represent different hydrological processes in a basin in developing a hydrological model for a basin we need an optimum set of parameters to represent all relevant hydrological processes while avoiding over parametrization which is one of the main sources of errors in the simulated results sensitivity analysis approaches are used to reduce the number of parameters that need to be equipped with input output data guo and su 2019 kumar et al 2017 me et al 2015 sudheer et al 2011 van griensven et al 2006 the research questions related to parameter sensitivity in a hydrological model have been explored by many researchers since last several decades mccuen 1973 discussed the importance of parameter sensitivity analysis to reduce the number of parameters and avoid complexity in a hydrological model bahremand and smedt 2008 used wetspa hydrological model in the torysa river basin eastern slovakia to assess the sensitivity of the model parameter and concluded that only by using sensitive parameters one can produce accurate results da silva et al 2015 also demonstrated the use of parameter sensitivity analysis in a swat model to select a set of parameters for poxim river basin in northeastern brazil to identify a set of sensitive parameters in a hydrological model for a basin different sensitivity analysis techniques can be used broadly the sensitivity analysis techniques can be divided into two categories local sensitivity analysis lsa and global sensitivity analysis gsa local sensitivity analysis such as one variable at a time oat and differential analysis da methods are less reliable because lsa considers one parameter at one time and keep the other parameters as constant douglas smith et al 2020 murphy et al 2004 nossent and bauwens 2012 saltelli and annoni 2010 gsa is an advanced version of sensitivity analysis that overcomes the drawbacks of lsa regression analysis ra morris screening sobol s methods fourier amplitude sensitivity test fast and regional sensitivity analysis rsa are some of the examples of gsa bilotta et al 2012 gamerith et al 2013 guse et al 2014 himanshu et al 2017 norton 2015 van griensven et al 2008 lenhart et al 2002 compared two different sensitivity analysis methods to find out the sensitivity of different parameters of a swat hydrological model they concluded that both methods show the same result cibin et al 2010 used variance based sobol s sensitivity analysis with a swat hydrological model for parameters sensitivity analysis in st joseph river watershed and illinois river watershed they demonstrated that the sensitivity of paarameters also depend upon the climate of the study area further they found that the various flow regimes also affect the sensitivity of the model parameters yang 2011 examined five different sensitivity analysis methods on an environmental model and showed that the sobol s method of sensitivity analysis method is the robust there is another aspect to the research on the topic of parameter sensitivity which is related to time steps daily and monthly of simulation and size of the basin different parameters are effective at different time steps and for different sized basin most of the parameter like slope elevation area vegetation type etc can be estimated but some of the parameters are unknown the appropriate selection of a combination of parameters for different time steps and for different size of basins increases the complexity of the modelling sharma et al 1987 troch et al 2003 ye et al 2008 zhang et al 2012 hydrological features of a catchment such as imperviousness soil water property vegetation type and topographical features such as slope aspect elevation of the area have a wide range of possible values in a large basin on the other hand small basin subbasins are likely to have a similar type of hydrological and topographical features with less range of values baduna et al 2017 fang et al 2016 randhir and tsvetkova 2011 shriver and randhir 2006 zhang and montgomery 1994 it is a well known fact that hydrological variables such as rainfall runoff evaporation baseflow and groundwater recharge fluctuate over time and are constantly associated with their temporal fluctuations amenu et al 2005 godsey et al 2010 kirchner and neal 2013 pandey et al 1998 gond et al 2019 das et al 2016 to study the role of catchment size on the parameter sensitivity analysis the area of the basin can vary from a few square kilometers to the size of the continent gentine et al 2012 duan and mei 2014 argued that the practical behaviour of basins would differ significantly with the catchment size and many processes of the hydrological cycle vary with time hence it may not be recommended to use the same model parameters for simulation at different time steps and for different catchment size kumar and merwade 2009 pushpalatha et al 2011 region et al 2012 reusser et al 2011 veith et al 2010 thampi et al 2010 used catchments of two different sizes in chaliyar river basin in kerala india with the same land use soil type topography and management practices to demonstrate the effect of basin size on the sensitivity of parameters they found that the parameters related to curve number soil evaporation compensation factor available water holding capacity average slope length and baseflow alpha factor are the critical parameters tobin and bennett 2009 used three rainfall products over three different watersheds with a swat model to asses the sensitivity of parameters used in streamflow calculation muleta et al 2007 developed six diffent models to simulate streamflow and sediment transport in the big creek watershed with different numbers of subbasins and concluded that the streamflow simulation is comparatively less affected by the spatial distribution of subbasins than the sediment simulation based on the above literature review it is clear that there have been studies separately addressing three important aspects of the sensitivity analysis the effect of catchment size simulation time steps and the choice of gsa method however to the best of our knowledge an analysis explicitly looking at the effect of variation in watershed size simulation time step and gsa method is not available different hydrological processes may interact with each other by considering a combination of these three aspects in hydrological simulations therefore it is necessary that sensitivity analysis should be performed considering different spatial extent and simulation time steps to identify sensitive parameters in other words such analysis can provide guidance to the modellers to avoid omitting important parameters while reducing the complexity of the calibration process our aim in this study is to identify a set of parameters covering all the important hydrological processes when a particular combination of catchment size model time step and gsa method is used the specific objectives of this study are 1 to set up a swat hydrological model in small to large watersheds in order to analyse the effect of variation in catchment size on the sensitivity of model parameters 2 to set up swat hydrological models at daily and monthly time steps in small to large watersheds in order to analyse the effect of daily and monthly time step simulation on the sensitivity of model parameters 3 to apply two gsa techniques in objectives 1 and 2 and 4 to identify any notable variation where the sensitivity of model parameters is either independent or highly dependent on the catchment size and time step of simulation to achieve these objectives swat models are developed for 10 different sized watersheds of narmada river basin at daily and monthly time steps with two gsa techniques multiple regression method that is used by sequential uncertainty fitting algorithm sufi 2 and fourier amplitude sensitivity testing fast 2 study area our study area is upper and middle basin of narmada river in central india as shown in fig 1 narmada river is the largest west flowing non perennial rivers of india it originates from amarkantak plateau of maikala range in the shahdol district of madhya pradesh at an elevation of 1057 m above mean sea level the latitude and longitude of the origin of narmada river are 22 40 north and 81 45 east the total length of the river from amarkantak plateau to the arabian sea is 1312 km some of the main tributaries of narmada river are shakkar river ganjal river chhota tawa river hiran river jamtara river kolar river orsang river sher river and tawa river the narmada river basin covers the states of madhya pradesh maharashtra and gujarat with a total area of 98 796 km2 the whole basin is divided into three parts i e upper narmada basin from origin to the sandiya middle narmada basin from sandiya to sardarsarovar dam and lower narmada basin from sardar sarovar dam to arabian sea for the current study only the upper and middle narmada basin is considered the geographical extent of upper and middle basin of narmada is from 75 33 e to 81 45 e and from 21 9 n to 23 50 n as shown in fig 1 the basin is located on the deccan plateau and is bounded by the vindhyas from the north maikala range from the east satpura range from the south and arabian sea from the west the high elevated regions of the basin are well forested while the plains are large and fertile the elevation of the basins varies from 131 m to 1317 m the basin is largely plain and has the elevation less than 500 m from the mean sea level only some parts of upper narmada river have elevation more than 1000 m from the mean sea level the climate of the basin is humid tropical ranging from sub humid in the east to semi arid in the west most of the rainfall received in the basin is due to the southwest monsoon that usually starts in june and ends in september temperature varies from 80c to 14 0c in winter and 30 0c to 40 0c in summer to study the effect of catchment size on the sensitivity of parameters narmada river basin has been divided into ten subbasins as shown in fig 1 3 model and methods 3 1 soil and water assessment tool swat swat is a semi distributed ecohydrological model arnold et al 1998 gassman et al 2007 swat divides the watershed into subbasins based on the topography further each subbasin is partitioned into hydrologic response unit hru which is a unique combination of land use soil and slope guse et al 2014 for this study swat version 2012 with its arcswat interface was used to simulate daily and monthly streamflow swat uses a typical setup with two phases a rainfall runoff phase based on a water balance for each subbasin equation 1 is taken from niehoff et al 2002 and a routing phase connecting all subbasins to produce spatially explicit outputs at the subbasin outlet 1 s w t s w t δ t r day t q surf t e a t w seep t q gw t where sw t is the soil water content in mm on day t sw t δt is the soil water content in mm on day t δt rday qsurf ea wseep and qgw represent precipitation mm surface runoff mm evapotranspiration mm percolation mm and groundwater flow mm respectively equation 1 determines the change in the soil water content for each day based on a daily calculation of the hydrological processes in the hru each soil type is divided into different soil layers and the soil water content is calculated for each soil layer separately and subsequently summed 3 2 sequential uncertainty fitting algorithm sufi 2 sufi 2 is a combined optimization approach that uses a global search method and the latin hypercube sampling technique to examine the behaviour of objective function abbaspour et al 2004 abbaspour et al 2007 first it identifies the range of parameters and then latin hypercube sampling is performed to generate multiple sets of parameters according to their range swat is run on each parameter set and objective function is calculated the parameter range gets updated every iteration and tries to find the best range of parameters boundary conditions parameters model structures and measured data are the sources of uncertainty in the sufi 2 after avoiding 5 of poor simulation 95 prediction uncertainty 95ppu is calculated from the cumulative distribution of an output obtained through latin hypercube sampling the accuracy of model calibration and validation is determined by r factor and p factor p factor shows the observed data that is captured by 95ppu range and accounted for all the uncertainties associated with the swat model the value of p factor ranges from 1 to 0 a value 1 indicates that 100 of measured data comes under the 95 ppu low value of p factor represents high uncertainty in the output and low percentage of measured data captured by 95 ppu the r factor is the average thickness of the 95ppu band divided by the standard deviation of the measured data it describes the quality of the calibration the value of r factor also varies from 1 to 0 where a low value shows the less uncertainty in the output to get an optimum result p and r factors have to be balanced for using sufi 2 we assume a wide range of values for the parameters so that large amount of data can come under the 95ppu we then start reducing the range of parameters to decrease the 95ppu range two basic criteria have to be satisfied in sufi 2 i most of the observed data should be bracted by the 95ppu band p factor and ii the band width r factor of the 95ppu must be smaller these two criteria are problem dependent for instance when we have a high quality data we achieve high p factor and vice versa for the second criterion the width of the 95ppu should be smaller than the standard deviation of the measured data a balance between p factor and r factor ensures bracketing most of the observed data within the 95ppu band abbaspour et al 2015 the detailed description of sufi 2 is given in the swat cup manual https swat tamu edu media 114860 usermanual swatcup pdf 3 3 global sensitivity analysis methods for selecting the sensitive parameters to identify the most sensitive parameter and to select a set of sensitive parameters that cover most of the hydrological processes we selected two different gsa methods a multiple regression method that is used by sufi 2 and b fourier amplitude sensitivity testing fast method fast method was introduced by cukier et al 1978 it is widely used by the scientific community for sensitivity analysis in many research fields 3 3 1 multiple regression method the sensitivity of parameters in sufi 2 is estimated by solving multiple regressions which regresses the parameters produced by the latin hypercube against the value of the objective function multiple regression method is considered as 2 g α i 1 m β i b i where g is the objective function b is a parameter α is a regression constant β corresponds to the technical coefficient attached to the variable b and m is equal to the number of parameters the mean estimates the sensitivity of the changes in the objective function it is determined one by one modifying each of the parameters while keeping all other parameters fixed the higher value of absolute t stat and a lower value of p stat indicate that the parameter is more sensitive 3 3 2 fourier amplitude sensitivity testing fast method fast method cukier et al 1978 reusser et al 2011 is a variance decomposition method that decomposes the total variance of the model s output into contributions of variance due to single factor i e parameters and inputs the method is described below 3 v i n v i i n j i 1 n v ij i n j i 1 n k j 1 n v ijk v 12 n where v is the total variance of the model outputs i j andkare the parameters used andnis the number of parameters vi andvij represent the variance described by the parameteri first order variance and the variance that is described by parametersi second order variance andj respectively the high order variance represents thecovariance due to multiple parameters the ratio of the variance induced by a single parameter and total variance is the first order sensitivity index si 4 s i v i v 3 4 swat model input data swat model requires many input data including topography land use land cover soil meteorological data and streamflow data the details of data along with the source are listed in table 1 topography data was used to delineate subbasins within the watershed while the crop data layer was used to represent the land use land cover in the basin the harmonized world soil database hwsd was used to provide physical and chemical properties of soil in the watershed the meteorological data consisted of daily precipitation and daily minimum and maximum temperature ten years 1991 2000 of daily precipitation and temperature data were used to simulate the climate in the watershed for this study the remaining weather data including relative humidity solar radiation and wind speed were auto simulated by swat weather generator the daily and monthly streamflow data were collected from central water commission cwc 3 5 swat set up the swat watershed delineation resulted in 43 watersheds for narmada river basin there are 18 discharge locations as shown in fig 1 but we selected only 10 discharge locations for watershed delineation due to proper data availability and size of the watersheds for this study these 10 watersheds are classified into three groups based on the area small watershed middle range watershed and large watershed 1 dindori 2 manot 3 mohgaon 4 belkhedi 5 gaderwara and 6 patan watershed were classified as small watershed 7 barmanghat and 8 sandiya as middle range watershed and 9 handiya and 10 mandleshwar as large watershed watersheds used in this study have almost similar type of land use and soil type as shown in table 2 range brush rngb forest mixed frst and irrigated groundwater double crop ri05 are the major part of all watersheds that covers approximately 60 to 75 percent of the total landuse furthermore the slope is classified in five classes i e 0 5 5 10 10 15 15 20 and 20 for all the watersheds the soil and land use classification and percentage area covered by them are shown in table 2 the distribution of soil and land use type after reclassification is shown in fig 2 the model was simulated from 1986 to 2000 first five years of warm up period 1986 1996 was assigned in the model to initialize model parameters daily and monthly simulated streamflow output from the swat model were compared against the observation data the calibration and validation periods were from 1991 to 1997 and 1998 to 2000 respectively 3 6 selection of swat parameters swat model contains more than 210 hydrological parameters all of them may not significantly contribute to the output therefore it is important to identify the most sensitive input parameters and their ranges for streamflow simulation based on the available literature 29 parameters were selected for this study garg et al 2012 narsimlu et al 2015 schmalz and fohrer 2009 to cover various relevant hydrological processes in the narmada river basin see table 3 a core description of these parameters is presented in appendix 1 see neitsch et al 2011 for more details since the average minimum temperature in the study area is always more than 4 c any snow related parameter is not considered in this study 3 7 calibration validation the calibration and validation were conducted using swat calibration and uncertainty procedure swat cup to handle a large number of simulations for the global sensitivity process 2000 simulations were conducted to identify the most sensitive input parameters the sequential uncertainty fitting sufi 2 optimization algorithm with nash sutcliffe efficiency nse as objective function was used to obtain the prediction accuracy in the model nse can be defined as 5 n s e 1 i q m q s i 2 i q m i q m 2 where q s is simulated discharge q m is measured discharge and q m is average of measured discharge nse value more than 0 5 is acceptable for rainfall runoff modelling swat cup uses t stat high absolute values suggest more sensitivity and p value values close to zero suggest a high level of significance to identify the relative significance of the individual parameter khatun et al 2018 kumar et al 2017 visakh et al 2019 a p factor of 1 and r factor of 0 indicate the simulated and observed data are equal fig 3 represents the overall approach used for the model development and parameter sensitivity analysis first we setup a swat model for narmada river basin then swat cup with sufi 2 algorithm is used for calibrating the arc swat generated output for 10 subbasins with 29 parameters hereafter we will refer as sa 29 after reaching a desirable calibration result we perform a global sensitivity analysis to estimate the sensitivity of sa 29 parameters by using multilinear regression sensitivity analysis after ranking all parameters we select first 16 sensitive parameters will refer as sa 16 for the fourier amplitude sensitivity testing fast analysis it is worth pointing out that there are a number of assumptions made in this study we have highlighted the main assumptions here due to restriction of the number of simulation in sufi 2 we could include only 2000 simulation for sa 29 we used only one landuse map for the entire calibration and validation time period the climatic condition is assumed to be same for all the ten watersheds because they are part of a single river the parameters are based on the literature and we did not consider exhaustive list of potential parameters to reduce the initial uncertainty we did not consider the error propagation through the algorithm and structure used by swat and uncertainty in the input data rainfall and temperature 4 results 4 1 calibration and validation of swat model with 29 parameters swat cup analysis tool with sufi 2 algorithm is used for calibration and validation generally 60 to 70 of data from the available data set is used for calibration and rest of the data is used for validation for this study daily and monthly average discharge data from 1stjanuary 1991 to 31st december 2000 is analysed fig 4 a j and 5 a j show the simulated and observed discharge values associated with 10 distinct subbasins i e belkhedi 1 gaderwara 2 patan 3 dindori 4 manot 5 mohagano 6 barman ghat 7 sandiya 8 handiya 9 and mandleshwar 10 at daily and monthly time steps fig 4 a to j show the hydrograph from january 1991 to december 2000 calibration period january 1991 to december 1997 and validation period january 1998 to december 2000 all 10 watersheds were considered to study the effect of catchment size on the simulation accuracy at a daily time step different watersheds are in the descending order from mandleshwar 10 watershed with entire study area with total area of 72173 km2 to belkhedi 1 watershed with total area of 1477 km2 with nse as the objective function by visual analysis of fig 4 a to j it is evident that the simulation with nse as an objective function produces reasonably good results except some of the high peaks simulated high and low flows are in good match with the observed flows since the patterns of simulated flow rise and fall of flow values duration of peak and low flows and overall variation in the time series are matching with the observed flows and all the statistical criteria such as nse show acceptable values we accepted the calibration results if we try to match all the peak flows in the simulation by modifying some of the parameters the baseflow will be altered the reasons for deviation in simulated and observed flow values could be many such as errors in the input data limitation of model structure limitation in the governing equations solved by swat error in neglecting the other parameters in the calibration etc to study the effect of daily and monthly time steps on the simulation accuracy the simulated and observed hydrograph associated with all ten watersheds at monthly time steps with nse objective functions are plotted in fig 5 a to j visual inspection of fig 5 a to j show that the simulation outputs are similar to the observed flows overall the variation between simulated and observed values at a daily time step is found to be more especially for the large catchments i e mandleshwar 10 handiya 9 and sandiya 8 as shown in fig 4 a to c the variation is less for monthly time step fig 5 a to j table 4 represents the model performance criteria i e p factor r factor and nse for different watersheds i e belkhedi 1 gaderwara 2 patan 3 dindori 4 manot 5 mohagano 6 barman ghat 7 sandiya 8 handiya 9 and mandleshwar 10 with sa 29 and sa 16 as shown in table 4 p factor varies from 0 72 to 0 95 and 0 55 to 0 95 for daily and monthly simulations respectively for the calibration period average p value for daily and monthly simulations is 0 89 and 0 82 respectively table 4 shows that for daily simulation for sa 29 nse varies from 0 58 to 0 75 with an average value of 0 67 for monthly simulation nse varies from 0 89 to 0 97 and the average value is 0 93 when we use only sa 16 nse values of the model performance of the watersheds don t deviate from those obtained from model with sa 29 sometimes nse value of the model with sa 16 is better than that of sa 29 for instance dindori 4 manot 5 and barman ghat 7 at monthly time step show high nse value with the set of sa 16 overall from table 4 we can say that the sa 16 also produce the accurate result compared to simulations with sa 29 the reduction of parameters is very helpful to reduce the complexity of the model 4 2 sensitivity analysis results 4 2 1 effect of catchment size on the sensitivity of parameters on daily simulation to study the variation in parameter sensitivity with catchment size the calibration was performed using 10 different sized watersheds fig 6 shows the parameter sensitivity results based on p value with sa 29 fig 6 a and fast indices with sa 16 fig 6 b for 10 different watersheds under three categories i e small watershed belkhedi 1 gaderwara 2 patan 3 dindori 4 manot 5 and mohagano 6 medium range watershed barman ghat 7 and sandiya 8 and large watershed handiya 9 and mandleshwar 10 in fig 6 parameters used for this study are shown on the y axis and the watersheds are listed on the x axis the sequence of these watersheds is in the increasing order of their area fast sensitivity analysis is performed on 16 most sensitive parameters sa 16 which were obtained from sufi 2 analysis it is worth repeating here that sufi 2 analysis was performed using 29 parameters selected from the literature sa 29 parameters which are not included in sa 16 for a watershed are represented by nan value shown in black colour in fig 6 b it is evident from the figures that the sensitivity of parameters for daily simulations depend upon the catchment size baseflow alpha factor for bank storage alpha bnk rte hydraulic conductivity in main channel ch k2 rte manning s value for main channel ch n2 rte average width of main channel bank ch w2 rte curve number cn2 hru threshold depth of water in shallow aquifer to return gwqmn gw and soil bulk density sol bd sol are the most sensitive parameters for all the watersheds our results indicate that the sensitivity of these parameters does not depend upon the catchment size at a daily simulation time step on the other hand following parameters are not sensitive in any watershed baseflow alpha factor for recession constant alpha bf gw maximum canopy storage canmax hru initial ground water height gwht gw lateral flow time lat ttime hru and threshold depth for exchange with deep aquifer revapmn gw we can conclude that these parameters can be ignored and thus the number of parameters can be minimized in daily simulations some of the parameters are sensitive only for a range of watershed size for instance average slope of tributary channel ch s1 sub soil bulk density sol bd sol and soil erodibilty factor usle k sol are sensitive for large watershed and middle range watershed sandiya 8 watershed ground water delay gw delay gw average slope steepness hru slp hru and support practice p factor of usle soil equation usle p mgt are not sensitive for large watersheds but sensitive for small and middle range watersheds 4 2 2 effect of catchment size on the sensitivity of parameters on monthly simulation fig 7 a and b show the sensitivity of sa 29 and sa 16 of ten distinct watersheds when monthly simulations were performed fig 7 shows that watershed size affects the parameter sensitivity overall baseflow alpha factor for bank storage alpha bnk rte curve number cn2 mgt groundwater delay gw delay gw ground water revap factor gw revap gw and available soil water sol awc sol are highly sensitive for almost all the watersheds at monthly time step which implies that these parameters are significant irrespective of selected catchment size in the monthly simulation furthermore average slope of tributary channels ch s1 sub lateral flow travel time lat ttime hru and support practice p factor of usle soil equation usle p mgt are least sensitive for almost all the watersheds at monthly simulation time step which implies that these parameters are not significant and can be ignored to avoid over parameterization in the monthly simulation some parameters are highly effective for some watersheds based on size for example baseflow alpha factor for recession constant alpha bf gw manning s value for overland flow ov n hru and soil erodibility factor usle k sol are sensitive for small watershed but not at all sensitive for large and medium range watersheds initial ground water height gwht gw and average slope length slsubbsn hru are sensitive in large watersheds but not sensitive in small watersheds 4 2 3 effect of daily and monthly simulations on the sensitivity of parameters figs 6 and 7 also show that the sensitivity of parameters depends on the time step of the simulation daily and monthly baseflow alpha factor for bank storage alpha bnk rte and curve number cn2 hru are the sensitive parameters and soil evaporation compensation factor esco hru soil erodibilty factor usle k sol and surface runoff lag time surlag bsn are the least sensitive parameters in both daily and monthly simulations ground water delay gw delay gw ground water revap factor gw revap gw and available soil water sol awc sol are sensitive in monhly simulation manning s value for main channel ch n2 rte average width of main channel bank ch w2 rte threshold depth of water in shallow aquifer to return gwqmn gw and soil bulk density sol bd sol are sensitive at daily simulation time step 5 discussion in this section we try to infer common points from the results presented in the previous section we now categorize the paperameters according to their association with a hydrological process such as groundwater surface runoff evapotranspiration etc further we attempt to explain the possible reasons behind a set of parameters being highly least sensitive to variation in the watershed size and simulation time step 5 1 sensitivity of groundwater related parameters the multilinear regression sensitivity analysis and the first order sensitivity indices derived from fast analysis for groundwater related parametres are shown in fig 8 a d at daily and monthly simulation time steps for sa 29 and sa 16 respectively it is worth pointing here that fig 8 is the subplot of figs 6 and 7 alpha bnk rte regulates the outflow of the ground soil water from the bank to the river it also directly contributes in the main channel flow as bank storage and groundwater thus the sensitivity of alpha bnk rte is more than other groundwater parameters for all watershedes and for both monthly and daily simulations similar results were also reported by nilawar and waikar 2018 and narsimlu et al 2015 in their studies for large watershedes at monthly time step initial groundwater height gwht gw shows high sensitivity in case of analysis with sufi 2 method with all 29 parameters but least sensitivity when we use only 16 parameters in the fast method this indicates that the sensitivity of gwht gw is affected by the presence of other ground water related parameters which we don t include in the fast method alpha bf gw regulates the outflow of the groundwater to the river the baseflow alpha factor is a function of the watershed topography drainage pattern and soil properties swat has the limitations in rigorously simulating the groundwater flow the interaction between groundwater flow and baseflow is high for smaller and mountainous region thus the small watersheds i e patan 3 dindori 4 and manot 5 show high sensitivity at both daily and monthly simulation time steps our results show that the sensitivity of alpha bf gw is more than the sensitivity of other groundwater parameters dhami et al 2018 also reported in their study that alpha bf gw is sensitive parameter in karnali river basin in a mountainous region of nepal our study area is also surrounded by different mountainous ranges see section 2 about the details of our study area groundwater starts transporting from shallow aquifer to river channel when the depth of water in the aquifer is equal or greater than the gwqmn perhaps this is one of the reasons why its sensitivity is independent of the size of the watershed in the daily simulations in monthly simulations change in the water level in the shallow aquifer is dependent on the area of the watershed therefore gwqmn gw is more sensitive in small watersheds but less sensitive in large watersheds our result is supported by the findings of guse et al 2014 who reported that the parameter gwqmn gw was highly sensitive in treene lowland catchment in northern germany ground water delay gw delay gw is the time required for water to reach the shallow aquifer from root zone it mainly depends on the soil property and height of the water table therefore its sensitivity is independent of the watershed size and simulation time steps which is also confirmed by other studies such as keery et al 2007 tolley et al 2019 and borgonovo et al 2017 5 2 sensitivity of runoff related parameters the sensitivity of runoff related parameters is shown in fig 9 a d the arrangement of the figure is similar to that of fig 8 the parameter cn2 mgt curve number for moisture condition has the primary influence on the amount of runoff generated from a hydrologic response unit hence a relatively greater sensitivity index for cn2 mgt can be expected for most of the watersheds the value of curve number depends on landuse and soil type it is not affected by the size of the watershed and simulation time step sharma et al 2019 mccuen 1973 large subbasins have more tributaries so the average slope of tributaries channel ch s1 sub is sensitive parameter for large subbasins at a daily time step emery et al 2016 pontes et al 2016 the contribution of the small tributaries varies frequently especially in a rainy day which could be the reason why the parameter is sensitive at a daily time step since the accumulated streamflow at monthly time step is more than that at a daily time step the parameter is not sensitive in case of monthly simulations the surface runoff lag time surlag bsn is sensitive when the time of concentration is high this parameter does not show significant sensitivity in daily simulations however in monthly simulations it is sensitive for almost all the watersheds for runoff the lag time is in days so in monthly simulations it is more uncertain compare to daily simulations rahman et al 2013 uniyal et al 2015 the value of saturated hydraulic conductivity sol k sol beven and germann 2013 pue et al 2019 depends on various factors like soil moisture soil hydro group etc therefore the sensitivity of these two parameters surlag bsn and sol k sol in case of sa 29 with more parameters is more as compared to sa 16 simulation 5 3 sensitivity of soilwater related parameters the sensitivity of soilwater related parameters is shown in fig 10 a to d moist bulk density sol bd sol and lateral flow from the soil lat ttime hru are directly affected by availabe water capacity of the soil sol awc sol the available soil water capacity sol awc is the amount of water that is available for plant uptake when the soil is at field capacity the available water capacity varies in three different soil layers since there is no role of the catchment size in transferring water from lower level of soil to the root zone our results show that the sensitivity of sol awc sol does not depend on the size of the watershed this parameter depends on the soil property like permeability of soil capillaries and macropores which are highly sensitive and changes frequently when the available water capacity of soil decreases the effect of evaporation decreases and the amount of subsurface flow increases within the soil profile the value of sol awc sol is more in dry months than in wet months the sensitivity of sol awc sol is more in daily simulations than in monthly simulations the other related studies also indicate that the available water capacity of soil is sensitive parameter in their study areas bosch et al 2004 ghasemizade et al 2017 zhang et al 2013 the amount of lateral flow discharged to the river on a particular day is controlled by lat ttime in our study area all the watersheds have such a shape that the lateral flow discharge to the river is small and almost constant in all the watersheds thus lat ttime is not sensitive in any watershed in daily and monthly simulations 5 4 sensitivity of evapotranspiration related parameters fig 11 a d summarizes the sensitivity of evapotranspiration related parametres soil water availability for evaporation is represented by esco hru the effect of soil capillary crust and cracking on soil is reflected by this parameter since the depth distribution of the water content in the layers is modified by esco hru it is sensitive for the clay loom soil clay loom soil is known to have high response towards the transfer of water from the soil in the form of evaporation guse et al 2014 schaake et al 1996 at a daily time step there is less time for water to evapotranspirate therefore it can be concluded that the evapotranspiration parameters are more sensitive at monthly time step but less sensitive at daily time step our results show that esco hru is sensitive in medium sized watersheds which is also reported by other researchers such as suryavanshi et al 2017 and spruill and taraba 2000 another parameter epco hru represent plant uptake compensation factor which is sensitive in small watershedes where there is less irrigation area watershed patan 3 dindori 4 and manot 5 maximum canopy storage canmx hru is not sensitive for any watershed in daily simulations 5 5 sensitivity of routing related parameters the sensitivity of routing related parameters are shown in fig 12 a d manning s cofficient of the main channel ch n2 rte is the key parameter that controls the flow in the river since this is the property of the channel itself it does not depend on the size of the watershed our results don t show any change in the sensitivity of ch n2 rte with respect to catchment size however it is sensitive at both monthly and daily time steps addressing daily changes in the channel s property is more challenging than monthly changes therefore all the parameters related to routing shows more sensitivity at daily time step compared to monthly time step shivhare et al 2018 himanshu et al 2017 effective hydraulic conductivity in the main channel ch k2 rte shows the movement of water from streambed to subsurface for any watershed therefore the sensitivity of ch k2 rte is independent of watershed size the average slope ch s2 rte and average top width ch w2 rte of the main channel are more sensitive when the sum of the length of main channel is more than the sum of the length of tributaries heuvelmans et al 2006 5 6 sensitivity of topographic related parameters the sensitivity of topographic related parameters is shown in fig 13 a d from the figure it is clear that the average slope steepness hru slp hru decreases with the increase in watershed size it could be attributed to fact that if the slope is steeper naturally less time is required for runoff to percolate from surface to subsurface also the steepness of the slope helps runoff water to reach the stream river therefore in small watersheds hru slp hru is showing high sensitivity average slope length of the subbasin slsubbsn hru directly affects the average streamflow amount and positively correlate with the streamflow as the size of watershed increases the slope length also increases we noticed that this parameter is sensitive for large watershed but not sensitive for small watershed a study on the tons river basin in india by kumar et al 2017 reported that slsubbsn hru is sensitive parameter for small sized watersheds the slope of the watershed for lateral flow in subsurface is shown by the parameter slsoil hru our results show that slsoil hru is sensitive at monthly time step when the time of flow is more in large watersheds our results are supported by the findings of kim and mohanty 2015 who reported that slsoil hru is sensitive parameter for large watersheds 5 7 sensitivity of erosion related parameters the sensitivity of erosion related parameters is shown in fig 14 a d the erodibility factor usle k sol depends on the property of the soil large watersheds have more variation in soil than the same in a small watershed the small watershed may have only one or two soil type which increases the sensitivity of usle k sol for large watershed the sensitivity of usle k sol is more at a daily time step compared to simulations with monthly time step in both sa 29 and sa 16 arabi et al 2006 misra and rose 1996 small watersheds have less varying slope than the large watersheds which need more support practice to control the soil loss therefore soil support practice factor usle p sol is more sensitive for small watersheds than for large watersheds usle p mgt is less sensitive as compared to usle k sol when we use less number of parameters sa 16 simulations than the simulations with more numbers of parameters sa 29 6 summary and conclusions in this paper we analysed the effect of catchment size simulation time steps and the type of global sensitivity analysis on the parameter sensitivity we developed swat hydrological model for ten watersheds in narmada river basin we conducted two types of global sensitivity analysis sa 29 and sa 16 i with 29 parameters using sufi 2 and ii with 16 most sensitive parameters using fast the summary of our results is presented in table 5 we have clearly indicated which parameters are sensitive in small and large watersheds at which simulation time step daily or monthly from the table we can easily identify the parameters which are not affected by the variation in both simulation time step and size of the watersheds the conclusions of this study are as follows sa 16 is efficient and reduces the complexity of semi distributed hydrological models for any watershed simulations with sa 16 produced better results than sa 29 in some watersheds dindori 4 manot 5 and barman ghat 7 at monthly time steps with sa 16 shows higher nse than in case of sa 29 our results show that parameter sensitivity depends heavily upon the selection of catchment size and time step used in the simulation however there are several parameters with their sensitivity independent of above mentioned selections for instance the curve number cn2 mgt and baseflow alpha factor for bank storage alpha bnk rte are highly sensitive for almost all the catchment size and time steps while lateral flow travel time lat ttime hru is least sensitive for almost all the catchment size and time steps these observations imply that many parameters may not be significant and can be ignored to avoid over parameterization of the model the sensitivity of several parameters significantly depends on catchment size for instance alpha bf gw ov n hru and usle k sol are sensitive for small watershed but not at all sensitive for large and medium sized watersheds gwht gw and slsubbsn hru are sensitive for large watershed but not sensitive for small watersheds at monthly time step sensitive parameters at daily time step for large and medium range watershed are ch s1 sub sol bd sol and usle k sol on the other hand gw delay gw hru slp and usle p mgt are not sensitive for large watershed but sensitive for other watersheds the sensitivity of several parameters primarily depends on time step used in the simulation for instance gw delay gw gw revap gw and sol awc sol are sensitive on monthly time step and ch k2 rte ch n2 rte ch w2 rte gwqmn gw and sol bd sol are sensitive at daily time step evapotranspiration parameters are less sensitive at monthly and daily time steps routing related parameters are also less sensitive when we reduce the number of parameters sa 16 to avoid complexity and uncertainty in any hydrological model reducing the number of parameters is important at the same time it is also necessary to select a parameter set that accounts for all the hydrological process our results indicate that depending on the size of the catchment and simulation time step suitable recommendations can be provided to the modeler for instance based on our results we can pick gw delay gw alpha bnk rte from ground water related parameters cn2 mgt from runoff related parameter sol awc sol from soil water related parameter epco hru from evapotranspiration related parameter ch n2 rte from routing related parameters and hru slp hru from topographic related parameters and that would hopefully be sufficient for the simulation of a small sized watershed erosion related parameters need not be considered based on our results we recommend that it is necessary to perform such analysis before selecting a set of parameters in a semi distributed hydrological model the encouraging results for the parameter sensitivity in swat hydrological model in this study seem to indicate that the approach has the potential to address the problems related to over parameterization hydrological modelling accuracy and spatio temporal variation of hydrological processes credit authorship contribution statement ankit singh data curation formal analysis methodology validation visualization writing original draft sanjeev

their valuable comments which improved the quality of the manuscript significantly appendix 1 descriptions of the parameters used in the sensivity analysis neitsch et al 2011 the surface runoff is characterized by the curve number cn2 mgt time of concentration surlag bsn lat ttime hru and slope hru slp hru slsubbsn hru the curve number cn2 mgt for distinct slopes is obtained from the average slope steepness parameter hru slp hru a reduction of the curve number results in a lower surface runoff which implies lower streamflow peak in the river the time of concentration relies on the timing parameters i e surlag bsn and lat ttime hru a time of concentration of more than 1 day implies that the cumulative amount of surface runoff does not reach the river on a given day average slope length slsubbsn hru and manning s roughness coefficient for the subbasin ov n hru contribute in the computation of the time of concentration of channel flow and average velocity the available soil water capacity sol awc sol moist bulk density sol bd sol and saturated hydraulic conductivity sol k sol are selected as the soil parameters sol awc sol is the estimation of the field capacity for each soil layer sol bd sol defines the relative amount of pore space and soil matrix travel time of water for percolation is calculated bysol k sol these soil water parameters regulate the percolation into the groundwater and the frequency of surface and lateral flows along with evaporation the evapotranspiration is represented by maximum canopy storage canmx hru soil evaporation compensation factor esco hru and plant uptake compensation factor epco hru canmx hru depicts the water capacity of the canopy storage and depends on the leaf area index of the specific crop precipitation only enters the soil once the canopy storage is completely filled once the canopy storage is empty soil water is utilized for the evaporation characterized by the depth of soil evaporation esco hru esco hru determines the contribution of each soil layer to the evaporation furthermore epco hru is the compensation factor for the water uptake by the plants as epco hru increases the water uptake from the lower zone of the soil also increases processes involving groundwater are represented by groundwater time delay gw delay gw baseflow recession constant alpha bf gw aquifer fraction coefficient rchrg dp gw groundwater revap coefficient gw revap gw threshold depth of water in the shallow aquifer for revap to occur revapmn gw initial groundwater height gwhtgw threshold depth of water in the shallow aquifer required for return flow to occur gwqmn gw and initial depth of water in shallow aquifer deepst gw the groundwater time delay gw delay gw and baseflow recession constant alpha bf gw are related to the timing of the process the gw delay gw measured in days regulates the time delay for recharging the shallow aquifer and increase in this delay factor leads to a slower recharging process the alpha bf gw delays the outflow of groundwater and estimates the time required by water to flow from groundwater to the river reach the aquifer fraction coefficient rchrg dp gw determines the splitting between deep and shallow aquifers the revap is defined as the movement of water from the lower soil surface to the overlying unsaturated layer for evapotranspiration which is done by deep root of plant the revap parameters majorly depend upon landuse and landcover the movement of water from shallow aquifer to evapotranspiration depends upon gw revap gw and revapmn gw parameters gwqmn gw is the threshold water level of shallow aquifer required for moving the water from the aquifer to the upper soil layer decreasing the value of gw revap gw and gwqmn gw reduces evapotranspiration and increases the base flow routing related parameter are represented by average width of main channel ch w2 rte channel slope ch s2 rte manning s value for the main channel ch n2 rte effective hydraulic conductivity in main channel ch k2 rte and base flow recession constant for bank storage alpha bnk rte discharge in the channel is calculated by cross sectional area of the channel channel slope ch s2 rte average width of the channel ch w2 rte and the flow velocity which is dependent upon ch n2 rte furthermore the transmission loss from channel is directly related to the hydraulic conductivity of the channel alluvium ch k2 rte alpha bnk rte measures the volume of water added to the channel from the bank storage usle k sol and usle p mgt are related to erosion usle p mgt is defined as the ratio of soil loss associated with a specific support practice to the corresponding losses with the varying slope culture whereas usle k sol is defined as the soil erodibility factor 
4341,interaction between ocean tides and coastal aquifers is an important process influencing the quality and quantity of groundwater resources in this study high frequency groundwater fluctuation along two transects from the gulf of mexico to the upper floridan aquifer ufa were analyzed to characterize the hydrogeologic structure of the multi layer karst aquifer tidal efficiency and time lag of harmonic constants were calculated from groundwater and seawater level and aquifer diffusivity were estimated using the jacob ferris equation measurable tidal signals were observed at a maximum inland distance of approximately 7 8 km due to the high conductivity of the unconfined karst aquifer the largest tidal fluctuation was observed in the deeper unit of the aquifer 146 155 m below land surface which indicate the hydraulic contact between seawater and the high permeability zone of avon park formation the estimated values of hydraulic diffusivities agreed well with the regional groundwater flow model despite the highly heterogeneous nature of karst aquifer our analysis suggested that tidal springs are important sea water groundwater interfaces and the conduit networks of tidal creeks caves and fractures are preferential pathways of tidal propagation keywords karst aquifer jacob ferris equation tidal fluctuations coastal springs 1 introduction tidal fluctuation is a ubiquitous force that constantly impacts the high frequency variation of coastal groundwater levels jiao and post 2019 extensive studies have been dedicated to understanding mechanisms of tidal propagation in coastal aquifers research revealed that tidal amplitude exponentially decreased and phase increasingly shifted as the tidal wave traveled landward the degree of amplitude damping and phase shift is controlled by 1 tidal amplitude and frequency 2 location geometry and slope of the aquifer seawater interface 3 aquifer character confined unconfined or leaky and 4 hydraulic properties

randomly distributed conductivity fields trefry et al 2011 the analytical solutions assume a homogeneous aquifer with uniform storativity and conductivity which may result in high degree of uncertainty when applied to highly heterogenous aquifers numerical models have been employed to investigate the groundwater head and flow response to period forcing in heterogeneous geologic media ataie ashtiani et al 2001 riedel et al 2010 furthermore studies have been conducted using density dependent flow models to investigate the impact of tidal forcing on salt water intrusion mao et al

tidal response in groundwater alcolea et al 2007 jardani et al 2012 in general tidal signals propagate farther in the confined aquifer than in the unconfined aquifer the rapid damping of tidal pressure waves in unconfined aquifers is believed to be a result of its specific yield which is usually several orders of magnitude higher than storativity of confined aquifers nielsen 1990 reported that tidal amplitude quickly reduced from 0 516 m on the shore to 0 075 m as it traveled to about 25 m from the shore field observation of erskine 1991 reported that tidal oscillations were unmeasurable 400 m from the shore however for unconfined aquifers with exceptionally high transmissivities the tidal effects may be observed much further inland for example the monitoring well at the center of an island aquifer about 5 km to shore showed clear major tidal modes rotzoll et al 2008 furthermore tidal fluctuation in unconfined aquifers can vary substantially with depth in multi unit aquifers whereas field studies showed larger amplitude and smaller time lags in deeper units erskine 1991 trefry and johnston 1998 nevertheless tidal fluctuation in multi unit unconfined karst aquifers were scarcely studied and little is known regarding the role of conduit network in tidal propagation martin et al 2012 perriquet et al 2014 the objectives of this study are 1 to determine the vertical and horizontal extent of tidal propagation in a multi unit unconfined karst aquifer through analysis of continuous groundwater monitoring records and 2 to evaluate the feasibility and limitations of analytical equations for calculating the hydraulic parameter of highly heterogenous karst aquifers it is also expected the study can shed light on the potential role of fracture network in transmission of tidal fluctuation in aquifers 2 material and methods 2 1 study site the study site is located on the west coast of the florida peninsula and eastern side of the gulf of mexico fig 1 the study area lies within the physiographic regions of coastal swamps and gulf coastal lowlands which has a typical karst landscape with numerous springs sinkholes internal drainage and undulating topography the land altitudes gradually increase from sea level at the gulf coast to about 15 m above sea level along the eastern edge of the study area the long term mean annual rainfall is about 1 372 mm and ranged from 1 016 to 1 803 mm monthly rainfall is concentrated in june through september and heavily impacted by convective thunderstorms during summer and tropical storms during hurricane season the coastal springs and estuaries of west central florida provide a unique and important ecological setting for submerged aquatic vegetation benthos mollusks fish and manatees ecological integrity in spring fed estuaries is directly connected to salinity which is controlled by the quantity and quality of water discharging from the springs seasonal pattern of spring flow is generally proportional to the groundwater level in coastal aquifers and is affected primarily by rainfall induced recharge many of the springs are characterized as tidal controlled with discharge greatly affected by sea level variation yobbi 1992 knochenmus and yobbi 2001 chen 2012 menning et al 2015 2 2 hydrogeology the hydrological system is part of the coastal springs groundwater basin bounded by groundwater divides rather than topographic divides where the principal drainage is groundwater flow through springs and creeks and there is minimal surface drainage yobbi 1992 the weeki wachee springs groundwater basin in the north contains the weeki wachee main spring and numerous smaller springs including little wilderness salt mud hospital hole and jenkins springs fig 1 the weeki wachee main and little springs discharge freshwater and available data shows that spring flows are not influenced by tide salt mud and jenkins springs discharge brackish water and are tidally influenced the springs discharge to the weeki wachee river which meanders about 11 9 km to the gulf of mexico at bayport in hernando county florida most of the flow in the river is from weeki wachee main spring with average discharge of approximately 4 93 m3 s for the period of record knochenmus and yobbi 2001 the aripeka springs groundwater basin in the south contains many small springs including aripeka 1 aripeka 2 boat gator magnolia and bobhill springs which are clustered in a 2 5 km2 area fig 1 flow of the springs are tidally affected and discharge a mixture of saltwater and freshwater the spring discharge were collected by the hammock creek and then flows about 1 6 km to the gulf of mexico flow in hammock creek is tidally controlled knochenmus and yobbi 2001 menning et al 2015 the groundwater flow is part of the floridan aquifer system which is one of the most productive aquifer systems in the unites states and the primary water source for the rapidly increasing population and economy in the region it is predominantly carbonate sequence of the paleocene to lower miocene series ryder 1985 williams and kuniansky 2016 in the study area the hydrogeologic framework includes a discontinuous surficial aquifer sa system consisting of unconsolidated deposits of sand and clay and a thick carbonate upper floridan aquifer ufa exposed at or very near to the land surface fig 2 the ufa is largely unconfined and experiences rapid recharge and increased discharge following rainfall events yobbi 1992 knochenmus and yobbi 2001 the geologic units of ufa include the suwannee limestone of oligocene age the ocala limestone and the avon park formation of eocene age fig 2 field tests indicate that the suwannee limestone and ocala limestone have moderate to high porosity and permeability the more consolidated limestone near top of the avon park formation results in a low permeability zone under which is a high permeability zone start from about 125 m below land surface with extensive cavities fractures and other solution features the high permeability zone of the avon park formation is the deepest unit containing freshwater water and its bottom approximately 240 m below land surface coincides with the bottom of the ufa which is characterized by the persistent occurrence of evaporites yobbi 1992 knochenmus and yobbi 2001 the groundwater in ufa generally flows west to northwest from the high potential zone inland and discharges to the gulf of mexico as diffuse seepage along the coast or through springs recharge occurs as rapid infiltration through surficial deposits and drainage into sinkholes followed by fast flow through secondary porosity features such as conduits enhanced fracture zones or caverns within the limestone the discharge occurs in the form of upward flows through solution cavities to springs or diffusive upward leakage into coastal swamps or the near shore environment the freshwater saltwater transition zone has a diffusive interface parallel to the coast with landward reentrants at major springs yobbi 1992 menning et al 2015 2 3 data source sea water level data recorded at the aripeka coastal station arpf1 was downloaded from national data buoy center ndbc of national oceanic and atmospheric administration noaa https www ndbc noaa gov station page php station arpf1 station arpf1 fig 1 is a shore based tower station mounted on the south fork hammock creek bridge it is operated by the coastal ocean monitoring and prediction system comps of the university of south florida usf measured sea level time series at 6 minute intervals in the year 2019 were used in the tidal harmonic analysis sea level data at the bayport coastal station usgs 02310600 was obtained from the national water information system nwis https waterdata usgs gov nwis of united sates geological survey usgs measured sea level time series at 15 minute intervals in the year 2019 were used in the tidal harmonic analysis a one week subset of measured sea level variation at the tidal stations is illustrated in fig 3 the groundwater data in this study was measured in regional observation and monitor well program romp well sites which were constructed and operated to monitor the freshwater saltwater interface by the southwest florida water management district swfwmd hourly water level measurements have been continuously recorded with submersible pressure transducers at an operating precision of 1 5 mm since 1997 time series data of year 2019 were retrieved and used in this study location of the well sites are shown in fig 1 and the physical settings such as land surface elevation casing and total depth are given in table 1 the natural coast of this area is characterized by tidal flats extending many kilometers into the gulf and a lack of clear shoreline for our analysis the nearest tidal pool was identified on the high resolution aerial image of 2009 and the distances to the nearest tidal pool were measured for each monitoring well 2 4 water level analysis water levels measured at the tidal station and monitoring wells were all converted to north american vertical datum of 1988 navd 88 the measured time series of groundwater levels were detrended to eliminate low frequency fluctuations caused by natural and anthropogenic stresses such as rainfall evaporation groundwater withdrawal and aperiodic atmospheric pressure variations specifically 24 hour moving averages were subtracted from observed hourly time series to detect the diurnal semi diurnal tidal variations merritt 2004 an example of fortnight variation of measured and detrended groundwater level is illustrated in fig 4 for monitoring well 20850 romp tr18 3 avon park formation the detrended values of groundwater levels were used for the tidal harmonic analysis and hydraulic parameter estimation monitoring data along 2 transects from the gulf of mexico to inland were analyzed to quantify the impact of tidal dynamics on groundwater level of sa and ufa fig 1 groundwater level of the 5 monitoring wells 1 sa well and 4 ufa wells along the weeki wachee transect were compared with the sea level variation at bayport coastal station usgs 02310600 similarly the aripeka transect in the south has 9 monitoring wells 2 sa wells and 7 ufa wells and the measured groundwater levels were compared with sea level of the aripeka coastal station arpf1 there are 4 wells 20848 20846 20850 and 20847 opening to different geologic units at site romp 18 3 on the aripeka transect which was used to characterize the vertical distribution of tidal variations in the multi unit aquifers one week subsets of detrended groundwater level comparison with the measured tidal elevations are illustrated for selected wells in figs 5 and 6 cross correlations were performed to determine the time lagged interrelation of measured sea level with detrended groundwater levels schaff and richards 2014 the pearson correlation coefficient r were computed between time series pairs in 1 minutes time windows the time shift corresponding to the maximum r r lag were determined as the time lag t lag between the groundwater level and sea level linear regression was carried out between shifted groundwater level and sea level and the slope of regression was computed as the relative amplitude a r here we assume that the diurnal fluctuation of groundwater h gl is a linearly scaled signal of the corresponding sea level fluctuation h sl that can be expressed as h gl a r h sl n where n is uncorrelated noise 2 5 tidal harmonic analysis tidal harmonic constants were estimated by least square fitting of measured sea levels or detrended groundwater levels to the function 1 h t h 0 α i cos ω i t ϕ i where h is the tidal variation around mean sea level h 0 t is time α i is the amplitude of tidal constituent i ω i and ϕ i are the angular frequency and phase constants respectively the angular frequencies of tidal constituents ω i 2 π τ i where τ i are the periods of tidal constituents m2 12 42 h o1 25 82 h k1 23 93 h s2 12 h the analysis was carried out using utide code codiga 2011 in the initial analysis α i and ϕ i of 4 major tidal constituents m2 s2 o1 and k1 were estimated at each tidal station or groundwater well the solar component k1 and s2 may contain atmospheric pressure and is considered unsuitable for estimation of hydraulic parameters merritt 2004 therefore a second analysis was conducted where the time series were fitted with only two tidal constituents m2 and o1 to obtain α i and ϕ i the tidal variations at different sites were simulated using the computed harmonic constants example of simulated tidal fluctuations are illustrated in fig 3 for tidal stations and fig 4 for groundwater well tidal efficiency factor t e is defined as the tidal amplitude of the groundwater level α gl divided by that of the seawater level α sl 2 t e α gl α sl in addition the phase lag δ ϕ of each groundwater well is calculated as the difference between phase constants of groundwater level ϕ gl and seawater level ϕ sl 3 δ ϕ ϕ gl ϕ sl 2 6 calculation of aquifer diffusivity under the assumption of homogenous and isotropic aquifer with only horizontal flow the groundwater flow can be described with the 1d linear groundwater flow equation 4 h t d 2 h x 2 where h is the groundwater level x is the horizontal distance from observation wells to the nearest tidal pool d t s is the aquifer diffusivity where t is the transmissivity and s is the storativity the governing equation subject to tidal boundary condition in eq 1 at the ocean side x 0 and a constant groundwater level at the inland side 5a h 0 t h 0 α i cos ω i t ϕ i 5b h t h 0 eq 4 subject to boundary conditions specified in eq 5 was analytically solved jacob 1950 ferris 1951 6 h x t h 0 α i e x ω i 2 d c o s ω i t ϕ i x ω i 2 d eq 6 is commonly referenced as the jacob ferris equation which predicts that the tidal efficiency t e exponentially decays with inland distance 7 t e x e x ω i 2 d and the phase lag δ ϕ linearly increases with inland distance 8 δ ϕ x x ω i 2 d eqs 7 and 8 provide two ways of estimating aquifer diffusivity 9 d α x l n t e 2 ω i 2 10 d ϕ x δ ϕ 2 ω i 2 where d α and d ϕ are hydraulic diffusivity estimated from tidal efficiency or phase lag respectively merritt 2004 to apply the equations linear regression was conducted to calculate slopes b α of l n t e versus distance to shore x and then d α is calculated as 11 d α ω i 2 b α 2 similarly slope b ϕ is calculated from linear regression between phase lag δϕ and distance x then d ϕ is calculated as 12 d ϕ ω i 2 b ϕ 2 where b ϕ is the slope of linear regression between δ ϕ and x 3 results 3 1 landward tidal dissipation one year of measured groundwater levels for 3 floridan aquifer wells 20690 20893 20922 on the weeki wachee transect are shown in fig 7 a together with time series of tidal elevation at the bayport coastal station fortnight subsets of detrended groundwater levels are illustrated in fig 7b to compare the tidal amplitudes with sea level the tidal elevation at bayport station exhibited a clear semi diurnal pattern with diurnal fluctuation over 1 0 m fig 3a the monitoring well near the coast 20690 0 9 km inland and 0 83 km from the nearest tidal pool exhibited the largest fluctuation in response to the tidal wave with a diurnal fluctuation around 0 4 0 6 m figs 5a and 7b the patterns of groundwater level at wells further inland 20893 and 20922 mostly exhibited seasonal variation controlled by the regional weather patterns the monitoring well 20893 4 8 km inland and 3 7 km from tidal pool exhibited a damped diurnal variation about 0 10 0 15 m fig 5b and 7b the tidal signal is severely damped but still detectable at the most inland well 20922 7 2 km inland and 5 9 km from tidal pool with an amplitude around 0 010 0 015 m fig 5c and 7b detailed comparison of groundwater diurnal variation with sea level in fig 5 indicated increased phase shift as tidal waves propagated landward a time series regression with lagged variables was carried out to establish the cross correlation between groundwater and seawater levels the calculated time lagged correlation coefficients r lag relative amplitude a r and time lag t lag are given in table 2 strong correlation between the floridan aquifer water level and tidal variation are revealed by the high values of correlation coefficients groundwater well 20922 r lag 0 587 and 20927 r lag 0 613 with inland distances 5 km had significant correlation with the sea level at the bayport station the cross correlation analysis also exposed the fast propagation of tidal signals in this unconfined karst aquifer as shown by the values of time lag t lag the results suggest that it takes 1 6 h for the tidal wave to reach 5 7 km inland at site 20927 and the tidal amplitude at site 20927 is 0 74 of the ocean tide similarly measured groundwater levels for 4 floridan aquifer wells 20936 20850 20854 20841 on the aripeka transect displayed a landward attenuation of tidal fluctuation fig 8 however the tidal propagation along the aripeka transect is relatively slower and weaker than along the weeki wachee transect the tidal elevation at coastal station aripeka is close to that of the bayport station with similar amplitude and slight shift fig 3 at well 20936 1 4 km inland and 0 9 km to tidal pool a r 0 094 and t lag 0 92 h fig 6a and table 2 a weak tidal signal was detected at 8 3 km inland site 20841 with r lag 0 273 and a r 0 0031 and time lag is 2 92 h at site 20854 3 7 km inland and 2 2 km to tidal pool the tidal signal is 3 55 h behind the tidal station indicating the relatively slow propagation of tidal wave to this site away from spring consuits 3 2 tidal propagation in multi layer aquifer the diurnal fluctuation of groundwater level in all 3 surficial aquifer wells 20894 20848 20840 were below or near the detection limit the cross correlation analysis result in table 2 showed that there is a weak correlation between the groundwater level in well 20894 on the weeki wachee transect 4 8 km to shore and 2 1 m depth with sea level r lag 0 13 and a r 0 0044 no significant correlation between groundwater and sea level were detected for the two surficial wells 20848 and 20840 on the aripeka transect the result indicated that tidal variation was very weak or undetectable in surficial aquifer wells regardless of their distance to shore one year of measured groundwater levels for 4 wells 20848 20846 20850 20847 open to different hydrogeologic layers at the site romp 18 3 3 1 km inland and 2 2 km to tidal pool are illustrated in fig 9 a and fortnight subsets of detrended groundwater levels are depicted in fig 9b the 4 wells at different layers exhibited similar seasonal patterns in response to the recharge and evapotranspiration conditions fig 9a the groundwater elevation of surficial aquifer well 20848 casing depth of 2 1 m is slightly higher than the 3 upper floridan aquifer wells the 3 floridan aquifer monitoring wells 20846 20850 20847 at romp 18 3 2 2 km inland demonstrated vertical pattern of tidal fluctuation in the floridan aquifer fig 9b it is found that the well 20850 casing depth of 146 m and total depth of 155 m open to high permeable zone of the avon park formation has the strongest correlation with tidal signal r lag 0 888 with highest relative amplitude a r 0 080 and smallest time lag t lag 0 78 h at romp 18 3 fig 6b and table 2 the groundwater well 20846 casing depth of 18 m and total depth of 115 m open to the ocala limestone had a much smaller tidal amplitude a r 0 046 than that of the avon park formation the result indicated the tidal signal is preferentially propagated through the high permeable zone of the avon park formation comparison between the well 20937 casing depth of 47 m and total depth of 64 m and 20936 casing depth of 136 m and total depth of 146 m exhibited a similar pattern with the stronger tidal fluctuation in the avon park formation than the ocala limestone table 2 unfortunately there is no comparable well pairs between the avon park formation than the ocala limestone on the weeki wachee transect but the relative amplitude values in table 2 revealed that the 2 wells open to the avon park formation 20690 and 20893 had much larger tidal fluctuations than the 2 wells open to the ocala limestone 20922 and 20927 3 3 tidal amplitude and phase the amplitude α i and phase shift ϕ i of each tidal component were estimated from fitting the seawater level or detrended groundwater levels using the least square curve fitting method and the computed parameter values are given in tables 3 and 4 with the 95 confidence intervals tidal fluctuations using harmonic constants are displayed in fig 3 for sea levels example of groundwater tidal variation simulated using α i and ϕ i is depicted with the fortnight subset for well 20850 in fig 4 in this study two sets of harmonic constants were computed as expected using 4 tidal constituents m2 s2 o1 and k1 provided a better fitting than 2 tidal constituents m2 and o1 as exhibited by the higher correlation coefficients in table 3 than table 4 for corresponding time series the surficial aquifer wells 20894 20848 20840 failed to yield meaningful values of harmonic constants due to the limited tidal fluctuation significant correlation between simulated tidal variation and detrended groundwater level data revealed that the diurnal groundwater variation in floridan aquifer wells were impacted by the propagation of ocean tides calculated amplitude α i of two coastal tidal stations were close to each other and the values of tidal phase shift ϕ i show that the tides at aripeka is about 0 4 h ahead of bayport tides in the area are dominantly semi diurnal m2 tide α m 2 0 31 m followed k1 α k 1 0 14 m s2 α s 2 0 14 m and o1 α o 1 0 14 m the harmonic constants computed from observed sea level agrees well with the numerical simulation of he and weisberg 2002 computation with 4 tidal constituents table 3 or 2 constituents table 2 yielded similar values of α i and ϕ i for tidal constituents m2 and o1 the same is true for groundwater wells with much smaller fluctuations reflecting the robustness of the fitting algorithm and further verified that the groundwater variation is indeed caused by ocean tides codiga 2011 the tidal amplitudes α i estimated from the time series of groundwater levels exhibited the gradual attenuation of tidal fluctuations in floridan aquifer tables 3 and 4 the higher values of α i at wells close to the coast reflected the strong influence of ocean tides on the groundwater elevation the wells farther inland with diminished α i demonstrated the damping of tidal waves as it travels through the geological material the estimated tidal phase shift ϕ i demonstrated increased time lag of the tidal constituents m2 and o1 with landward distance but the ϕ i estimated for tidal constituents k1 and s2 are generally less reliable and the pattern is less clear which is probably due to the influence of atmospheric pressure merritt 2004 as a result values of α i and ϕ i estimated with m2 and o1 was used for estimating the hydraulic parameters 3 4 estimated aquifer diffusivities the tidal efficiency factor t e and phase lag δ ϕ of m2 and o1 tide was computed using the eqs 2 and 3 with harmonic constants in table 4 specifically t e for each of the floridan aquifer wells on the weeki wachee transect were calculated by dividing their α i with the α i of the bayport coastal station and α i of the wells on the apripeka transect were divided by α i of the aripeka station similarly δ ϕ were calculated from subtracting ϕ i of wells on the weeki wachee transect with ϕ i of the bayport station and ϕ i on the aripeka transect from ϕ i of the aripeka tidal station the calculated t e and δ ϕ are given in table 5 and plotted as a function of distance to nearest tidal pool in figs 10 and 11 furthermore t e and δ ϕ of wells at site romp 18 3 were plotted as a function of casing depth in fig 12 to illustrate the vertical variation as given in table 5 the values of tidal efficiency t e of m2 and o1 are close to each other while the δ ϕ of o1 tide is larger than the m2 tide furthermore the tidal efficiency t e of both m2 and o1 tide table 5 are slightly higher than a r calculated from cross correlation analysis table 2 the phase lag δ ϕ of m2 tide is close to the corresponding values of t lag in table 2 while δ ϕ of o1 tide is generally larger table 6 gives the aquifer diffusivities d α or d ϕ calculated using either t e with eq 9 or δ ϕ with eq 10 with linear regression of l n t e or δ ϕ with the distance to potential discharge location x the analysis was conducted separately on the two transects for different hydrogeologic units on the weeki wachee transect 4 wells 20690 20893 20922 and 20927 were used for the floridan aquifer 2 wells 20922 and 20927 for ocala limestone and 2 wells 20690 and 20893 for avon park formation on the aripeka transect 7 wells 20937 20936 20846 20850 20847 20854 and 20841 were used for floridan aquifer 2 wells 20937and 20846 for ocala limestone and 5 wells 20936 20850 20847 20854 and 20841 for avon park formation overall aquifer diffusivities were higher on the weeki wachee transect than that on the aripeka transect and the avon park formation had higher diffusivities than ocala limestone table 6 diffusivity calculated from time lag method d ϕ is 1 6 times higher than d α calculated from the tidal amplitudes in addition diffusivities d α calculated using amplitudes of m2 or o1 were close but the d ϕ calculated from phase lag of m2 was higher than that of o1 4 discussion observed diurnal variation of groundwater levels in this study reveal that tidal waves can propagate long distances 6 8 km inland in an unconfined karst aquifer tables 2 and 5 previous studies suggested that tidal fluctuations were generally damped very quickly as they travel in unconfined aquifer observed tidal fluctuation in siliciclastic aquifers often show amplitude ratio less than 1 at distances of tens to hundreds of meters nielsen 1990 erskine 1991 trefry and johnston 1998 mao et al 2006 abarca et al 2013 shuai et al 2017 trglavcnik et al 2018 which is attributed to the high specific yield of unconfined aquifers merritt 2004 however tidal waves can travel much further in unconfined karst aquifers due to their large hydraulic conductivity and lower storativity rotzoll et al 2008 2013 for example studies of rotzoll et al 2008 demonstrate that at 5 km to shore the o1 tide amplitude was 2 7 of the ocean tide and the time lag was around 2 h which is close to this study tables 2 and 5 the strong interaction between seawater and groundwater suggests that coast karst aquifers are especially susceptible to sea level change and saltwater migration martin et al 2012 perriquet et al 2014 xu et al 2016 multi level observation wells often show that the deeper part of the aquifer has larger tidal amplitude than the shallow layers erskine 1991 trefry and johnston 1998 ratner narovlansky et al 2020 the increased tidal amplitude with depth was suggested to be a result of the increased confinement and or decreased storativity trefry and johnston 1998 and the analytical models developed for the site suggested the leakage effects of the semi permeable peat layers guo et al 2007 the analytical solution recently developed by bakker 2019 demonstrates that the tidal signals travel much farther in deeper parts of a multi layer unconfined aquifer and the effect is enhanced with the presence of thin layers of low permeability which can partially explain the higher tidal amplitude at the avon park formation than the ocala limestone at site romp tr18 3 fig 12 however fig 12 shows the upper layer of the avon park formation well 20850 146 155 m below ground has larger tidal amplitude and lower phase lag than the lower avon park formation well 20847 180 190 m below ground this vertical pattern of tidal fluctuation suggests that the tidal wave transmits preferentially in the high permeability zone of the avon park formation and then propagate upward and downward to the layers above and below which is consistent with the conceptual understanding of the regional hydrogeology yobbi 1992 knochenmus and yobbi 2001 application of the jacob ferris equation often assumes a distinctive shoreline as the hydraulic contact with seawater to determine the distance x to ocean boundary however natural coasts are characterized by complex geomorphology where groundwater discharges into ocean through a range of point linear or diffusive features there are many tidal springs scattered on the coast fig 1 with a direct link to ufa through a complex network of subsurface conduits yobbi 1992 knochenmus and yobbi 2001 fleury et al 2007 menning et al 2015 in addition the regional potentiometric surface indicates there is a diffusive upward discharge through vast areas of coastal swamps ryder 1985 knochenmus and yobbi 2001 this composite pattern of hydraulic interaction through rapid flow in fracture networks and slow flow in bulk rock matrices brings a degree of uncertainty in estimation of hydraulic parameter through tidal method martin et al 2012 perriquet et al 2014 for example martin et al 2012 applied tidal amplitude method to island karst aquifers and reported that transmissivity of blue holes were 20 60 times higher than that of wells further theoretical and numerical modeling is warranted to elucidate the mechanisms of tidal interaction in dual permeability aquifers amplitude based diffusivity d α were consistent for the lunar semi diurnal m2 and diurnal o1 tides whereas diffusivity derived from time lag d ϕ varied considerably between m2 and o1 tide table 6 assuming linear wave propagation the jacob ferris equation eq 7 predicts that semi diurnal tide dissipated more quickly with less time lag than diurnal tide rotzoll et al 2008 however in highly heterogenous karst aquifers turbulent flow in subsurface conduits might be an important or even dominant pathway for the transmission of tidal energies martin et al 2012 perriquet et al 2014 nonlinear wave interaction might arise in such situations and cause the departure from the jacob ferris equation xin et al 2015 hydraulic diffusivity estimated from the amplitude ratio method d α and the time lag method d ϕ demonstrated significant differences table 6 many studies have reported that the jacob ferris equation yields inconsistent diffusivities depending on whether amplitudes or lags are used ferris 1951 erskine 1991 trefry and johnston 1998 trefry and bekele 2004 rotzoll et al 2008 trglavcnik et al 2018 and suggested explanations in terms of depth dependence of storativities phreatic influences or internal layering in hydraulic conductivities although without conclusive evidence trefry and bekele 2004 defined d α d ϕ as slope factor to measure the departure from the ideal jacob ferris model for tidal wave propagation depending on tidal components hydrogeologic layers and transects the slope factor in our study varied between 0 38 and 1 4 which falls in the range of literature values trefry and bekele 2004 the slope factors for most wells were below unity which indicated the tidal waves propagate faster than predicted by the analytical equation for 1 d homogeneous groundwater flow perriquet et al 2014 suggested that ratio of d α d ϕ negatively correlates with the contribution of matrix flow relative to conduit flow and classified the hydrodynamic environment into matrix d ϕ d α fissure intermediate d α d ϕ and conduit d ϕ d α our results in table 6 indicated that the conduit flow is more prominent in the avon park formation than in the ocala limestone in the unconfined ufa the tidal flow likely first propagates through the dissolved conduits and fractures in high permeable zone of the avon park formation and then expressed in the matrix of hydrogeologic layers above and below submarine springs at the ocean end of the conduit networks might be an important interface between seawater and groundwater menning et al 2015 xu et al 2016 our analysis indicates that dispersivities calculated from the amplitude of dominant tidal component d α m2 provided most robust estimates of the aquifer characteristics of the ufa 1 1 107 and 7 1 106 m2 d 1 for the weeki wachee and aripeka transects respectively assuming a storativity s of 5 10 3 based on the range 5x10 4 to 5x10 2 reported for ufa southwest florida water management district 2018 the transmissivity t were calculated as 5 5 104 and 3 6 104 m2 d 1 for weeki wachee and aripeka transects respectively given a total ufa thickness of 250 m fig 2 the hydraulic conductivity values were estimated as 220 and 143 m d for weeki wachee and aripeka transects respectively karst aquifers are known for their extremely high heterogeneity and estimation of hydraulic properties is a challenging task due to the complex and dual porosity flows in the studied area reported values of ufa transmissivity from aquifer performance test or slug test ranged 5 orders of magnitude from 21 to 1 5 105 m2 d 1 which is typical of karst aquifers with extensive conduits williams and kuniansky 2016 at regional scale the hydraulic parameters adopted for groundwater flow computation need to combine estimates from pumping test with analysis of potentiometric surface and further refined through model calibration transmissivity values of 4 6 104 m2 d 1 for weeki wachee and 1 6 104 m2 d 1 for aripeka were used by knochenmus and yobbi 2001 in estimation of spring flow and similar values are reported in other floridan aquifer studies ryder 1985 williams and kuniansky 2016 in this study the transmissivity estimated from tidal method is remarkably close to that used in regional groundwater flow models ryder 1985 yobbi 1992 knochenmus and yobbi 2001 williams and kuniansky 2016 it demonstrated that the tidal method could provide a combined characteristic of the aquifer over a large distance trefry and bekele 2004 for highly heterogenous karst aquifers this is especially an advantage over pumping tests which measure aquifer properties at limited distances the tidal analysis could serve as a valuable tool in developing groundwater models for coastal aquifers 5 conclusions cross correlation of high frequency fluctuation in groundwater level with tidal level provided insight into the hydrogeologic structures of a multi layer coastal karst aquifer system propagation of tidal signals was observed along the two transects at inland distance up to 7 8 km with a short time lag 1 3 h the tidal fluctuation in the multi unit aquifer indicated that the tidal wave preferentially transmitted in the highly permeable zone of the avon park formation analysis of the

4341,interaction between ocean tides and coastal aquifers is an important process influencing the quality and quantity of groundwater resources in this study high frequency groundwater fluctuation along two transects from the gulf of mexico to the upper floridan aquifer ufa were analyzed to characterize the hydrogeologic structure of the multi layer karst aquifer tidal efficiency and time lag of harmonic constants were calculated from groundwater and seawater level and aquifer diffusivity were estimated using the jacob ferris equation measurable tidal signals were observed at a maximum inland distance of approximately 7 8 km due to the high conductivity of the unconfined karst aquifer the largest tidal fluctuation was observed in the deeper unit of the aquifer 146 155 m below land surface which indicate the hydraulic contact between seawater and the high permeability zone of avon park formation the estimated values of hydraulic diffusivities agreed well with the regional groundwater flow model despite the highly heterogeneous nature of karst aquifer our analysis suggested that tidal springs are important sea water groundwater interfaces and the conduit networks of tidal creeks caves and fractures are preferential pathways of tidal propagation keywords karst aquifer jacob ferris equation tidal fluctuations coastal springs 1 introduction tidal fluctuation is a ubiquitous force that constantly impacts the high frequency variation of coastal groundwater levels jiao and post 2019 extensive studies have been dedicated to understanding mechanisms of tidal propagation in coastal aquifers research revealed that tidal amplitude exponentially decreased and phase increasingly shifted as the tidal wave traveled landward the degree of amplitude damping and phase shift is controlled by 1 tidal amplitude and frequency 2 location geometry and slope of the aquifer seawater interface 3 aquifer character confined unconfined or leaky and 4 hydraulic properties storativity specific yield hydraulic conductivity and aquifer thickness an analytical solution of one dimensional flow in homogeneous and infinite aquifer subject to periodic head oscillation at an ocean boundary was derived by jacob 1950 and ferris 1951 and has been extensively employed to estimate hydraulic properties e g nielsen 1990 trefry and johnston 1998 merritt 2004 rotzoll et al 2008 2013 trglavcnik et al 2018 later on numerous analytical solutions were derived for special cases e g aquifer extended beneath sea floor van der kamp 1972 aquifer near tidal rivers maas and de lange 1987 sloping beaches nielsen 1990 cartwright et al 2004 layered aquifer with a unconfined and confined aquifer separated by a thin aquitard jiao and tang 1999 leaky aquifer li and jiao 2001 xia et al

randomly distributed conductivity fields trefry et al 2011 the analytical solutions assume a homogeneous aquifer with uniform storativity and conductivity which may result in high degree of uncertainty when applied to highly heterogenous aquifers numerical models have been employed to investigate the groundwater head and flow response to period forcing in heterogeneous geologic media ataie ashtiani et al 2001 riedel et al 2010 furthermore studies have been conducted using density dependent flow models to investigate the impact of tidal forcing on salt water intrusion mao et al 2006 li et al 2008 post 2011 mulligan et al 2011 kuan et al 2012 abarca et al 2013 pauw et al 2014 xin et al 2015 inverse modeling has been conducted to estimate hydraulic parameters from observed tidal response in groundwater alcolea et al 2007 jardani et al 2012 in general tidal signals propagate farther in the confined aquifer than in the unconfined aquifer the rapid damping of tidal pressure waves in unconfined aquifers is believed to be a result of its specific yield which is usually several orders of magnitude higher than storativity of confined aquifers nielsen 1990 reported that tidal amplitude quickly reduced from 0 516 m on the shore to 0 075 m as it traveled to about 25 m from the shore field observation of erskine 1991 reported that tidal oscillations were unmeasurable 400 m from the shore however for unconfined aquifers with exceptionally high transmissivities the tidal effects may be observed much further inland for example the monitoring well at the center of an island aquifer about 5 km to shore showed clear major tidal modes rotzoll et al 2008 furthermore tidal fluctuation in unconfined aquifers can vary substantially with depth in multi unit aquifers whereas field studies showed larger amplitude and smaller time lags in deeper units erskine 1991 trefry and johnston 1998 nevertheless tidal fluctuation in multi unit unconfined karst aquifers were scarcely studied and little is known regarding the role of conduit network in tidal propagation martin et al 2012 perriquet et al 2014 the objectives of this study are 1 to determine the vertical and horizontal extent of tidal propagation in a multi unit unconfined karst aquifer through analysis of continuous groundwater monitoring records and 2 to evaluate the feasibility and limitations of analytical equations for calculating the hydraulic parameter of highly heterogenous karst aquifers it is also expected the study can shed light on the potential role of fracture network in transmission of tidal fluctuation in aquifers 2 material and methods 2 1 study site the study site is located on the west coast of the florida peninsula and eastern side of the gulf of mexico fig 1 the study area lies within the physiographic regions of coastal swamps and gulf coastal lowlands which has a typical karst landscape with numerous springs sinkholes internal drainage and undulating topography the land altitudes gradually increase from sea level at the gulf coast to about 15 m above sea level along the eastern edge of the study area the long term mean annual rainfall is about 1 372 mm and ranged from 1 016 to 1 803 mm monthly rainfall is concentrated in june through september and heavily impacted by convective thunderstorms during summer and tropical storms during hurricane season the coastal springs and estuaries of west central florida provide a unique and important ecological setting for submerged aquatic vegetation benthos mollusks fish and manatees ecological integrity in spring fed estuaries is directly connected to salinity which is controlled by the quantity and quality of water discharging from the springs seasonal pattern of spring flow is generally proportional to the groundwater level in coastal aquifers and is affected primarily by rainfall induced recharge many of the springs are characterized as tidal controlled with discharge greatly affected by sea level variation yobbi 1992 knochenmus and yobbi 2001 chen 2012 menning et al 2015 2 2 hydrogeology the hydrological system is part of the coastal springs groundwater basin bounded by groundwater divides rather than topographic divides where the principal drainage is groundwater flow through springs and creeks and there is minimal surface drainage yobbi 1992 the weeki wachee springs groundwater basin in the north contains the weeki wachee main spring and numerous smaller springs including little wilderness salt mud hospital hole and jenkins springs fig 1 the weeki wachee main and little springs discharge freshwater and available data shows that spring flows are not influenced by tide salt mud and jenkins springs discharge brackish water and are tidally influenced the springs discharge to the weeki wachee river which meanders about 11 9 km to the gulf of mexico at bayport in hernando county florida most of the flow in the river is from weeki wachee main spring with average discharge of approximately 4 93 m3 s for the period of record knochenmus and yobbi 2001 the aripeka springs groundwater basin in the south contains many small springs including aripeka 1 aripeka 2 boat gator magnolia and bobhill springs which are clustered in a 2 5 km2 area fig 1 flow of the springs are tidally affected and discharge a mixture of saltwater and freshwater the spring discharge were collected by the hammock creek and then flows about 1 6 km to the gulf of mexico flow in hammock creek is tidally controlled knochenmus and yobbi 2001 menning et al 2015 the groundwater flow is part of the floridan aquifer system which is one of the most productive aquifer systems in the unites states and the primary water source for the rapidly increasing population and economy in the region it is predominantly carbonate sequence of the paleocene to lower miocene series ryder 1985 williams and kuniansky 2016 in the study area the hydrogeologic framework includes a discontinuous surficial aquifer sa system consisting of unconsolidated deposits of sand and clay and a thick carbonate upper floridan aquifer ufa exposed at or very near to the land surface fig 2 the ufa is largely unconfined and experiences rapid recharge and increased discharge following rainfall events yobbi 1992 knochenmus and yobbi 2001 the geologic units of ufa include the suwannee limestone of oligocene age the ocala limestone and the avon park formation of eocene age fig 2 field tests indicate that the suwannee limestone and ocala limestone have moderate to high porosity and permeability the more consolidated limestone near top of the avon park formation results in a low permeability zone under which is a high permeability zone start from about 125 m below land surface with extensive cavities fractures and other solution features the high permeability zone of the avon park formation is the deepest unit containing freshwater water and its bottom approximately 240 m below land surface coincides with the bottom of the ufa which is characterized by the persistent occurrence of evaporites yobbi 1992 knochenmus and yobbi 2001 the groundwater in ufa generally flows west to northwest from the high potential zone inland and discharges to the gulf of mexico as diffuse seepage along the coast or through springs recharge occurs as rapid infiltration through surficial deposits and drainage into sinkholes followed by fast flow through secondary porosity features such as conduits enhanced fracture zones or caverns within the limestone the discharge occurs in the form of upward flows through solution cavities to springs or diffusive upward leakage into coastal swamps or the near shore environment the freshwater saltwater transition zone has a diffusive interface parallel to the coast with landward reentrants at major springs yobbi 1992 menning et al 2015 2 3 data source sea water level data recorded at the aripeka coastal station arpf1 was downloaded from national data buoy center ndbc of national oceanic and atmospheric administration noaa https www ndbc noaa gov station page php station arpf1 station arpf1 fig 1 is a shore based tower station mounted on the south fork hammock creek bridge it is operated by the coastal ocean monitoring and prediction system comps of the university of south florida usf measured sea level time series at 6 minute intervals in the year 2019 were used in the tidal harmonic analysis sea level data at the bayport coastal station usgs 02310600 was obtained from the national water information system nwis https waterdata usgs gov nwis of united sates geological survey usgs measured sea level time series at 15 minute intervals in the year 2019 were used in the tidal harmonic analysis a one week subset of measured sea level variation at the tidal stations is illustrated in fig 3 the groundwater data in this study was measured in regional observation and monitor well program romp well sites which were constructed and operated to monitor the freshwater saltwater interface by the southwest florida water management district swfwmd hourly water level measurements have been continuously recorded with submersible pressure transducers at an operating precision of 1 5 mm since 1997 time series data of year 2019 were retrieved and used in this study location of the well sites are shown in fig 1 and the physical settings such as land surface elevation casing and total depth are given in table 1 the natural coast of this area is characterized by tidal flats extending many kilometers into the gulf and a lack of clear shoreline for our analysis the nearest tidal pool was identified on the high resolution aerial image of 2009 and the distances to the nearest tidal pool were measured for each monitoring well 2 4 water level analysis water levels measured at the tidal station and monitoring wells were all converted to north american vertical datum of 1988 navd 88 the measured time series of groundwater levels were detrended to eliminate low frequency fluctuations caused by natural and anthropogenic stresses such as rainfall evaporation groundwater withdrawal and aperiodic atmospheric pressure variations specifically 24 hour moving averages were subtracted from observed hourly time series to detect the diurnal semi diurnal tidal variations merritt 2004 an example of fortnight variation of measured and detrended groundwater level is illustrated in fig 4 for monitoring well 20850 romp tr18 3 avon park formation the detrended values of groundwater levels were used for the tidal harmonic analysis and hydraulic parameter estimation monitoring data along 2 transects from the gulf of mexico to inland were analyzed to quantify the impact of tidal dynamics on groundwater level of sa and ufa fig 1 groundwater level of the 5 monitoring wells 1 sa well and 4 ufa wells along the weeki wachee transect were compared with the sea level variation at bayport coastal station usgs 02310600 similarly the aripeka transect in the south has 9 monitoring wells 2 sa wells and 7 ufa wells and the measured groundwater levels were compared with sea level of the aripeka coastal station arpf1 there are 4 wells 20848 20846 20850 and 20847 opening to different geologic units at site romp 18 3 on the aripeka transect which was used to characterize the vertical distribution of tidal variations in the multi unit aquifers one week subsets of detrended groundwater level comparison with the measured tidal elevations are illustrated for selected wells in figs 5 and 6 cross correlations were performed to determine the time lagged interrelation of measured sea level with detrended groundwater levels schaff and richards 2014 the pearson correlation coefficient r were computed between time series pairs in 1 minutes time windows the time shift corresponding to the maximum r r lag were determined as the time lag t lag between the groundwater level and sea level linear regression was carried out between shifted groundwater level and sea level and the slope of regression was computed as the relative amplitude a r here we assume that the diurnal fluctuation of groundwater h gl is a linearly scaled signal of the corresponding sea level fluctuation h sl that can be expressed as h gl a r h sl n where n is uncorrelated noise 2 5 tidal harmonic analysis tidal harmonic constants were estimated by least square fitting of measured sea levels or detrended groundwater levels to the function 1 h t h 0 α i cos ω i t ϕ i where h is the tidal variation around mean sea level h 0 t is time α i is the amplitude of tidal constituent i ω i and ϕ i are the angular frequency and phase constants respectively the angular frequencies of tidal constituents ω i 2 π τ i where τ i are the periods of tidal constituents m2 12 42 h o1 25 82 h k1 23 93 h s2 12 h the analysis was carried out using utide code codiga 2011 in the initial analysis α i and ϕ i of 4 major tidal constituents m2 s2 o1 and k1 were estimated at each tidal station or groundwater well the solar component k1 and s2 may contain atmospheric pressure and is considered unsuitable for estimation of hydraulic parameters merritt 2004 therefore a second analysis was conducted where the time series were fitted with only two tidal constituents m2 and o1 to obtain α i and ϕ i the tidal variations at different sites were simulated using the computed harmonic constants example of simulated tidal fluctuations are illustrated in fig 3 for tidal stations and fig 4 for groundwater well tidal efficiency factor t e is defined as the tidal amplitude of the groundwater level α gl divided by that of the seawater level α sl 2 t e α gl α sl in addition the phase lag δ ϕ of each groundwater well is calculated as the difference between phase constants of groundwater level ϕ gl and seawater level ϕ sl 3 δ ϕ ϕ gl ϕ sl 2 6 calculation of aquifer diffusivity under the assumption of homogenous and isotropic aquifer with only horizontal flow the groundwater flow can be described with the 1d linear groundwater flow equation 4 h t d 2 h x 2 where h is the groundwater level x is the horizontal distance from observation wells to the nearest tidal pool d t s is the aquifer diffusivity where t is the transmissivity and s is the storativity the governing equation subject to tidal boundary condition in eq 1 at the ocean side x 0 and a constant groundwater level at the inland side 5a h 0 t h 0 α i cos ω i t ϕ i 5b h t h 0 eq 4 subject to boundary conditions specified in eq 5 was analytically solved jacob 1950 ferris 1951 6 h x t h 0 α i e x ω i 2 d c o s ω i t ϕ i x ω i 2 d eq 6 is commonly referenced as the jacob ferris equation which predicts that the tidal efficiency t e exponentially decays with inland distance 7 t e x e x ω i 2 d and the phase lag δ ϕ linearly increases with inland distance 8 δ ϕ x x ω i 2 d eqs 7 and 8 provide two ways of estimating aquifer diffusivity 9 d α x l n t e 2 ω i 2 10 d ϕ x δ ϕ 2 ω i 2 where d α and d ϕ are hydraulic diffusivity estimated from tidal efficiency or phase lag respectively merritt 2004 to apply the equations linear regression was conducted to calculate slopes b α of l n t e versus distance to shore x and then d α is calculated as 11 d α ω i 2 b α 2 similarly slope b ϕ is calculated from linear regression between phase lag δϕ and distance x then d ϕ is calculated as 12 d ϕ ω i 2 b ϕ 2 where b ϕ is the slope of linear regression between δ ϕ and x 3 results 3 1 landward tidal dissipation one year of measured groundwater levels for 3 floridan aquifer wells 20690 20893 20922 on the weeki wachee transect are shown in fig 7 a together with time series of tidal elevation at the bayport coastal station fortnight subsets of detrended groundwater levels are illustrated in fig 7b to compare the tidal amplitudes with sea level the tidal elevation at bayport station exhibited a clear semi diurnal pattern with diurnal fluctuation over 1 0 m fig 3a the monitoring well near the coast 20690 0 9 km inland and 0 83 km from the nearest tidal pool exhibited the largest fluctuation in response to the tidal wave with a diurnal fluctuation around 0 4 0 6 m figs 5a and 7b the patterns of groundwater level at wells further inland 20893 and 20922 mostly exhibited seasonal variation controlled by the regional weather patterns the monitoring well 20893 4 8 km inland and 3 7 km from tidal pool exhibited a damped diurnal variation about 0 10 0 15 m fig 5b and 7b the tidal signal is severely damped but still detectable at the most inland well 20922 7 2 km inland and 5 9 km from tidal pool with an amplitude around 0 010 0 015 m fig 5c and 7b detailed comparison of groundwater diurnal variation with sea level in fig 5 indicated increased phase shift as tidal waves propagated landward a time series regression with lagged variables was carried out to establish the cross correlation between groundwater and seawater levels the calculated time lagged correlation coefficients r lag relative amplitude a r and time lag t lag are given in table 2 strong correlation between the floridan aquifer water level and tidal variation are revealed by the high values of correlation coefficients groundwater well 20922 r lag 0 587 and 20927 r lag 0 613 with inland distances 5 km had significant correlation with the sea level at the bayport station the cross correlation analysis also exposed the fast propagation of tidal signals in this unconfined karst aquifer as shown by the values of time lag t lag the results suggest that it takes 1 6 h for the tidal wave to reach 5 7 km inland at site 20927 and the tidal amplitude at site 20927 is 0 74 of the ocean tide similarly measured groundwater levels for 4 floridan aquifer wells 20936 20850 20854 20841 on the aripeka transect displayed a landward attenuation of tidal fluctuation fig 8 however the tidal propagation along the aripeka transect is relatively slower and weaker than along the weeki wachee transect the tidal elevation at coastal station aripeka is close to that of the bayport station with similar amplitude and slight shift fig 3 at well 20936 1 4 km inland and 0 9 km to tidal pool a r 0 094 and t lag 0 92 h fig 6a and table 2 a weak tidal signal was detected at 8 3 km inland site 20841 with r lag 0 273 and a r 0 0031 and time lag is 2 92 h at site 20854 3 7 km inland and 2 2 km to tidal pool the tidal signal is 3 55 h behind the tidal station indicating the relatively slow propagation of tidal wave to this site away from spring consuits 3 2 tidal propagation in multi layer aquifer the diurnal fluctuation of groundwater level in all 3 surficial aquifer wells 20894 20848 20840 were below or near the detection limit the cross correlation analysis result in table 2 showed that there is a weak correlation between the groundwater level in well 20894 on the weeki wachee transect 4 8 km to shore and 2 1 m depth with sea level r lag 0 13 and a r 0 0044 no significant correlation between groundwater and sea level were detected for the two surficial wells 20848 and 20840 on the aripeka transect the result indicated that tidal variation was very weak or undetectable in surficial aquifer wells regardless of their distance to shore one year of measured groundwater levels for 4 wells 20848 20846 20850 20847 open to different hydrogeologic layers at the site romp 18 3 3 1 km inland and 2 2 km to tidal pool are illustrated in fig 9 a and fortnight subsets of detrended groundwater levels are depicted in fig 9b the 4 wells at different layers exhibited similar seasonal patterns in response to the recharge and evapotranspiration conditions fig 9a the groundwater elevation of surficial aquifer well 20848 casing depth of 2 1 m is slightly higher than the 3 upper floridan aquifer wells the 3 floridan aquifer monitoring wells 20846 20850 20847 at romp 18 3 2 2 km inland demonstrated vertical pattern of tidal fluctuation in the floridan aquifer fig 9b it is found that the well 20850 casing depth of 146 m and total depth of 155 m open to high permeable zone of the avon park formation has the strongest correlation with tidal signal r lag 0 888 with highest relative amplitude a r 0 080 and smallest time lag t lag 0 78 h at romp 18 3 fig 6b and table 2 the groundwater well 20846 casing depth of 18 m and total depth of 115 m open to the ocala limestone had a much smaller tidal amplitude a r 0 046 than that of the avon park formation the result indicated the tidal signal is preferentially propagated through the high permeable zone of the avon park formation comparison between the well 20937 casing depth of 47 m and total depth of 64 m and 20936 casing depth of 136 m and total depth of 146 m exhibited a similar pattern with the stronger tidal fluctuation in the avon park formation than the ocala limestone table 2 unfortunately there is no comparable well pairs between the avon park formation than the ocala limestone on the weeki wachee transect but the relative amplitude values in table 2 revealed that the 2 wells open to the avon park formation 20690 and 20893 had much larger tidal fluctuations than the 2 wells open to the ocala limestone 20922 and 20927 3 3 tidal amplitude and phase the amplitude α i and phase shift ϕ i of each tidal component were estimated from fitting the seawater level or detrended groundwater levels using the least square curve fitting method and the computed parameter values are given in tables 3 and 4 with the 95 confidence intervals tidal fluctuations using harmonic constants are displayed in fig 3 for sea levels example of groundwater tidal variation simulated using α i and ϕ i is depicted with the fortnight subset for well 20850 in fig 4 in this study two sets of harmonic constants were computed as expected using 4 tidal constituents m2 s2 o1 and k1 provided a better fitting than 2 tidal constituents m2 and o1 as exhibited by the higher correlation coefficients in table 3 than table 4 for corresponding time series the surficial aquifer wells 20894 20848 20840 failed to yield meaningful values of harmonic constants due to the limited tidal fluctuation significant correlation between simulated tidal variation and detrended groundwater level data revealed that the diurnal groundwater variation in floridan aquifer wells were impacted by the propagation of ocean tides calculated amplitude α i of two coastal tidal stations were close to each other and the values of tidal phase shift ϕ i show that the tides at aripeka is about 0 4 h ahead of bayport tides in the area are dominantly semi diurnal m2 tide α m 2 0 31 m followed k1 α k 1 0 14 m s2 α s 2 0 14 m and o1 α o 1 0 14 m the harmonic constants computed from observed sea level agrees well with the numerical simulation of he and weisberg 2002 computation with 4 tidal constituents table 3 or 2 constituents table 2 yielded similar values of α i and ϕ i for tidal constituents m2 and o1 the same is true for groundwater wells with much smaller fluctuations reflecting the robustness of the fitting algorithm and further verified that the groundwater variation is indeed caused by ocean tides codiga 2011 the tidal amplitudes α i estimated from the time series of groundwater levels exhibited the gradual attenuation of tidal fluctuations in floridan aquifer tables 3 and 4 the higher values of α i at wells close to the coast reflected the strong influence of ocean tides on the groundwater elevation the wells farther inland with diminished α i demonstrated the damping of tidal waves as it travels through the geological material the estimated tidal phase shift ϕ i demonstrated increased time lag of the tidal constituents m2 and o1 with landward distance but the ϕ i estimated for tidal constituents k1 and s2 are generally less reliable and the pattern is less clear which is probably due to the influence of atmospheric pressure merritt 2004 as a result values of α i and ϕ i estimated with m2 and o1 was used for estimating the hydraulic parameters 3 4 estimated aquifer diffusivities the tidal efficiency factor t e and phase lag δ ϕ of m2 and o1 tide was computed using the eqs 2 and 3 with harmonic constants in table 4 specifically t e for each of the floridan aquifer wells on the weeki wachee transect were calculated by dividing their α i with the α i of the bayport coastal station and α i of the wells on the apripeka transect were divided by α i of the aripeka station similarly δ ϕ were calculated from subtracting ϕ i of wells on the weeki wachee transect with ϕ i of the bayport station and ϕ i on the aripeka transect from ϕ i of the aripeka tidal station the calculated t e and δ ϕ are given in table 5 and plotted as a function of distance to nearest tidal pool in figs 10 and 11 furthermore t e and δ ϕ of wells at site romp 18 3 were plotted as a function of casing depth in fig 12 to illustrate the vertical variation as given in table 5 the values of tidal efficiency t e of m2 and o1 are close to each other while the δ ϕ of o1 tide is larger than the m2 tide furthermore the tidal efficiency t e of both m2 and o1 tide table 5 are slightly higher than a r calculated from cross correlation analysis table 2 the phase lag δ ϕ of m2 tide is close to the corresponding values of t lag in table 2 while δ ϕ of o1 tide is generally larger table 6 gives the aquifer diffusivities d α or d ϕ calculated using either t e with eq 9 or δ ϕ with eq 10 with linear regression of l n t e or δ ϕ with the distance to potential discharge location x the analysis was conducted separately on the two transects for different hydrogeologic units on the weeki wachee transect 4 wells 20690 20893 20922 and 20927 were used for the floridan aquifer 2 wells 20922 and 20927 for ocala limestone and 2 wells 20690 and 20893 for avon park formation on the aripeka transect 7 wells 20937 20936 20846 20850 20847 20854 and 20841 were used for floridan aquifer 2 wells 20937and 20846 for ocala limestone and 5 wells 20936 20850 20847 20854 and 20841 for avon park formation overall aquifer diffusivities were higher on the weeki wachee transect than that on the aripeka transect and the avon park formation had higher diffusivities than ocala limestone table 6 diffusivity calculated from time lag method d ϕ is 1 6 times higher than d α calculated from the tidal amplitudes in addition diffusivities d α calculated using amplitudes of m2 or o1 were close but the d ϕ calculated from phase lag of m2 was higher than that of o1 4 discussion observed diurnal variation of groundwater levels in this study reveal that tidal waves can propagate long distances 6 8 km inland in an unconfined karst aquifer tables 2 and 5 previous studies suggested that tidal fluctuations were generally damped very quickly as they travel in unconfined aquifer observed tidal fluctuation in siliciclastic aquifers often show amplitude ratio less than 1 at distances of tens to hundreds of meters nielsen 1990 erskine 1991 trefry and johnston 1998 mao et al 2006 abarca et al 2013 shuai et al 2017 trglavcnik et al 2018 which is attributed to the high specific yield of unconfined aquifers merritt 2004 however tidal waves can travel much further in unconfined karst aquifers due to their large hydraulic conductivity and lower storativity rotzoll et al 2008 2013 for example studies of rotzoll et al 2008 demonstrate that at 5 km to shore the o1 tide amplitude was 2 7 of the ocean tide and the time lag was around 2 h which is close to this study tables 2 and 5 the strong interaction between seawater and groundwater suggests that coast karst aquifers are especially susceptible to sea level change and saltwater migration martin et al 2012 perriquet et al 2014 xu et al 2016 multi level observation wells often show that the deeper part of the aquifer has larger tidal amplitude than the shallow layers erskine 1991 trefry and johnston 1998 ratner narovlansky et al 2020 the increased tidal amplitude with depth was suggested to be a result of the increased confinement and or decreased storativity trefry and johnston 1998 and the analytical models developed for the site suggested the leakage effects of the semi permeable peat layers guo et al 2007 the analytical solution recently developed by bakker 2019 demonstrates that the tidal signals travel much farther in deeper parts of a multi layer unconfined aquifer and the effect is enhanced with the presence of thin layers of low permeability which can partially explain the higher tidal amplitude at the avon park formation than the ocala limestone at site romp tr18 3 fig 12 however fig 12 shows the upper layer of the avon park formation well 20850 146 155 m below ground has larger tidal amplitude and lower phase lag than the lower avon park formation well 20847 180 190 m below ground this vertical pattern of tidal fluctuation suggests that the tidal wave transmits preferentially in the high permeability zone of the avon park formation and then propagate upward and downward to the layers above and below which is consistent with the conceptual understanding of the regional hydrogeology yobbi 1992 knochenmus and yobbi 2001 application of the jacob ferris equation often assumes a distinctive shoreline as the hydraulic contact with seawater to determine the distance x to ocean boundary however natural coasts are characterized by complex geomorphology where groundwater discharges into ocean through a range of point linear or diffusive features there are many tidal springs scattered on the coast fig 1 with a direct link to ufa through a complex network of subsurface conduits yobbi 1992 knochenmus and yobbi 2001 fleury et al 2007 menning et al 2015 in addition the regional potentiometric surface indicates there is a diffusive upward discharge through vast areas of coastal swamps ryder 1985 knochenmus and yobbi 2001 this composite pattern of hydraulic interaction through rapid flow in fracture networks and slow flow in bulk rock matrices brings a degree of uncertainty in estimation of hydraulic parameter through tidal method martin et al 2012 perriquet et al 2014 for example martin et al 2012 applied tidal amplitude method to island karst aquifers and reported that transmissivity of blue holes were 20 60 times higher than that of wells further theoretical and numerical modeling is warranted to elucidate the mechanisms of tidal interaction in dual permeability aquifers amplitude based diffusivity d α were consistent for the lunar semi diurnal m2 and diurnal o1 tides whereas diffusivity derived from time lag d ϕ varied considerably between m2 and o1 tide table 6 assuming linear wave propagation the jacob ferris equation eq 7 predicts that semi diurnal tide dissipated more quickly with less time lag than diurnal tide rotzoll et al 2008 however in highly heterogenous karst aquifers turbulent flow in subsurface conduits might be an important or even dominant pathway for the transmission of tidal energies martin et al 2012 perriquet et al 2014 nonlinear wave interaction might arise in such situations and cause the departure from the jacob ferris equation xin et al 2015 hydraulic diffusivity estimated from the amplitude ratio method d α and the time lag method d ϕ demonstrated significant differences table 6 many studies have reported that the jacob ferris equation yields inconsistent diffusivities depending on whether amplitudes or lags are used ferris 1951 erskine 1991 trefry and johnston 1998 trefry and bekele 2004 rotzoll et al 2008 trglavcnik et al 2018 and suggested explanations in terms of depth dependence of storativities phreatic influences or internal layering in hydraulic conductivities although without conclusive evidence trefry and bekele 2004 defined d α d ϕ as slope factor to measure the departure from the ideal jacob ferris model for tidal wave propagation depending on tidal components hydrogeologic layers and transects the slope factor in our study varied between 0 38 and 1 4 which falls in the range of literature values trefry and bekele 2004 the slope factors for most wells were below unity which indicated the tidal waves propagate faster than predicted by the analytical equation for 1 d homogeneous groundwater flow perriquet et al 2014 suggested that ratio of d α d ϕ negatively correlates with the contribution of matrix flow relative to conduit flow and classified the hydrodynamic environment into matrix d ϕ d α fissure intermediate d α d ϕ and conduit d ϕ d α our results in table 6 indicated that the conduit flow is more prominent in the avon park formation than in the ocala limestone in the unconfined ufa the tidal flow likely first propagates through the dissolved conduits and fractures in high permeable zone of the avon park formation and then expressed in the matrix of hydrogeologic layers above and below submarine springs at the ocean end of the conduit networks might be an important interface between seawater and groundwater menning et al 2015 xu et al 2016 our analysis indicates that dispersivities calculated from the amplitude of dominant tidal component d α m2 provided most robust estimates of the aquifer characteristics of the ufa 1 1 107 and 7 1 106 m2 d 1 for the weeki wachee and aripeka transects respectively assuming a storativity s of 5 10 3 based on the range 5x10 4 to 5x10 2 reported for ufa southwest florida water management district 2018 the transmissivity t were calculated as 5 5 104 and 3 6 104 m2 d 1 for weeki wachee and aripeka transects respectively given a total ufa thickness of 250 m fig 2 the hydraulic conductivity values were estimated as 220 and 143 m d for weeki wachee and aripeka transects respectively karst aquifers are known for their extremely high heterogeneity and estimation of hydraulic properties is a challenging task due to the complex and dual porosity flows in the studied area reported values of ufa transmissivity from aquifer performance test or slug test ranged 5 orders of magnitude from 21 to 1 5 105 m2 d 1 which is typical of karst aquifers with extensive conduits williams and kuniansky 2016 at regional scale the hydraulic parameters adopted for groundwater flow computation need to combine estimates from pumping test with analysis of potentiometric surface and further refined through model calibration transmissivity values of 4 6 104 m2 d 1 for weeki wachee and 1 6 104 m2 d 1 for aripeka were used by knochenmus and yobbi 2001 in estimation of spring flow and similar values are reported in other floridan aquifer studies ryder 1985 williams and kuniansky 2016 in this study the transmissivity estimated from tidal method is remarkably close to that used in regional groundwater flow models ryder 1985 yobbi 1992 knochenmus and yobbi 2001 williams and kuniansky 2016 it demonstrated that the tidal method could provide a combined characteristic of the aquifer over a large distance trefry and bekele 2004 for highly heterogenous karst aquifers this is especially an advantage over pumping tests which measure aquifer properties at limited distances the tidal analysis could serve as a valuable tool in developing groundwater models for coastal aquifers 5 conclusions cross correlation of high frequency fluctuation in groundwater level with tidal level provided insight into the hydrogeologic structures of a multi layer coastal karst aquifer system propagation of tidal signals was observed along the two transects at inland distance up to 7 8 km with a short time lag 1 3 h the tidal fluctuation in the multi unit aquifer indicated that the tidal wave preferentially transmitted in the highly permeable zone of the avon park formation analysis of the hydrogeologic condition suggested there were complex seawater groundwater interfaces including a preferential pathway through subsurface conduits to coastal springs and a diffusive upward leakage into coastal swamps dual permeability transmission appeared to be a significant process linking groundwater levels in karst aquifers with the ocean forces the jacob ferris equation was successfully employed to quantitatively estimate the aquifer diffusivity and the calculated values were close to that in the regional groundwater flow models for highly heterogeneous karst aquifers tidal methods provide a composite description of the hydraulic properties over a long distance which is more accurate in characterizing regional flow than the pumping based aquifer test techniques further theoretical and numerical investigation of the dual permeability flow is warranted for the better understanding of the karst aquifer response to ocean forces and more effective management of

4342,identification of flood prone sites in urban environments is necessary but there is insufficient hydraulic information and time series data on surface runoff to date several attempts have been made to apply deep learning models for flood hazard mapping in urban areas this study evaluated the capability of convolutional neural network nnetc and recurrent neural network nnetr models for flood hazard mapping a flood inundation inventory including 295 flooded sites was used as the response variable and 10 flood affecting factors were considered as the predictor variables flooded sites were then spatially randomly split in a 70 30 ratio for building flood models and for validation purposes the prediction quality of the models was validated using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve auc and root mean square error rmse the validation results indicated that prediction performance of the nnetc model auc 84 rmse 0 163 was slightly better than that of the nnetr model auc 82 rmse 0 186 both models indicated that terrain ruggedness index was the most important predictor followed by slope and elevation although the model output had a relative error of up to 20 based on auc this modeling approach could still be used as a reliable and rapid tool to generate a flood hazard map for urban areas provided that a flood inundation inventory is available keywords flood inundation cities gis deep learning predictors 1 introduction in urban areas floods typically cause significant loss of life and material damage due to the high density of residents and property karamouz et al 2011 cherqui et al 2015 zhao et al 2020 urban floods disrupt communication power and transportation systems and thus essential supply chains anni et al 2020 between 2001 and 2018 floods caused 66 078 deaths worldwide and affected 1 4 billion people they also caused damages estimated at usd 309 4 billion un water 2020 urban areas are of particular concern as the urban population is expected to increase from the current level of 55 of world s population to 60 by 2030 and 66 by 2050 moreover asian cities are among the fastest growing urban agglomerations in the world un water 2020 in recent years increases in the severity and frequency of urban flooding have been recorded they are driven by extreme weather rapid urbanization and climate change anni et al 2020 floods in urban areas are generally triggered by intense rainfall which is a major concern given the changes in rainfall patterns expected in response to future climate change easterling et al 2000 expansion of impervious surfaces e g construction of buildings and roads has major impacts on rainfall runoff processes as they decrease infiltration and water retention capacity kalantari et al 2017 ferreira et al 2018 the ability of artificial drainage systems to rapidly transport runoff from urban areas is a critical parameter affecting the impacts of urban flooding table 1 accurate flood susceptibility mapping can provide meaningful information to support flood mitigation and management decisions although urban hydrology has been studied for decades the complex interactions between hydrological hydrometeorological and land surface factors and their roles in urban flooding remain unclear nguyen and bae 2020 to manage floods effectively and prevent loss of human life and property identification of flood prone zones is urgently needed lee et al 2017 wang et al 2019 flood susceptibility mapping methods have improved over the years following advances in remote sensing artificial intelligence computational capacity and geographic information systems at present such maps are largely based on flood inventories bivariate and multivariate statistical relationships between hydrological datasets kalantari et al 2019 and the results of physically based models zhang and pan 2014 however these approaches require large amounts of data that are difficult to collect in urban areas they also assume predefined relationships between controlling factors and flood occurrence that may not adequately describe the nonlinear dynamic characteristics of floods which introduces uncertainty into the evaluation results rahmati et al 2019 in recent years machine learning has been coupled with geospatial analyses and applied in numerous studies related to flood vulnerability mapping machine learning uses computer algorithms to evaluate information and develop predictions by being trained with a specially developed dataset this approach is particularly useful in data scarce areas several machine learning algorithms including support vector machines rahmati et al 2020 artificial neural networks michielsen et al 2016 falah et al 2019 and random forest classification wang et al 2019 have been successfully applied in flood modeling studies such models predict susceptibility to flood hazards based on the statistical relationship between causal factors and inundation events obtaining information directly from the data with only one assumption future floods will occur under similar circumstances as past floods xu et al 2018 zhao et al 2020 machine learning approaches achieve better results than other flood susceptibility assessment methods although their performance varies with the algorithm used wang et al 2019 several machine learning models have also been employed to enhance flood management strategies by accurately predicting streamflow shiri and kisi 2010 shiri et al 2012 nourani et al 2014 karimi et al 2018 petty and dhingra 2018 the development of models capable of predicting watershed streamflow is a growing endeavor in flood risk research but this is beyond the scope of this study the drawbacks of conventional models for analyzing big data have recently been overcome by using deep learning which can automatically extract image features and represents an important advance the deep learning approach greatly minimizes the dimensions of parameters in neural networks during the training phase and this produces more reliable disaster risk maps one of the most popular deep learning models is convolutional neural network nnetc it has been applied in flood susceptibility assessment in agricultural wang et al 2019 and urban zhao et al 2020 watersheds in china recently panahi et al 2021 identified the flood prone areas of an agricultural watershed in golestan province iran using nnetc and recurrent neural networks nnetr since an urban watershed is dominated by pavement streets buildings and parking areas its hydrological function and structural characteristics are very different from those of agricultural forested and mountainous watersheds on the other hand urban environments usually lack hydrometric stations and hydrological information is limited they are known to be data scarce areas a barrier to using nnetc for urban flood susceptibility modeling is that its efficiency in this area of application has not been fully investigated zhao et al 2020 more importantly the efficiency of nnetr has not yet been assessed however several remote sensing studies e g li et al 2019 peng et al 2019 have sought to classify satellite images for identifying flood extent in addition the nnetc model has been applied for rainfall runoff simulation in urban areas kimura et al 2020 guo et al 2021 these two applications were also beyond the scope of this work the main goal of this study was to map flood susceptibility in seoul south korea where flooding is the most common natural disaster experience major floods have been recorded in recent years park et al 2020 previous studies in the region have mapped flood susceptibility using boosted tree and random forest models lee et al 2017 in this study a new methodological framework using a deep learning approach was developed to improve urban flood inundation mapping the main hypothesis tested in this study was that deep learning models can efficiently identify zones of flood inundation in an urban watershed key objectives of the work were to evaluate the capability of the nnetc and nnetr models for mapping flood susceptibility in seoul compare their efficiency in terms of goodness of fit and predictive performance and determine the importance of various causal drivers of urban flooding the main novel feature and contribution of this study is that it demonstrates that the complicated conditions of urban flood inundation in the context of limited data can be overcome by modeling using nnetc and nnetr 2 study area seoul the capital of south korea has an approximate area of 605 km2 and 9 7 million residents making it a densely populated city ha et al 2009 this megacity is located at about 37 5 n and 127 0 e fig 1 it is surrounded by mountains with heights ranging from 111 to 836 m eum 2008 since the early 2000 s the south korean government has sought to transform seoul into competitive global megacity kim and han 2012 this highly developed city is now among the major cities in asia hales et al 2018 in recent years its population has stabilized due to the high cost of housing and to a program to control city sprawl through the formation of satellite cities near seoul lee et al 2018 annual precipitation in seoul 1200 1600 mm is higher than that in other areas at the same latitude due to its monsoon climate roughly 65 of annual rainfall occurs during the summer which can lead to flooding kim et al 2016 due to topography and limited drainage capacity lower lying areas of seoul have the highest flood risk shin and park 2014 moreover the existing retention and drainage infrastructure is inadequate for extreme precipitation events therefore additional stormwater management procedures are needed kato and

importance of variables section 3 4 3 1 database construction 3 1 1 flood inundation inventory the locations of flood inundation from 2018 to 2020 were recorded using a gps device a flood inundation map was created that included 295 inundated locations the flood inundation dataset was randomly split into two datasets for training 70 of data n 207 and validation 30 of data n 88 fig 1 the training data were used to build and calibrate the model and the validation data were used to evaluate the accuracy of the model wang et al 2019 accuracies of modeling based on training and validation data are referred to as goodness of fit and predictive skill respectively spatial modeling with machine learning requires flood present 1 and flood absent 0 location data termeh et al 2018 darabi et al 2019 approximately equal numbers of flood present and flood absent locations is recommended for flood inundation mapping tehrany et al 2014 zhao et al 2019 3 1 2 factors controlling flood inundation to predict flood probability in this environment we selected 10 predictor variables also referred to as explanatory factors based on field observations and a literature review fernández and lutz 2010 rahmati et al 2019 zhao et al 2019 these variables were elevation slope slope length factor slf topographic wetness index twi curvature stream power index spi topographic position index tpi distance to the river terrain ruggedness index tri and land use rainfall was not included as a predictor variable because the study area was small in area and thus the spatial variation in rainfall was relatively low previous studies have similarly opted not to use rainfall distribution for urban flood hazard assessment fernandez and lutz 2010 gigović et al 2017 sepehri et al 2019 3 1 2 1 elevation elevation can affect rainfall characteristics and the direction of runoff sanders 2007 a digital elevation model dem with 2 m spatial resolution was extracted from the topographical database elevation ranged from 5 to 807 m fig 3 a 3 1 2 2 slope slope is an important cause of inundation and it influences water flow direction in this study slope data were derived from the dem using arcgis 10 2 slope varied from 0 to 84 it was highest in the northern part of the city which includes bukhansan national park fig 3b 3 1 2 3 slope length factor slf slf is one of the most important ways to describe the effects of topography and hydrology on soil erosion moore et al 1991 it is a secondary factor calculated from the slope gradient and length rodríguez and suárez 2010 slf was calculated using saga gis software with the following equation moore et al 1991 1 slf a s 22 13 0 4 sin β 0 0896 1 3 where as is the upstream contributing area m2 and β is the slope in a given cell degrees slf values in the study area ranged from 0 to 266 fig 3c 3 1 2 4 curvature curvature is the morphometry of local topography and describes changes in slope inclination wilson and gallant 2000 positive and negative values represent convex and concave areas respectively and values of zero indicate flat areas curvature influences the convergence or divergence of water during downslope flow concave curvature retains more water thus increasing the risk of flooding rejith et al 2019 a curvature map of the study area was produced using saga gis software fig 3d 3 1 2 5 stream power index spi spi which estimates the erosive power of surface runoff encompasses slope degree and catchment area burrough and mcdonnell 1998 both of which influence flood occurrence khosravi et al 2018 spi is a major factor controlling channel widening and thereby influences flooding righini et al 2017 spi was calculated using the following equation 2 spi a s t a n β where as is the upstream contributing area m2 and β is the slope in a given cell degrees spi values in the study area ranged from 0 to 11 fig 3e 3 1 2 6 topographic position index tpi tpi indicates the difference between the elevation of a focal cell and the mean elevation of neighboring cells tpi was calculated using the following equation eq 3 guisan et al 1999 mokarrama and hojati 2018 popa et al 2019 3 tpi z 0 1 n z n n where zn is the elevation of cells m within the local window z0 is the elevation of the cell under evaluation m and n is the total number of neighboring cells employed in the evaluation since a 3 3 filter was used n was eight in this study the tpi value in the study area varied from 148 to 51 fig 3f positive values of tpi indicate that the focal cell is higher than adjacent areas while negative values denote a focal cell that is lower than adjacent areas as generally occurs in valleys de reu et al 2013 zero values of tpi indicate flat areas weiss 2001 3 1 2 7 terrain ruggedness index tri tri is useful for flood inundation modeling riley et al 1999 flat areas have a value of zero whereas strong positive tri values are found in mountain areas with steep ridges tpi represents the roughness of the surface which along with the objects on it e g vegetation buildings creates hydrodynamic friction dorn et al 2014 a tri map was produced using saga gis tri values in the study area ranged from 0 to 204 fig 3g 3 1 2 8 topographic wetness index twi twi is used to estimate hydrological responses to topographic characteristics beven and kirkby 1979 mokarrama and hojati 2018 or to map spatial patterns of soil moisture raduła et al 2018 twi is a function of the upstream contributing area α and slope degree tan θ 4 twi ln α t a n θ in the study area twi ranged from 0 52 to 10 79 fig 3h with higher values indicating wetter areas 3 1 2 9 distance to the river riverbanks and flood plains are at the highest risk of inundation so distance to the nearest river is important when modeling floods predick and turner 2008 mignot et al 2019 euclidean distances to the han river system were calculated as continuous values from 0 to 204 m in the study area fig 3j distance to the river was generated using the flow direction and euclidian distance functions in arcgis 10 2 3 1 2 10 land use runoff conditions vary considerably among different land use and land cover patterns darabi et al 2019 built up areas generate more surface runoff than vegetated areas tehrany et al 2015a therefore land use is a key factor in flood risk beckers et al 2013 we identified seven land use classes in the study area public residential manufacturing commercial recreational traffic and other fig 3k more information is provided table 2 all of the input layers predictor variables were standardized before being used in the models 3 1 3 correlation analysis although predictor variables were selected from a review of the literature review the spatial autocorrelation of these variables was a concern autocorrelated predictors can lead to significant overfitting meyer et al 2019 in this study pearson s correlation test was run using the band collection statistics tool in arcgis 10 2 table 3 the analysis revealed that there were no statistically significant correlations between predictor variables p 0 05 3 2 urban flood hazard mapping 3 2 1 application of convolutional neural network nnetc models the nnetc model uses deep learning and has shown promise for image classification and recognition hu et al 2015 the basic architecture of a nnetc comprises a feature extraction layer containing a pooling layer and a convolutional layer and a feature mapping layer or fully connected layer the convolutional layer consists of convolution units parameters optimized using a back propagation algorithm kang et al 2019 the convolution step considers the features of predictive variables and determines their weights the input and output for each stage in the model architecture are sets of arrays referred to as feature maps for example if the input is a two dimensional image x the input is first decomposed into a sequential array of x x1 x2 xn the convolutional layer is defined as 5 y i f b j i k ij x i where yj is the jth output for the convolutional layer xi refers to each input feature map kij represents the convolutional kernel with the ith predictive variable designated xi bj is a trainable bias and f denotes the nonlinear function the size of the feature map output from the convolutional layer is reduced by the pooling layer through down sampling this process can ultimately improve the overfitting problem with the model while sharply reducing the computation cost in the absence of changes to the structure of the image when the amount of input data is very large the pooling layer retains the most crucial information and reduces the number of parameters there are various types of pooling layers e g max average sum and so forth max pooling a frequent subsampling layer reduces the size of the convolutional layer output by computing the maximum value for each patch of the feature map leading to considerable improvement in detection of important features gopalakrishnan et al 2017 in fact the output of the max pooling layer contains the key information from the previous stage kumar and hati 2020 the last layer in the nnetc architecture the fully connected layer contains neurons which integrate the features obtained from multiple feature maps extracted by the convolutional layer using a softmax activation function the output vector is mapped to values between 0 and 1 that indicate the predicted probability of this category kang et al 2019 3 2 2 application of recurrent neural network nnetr models nnetr models are artificial neural networks with recurrent connections that analyze large datasets to make predictions bengio et al 1994 these models have a memory of past results which is beneficial for predicting time dependent objectives nnetr models are well suited to supervised learning problems where the dataset has a sequential nature the aim of supervised learning is to predict future results from past data a training set containing a given target an output and several input variables can be used to predict target values the final outputs of an artificial neural network can be continuous regression or categorical classification petneházi 2019 nnetr models use high dimensionality hidden states with non linear dynamics sutskever et al 2011 they can be used to extract dynamic behaviors from complex systems based on internal recurrence and can be trained to understand time varying or sequential patterns chang et al 2014 nnetr models have been used to forecast hydrological processes e g water level prediction as they are able to learn and model nonlinear relationships ren et al 2020 hidden states act as the memory of the network and the state of the hidden layer at any given time is dependent on its previous state mikolov et al 2006 input recurrent hidden and output layers comprise the nnetr the input layer has n input units and the inputs are a sequence of vectors through time t xt 1 xt xt 1 the input data are connected to the hidden layer the hidden layer has m hidden units ht h1 h2 hm which are connected to each other through time with recurrent connections sutskever et al 2013 the hidden layer defines the state space or memory of the system as 6 h t f h 0 t 7 0 t w ih x t w hh h t 1 b h where fh defines the hidden layer activation function and bh refers to the bias vector of the hidden units the hidden units and output layer are connected through weighted connections called who the output layer has p units yt y1 y2 yp which are calculated 8 y t f o w ho h t b 0 where fo refers to the activation function and bo defines the bias vector in the output layer sutskever et al 2011 3 3 evaluation of model accuracy the growing availability of numerous learning algorithms with differing success rates has made the task of appropriate model selection crucially important and highlights the need for evaluation criteria wu and flach 2005 the receiver operating characteristic roc curve is a popular technique for accuracy evaluation of binary classification models gajowniczek et al 2014 the roc curve is a confusion matrix with four categories of data true negatives tn data correctly regarded as negative true positives tp data correctly regarded as positive false negatives fn data incorrectly regarded as negative and false positives fp data incorrectly regarded as positive davis and goadrich 2006 model performance metrics such as the true positive rate tpr the proportion of instances labeled positive that were correctly predicted which is plotted on the y axis and false positive rate fpr the proportion of instances labeled positive that were incorrectly labeled as negative which is plotted on x axis are derived from the confusion matrix the upper left hand corner of the roc curve where fpr is 0 and tpr is 1 is the optimal point on the roc curve eqs 9 and 10 define the area under the roc curve auc 9 x 1 s p e c i f i c i t y 1 tn fp t n 10 y s e n s i t i v i t y tp tp f n auc was used to determine the accuracy of the models tested in this study yesilnacar 2005 classified the relationship between the auc value and the predictive skill of models as poor average good very good and excellent using the categories 0 5 0 6 0 6 0 7 0 7 0 8 0 8 0 9 and 0 9 1 0 respectively root mean square error rmse was calculated as a complementary metric using the equation 11 rmse i 1 n f i f i 2 n where f is the estimated flood susceptibility f is the observed flood susceptibility and n is the total number of flooded sites like the auc metric rmse was calculated for each model in both the training and validation steps 3 4 importance of variables machine learning models allow the importance of predictor variables to be estimated based on contribution analysis williamson et al 2021 the importance of variables was investigated using the method proposed by xia et al 2021 which focuses on the values of the global max pooling layer and weights in the output layer the importance of variables was determined for both models 4 results 4 1 urban flood susceptibility mapping the aim of this study was to map flood prone areas in seoul utilizing the nnetc and nnetr approaches to achieve this goal thematic layers of 10 flood related factors elevation slope slf curvature spi tpi tri twi distance to the river and land use were overlaid with 70 of the flooded points that comprised the training set the flood risk maps were categorized areas into five classes by flood potential very high high moderate low or very low which covered respectively 20 24 21 05 19 2 19 63 and 19 88 of the nnetc map and 20 6 19 59 20 21 19 72 and 19 88 of the nnetr model results fig 4 these maps show that nearly 40 of the study area is likely to be affected by flooding visually it is apparent that the flood points in both the testing and training groups agreed with the predicted flood maps 4 2 accuracy assessment based on auc values the accuracies of the models produced in the training and validation steps were very good fig 5 in the training step auc values of 86 and 84 were obtained for the nnetc and nnetr models respectively fig 5a it can be concluded that there was good agreement between flood locations training group and environmental factors however training flood locations were used in construction of the model so the accuracy of the training phase does not represent the performance of the model therefore validation data were used for the final assessment for this purpose the nnetc and nnetr flood maps generated were overlaid with 30 of the flood locations initially set aside for validation the auc values were 84 nnetc and 82 nnetr for the validation step fig 5b demonstrating strong performance of both models in predicting flood hazard probability the rmse values confirmed the goodness of fit and predictive performance of the models fig 6 in the training step the nnetc and nnetr models had rmse values of 0 147 and 0 158 respectively fig 6e 6g these results indicate excellent goodness of fit between the training dataset and predictor variables in the validation analysis fig 6l 6k nnetc rmse 0 163 showed better predictive performance than the nnetr model rmse 0 186 overall both evaluation metrics indicated good agreement and in comparison nnetc was the better model 4 3 variable importance according to the nnetc model tri is the most important factor in flood inundation in seoul with a contribution value of 16 17 in modeling fig 7 it was followed by slope 15 5 elevation 13 4 and twi 12 92 fig 7a land use 9 22 sfl 9 84 tpi 7 93 and plan curvature 6 72 made medium contributions in flood inundation modeling using nnetc the lowest contributions were made by spi 4 76 and distance to river 3 9 results for the nnetr model were similar in terms of relative importance fig 7b according to nnetr tri 14 87 slope 13 59 and elevation 11 7 were the most important predictor variables in urban flood hazard mapping of the study area twi land use sfl tpi and plan curvature made moderate contributions to the modeling like the nnetc model spi 6 66 and distance to river 6 21 made the lowest contributions to urban flood modeling with the nnetr model 5 discussion 5 1 urban flood susceptibility maps flooding causes significant fatalities and properties globally it is probably the most devastating and widespread natural disaster affecting humanity teng et al 2017 urban areas have higher flood risk due to the large proportion of rainfall that becomes runoff sato 2006 mignot et al 2019 moreover urban growth has continuously encroached into spaces that rivers use for excess flows tockner et al 2010 the quality of life in urban areas is dependent on the availability of services and on energy and water provisioning accommodation education and employment urban flooding causes significant disruption of such services and thus has a major secondary impact on urban residents hammond et al 2015 as it is impossible to prevent the occurrence of these extreme events application of flood management strategies is crucial through precise analysis of previously flooded locations flood prone areas can be identified and damages can be reduced through mitigative measures flood susceptibility mapping is a widely used strategy for managing future floods kourgialas and karatzas 2011 urban flood vulnerability maps are also useful tools for planning urban land uses additionally such maps can help engineers identify the areas that are most in need of discharge infrastructure büchele et al 2006 flood inundation due to extreme rainfall events has been documented throughout seoul s history this megacity has a high concentration of political economic and other urban activities combined with high population density and complex buildings and underground networks there is a high potential for considerable economic losses in future floods in this study two deep learning models nnetc nnetr were used to generate flood susceptibility maps of seoul to support land use planning and flood risk mitigation efforts based on the susceptibility maps generated most of the study area possess high flood risk therefore seoul should receive the attention of scientists and government authorities to improve planning and mitigate flood risk to protect human life property and the immense infrastructure of this city otherwise even small floods will continue to pose the prospects for major disasters 5 2 flood influencing factors the results of this study indicate that tri slope elevation and twi are the most important predictors of urban flooding in seoul they are followed by land use sfl tpi plan curvature spi and proximity to the river strong and significant relationships between flood occurrence and certain environmental variables are revealed by the final flood susceptibility maps floods are more likely to occur in areas characterized by lower tri lower slope lower elevation and higher twi values high twi values are strongly correlated with floodplain development naito and cairns 2011 hong et al 2018 our findings are supported by previous studies conducted in the area even though different predictor variables were used in this study lee et al 2018 higher slopes increase flow velocity but flooding is unlikely to occur on steep slopes li et al 2012 instead steep slopes cause flooding downstream and increase the destructive power of floods eini et al 2020 flat areas have little resistance to flow making them more prone to flooding especially in coastal areas flooding in seoul is predicted to occur in areas of moderate slope and low elevation higher twi occurs in large areas with low slopes places that are more likely to flood lee et al 2017 created flood susceptibility maps of seoul using boosted tree and random forest models and showed that flooding is more likely in areas of lower elevation similar observations have been made worldwide as discussed by li et al 2012 low lying areas are highly prone to flooding and such areas also tend to have high population density which increases exposure of people to floods slope length influences the time required for a molecule of water to flow from the top of a catchment to its outlet and therefore influences flood risk rodríguez and suárez 2010 tehrany et al 2015b similarly concluded that floods are more likely to occur in areas with low slopes and concave curvature and that floods primarily occur at low elevations nearer riverbanks 5 3 comparison of model performance the capabilities of the nnetc model for modeling urban floods had not been investigated extensively zhao et al 2020 more importantly never had the nnetr model been applied to mapping flood susceptibility our results indicate that both the nnetc and nnetr models performed very well very good based on the accuracy classification in yesilnacar 2005 there was a slight difference in the accuracies of the models but the nnetc model was revealed to be more accurate in both the training and validation steps regarding model efficiency previous research had shown that the random forest and support vector machine models were the benchmarks for flood susceptibility mapping tehrany et al 2015b lee et al 2017 based on our results we can strongly recommend the nnetc and nnetr models for accurate visualization of flood occurrence to enable risk mitigation and planning to protect life and property the validation analysis supports the hypothesis that deep learning models can efficiently determine the distribution of flood inundation in an urban watershed and that both nnetc and nnetr are suitable for flood inundation analysis in urban settings the nnetc model as explained by hussain et al 2020 has the benefit of reducing the number of parameters required for the convolutional layer by sharing the same convolution kernel among all spatial locations this organization of convolution kernels promotes accurate learning wu 2020 previous studies have shown that nnetc models can learn invariant representations and can achieve human level performance with adequate training data and that these models can acquire representations from grid like data khan et al 2020 the nnetc model as a state of the art machine learning approach has performed excellently in relating to pattern recognition and computer vision wu 2020 nnetr models have also achieved breakthroughs in numerous sequence and series based learning tasks and in language processing image captioning and speech recognition socher et al 2011 graves et al 2013 mao et al 2014 nnetr is known to perform well in learning tasks based on successive input data and the nnetr architecture is capable of modeling time series data wherein each time step depends on those that preceded it furthermore nnetr can handle variable length inputs eliminating the need for padding inputs in contrast the multilayer perceptron and nnetc approaches are constrained by the sizes of inputs and outputs and the numbers of layers and computational steps factors affecting the precision of a model can be investigated using the embedded functions of machine learning which identify underlying correlations in a dataset and make decisions without explicit instructions thereby obtaining results with very low uncertainty khan et al 2020 moreover machine learning allows model systems to learn from past data recognize patterns and make predictions for urban systems with minimal human interaction this method can provide computers with the ability to learn and make decisions without explicit programming using such methods computers can change programs when exposed to new data although some research has shown that the accuracy of machine learning models can fluctuate with respect to different training validation datasets xu and mannor 2012 jalal shiri et al 2020 naser shiri et al 2020 it was beyond the scope of this study to scrutinize the effects of different training and validation data on the robustness of the models 6 conclusions flooding in seoul is increasing most recent floods have affected roads in the inner city or in residential areas and have caused deaths and damage to property therefore flood susceptibility assessment is crucial for predicting the future disasters this study applied nnetc and nnetr models to identify areas of high flood risk within seoul south korea the following conclusions were drawn the validation tests demonstrated that the nnetc model auc 84 rmse 0 163 outperformed the nnetr model auc 82 rmse 0 186 therefore the nnetc model can be used to map flood susceptibility in urban areas where hydraulic based models are not appropriate due to data scarcity however the efficiency of both models is very good and both are robust and can be used for urban flood management therefore application of both is highly recommended in future research as they provide rapid low cost results tri was identified as the most important factor affecting urban flood risk in seoul slope elevation twi land use slf and tpi were secondarily important influencing factors these factors should be analyzed by before construction of new infrastructure and housing projects other factors curvature spi distance to river made weak or moderate contributions to the models both models successfully predicted flood prone areas in seoul but further research is needed to determine the efficiency of their use in other urban areas more work is needed to determine the effects of different training and testing

4342,identification of flood prone sites in urban environments is necessary but there is insufficient hydraulic information and time series data on surface runoff to date several attempts have been made to apply deep learning models for flood hazard mapping in urban areas this study evaluated the capability of convolutional neural network nnetc and recurrent neural network nnetr models for flood hazard mapping a flood inundation inventory including 295 flooded sites was used as the response variable and 10 flood affecting factors were considered as the predictor variables flooded sites were then spatially randomly split in a 70 30 ratio for building flood models and for validation purposes the prediction quality of the models was validated using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve auc and root mean square error rmse the validation results indicated that prediction performance of the nnetc model auc 84 rmse 0 163 was slightly better than that of the nnetr model auc 82 rmse 0 186 both models indicated that terrain ruggedness index was the most important predictor followed by slope and elevation although the model output had a relative error of up to 20 based on auc this modeling approach could still be used as a reliable and rapid tool to generate a flood hazard map for urban areas provided that a flood inundation inventory is available keywords flood inundation cities gis deep learning predictors 1 introduction in urban areas floods typically cause significant loss of life and material damage due to the high density of residents and property karamouz et al 2011 cherqui et al 2015 zhao et al 2020 urban floods disrupt communication power and transportation systems and thus essential supply chains anni et al 2020 between 2001 and 2018 floods caused 66 078 deaths worldwide and affected 1 4 billion people they also caused damages estimated at usd 309 4 billion un water 2020 urban areas are of particular concern as the urban population is expected to increase from the current level of 55 of world s population to 60 by 2030 and 66 by 2050 moreover asian cities are among the fastest growing urban agglomerations in the world un water 2020 in recent years increases in the severity and frequency of urban flooding have been recorded they are driven by extreme weather rapid urbanization and climate change anni et al 2020 floods in urban areas are generally triggered by intense rainfall which is a major concern given the changes in rainfall patterns expected in response to future climate change easterling et al 2000 expansion of impervious surfaces e g construction of buildings and roads has major impacts on rainfall runoff processes as they decrease infiltration and water retention capacity kalantari et al 2017 ferreira et al 2018 the ability of artificial drainage systems to rapidly transport runoff from urban areas is a critical parameter affecting the impacts of urban flooding table 1 accurate flood susceptibility mapping can provide meaningful information to support flood mitigation and management decisions although urban hydrology has been studied for decades the complex interactions between hydrological hydrometeorological and land surface factors and their roles in urban flooding remain unclear nguyen and bae 2020 to manage floods effectively and prevent loss of human life and property identification of flood prone zones is urgently needed lee et al 2017 wang et al 2019 flood susceptibility mapping methods have improved over the years following advances in remote sensing artificial intelligence computational capacity and geographic information systems at present such maps are largely based on flood inventories bivariate and multivariate statistical relationships between hydrological datasets kalantari et al 2019 and the results of physically based models zhang and pan 2014 however these approaches require large amounts of data that are difficult to collect in urban areas they also assume predefined relationships between controlling factors and flood occurrence that may not adequately describe the nonlinear dynamic characteristics of floods which introduces uncertainty into the evaluation results rahmati et al 2019 in recent years machine learning has been coupled with geospatial analyses and applied in numerous studies related to flood vulnerability mapping machine learning uses computer algorithms to evaluate information and develop predictions by being trained with a specially developed dataset this approach is particularly useful in data scarce areas several machine learning algorithms including support vector machines rahmati et al 2020 artificial neural networks michielsen et al 2016 falah et al 2019 and random forest classification wang et al 2019 have been successfully applied in flood modeling studies such models predict susceptibility to flood hazards based on the statistical relationship between causal factors and inundation events obtaining information directly from the data with only one assumption future floods will occur under similar circumstances as past floods xu et al 2018 zhao et al 2020 machine learning approaches achieve better results than other flood susceptibility assessment methods although their performance varies with the algorithm used wang et al 2019 several machine learning models have also been employed to enhance flood management strategies by accurately predicting streamflow shiri and kisi 2010 shiri et al 2012 nourani et al 2014 karimi et al 2018 petty and dhingra 2018 the development of models capable of predicting watershed streamflow is a growing endeavor in flood risk research but this is beyond the scope of this study the drawbacks of conventional models for analyzing big data have recently been overcome by using deep learning which can automatically extract image features and represents an important advance the deep learning approach greatly minimizes the dimensions of parameters in neural networks during the training phase and this produces more reliable disaster risk maps one of the most popular deep learning models is convolutional neural network nnetc it has been applied in flood susceptibility assessment in agricultural wang et al 2019 and urban zhao et al 2020 watersheds in china recently panahi et al 2021 identified the flood prone areas of an agricultural watershed in golestan province iran using nnetc and recurrent neural networks nnetr since an urban watershed is dominated by pavement streets buildings and parking areas its hydrological function and structural characteristics are very different from those of agricultural forested and mountainous watersheds on the other hand urban environments usually lack hydrometric stations and hydrological information is limited they are known to be data scarce areas a barrier to using nnetc for urban flood susceptibility modeling is that its efficiency in this area of application has not been fully investigated zhao et al 2020 more importantly the efficiency of nnetr has not yet been assessed however several remote sensing studies e g li et al 2019 peng et al 2019 have sought to classify satellite images for identifying flood extent in addition the nnetc model has been applied for rainfall runoff simulation in urban areas kimura et al 2020 guo et al 2021 these two applications were also beyond the scope of this work the main goal of this study was to map flood susceptibility in seoul south korea where flooding is the most common natural disaster experience major floods have been recorded in recent years park et al 2020 previous studies in the region have mapped flood susceptibility using boosted tree and random forest models lee et al 2017 in this study a new methodological framework using a deep learning approach was developed to improve urban flood inundation mapping the main hypothesis tested in this study was that deep learning models can efficiently identify zones of flood inundation in an urban watershed key objectives of the work were to evaluate the capability of the nnetc and nnetr models for mapping flood susceptibility in seoul compare their efficiency in terms of goodness of fit and predictive performance and determine the importance of various causal drivers of urban flooding the main novel feature and contribution of this study is that it demonstrates that the complicated conditions of urban flood inundation in the context of limited data can be overcome by modeling using nnetc and nnetr 2 study area seoul the capital of south korea has an approximate area of 605 km2 and 9 7 million residents making it a densely populated city ha et al 2009 this megacity is located at about 37 5 n and 127 0 e fig 1 it is surrounded by mountains with heights ranging from 111 to 836 m eum 2008 since the early 2000 s the south korean government has sought to transform seoul into competitive global megacity kim and han 2012 this highly developed city is now among the major cities in asia hales et al 2018 in recent years its population has stabilized due to the high cost of housing and to a program to control city sprawl through the formation of satellite cities near seoul lee et al 2018 annual precipitation in seoul 1200 1600 mm is higher than that in other areas at the same latitude due to its monsoon climate roughly 65 of annual rainfall occurs during the summer which can lead to flooding kim et al 2016 due to topography and limited drainage capacity lower lying areas of seoul have the highest flood risk shin and park 2014 moreover the existing retention and drainage infrastructure is inadequate for extreme precipitation events therefore additional stormwater management procedures are needed kato and

importance of variables section 3 4 3 1 database construction 3 1 1 flood inundation inventory the locations of flood inundation from 2018 to 2020 were recorded using a gps device a flood inundation map was created that included 295 inundated locations the flood inundation dataset was randomly split into two datasets for training 70 of data n 207 and validation 30 of data n 88 fig 1 the training data were used to build and calibrate the model and the validation data were used to evaluate the accuracy of the model wang et al 2019 accuracies of modeling based on training and validation data are referred to as goodness of fit and predictive skill respectively spatial modeling with machine learning requires flood present 1 and flood absent 0 location data termeh et al 2018 darabi et al 2019 approximately equal numbers of flood present and flood absent locations is recommended for flood inundation mapping tehrany et al 2014 zhao et al 2019 3 1 2 factors controlling flood inundation to predict flood probability in this environment we selected 10 predictor variables also referred to as explanatory factors based on field observations and a literature review fernández and lutz 2010 rahmati et al 2019 zhao et al 2019 these variables were elevation slope slope length factor slf topographic wetness index twi curvature stream power index spi topographic position index tpi distance to the river terrain ruggedness index tri and land use rainfall was not included as a predictor variable because the study area was small in area and thus the spatial variation in rainfall was relatively low previous studies have similarly opted not to use rainfall distribution for urban flood hazard assessment fernandez and lutz 2010 gigović et al 2017 sepehri et al 2019 3 1 2 1 elevation elevation can affect rainfall characteristics and the direction of runoff sanders 2007 a digital elevation model dem with 2 m spatial resolution was extracted from the topographical database elevation ranged from 5 to 807 m fig 3 a 3 1 2 2 slope slope is an important cause of inundation and it influences water flow direction in this study slope data were derived from the dem using arcgis 10 2 slope varied from 0 to 84 it was highest in the northern part of the city which includes bukhansan national park fig 3b 3 1 2 3 slope length factor slf slf is one of the most important ways to describe the effects of topography and hydrology on soil erosion moore et al 1991 it is a secondary factor calculated from the slope gradient and length rodríguez and suárez 2010 slf was calculated using saga gis software with the following equation moore et al 1991 1 slf a s 22 13 0 4 sin β 0 0896 1 3 where as is the upstream contributing area m2 and β is the slope in a given cell degrees slf values in the study area ranged from 0 to 266 fig 3c 3 1 2 4 curvature curvature is the morphometry of local topography and describes changes in slope inclination wilson and gallant 2000 positive and negative values represent convex and concave areas respectively and values of zero indicate flat areas curvature influences the convergence or divergence of water during downslope flow concave curvature retains more water thus increasing the risk of flooding rejith et al 2019 a curvature map of the study area was produced using saga gis software fig 3d 3 1 2 5 stream power index spi spi which estimates the erosive power of surface runoff encompasses slope degree and catchment area burrough and mcdonnell 1998 both of which influence flood occurrence khosravi et al 2018 spi is a major factor controlling channel widening and thereby influences flooding righini et al 2017 spi was calculated using the following equation 2 spi a s t a n β where as is the upstream contributing area m2 and β is the slope in a given cell degrees spi values in the study area ranged from 0 to 11 fig 3e 3 1 2 6 topographic position index tpi tpi indicates the difference between the elevation of a focal cell and the mean elevation of neighboring cells tpi was calculated using the following equation eq 3 guisan et al 1999 mokarrama and hojati 2018 popa et al 2019 3 tpi z 0 1 n z n n where zn is the elevation of cells m within the local window z0 is the elevation of the cell under evaluation m and n is the total number of neighboring cells employed in the evaluation since a 3 3 filter was used n was eight in this study the tpi value in the study area varied from 148 to 51 fig 3f positive values of tpi indicate that the focal cell is higher than adjacent areas while negative values denote a focal cell that is lower than adjacent areas as generally occurs in valleys de reu et al 2013 zero values of tpi indicate flat areas weiss 2001 3 1 2 7 terrain ruggedness index tri tri is useful for flood inundation modeling riley et al 1999 flat areas have a value of zero whereas strong positive tri values are found in mountain areas with steep ridges tpi represents the roughness of the surface which along with the objects on it e g vegetation buildings creates hydrodynamic friction dorn et al 2014 a tri map was produced using saga gis tri values in the study area ranged from 0 to 204 fig 3g 3 1 2 8 topographic wetness index twi twi is used to estimate hydrological responses to topographic characteristics beven and kirkby 1979 mokarrama and hojati 2018 or to map spatial patterns of soil moisture raduła et al 2018 twi is a function of the upstream contributing area α and slope degree tan θ 4 twi ln α t a n θ in the study area twi ranged from 0 52 to 10 79 fig 3h with higher values indicating wetter areas 3 1 2 9 distance to the river riverbanks and flood plains are at the highest risk of inundation so distance to the nearest river is important when modeling floods predick and turner 2008 mignot et al 2019 euclidean distances to the han river system were calculated as continuous values from 0 to 204 m in the study area fig 3j distance to the river was generated using the flow direction and euclidian distance functions in arcgis 10 2 3 1 2 10 land use runoff conditions vary considerably among different land use and land cover patterns darabi et al 2019 built up areas generate more surface runoff than vegetated areas tehrany et al 2015a therefore land use is a key factor in flood risk beckers et al 2013 we identified seven land use classes in the study area public residential manufacturing commercial recreational traffic and other fig 3k more information is provided table 2 all of the input layers predictor variables were standardized before being used in the models 3 1 3 correlation analysis although predictor variables were selected from a review of the literature review the spatial autocorrelation of these variables was a concern autocorrelated predictors can lead to significant overfitting meyer et al 2019 in this study pearson s correlation test was run using the band collection statistics tool in arcgis 10 2 table 3 the analysis revealed that there were no statistically significant correlations between predictor variables p 0 05 3 2 urban flood hazard mapping 3 2 1 application of convolutional neural network nnetc models the nnetc model uses deep learning and has shown promise for image classification and recognition hu et al 2015 the basic architecture of a nnetc comprises a feature extraction layer containing a pooling layer and a convolutional layer and a feature mapping layer or fully connected layer the convolutional layer consists of convolution units parameters optimized using a back propagation algorithm kang et al 2019 the convolution step considers the features of predictive variables and determines their weights the input and output for each stage in the model architecture are sets of arrays referred to as feature maps for example if the input is a two dimensional image x the input is first decomposed into a sequential array of x x1 x2 xn the convolutional layer is defined as 5 y i f b j i k ij x i where yj is the jth output for the convolutional layer xi refers to each input feature map kij represents the convolutional kernel with the ith predictive variable designated xi bj is a trainable bias and f denotes the nonlinear function the size of the feature map output from the convolutional layer is reduced by the pooling layer through down sampling this process can ultimately improve the overfitting problem with the model while sharply reducing the computation cost in the absence of changes to the structure of the image when the amount of input data is very large the pooling layer retains the most crucial information and reduces the number of parameters there are various types of pooling layers e g max average sum and so forth max pooling a frequent subsampling layer reduces the size of the convolutional layer output by computing the maximum value for each patch of the feature map leading to considerable improvement in detection of important features gopalakrishnan et al 2017 in fact the output of the max pooling layer contains the key information from the previous stage kumar and hati 2020 the last layer in the nnetc architecture the fully connected layer contains neurons which integrate the features obtained from multiple feature maps extracted by the convolutional layer using a softmax activation function the output vector is mapped to values between 0 and 1 that indicate the predicted probability of this category kang et al 2019 3 2 2 application of recurrent neural network nnetr models nnetr models are artificial neural networks with recurrent connections that analyze large datasets to make predictions bengio et al 1994 these models have a memory of past results which is beneficial for predicting time dependent objectives nnetr models are well suited to supervised learning problems where the dataset has a sequential nature the aim of supervised learning is to predict future results from past data a training set containing a given target an output and several input variables can be used to predict target values the final outputs of an artificial neural network can be continuous regression or categorical classification petneházi 2019 nnetr models use high dimensionality hidden states with non linear dynamics sutskever et al 2011 they can be used to extract dynamic behaviors from complex systems based on internal recurrence and can be trained to understand time varying or sequential patterns chang et al 2014 nnetr models have been used to forecast hydrological processes e g water level prediction as they are able to learn and model nonlinear relationships ren et al 2020 hidden states act as the memory of the network and the state of the hidden layer at any given time is dependent on its previous state mikolov et al 2006 input recurrent hidden and output layers comprise the nnetr the input layer has n input units and the inputs are a sequence of vectors through time t xt 1 xt xt 1 the input data are connected to the hidden layer the hidden layer has m hidden units ht h1 h2 hm which are connected to each other through time with recurrent connections sutskever et al 2013 the hidden layer defines the state space or memory of the system as 6 h t f h 0 t 7 0 t w ih x t w hh h t 1 b h where fh defines the hidden layer activation function and bh refers to the bias vector of the hidden units the hidden units and output layer are connected through weighted connections called who the output layer has p units yt y1 y2 yp which are calculated 8 y t f o w ho h t b 0 where fo refers to the activation function and bo defines the bias vector in the output layer sutskever et al 2011 3 3 evaluation of model accuracy the growing availability of numerous learning algorithms with differing success rates has made the task of appropriate model selection crucially important and highlights the need for evaluation criteria wu and flach 2005 the receiver operating characteristic roc curve is a popular technique for accuracy evaluation of binary classification models gajowniczek et al 2014 the roc curve is a confusion matrix with four categories of data true negatives tn data correctly regarded as negative true positives tp data correctly regarded as positive false negatives fn data incorrectly regarded as negative and false positives fp data incorrectly regarded as positive davis and goadrich 2006 model performance metrics such as the true positive rate tpr the proportion of instances labeled positive that were correctly predicted which is plotted on the y axis and false positive rate fpr the proportion of instances labeled positive that were incorrectly labeled as negative which is plotted on x axis are derived from the confusion matrix the upper left hand corner of the roc curve where fpr is 0 and tpr is 1 is the optimal point on the roc curve eqs 9 and 10 define the area under the roc curve auc 9 x 1 s p e c i f i c i t y 1 tn fp t n 10 y s e n s i t i v i t y tp tp f n auc was used to determine the accuracy of the models tested in this study yesilnacar 2005 classified the relationship between the auc value and the predictive skill of models as poor average good very good and excellent using the categories 0 5 0 6 0 6 0 7 0 7 0 8 0 8 0 9 and 0 9 1 0 respectively root mean square error rmse was calculated as a complementary metric using the equation 11 rmse i 1 n f i f i 2 n where f is the estimated flood susceptibility f is the observed flood susceptibility and n is the total number of flooded sites like the auc metric rmse was calculated for each model in both the training and validation steps 3 4 importance of variables machine learning models allow the importance of predictor variables to be estimated based on contribution analysis williamson et al 2021 the importance of variables was investigated using the method proposed by xia et al 2021 which focuses on the values of the global max pooling layer and weights in the output layer the importance of variables was determined for both models 4 results 4 1 urban flood susceptibility mapping the aim of this study was to map flood prone areas in seoul utilizing the nnetc and nnetr approaches to achieve this goal thematic layers of 10 flood related factors elevation slope slf curvature spi tpi tri twi distance to the river and land use were overlaid with 70 of the flooded points that comprised the training set the flood risk maps were categorized areas into five classes by flood potential very high high moderate low or very low which covered respectively 20 24 21 05 19 2 19 63 and 19 88 of the nnetc map and 20 6 19 59 20 21 19 72 and 19 88 of the nnetr model results fig 4 these maps show that nearly 40 of the study area is likely to be affected by flooding visually it is apparent that the flood points in both the testing and training groups agreed with the predicted flood maps 4 2 accuracy assessment based on auc values the accuracies of the models produced in the training and validation steps were very good fig 5 in the training step auc values of 86 and 84 were obtained for the nnetc and nnetr models respectively fig 5a it can be concluded that there was good agreement between flood locations training group and environmental factors however training flood locations were used in construction of the model so the accuracy of the training phase does not represent the performance of the model therefore validation data were used for the final assessment for this purpose the nnetc and nnetr flood maps generated were overlaid with 30 of the flood locations initially set aside for validation the auc values were 84 nnetc and 82 nnetr for the validation step fig 5b demonstrating strong performance of both models in predicting flood hazard probability the rmse values confirmed the goodness of fit and predictive performance of the models fig 6 in the training step the nnetc and nnetr models had rmse values of 0 147 and 0 158 respectively fig 6e 6g these results indicate excellent goodness of fit between the training dataset and predictor variables in the validation analysis fig 6l 6k nnetc rmse 0 163 showed better predictive performance than the nnetr model rmse 0 186 overall both evaluation metrics indicated good agreement and in comparison nnetc was the better model 4 3 variable importance according to the nnetc model tri is the most important factor in flood inundation in seoul with a contribution value of 16 17 in modeling fig 7 it was followed by slope 15 5 elevation 13 4 and twi 12 92 fig 7a land use 9 22 sfl 9 84 tpi 7 93 and plan curvature 6 72 made medium contributions in flood inundation modeling using nnetc the lowest contributions were made by spi 4 76 and distance to river 3 9 results for the nnetr model were similar in terms of relative importance fig 7b according to nnetr tri 14 87 slope 13 59 and elevation 11 7 were the most important predictor variables in urban flood hazard mapping of the study area twi land use sfl tpi and plan curvature made moderate contributions to the modeling like the nnetc model spi 6 66 and distance to river 6 21 made the lowest contributions to urban flood modeling with the nnetr model 5 discussion 5 1 urban flood susceptibility maps flooding causes significant fatalities and properties globally it is probably the most devastating and widespread natural disaster affecting humanity teng et al 2017 urban areas have higher flood risk due to the large proportion of rainfall that becomes runoff sato 2006 mignot et al 2019 moreover urban growth has continuously encroached into spaces that rivers use for excess flows tockner et al 2010 the quality of life in urban areas is dependent on the availability of services and on energy and water provisioning accommodation education and employment urban flooding causes significant disruption of such services and thus has a major secondary impact on urban residents hammond et al 2015 as it is impossible to prevent the occurrence of these extreme events application of flood management strategies is crucial through precise analysis of previously flooded locations flood prone areas can be identified and damages can be reduced through mitigative measures flood susceptibility mapping is a widely used strategy for managing future floods kourgialas and karatzas 2011 urban flood vulnerability maps are also useful tools for planning urban land uses additionally such maps can help engineers identify the areas that are most in need of discharge infrastructure büchele et al 2006 flood inundation due to extreme rainfall events has been documented throughout seoul s history this megacity has a high concentration of political economic and other urban activities combined with high population density and complex buildings and underground networks there is a high potential for considerable economic losses in future floods in this study two deep learning models nnetc nnetr were used to generate flood susceptibility maps of seoul to support land use planning and flood risk mitigation efforts based on the susceptibility maps generated most of the study area possess high flood risk therefore seoul should receive the attention of scientists and government authorities to improve planning and mitigate flood risk to protect human life property and the immense infrastructure of this city otherwise even small floods will continue to pose the prospects for major disasters 5 2 flood influencing factors the results of this study indicate that tri slope elevation and twi are the most important predictors of urban flooding in seoul they are followed by land use sfl tpi plan curvature spi and proximity to the river strong and significant relationships between flood occurrence and certain environmental variables are revealed by the final flood susceptibility maps floods are more likely to occur in areas characterized by lower tri lower slope lower elevation and higher twi values high twi values are strongly correlated with floodplain development naito and cairns 2011 hong et al 2018 our findings are supported by previous studies conducted in the area even though different predictor variables were used in this study lee et al 2018 higher slopes increase flow velocity but flooding is unlikely to occur on steep slopes li et al 2012 instead steep slopes cause flooding downstream and increase the destructive power of floods eini et al 2020 flat areas have little resistance to flow making them more prone to flooding especially in coastal areas flooding in seoul is predicted to occur in areas of moderate slope and low elevation higher twi occurs in large areas with low slopes places that are more likely to flood lee et al 2017 created flood susceptibility maps of seoul using boosted tree and random forest models and showed that flooding is more likely in areas of lower elevation similar observations have been made worldwide as discussed by li et al 2012 low lying areas are highly prone to flooding and such areas also tend to have high population density which increases exposure of people to floods slope length influences the time required for a molecule of water to flow from the top of a catchment to its outlet and therefore influences flood risk rodríguez and suárez 2010 tehrany et al 2015b similarly concluded that floods are more likely to occur in areas with low slopes and concave curvature and that floods primarily occur at low elevations nearer riverbanks 5 3 comparison of model performance the capabilities of the nnetc model for modeling urban floods had not been investigated extensively zhao et al 2020 more importantly never had the nnetr model been applied to mapping flood susceptibility our results indicate that both the nnetc and nnetr models performed very well very good based on the accuracy classification in yesilnacar 2005 there was a slight difference in the accuracies of the models but the nnetc model was revealed to be more accurate in both the training and validation steps regarding model efficiency previous research had shown that the random forest and support vector machine models were the benchmarks for flood susceptibility mapping tehrany et al 2015b lee et al 2017 based on our results we can strongly recommend the nnetc and nnetr models for accurate visualization of flood occurrence to enable risk mitigation and planning to protect life and property the validation analysis supports the hypothesis that deep learning models can efficiently determine the distribution of flood inundation in an urban watershed and that both nnetc and nnetr are suitable for flood inundation analysis in urban settings the nnetc model as explained by hussain et al 2020 has the benefit of reducing the number of parameters required for the convolutional layer by sharing the same convolution kernel among all spatial locations this organization of convolution kernels promotes accurate learning wu 2020 previous studies have shown that nnetc models can learn invariant representations and can achieve human level performance with adequate training data and that these models can acquire representations from grid like data khan et al 2020 the nnetc model as a state of the art machine learning approach has performed excellently in relating to pattern recognition and computer vision wu 2020 nnetr models have also achieved breakthroughs in numerous sequence and series based learning tasks and in language processing image captioning and speech recognition socher et al 2011 graves et al 2013 mao et al 2014 nnetr is known to perform well in learning tasks based on successive input data and the nnetr architecture is capable of modeling time series data wherein each time step depends on those that preceded it furthermore nnetr can handle variable length inputs eliminating the need for padding inputs in contrast the multilayer perceptron and nnetc approaches are constrained by the sizes of inputs and outputs and the numbers of layers and computational steps factors affecting the precision of a model can be investigated using the embedded functions of machine learning which identify underlying correlations in a dataset and make decisions without explicit instructions thereby obtaining results with very low uncertainty khan et al 2020 moreover machine learning allows model systems to learn from past data recognize patterns and make predictions for urban systems with minimal human interaction this method can provide computers with the ability to learn and make decisions without explicit programming using such methods computers can change programs when exposed to new data although some research has shown that the accuracy of machine learning models can fluctuate with respect to different training validation datasets xu and mannor 2012 jalal shiri et al 2020 naser shiri et al 2020 it was beyond the scope of this study to scrutinize the effects of different training and validation data on the robustness of the models 6 conclusions flooding in seoul is increasing most recent floods have affected roads in the inner city or in residential areas and have caused deaths and damage to property therefore flood susceptibility assessment is crucial for predicting the future disasters this study applied nnetc and nnetr models to identify areas of high flood risk within seoul south korea the following conclusions were drawn the validation tests demonstrated that the nnetc model auc 84 rmse 0 163 outperformed the nnetr model auc 82 rmse 0 186 therefore the nnetc model can be used to map flood susceptibility in urban areas where hydraulic based models are not appropriate due to data scarcity however the efficiency of both models is very good and both are robust and can be used for urban flood management therefore application of both is highly recommended in future research as they provide rapid low cost results tri was identified as the most important factor affecting urban flood risk in seoul slope elevation twi land use slf and tpi were secondarily important influencing factors these factors should be analyzed by before construction of new infrastructure and housing projects other factors curvature spi distance to river made weak or moderate contributions to the models both models successfully predicted flood prone areas in seoul but further research is needed to determine the efficiency of their use in other urban areas more work is needed to determine the effects of different training and testing

4343,increase in water demand within the cauvery river basin is a cause of serious concern over sustainable utilization and managment of water resources sustainable efficent and equitable managment of cauvery riverwater requires a thorough understanding of the contributing sources and hydrological processes influencing avaliability of water resources the study investigates the seasonal contribution of surface runoff and baseflow to the cauvery streamflow using isotope mass balance approach stable isotope measurements δ2h δ18o of cauvery river water along with groundwater are carried during seasonal time intervals spanning from 2014 2016 covering pre monsoon pm south west monsoon swm and north east monsoon nem seasons field campaigns yielded seasonal datasets of cauvery riverwater and groundwater isotopic composition stable isotope analysis showed a seasonal shift in the river water isotopic composition δ2h 8 δ18o 0 95 between pre monsoon pm and south west monsoon swm seasons isotopically heavier values are recorded during the pre monsoon season coinciding with the period of low flow condition whereas the monsoon season is characterized by high discharge and recorded isotopically lighter values the krishna raja sagar krs reservoir controls the isotopic composition of riverwater by evaporative process during the pre monsoon season resulting in river water becoming isotopically lighter we utilized two component mixing model to estimate the seasonal base flow contribution to the cauvery river for which the river is segmented into three sectors the average base flow contribution to river flow during pre monsoon season in sector i is 85 5 whereas in sector ii and iii the average groundwater contribution drops to 59 3 and 39 3 respectively similarly the average base flow contribution to the river flow during south west monsoon season drops to 32 7 in sector i whereas in sector ii and iii the average base flow contribution is estimated at 42 7 and 47 7 respectively the base flow contribution is appreciably high in the upper cauvery basin comprising the western ghats which plays a crucial role in sustaining stream flow during the pre monsoon season assessment of spatial and temporal variability of surface water and groundwater isotopic composition within the cauvery river basin provides an important dataset for developing a sustainable river management plan in this tropical mesoscale riverine system keywords base flow contribution stable isotopes cauvery river krs reservoir groundwater 1 introduction water is considered as a vital requirement for sustaining environment and human society therefore water scarcity is a significant limiting factor in the economic growth and development of a region groundwater acts as a buffer to supplement water demand against the erratic fluctuations in surface water availability caused due to the variability in monsoonal precipitation but evidence suggests that this buffer is fast depleting in india where 80 of water resources are consumed to meet the demand of the agricultural sector seckler et al 1998 gleick 2000 rosegrant et al 2002 ashoka et al 2017 surface water availability is influenced by various factors and complex processes which include precipitaion amount and its timing temperature groundwater levels and its recharge and discharge groundwater storage excessive drawdown of groundwater and an increase in frequency and magnitude of extreme weather events such as floods and droughts as a consequence of global climate change aeschbach hertig and gleeson 2012 fishman et al 2011 wada et al 2012 ludwig et al 2014 cuthbert et al 2019 taylor et al 2013 all these processes may affect river flow in both direct and indirect ways dettinger and earman 2007 recent studies have shown a drop in the surface water flow caused by the variability in monsoon precipitation linked to more frequent climatic events like el niño southern oscillation enso taylor et al 2013 ashoka et al 2017 in addition an increase in the groundwater abstraction has put exceptional pressure on this very valuable resource scanlon et al 2012 gleeson et al 2012 especially in the regions which receives low rainfall in india bhanja et al 2017 scanlon et al 2006 increasing water scarcity environmental degradation rapid rise in water demand has lead to prolific abstraction of groundwater resources thereby adversely affecting the capacity of aquifers for sustaining river flow during dry seasons sahuquillo 1985 gleeson et al 2012 mukherjee et al 2018 yao et al 2018 as a result cauvery river has experienced significant crises in water management involving the state governments of karnataka and tamil nadu there has been a prolonged inter state conflict on the equitable sharing and distribution of cauvery waters within the two states sharma et al 2020 anand 2004 vanham et al 2011 moreover cauvery river basin experiences tropical monsoon climate and receives rainfall from dual monsoon systems i e south west monsoon during june september jjas and north east monsoon spanning from october december ond and acts as a representative basin deshpande et al 2003 pattanaik et al 2013 warrier et al 2010 for assessing the seasonal variability of baseflow to the river in a tropical climate setting hameed et al 2015 pattanaik et al 2013 schwerdtfeger et al 2016 the stress on groundwater resources is further aggravated especially in semi arid and arid regions where groundwater is often the only alternate water resource available to sustain present and future water demand in the cauvery river basin stable isotopes δ2h δ18o in water act as unique tracers due to their remarkable ability to capture any changes in the physical condition of an environment clark and fritz 1997 rozanski et al 2001 winston and criss 2003 mcdonnell and kendall 1992 therefore these naturally occurring tracers have been used extensively in hydrology to estimate the contributions of different water sources to river flow isotopic tracers have been successfully utilized in mountainous regions to estimate contribution from glacier melt snowmelt and groundwater jeelani et al 2017 penna et al 2014 khan et al 2017 watersheds affected by anthropogenic disturbances such as urban streams are characterized using the stable isotope signatures to ascertain contributions of water from wastewater treatment plant agricultural runoff stormwater runoff and canal seepage bell et al 2016 diamond and jack 2018 follstad shah et al 2019 kuhlemann et al 2020 moreover stable isotope technique has been used to investigate the mechanism of recharge and discharge processes interaction between surface water and groundwater including anthropogenic impacts on surface water and groundwater resources gat and tzur 1967 gomez et al 2016 gonfiantini 1986 ingraham and taylor 1991 rozanski et al 1993 lee et al 1999 lee and kim 2007 ladouche et al 2001 reservoirs affect flow regulation in a river and cause fragmentation nilsson et al 2005 and its effects on seasonal isotopic composition of river water are usually neglected or overlooked reservoirs often lead to increased evaporation of stored water leading to transformation of river water isotopic composition to an isotopically heavier value thereby diminishing the natural variability of river water composition downstream of a dam or reservoir soulsby et al 2015 deng et al 2016 li et al 2016 kirkels et al 2020 an exhaustive isotopic datasets of surface waters of himalayan rivers draining the indian continental region has been

et al 2017 in comparison only a handful of peninsular rivers originating from the western ghats have been investigated for river discharge patterns and characterization of water resources kirkels et al 2020 lambs et al 2011 tripti et al 2019 hameed et al 2015 tripti et al 2013 resmi et al 2016 preliminary studies investigating the δ2h δ18o systematics of cauvery river water indicates the presence of evaporative enrichment and evidence of moisture recycling achyuthan et al 2010 tripti et al 2016 stable isotopic data on a basin wide scale at seasonal time scale encompassing the regional hydrological dynamics of east flowing rivers efr s of peninsular india is woefully inadequate therefore the present investigation was undertaken to ascertain key factors responsible for modulating stable isotope ratios of cauvery river water at seasonal time scale the present study utilizes stable isotope ratios of river water for the estimation of relative contribution of surface runoff precipitation and baseflow groundwater by assuming a two component end member mixing model we used isotopic mass balance approach for these estimates and constrained the end member isotopic composition using observational datasets collection of these datasets was possible based on intense monitoring of riverwater and groundwater at multiple stations across the length of the cauvery river the study helps in the identification of hydrological processes governing the spatio temporal variability of river water and groundwater isotopic composition at seasonal time scales including the role of large reservoirs in modulating stable isotopic composition of riverwater the present study intends to fill a crucial knowledge gap by providing the key hydrological factors controlling the seasonal stable isotopes dynamics of cauvery river water with multiple years of observational data 2 study area cauvery river basin the cauvery river or dakshin ganga is an important interstate river of peninsular india and originates at talacauvery at an elevation of about 1341 m above msl in the brahmagiri hills within the western ghat mountains kodagu district karnataka the basin extends in nw se direction with a total area of about 81 155 sq km and lies in a grid defined by 75 27 e 79 54 e and 10 9 n 13 30 n which is 2 7 of the country s total geographical area https indiawris gov in wris atlas the overall flow of the river is in a south easterly direction with a stream length of 765 km passing through the states of karnataka and tamil nadu thereby crossing the mysore plateau and descending to the eastern ghats in a series of cascading waterfalls e g shivasamudaram falls and hogenakkal falls after which the cauvery flows into the mettur reservoir the digital elevation map dem of the cauvery basin depicts location of river water rw n 103 and groundwater gw n 50 samples for all seasons combined along with an inset showing the boundary of cauvery basin situated in the south indian peninsula shown in fig 1 the western ghats are in the form of a continuous escarpment running parallel to the west coast of india and known for large tracts of highly heterogeneous forest cover the western ghats are regarded as one of the hotspots of biodiversity due to its range of ecosystems with highly diverse forest types consisting of evergreen semi evergreen deciduous thorn and scrub forests including the montane savanna vegetation at higher elevation also known as shola grasslands mittermeier et al 2005 the western ghats are characterized by an ecological fragility that makes them highly sensitive to environmental changes gadgil et al 2011 ramachandra et al 2018 western ghats also serve as water towers for the peninsular india as these act as an orographic barrier for south west monsoons with major rivers having their origins in the western ghats viviroli et al 2007 the western ghats are also known for different climosequences coupled with prominent climatic gradient induced due to the elevation and rainfall gunnell and bourgeon 1997 there is considerable spatial variation in rainfall across the cauvery river basin as it flows from the region of the humid zone in proximity to the west coast towards the rain shadow zone of the western ghats and finally to the semi arid and arid regions of karnataka and tamil nadu this is mainly due to sharp contrast in the amount of rainfall across the length of cauvery catchment and can be divided into different climatic zones i e humid 1200 mm to semi arid 800 mm to arid 600 mm the cauvery basin is divided into three distinct eco geographical zones the upper reaches consisting of the mountainous headwaters of the western ghats the middle reaches composed of the mysore plateau and the lower reaches forming the floodplain including the cauvery delta the cauvery basin experiences a dual monsoon system with upper and middle reaches of the basin receiving substantial rainfall during the indian summer monsoon ism also known as south west monsoon season june september while the lower basin receives most of its rainfall during north east monsoon october december north east monsoon also known as retreating monsoon refers to the withdrawal of the south west monsoon winds which carry moisture from the bay of bengal thereby causing rainfall in the east coast of tamil nadu chidambaram et al 2009 in cauvery basin base flow is typically derived from groundwater discharge whereas peak flow condition occurs due to increased input of surface runoff during the monsoon season each year low river flow condition is experienced in the months of march may whereas peak river flow condition is recorded during june september vörösmarty et al 1998 some of the prominent tributaries of cauvery river are harangi hemavati lakshmana tirtha kabini shimsha arkavati moyar bhavani and amaravati which contribute to the overall flow at seasonal time scales reservoir and canal networks have led to the development of intensive agriculture within the basin such as the mysore plateau and the floodplains of tamil nadu including the cauvery delta which are the most fertile and productive tracts in the entire basin the krishna raja sagar krs reservoir is a gravity dam built across cauvery river with two tributaries i e hemavati and lakshmana tirtha joining the krishna raja sagar reservoir the reservoir has a spread of about 129 5 sq km extending around 40 km upstream from the site of the reservoir the reservoir has live storage capacity of 1276 million cubic meters mcm it serves as the source of irrigation supply for the agricultural lands of mandya and mysore districts including source of drinking water for the cities of mysoreand bangalore at trichy the kallanai dam or grand anicut small barrage diverts the cauvery river into three main distributary branches kollidam cauvery and vennar leading to numerous irrigation tracts thereby forming the cauvery delta prior to joining the bay of bengal 3 material and methods 3 1 field work and sampling duration river water samples were collected during the months of may september and december 2014 covering the seasons of pre monsoon south west monsoon and north east monsoon respectively each sampling campaign was conducted within a week covering the entire length of the river these seasons were specifically chosen for the sampling campaign as these seasons coincide with periods of base flow and peak flow conditions in the cauvery river basin vörösmarty et al 1998 srinivas and srinivasan 2005 river water samples were collected at different locations along the stream length of the cauvery river during north east monsoon 2015 sampling at sites was repeated covering the middle and lower reaches of cauvery river as these locations were not sampled during 2014 due to logistical issues another campaign was conducted during pre monsoon 2016 to check for inter annual variability including effect of krishna raja sagar krs reservoir on the isotopic composition of the cauvery river water in the downstream segment the number of samples collected from the cauvery mainstream during different seasons pre monsoon n 26 south west monsoon n 34 north east monsoon n 10 in the year 2014 are listed in table 1 riverwater sampling was also conducted during north east monsoon 2015 n 8 pre monsoon 2016 n 11 and north east monsoon 2016 n 14 apart from riverwater samples groundwater samples were also collected during north east monsoon 2015 n 9 and north east monsoon 2016 n 9 during pre monsoon 2016 field campaign resulted in the large number of n 39 groundwater samples the groundwater samples from shallow aquifers hand pump and deep aquifers bore well within the basin were also collected the depth for shallow aquifers hand pumps ranged from 0 to 30 m below ground level mbgl whereas for deep aquifers bore well the water depth varied from 30 to 150 mbgl the details of which are given in table 2 3 2 sample collection and handling river water samples were collected from midstream either at bridges or embankments where the flow was maximum avoiding pools of stagnant water the collection procedure for river water samples involved lowering the sampler open lpde bucket tied with nylon rope from the road embankment over bridges and platforms in case of groundwater samples water from shallow and deep aquifers was withdrawn from hand pumps and bore wells respectively the sampling bottle was filled after pumping out at least one well volume of water in order to avoid sampling stagnant water prone to the process of evaporation narrow mouth low density polyethylene ldpe tarson bottles were used for sample collection of river water and groundwater the bottles were tightly capped and sealed with parafilm to avoid any post evaporative loss a calibrated handheld digital ph meter hanna instruments was used for measurements a calibrated thermo scientific orion 5 star meter thermo electron orion beverly ma usa enabled the assessment of water parameters which includes temperature dissolved oxygen conductivity latitude longitude and altitude of the sampling sites were recorded using garmin e trex gps receiver with horizontal accuracy using wide area augmentation system waas at 3 m whereas the vertical accuracy ranged from 12 to 15 m 3 3 analytical methods 3 3 1 hydrogen and oxygen isotopic analyses oxygen isotope analysis of cauvery river water samples was carried out at the operation and application of stable isotope systems oasis laboratory at indian institute of science iisc bangalore india the measurement of stable isotope ratios in water samples involves equilibration method employing thermo scientific gasbench ii interface connected to a thermo scientific mat 253 isotope ratio mass spectrometer thermo scientific bremen germany all the isotopic ratios reported are in the δ notation parts per thousand between the isotope ratio of the sample δ18osample and the water reference vsmow as in the following equation δsample rsample rvsmow 1 1000 the oxygen isotopic analysis was carried out using equilibration method epstein and mayeda 1953 routine analyses of water samples involved loading 200 μl of the sample water into labco exetainer glass vials which were equilibrated with a gaseous mixture of co2 he 0 25 of co2 in he at a constant bath temperature of 30 c a mixture of h2 and he 2 0 of h2 in he was purged as equilibrated gas for hydrogen isotope equilibration experiments for oxygen δ18o isotope measurement the equilibration time was set to 20 hrs while hydrogen δ2h isotopic ratios were measured after 2 h of equilibration in the presence of a pt catalyst rangarajan and ghosh 2011 the runtime for an individual sample was 12 min each which include the acquisition of four working gas peaks and five sample gas peaks the acquisition sequence of a typical batch comprising of water samples standards procedural blanks and replicates are kept consistently similar for analytical purposes the reproducibility of sample analysis based on analytical reproducibility of standards yielded standard deviation of 1 0 for δ2h and 0 05 for δ18o 3 3 2 contribution of groundwater to the cauvery river flow the seasonal contribution of groundwater to the cauvery river flow was estimated for the upper and middle reaches of the cauvery basin covering approximately 300 km of river length this was done as large cluster of groundwater samples lie in the region of western ghats and mysore plateau a two component mixing model consisting of surface runoff precipitation and base flow groundwater has been used to estimate seasonal contribution of groundwater f gw to the cauvery river flow the isotopic composition of the surface water is largely precipitation dependent which may get partially modified due to evaporation and soil infiltration process a total of 13 stations are considered for estimating the proportion of two end member components in the upper and middle segments covering 300 km of river length in the cauvery basin this 300 km long transect along the cauvery river was divided into 3 sectors covering river length of 100 km each considering f precip and f gw as the fractions of precipitation and groundwater end member contribution in the admixture δmix of riverwater following isotopic mass balance equations are used for the estimation of the proportional contribution of the end member 1 δ mix f precip δ precip f gw δ gw 2 f precip f gw 1 3 f precip δ mix δ gw δ precip δ gw 4 f gw δ mix δ precip δ precip δ gw the fractional contribution of groundwater to the river water at each station was computed using eq 4 where f precip and f gw are the fractional contributions of the individual components while δprecip δgw and δmix are the isotopic compositions of the two end members precipitation and groundwater and the river water admixture respectively schematic diagram depicting the methodology adopted for two component end member mixing model utilized in this study is shown in fig 2 during pre monsoon the hydraulic head between groundwater table and river stage leads to influent conditions for base flow whereas surface runoff is the main contributor to cauvery river flow during monsoon season precipitation values were obtained using online isotopes in precipitation opic calculator which provides an interpolated estimate of mean monthly δ2h and δ18o values table 3 at a given location these estimated values are available globally and are interpolated using an algorithm bowen and wilkinson 2002 that was later refined for more accurate values bowen and revenaugh 2003 bowen et al 2005 for calculating the baseflow contribution we employed groundwater datasets sampled at seasonal time intervals to constrain end member composition of groundwater here we assumed that the interannual or inter seasonal isotopic composition of groundwater within the cauvery basin was either constant or experiences minimal spatio temporal variability in the present study an uncertainty analysis for the two component mixing model was performed using the gaussian error propagation technique by considering three parameters 1 standard deviation of multiple samples and 2 analytical error with respect to each single sample 3 the standard deviation of δ18o values derived from the opic calculator 3 4 data sources and treatment daily discharge data for cauvery river basin site no 2042 was taken from dartmouth flood observatory dfo https floodobservatory colorado edu sitedisplays 2042 htm using the river and reservoir watch version 3 6 dataset which measures river discharge through satellite microwave radiometry the site lies at grand anicut trichy which is located at the apex of the cauvery delta covering an area of 75 506 sq km the data was obtained using remote orbital passive microwave sensor e g amsr e and tmi that directly monitors discharge through development of rating curves where the microwave discharge estimator signal is used to obtain the wbm a global hydrology model predicted values brakenridge et al 2007 brakenridge et al 2012 this allows for the calibration of remote sensing signal to discharge units m3 s or to catchment runoff mm daily precipitation mm day data at grand anicut for the study is derived from nasa s global precipitation mission gpm which uses integrated multi satellite retrievals for gpm imerg v06 huffman et al 2019 the dataset uses unified satellite precipitation product and estimates surface precipitation from microwave mw and infrared ir sensors for this study we used high quality precipitation estimates of merged microwave products in addition tropical rainfall measurement mission multi satellite precipitation analysis tmpa rainfall estimate product 3b43 ver 7 was utilized for the creation of spatial and temporal distribution rainfall maps over the cauvery basin and for calculating monthly rainfall amount huffman et al 2007 this dataset merges satellite rainfall estimates s with gauge data g into gridded estimates at monthly temporal resolution and spatial resolution of 0 25 x 0 25 the dataset was imported to arcgis and was overlaid on the cauvery basin shapefile shp which lead to 123 grid points of rainfall measurement during different seasons subsequently this precipitation dataset was then interpolated using the inverse distance weightage idw technique after interpolation the rainfall data was classified into different classes in order to create monthly rainfall maps basis for the cauvery river basin crb 4 results 4 1 variations of δ2h and δ18o in cauvery river water the stable isotope compositions of surface waters collected during pre monsoon 2014 2016 south west monsoon 2014 and north east monsoon 2014 2015 2016 from the cauvery main channel at several locations are presented in table 1 a bivariate plot consisting of δ2h and δ18o river water isotopic values is shown in fig 3 most of the river water samples fall below the global meteoric water line gmwl with few river water samples lying above or on the local meteoric water line lmwl designated for the southern indian precipitation dansgaard 1964 craig 1961 rozanski et al 1993 kumar et al 2010 the global meteoric water line gmwl and local meteoric water line lmwl help to trace the isotopic compositions of precipitation at global and regional scale south india respectively the river water line rwl for cauvery river eq 5 is derived using riverine isotopic composition for all seasons local meteoric water line lmwl for southern india eq 6 kumar et al 2010 and the global meteoric water line gmwl eq 7 gourcy et al 2005 and river water line rwl for cauvery river are governed by the following regression equations 5 δ 2 h 8 14 0 28 δ 18 o 10 43 1 27 n 93 r 2 0 91 6 δ 2 h 7 82 0 17 δ 18 o 10 23 0 85 n 62 r 2 0 97 7 δ 2 h 8 14 0 02 δ 18 o 10 9 0 2 r 2 0 98 cauvery river water δ2h δ18o isotopic values are strongly correlated with a distinct and distinguishable seasonality pattern observed between pre monsoon and monsoon seasons the isotopic composition of river water does overlap for the samples collected during the south west monsoon and north east monsoon seasons river water samples falling below the global meteoric water line gmwl indicate that they are derived from meteoric water especially during the monsoon season while some samples collected during the pre monsoon season show signature of evaporative enrichment 4 2 seasonal isotopic variation along the cauvery river course a significant seasonal variability in the isotopic composition δ2h δ18o of river water was recorded between pre monsoon dry and monsoon wet seasons the cauvery river water δ18o recorded average values of 3 6 1 1 mean 1sd n 26 hereafter 1σ 4 7 0 8 n 34 and 5 2 0 7 n 10 corresponding to the pre monsoon south west monsoon and north east monsoon 2014 similarly average δ18o isotopic values measured during north east monsoon 2015 are 4 7 0 4 n 8 while pre monsoon 2016 and north east monsoon 2016 recorded average δ18o isotopic composition of 3 1 0 4 n 11 and 4 9 0 7 n 14 respectively although inter annual variability exists in isotopic composition of river water the spatial trend recorded during different seasons remained consistent i e pre monsoon season records heavier isotopic values as compared to south west monsoon and north east monsoon seasons which are relatively lighter in the isotopic composition additionally the average δ2h of river water for pre monsoon south west monsoon and north east monsoon 2014 are 20 6 8 5 n 26 hereafter 1σ 31 1 5 0 n 26 and 32 5 3 9 n 10 respectively similarly average δ2h value recorded during north east monsoon 2015 is 29 7 3 5 n 6 while samples of pre monsoon and north east monsoon 2016 seasons yielded 11 8 3 0 n 11 and 28 3 8 9 n 14 respectively maximum variations in the isotopic δ2h δ18o values are recorded during the pre monsoon pm season while the variation is minimal during south west monsoon and north east monsoon seasons the results indicate towards the presence of a distinct seasonal pattern in the river water isotopic composition during the pre monsoon season as compared to the south west monsoon and north east monsoon seasons the pre monsoon season is characterized by heavier isotopic values of river water indicating the influence of evaporative process along with enhanced input of groundwater as base flow whereas the south west monsoon and north east monsoon seasons result in an increased contribution of precipitation into the stream flow thereby registering an overall lighter isotopic composition as the cauvery river flows downstream it gets progressively enriched in heavier isotopes and this trend is observed in all seasons this interpretation is consistent for δ18o and δ2h isotopic values suggesting dependency of physical processes explaining the composition of river water during the south west monsoon and north east monsoon seasons as shown in fig 4 4 3 isotopic composition compared to river discharge and precipitation time series datasets of daily average discharge q m3 sec and daily precipitation mm day at grand anicut are plotted along with the average seasonal isotopic values of cauvery river water samples for all seasonal field campaigns covering time interval from 2014 to 2016 and shown in fig 5 during the pre monsoon pm 2014 season the stream flow is minimal and the average isotopic composition of river water is relatively heavier registering mean value of 3 6 1 1 mean 1sd n 26 as the south west monsoon 2014 season commences the river discharge gradually starts to increase and the isotopic composition becomes lighter registering mean values of 4 7 0 8 n 34 during north east monsoon 2014 season retreating winds pick up moisture from bay of bengal which leads to intense precipitation in the middle and lower reaches of the cauvery river basin and the isotopic composition gets further lighter recording mean value of 5 2 0 7 n 10 similar trends in river discharge can also be seen during north east monsoon 2015 season where the average δ18o value measured is 4 7 0 4 n 8 during the pre monsoon 2016 season the river discharge again drops and the average isotopic composition measured is the highest recorded in all seasons with enriched values of 3 1 0 4 n 11 and during the north east monsoon 2016 season begins the average isotopic composition of river water was measured as 4 9 0 7 n 14 which is relatively lighter we can observe an inverse relationship between discharge q and isotopic composition such that as river discharge increases the δ18o isotopic composition tends to get lighter this inverse relationship between discharge q and isotopic composition δ18o is expected as high flows are associated with the seasons where the large scale convective activity leads to intense monsoon rainfall i e during south west monsoon and north east monsoon corresponding to jjas and ond respectively lekshmy et al 2014 period of lean flow in the cauvery river is associated with pre monsoon season during march may where the river discharge is primarily composed from the baseflow groundwater discharge and tends to show relatively heavier isotopic values when comparing the relationship between discharge q and isotopic composition δ18o in a bivariate plot fig 1 refer to supplementary text it is intresting to note that the measured seasonal average isotopic composition and the monthly river discharge q are strongly correlated r2 0 76 pre monsoon 2014 recieves adequate rainfall and records average δ18o isotopic value of river water as 3 6 1 1 n 26 whereas pre monsoon 2016 recieves scanty rainfall activity and measures isotopically heavier δ18o value of 3 1 0 4 n 11 the lowest rainfall was recorded during 2016 whereas rainfall events were more numerous in 2015 in addition 2015 was a strong el niño year with an oceanic niño index oni of 2 2 and a strongly positive indian ocean dipole iod helped in keeping sst warm over southern bob therefore the combined effects of the these processes resulted in numerous precipitation events especially during north east monsoon 2015 storm event which brings maximum daily precipitation was documented during august 2014 with a rainfall amount of 28 81 mm day earlier studies have established that amount effect has been observed in the relationship between the isotopic composition of monthly weighted mean precipitation and amount of monthly precipitation the effect is prominent in the tropical islands and showed much larger variability over continental interiors breitenbach et al 2010 lekshmy et al 2015 lee fung 2008 yadava et al 2007 lekshmy et al 2014 warrier et al 2010 correlation between monthly precipitation mm day and δ18o isotopic composition is shown in a bivariate plot in fig 6 these results indicates that the amount effect is weakly correlated across seasons in the cauvery river basin during 2014 the months of may september and december show a weak correlation with r2 0 44 r2 0 45 and r2 0 46 respectively as shown in fig 6 similarly during 2016 the months of may and december the δ18o isotopic values and the rainfall amount mm day are also weakly correlated with r2 0 34 and r2 0 48 respectively it is intresting to note similar trends in rainfall amount and δ18o isotopic composition during the months of december 2014 and december 2016 which primarily indicates near similar source water of precipitation occurring during the north east monsoon season the north east monsoon precipitation is derived from retreating monsoon winds which bring moisture from bay of bengal region and support cold weather condition in the south eastern parts of the cauvery basin during october to december ond 4 4 seasonal variation of groundwater in the cauvery basin the majority of the groundwater samples are collected during the pre monsoon pm season rendering minimal input from the rainwater or precipitation events the residence time of groundwater in the crystalline rocks of southern india is estimated to be 5 7 years based on injected tritium study rangarajan and athavale 2000 all types of groundwater data i e hand pump and bore hole in the cauvery basin fall within a narrow range of stable isotopic values except for the sampling locations at higher elevations western ghats and the nilgiris the δ18o and δ2h of groundwater samples varies between 11 4 to 2 3 and 55 7 and 8 4 for respectively a bivariate plot of δ18o and δ2h of the groundwater samples is used to obtain groundwater water line gwl for the cauvery basin fig 3 table 2 9 δ 2 h 5 53 0 35 δ 18 o 7 52 2 06 n 35 r 2 0 87 this groundwater water line gwl obtained for cauvery basin is comparable with earlier observations based on shallow groundwater samples from the cauvery basin eq 10 deshpande et al 2003 and can be described using the equation below 10 δ 2 h 7 25 δ 18 o 2 58 n 21 r 2 0 70 groundwater samples were classified based on aquifer depth with shallow groundwater handpump 30 mbgl and deep groundwater borewell 30 mbgl shallow groundwater samples showed a narrow range of δ2h δ18o isotopic values with notable heavier composition as compared to deeper groundwater the δ18o and δ2h isotopic values for shallow groundwater range between 5 4 to 2 3 and 8 4 to 26 9 respectively in contrast deep groundwater samples depths 30 mbgl show a broad range of δ18o isotopic values varying between 11 4 to 4 1 and δ2h between 55 7 to 14 13 in general isotopic composition of deeper groundwater shows a greater spatial variability as compared to shallow groundwater fig 2 supplementary text our results indicate that the isotopic characteristic of groundwater in the cauvery river basin vary spatially as well as with depth the regression equations defining the groundwater composition based on the survey of shallow and deep aquifers are given below eq 11 12 fig 2 refer to supplementary text 11 δ 2 h 5 35 1 02 δ 18 o 6 44 5 39 n 16 r 2 0 66 12 δ 2 h 5 59 0 37 δ 18 o 8 02 2 26 n 19 r 2 0 93 the seasonal variability of groundwater isotopic values across seasons was recorded in the cauvery river basin during the pre monsoon 2016 season the average δ2h and δ18o isotopic composition of groundwater was 17 5 4 1 n 19 and 4 8 0 9 n 36 respectively whereas during north east monsoon 2015 2016 seasons the average isotopic composition of δ2h and δ18o are 29 2 11 2 n 16 and 6 2 2 0 n 16 respectively as shown in table 2 groundwater line gwl during the pre monsoon 2016 and north east monsoon 2015 2016 are given in equations below 13 δ 2 h 3 61 δ 18 o 0 21 n 19 r 2 0 91 14 δ 2 h 5 36 δ 18 o 4 05 n 16 r 2 0 92 during both the seasons considerable change in the slope and intercept values is seen fig 3 refer to supplementary text similar trend of seasonal variation is also reflected in cauvery river water where the pre monsoon values show heavier values denoting evaporative effect as compared to north east monsoon season during which the bay of bengal acts as the source water for precipitation therefore the logical conclusion can be reached that the seasonal variations of river water in turn are also comparable with the seasonal groundwater isotopic values 4 5 seasonal contribution of groundwater to the cauvery river in this study field campaigns were conducted on seasonal intervals to measure river water and groundwater isotopic datasets so as to estimate the seasonal groundwater contribution to cauvery river flow using the isotope mass balance calculations equation 1 4 the end member contributions of groundwater for three different sectors were calculated during the pre monsoon and south west monsoon seasons table 1 supplementary text the groundwater contribution to cauvery river is spatially variable along the 300 km long river transect overall the average estimate of seasonal groundwater contribution during the pre monsoon season is 57 4 to the cauvery river flow whereas during the south west monsoon season groundwater contribution drops to 42 7 as shown in fig 7 a table 3 during the pre monsoon season sector i which covers the western ghats region records the highest groundwater contribution with average value of 85 5 x 1σ n 3 groundwater contribution steadily drops along the remaining transect with sector ii and sector iii recording 59 3 n 5 and 39 3 n 5 respectively as shown in fig 8 during the south west monsoon season sector i records the lowest groundwater contribution with average value of 32 7 n 3 whereas sector ii and sector iii record relatively higher groundwater contribution with average values of 42 7 n 5 and 47 7 n 5 respectively both the seasons record the presence of a distinct reservoir effect on baseflow contribution with sudden spike or drop in groundwater contribution at stations located just downstream of the krishna raja sagar krs reservoir the uncertainty of the estimated contribution from both the fractions i e precipitation and groundwater have been listed in table 3 the average uncertainty of the estimated contribution of the two fractions i e precipitation and groundwater during the pre monsoon and south west monsoon period was 4 and 7 respectively 5 discussion 5 1 seasonal river water composition the δ2h and δ18o isotopic values at the headwaters of cauvery river basin crb are similar during pre monsoon south west monsoon and north east monsoon seasons for the different years but continue to evolve differently along the stream length as the river traverses towards the sea bay of bengal the average δ18o value of the cauvery river registered during pre monsoon is 3 6 1 1 n 26 which coincide with the period of maximum baseflow in the cauvery basin srinivas and srinivasan 2005 similarly during south west monsoon the cauvery river waters recorded average δ18o value of 4 7 0 8 n 34 which is isotopically lighter and defines the peakflow period during which the basin receives 60 70 of the annual precipitation pattanaik et al 2013 the spatial distribution of isotopic values in the cauvery river as shown in fig 9 depicts that the river water is isotopically lighter in the region of headwater and becomes isotopically heavier along the river course due to evaporative process and similar pattern is observed across all seasons therefore based on isotopic variations of δ2h and δ18o in cauvery river the entire basin can it be divided into two distinct segments i upstream stations located in the mountainous upper reaches recorded lighter δ18o isotopic value ii downstream stations comprising of the mysore plateau and the floodplains of tamil nadu which registered relatively heavier δ18o values the isotopic values in these two river segments always follow distinct trends irrespective of the season the factors responsible for the seasonal variability are discussed in the subsequent section 5 2 influence of western ghats field observations from first order streams in small catchments of talacauvery region provide evidences that subsurface flow forms the primary component of stream flow and contributes nearly 60 of the total flow putty and prasad 2000 isotopically lighter δ18o values at the headwaters of cauvery can probably be explained by an altitudinal effect controlled by the topography of western ghat mountain escarpment defining an orographic barrier to force ascent of the moist air parcel and generating rain with isotopically lighter composition rozanski et al 1993 lambs et al 2011 tripti et al 2016 tripti et al 2019 deshpande et al 2003 furthermore the upstream stations within the catchment experience high condensation rates accompanied by lowering of temperatures with progressive change in elevation the headwater areas comprise of montane cloud forests and shola grasslands along with tropical evergreen and moist deciduous forests experience regular fog and dew formation due to high relative humidity level in atmospheric air shivanna et al 2004 lambs et al 2011 tripti et al 2016 the western ghats are also characterized by high relative humidity and low temperature which lead to negligible evaporation at higher reaches this implies that most of the south west monsoon precipitation infiltrates into the groundwater and remains available for the stream as baseflow in the subsequent pre monsoon season tripti et al 2016 siegenthaler and oeschger 1980 5 3 reservoir effect and inter seasonal shift in isotopic composition the δ2h and δ18o isotopic data in the middle and lower reaches of the cauvery basin is devoid of any gradual enrichment of δ18o isotopic value as the river traverses its path this observation explains the role of reservoirs within the mysore plateau dominating the downstream composition of the river water especially during pre monsoon season during the dry spell jan may the cauvery and its tributaries hemavathi and lakshmana teertha flow into the krishna raja sagar reservoir river flow during the pre monsoon has a significant component of ground water ingress minimal outflows during the dry season from the krishna raja sagar reservoir result in stocking up of inflows spanning 5 months jan may which assists in achieving a state of complete mixing of surface water with the storage of krishna raja sagar reservoir vörösmarty et al 1998 srinivas and srinivasan 2005 as shown in fig 10 c where 45 years of mean monthly discharge data from krishna raja sagar krs reservoir is depicted this discharge dataset is obtained from the global river discharge database rivdis v1 1 spanning from 1934 1979 vörösmarty et al 1998 the evaporative processes allow achieving well mixed homogenized body of water during the dry spell with prevailing high temperature and low atmospheric relative humidity the krishna raja sagar krs reservoir will be at its lowest level during the pre monsoon season and the outflow from the reservoir starts increasing from june onwards when the indian summer monsoon ism rainfall commences the evaporation and the low storage in the krishna raja sagar krs reservoir during the pre monsoon dominate in driving the δ2h and δ18o signtaure observed in the river water in the downstream segment since the flow during pre monsoon has a larger fraction of baseflow component the resultant composition of river water is isotopically heavier recent studies investigating the effect of large reservoirs on isotopic composition of river waters have showed a dampening effect on the seasonal variability of river water isotopic values on encountering a major reservoir soulsby et al 2015 deng et al 2016 li et al 2016 kirkels et al 2020 this dampening effect within the cauvery river basin can be seen at the 200 km mark along the stream length from where onwards no substantial variations in the isotopic values are observed as depicted in fig 10 a therefore it is logical to infer that the amplitude of seasonal variation in cauvery river basin gets obscured by the presence of krishna raja sagar reservoir storage which facilitates homogenization by a mixing process significant intra seasonal variations exist in the isotopic values of river water at the upper reaches as compared to the middle and the lower segments of the river during pre monsoon the difference in the isotopic compositions between the upper and middle segments of the river is 3 1 conversely during the south west monsoon season the difference in the isotopic composition between these two segments dropped to 1 3 during south west monsoon isotopically lighter values are recorded in cauvery river water which is characteristic of surface runoff and its isotopic composition is governed by large scale precipitation due to convective systems in operation over the region of southern indian ocean and the arabian sea lekshmy et al 2014 in contrast during pre monsoon season the isotopic composition is mainly governed by the composition of the baseflow and active evaporative processes this is depicted in the conceptual model diagram in fig 10 the overall pattern of variation remains similar across seasons e g pre monsoon seasons of 2014 and 2016 are both isotopically heavier and exhibit minimal inter annual variability the inter seasonal variation in δ18o of river water is primarily caused by the variable contribution from precipitation climate and hydrological factors gat and tzur 1967 5 4 factors influencing groundwater isotopic variability and recharge rates the groundwater isotopic values can be best represented by the long term average isotopic values in the precipitation and show low affinity to the isotopic composition of precipitation events occurring at seasonal to annual time intervals including storm events ingraham and taylor 1991 as evident from the distribution of groundwater samples fig 3 conspicuous deviation from the local meteoric water line lmwl indicate moisture recycling the non equilibrium process and making the residual water isotopically heavier the precipitation condensate from the moisture generated from the residual water lies above the gmwl which ultimately infiltrates and becomes part of groundwater most of the shallow ground waters in the mysore plateau are isotopically heavier as compared to the deeper borehole waters this implies modification of shallow ground water by the process of anthropogenic drawdown or by the process of mixing of surface water and groundwater the groundwater composition is isotopically heavier during the pre monsoon pm season as compared to lighter composition found during the post monsoon pom season this is shown in seasonal isoscape maps for groundwater in fig 11 in a previous study deshpande et al 2003 the average δ18o value recorded in the groundwater samples in the cauvery basin was 3 36 1 2 x 1σ n 23 whereas the present study measures the average groundwater δ18o values as 4 48 0 3 x 1σ n 17 this relative lighter groundwater value was noticed with insignificant seasonal variation in isotopic composition at the shallow level due to residence time ashoka et al 2017 rangarajan and athavale 2000 the depths of groundwater during pre monsoon 2014 and post monsoon 2014 are shown in fig 12 with groundwater dataset taken from central ground water board cgwb 2006 these groundwater depth maps show the probable locations blue shaded where surfacewater and groundwater interactions occur during respective seasons earlier studies done in the semi arid zone of karnataka have shown the effect of south west monsoon and north east monsoon storms on the groundwater isotopic values shivanna et al 2004 chidambaram et al 2009 within the cauvery basin studies conducted on small catchments in mule hole basin found that water percolation into the deep vadose zone was mainly concentrated during short rainy periods of the monsoon season usually lasting for a period of few days to 2 weeks followed by drier conditions maréchal et al 2006 maréchal et al 2009 ruiz et al 2010 geophysical and geochemical studies found that the average total porosity of the saprolite in the mule hole watershed was estimated at 12 braun et al 2009 the modelled watershed balance resulted in an average water flow of about 180 mm year out of which 80 mm was groundwater base flow maréchal et al 2009 this baseflow reaches the streams of higher order rivers like nugu or kabini which are tributaries of the cauvery river since mule hole experimental watershed falls in the transition zone between humid and semi arid zones the flow of groundwater produced is fairly constant and has significant importance in sustaining the base flow in large tributaries during the dry season studies carried out in north karnataka suggest that catchments with higher proportion of forest cover upstream can sustain flow during the dry season where higher groundwater recharge is a factor influenced by land use krishnaswamy et al 2013 5 5 groundwater contribution to cauvery river flow 5 5 1 contribution during pre monsoon our estimates of end member groundwater values in three sectors of the river transect during pre monsoon are 6 5 4 3 and 4 4 whereas during south west monsoon the groundwater end member values are 5 2 4 7 and 4 2 respectively table 1 supplementary text these values are used in the mixing model to arrive at fractional contribution of groundwater the average groundwater contribution to the river flow during pre monsoon time is 85 5 in sector i of cauvery river sector ii located upstream of the krishna raja sagar krs reservoir records average groundwater contribution of to 59 3 whereas sector iii located downstream of the krishna raja sagar krs reservoir records average groundwater contribution of to 39 3 during the pre monsoon season in the headwater regions of the cauvery river we see a significant contribution of baseflow contribution 85 which could be either due to mountain front recharge mfr or mountain block recharge mbr davidson 1973 ajami et al 2011 from the western ghats cauvery river is perennial in nature and the recharge of aquifers in the catchment occurs during the storms shivanna et al 2004 during the pre monsoon the presence of a negative hydraulic gradient between the water table and the river water level results in an infiltration of ground water into cauvery river as shown in the conceptual model fig 4 supplementary text but its validation and quantitative modelling will be the work of further research and monitoring experiments indirect recharge of groundwater in the mysore plateau area also happens due to infiltration of water from numerous lakes and water bodies in natural depressions where surface runoff adds water during the monsoon season the significant isotopic variation between seasons can also be ascribed partly due to the local topography of the elevated river section and the reservoir dynamics in the upper reaches of the cauvery river basin we also suspect the involvement of the process of localized recharge of groundwater from the accumulated water present in the krishna raja sagar reservoir and also from the numerous unlined irrigation canals these can act as additional sources of indirect recharge to the aquifers thereby affecting overall isotopic composition in the groundwater 5 5 2 contribution during south west monsoon during the south west monsoon season the scenario of groundwater contribution reverses where 58 7 of the river water is composed of water derived from precipitation in the cauvery basin while the remaining contribution is derived from the groundwater comprising of 42 7 similarly groundwater contribution to the river flow during monsoon season is 32 7 in the sector i of river transect denoting upstream segment of the river sector ii and iii the groundwater contribution increases to 42 7 and 47 7 this is well within our expectations as during the south west monsoon the catchment of cauvery basin receives maximum rainfall in the elevated region located in the western ghats the average rainfall in middle reaches of the cauvery basin mysore plateau is around 600 900 mm during the south west monsoon therefore the dominance of surface runoff derived from inland precipitation constitutes the major fraction of river water flow many areas within the cauvery river basin exhibited reduction in the proportional contribution of groundwater as it experiences greater magnitude of groundwater abstraction which is evident from the drop in the groundwater level within the cauvery basin cgwb 2006 there is apprehension that river flow during the pre monsoon would further diminish or seize with increasing drawdown of groundwater in near future in cauvery river basin 6 conclusions this study investigated the seasonal δ 18o isotopic variation within the cauvery river water and measured the presence of distinct isotopic ratios in the seasonal water collected during pre monsoon south west monsoon and north east monsoon seasons during the pre monsoon season the krishna raja sagar reservoir exhibits primary control in isotopic values of downstream river water this is explained by the enhanced evaporative loss our observation showed inter seasonal isotopic shift of around 1 from the pre monsoon to the south west monsoon seasons whereas isotopic values recorded during the north east monsoon were identical to the south west monsoon collection this study analysed simultaneous record of riverine and groundwater δ2h and δ 18o istopic values were used in a two component mixing model to ascertain ground water contribution to cauvery river flow our estimate of groundwater contribution is appreciablly higher in sector i with 85 7 during the pre monsoon season whereas during the south west monsoon season sector iii recorded the highest groundwater contribution of 47 7 to the cauvery river flow another important observation is the role of krishna raja sagar krs reservoir on isotopic composition of river water in the downstream segment of the cauvery river the location of krs in the semiarid zone allows large hydrological losses due to evaporative process which is captured in our

4343,increase in water demand within the cauvery river basin is a cause of serious concern over sustainable utilization and managment of water resources sustainable efficent and equitable managment of cauvery riverwater requires a thorough understanding of the contributing sources and hydrological processes influencing avaliability of water resources the study investigates the seasonal contribution of surface runoff and baseflow to the cauvery streamflow using isotope mass balance approach stable isotope measurements δ2h δ18o of cauvery river water along with groundwater are carried during seasonal time intervals spanning from 2014 2016 covering pre monsoon pm south west monsoon swm and north east monsoon nem seasons field campaigns yielded seasonal datasets of cauvery riverwater and groundwater isotopic composition stable isotope analysis showed a seasonal shift in the river water isotopic composition δ2h 8 δ18o 0 95 between pre monsoon pm and south west monsoon swm seasons isotopically heavier values are recorded during the pre monsoon season coinciding with the period of low flow condition whereas the monsoon season is characterized by high discharge and recorded isotopically lighter values the krishna raja sagar krs reservoir controls the isotopic composition of riverwater by evaporative process during the pre monsoon season resulting in river water becoming isotopically lighter we utilized two component mixing model to estimate the seasonal base flow contribution to the cauvery river for which the river is segmented into three sectors the average base flow contribution to river flow during pre monsoon season in sector i is 85 5 whereas in sector ii and iii the average groundwater contribution drops to 59 3 and 39 3 respectively similarly the average base flow contribution to the river flow during south west monsoon season drops to 32 7 in sector i whereas in sector ii and iii the average base flow contribution is estimated at 42 7 and 47 7 respectively the base flow contribution is appreciably high in the upper cauvery basin comprising the western ghats which plays a crucial role in sustaining stream flow during the pre monsoon season assessment of spatial and temporal variability of surface water and groundwater isotopic composition within the cauvery river basin provides an important dataset for developing a sustainable river management plan in this tropical mesoscale riverine system keywords base flow contribution stable isotopes cauvery river krs reservoir groundwater 1 introduction water is considered as a vital requirement for sustaining environment and human society therefore water scarcity is a significant limiting factor in the economic growth and development of a region groundwater acts as a buffer to supplement water demand against the erratic fluctuations in surface water availability caused due to the variability in monsoonal precipitation but evidence suggests that this buffer is fast depleting in india where 80 of water resources are consumed to meet the demand of the agricultural sector seckler et al 1998 gleick 2000 rosegrant et al 2002 ashoka et al 2017 surface water availability is influenced by various factors and complex processes which include precipitaion amount and its timing temperature groundwater levels and its recharge and discharge groundwater storage excessive

fishman et al 2011 wada et al 2012 ludwig et al 2014 cuthbert et al 2019 taylor et al 2013 all these processes may affect river flow in both direct and indirect ways dettinger and earman 2007 recent studies have shown a drop in the surface water flow caused by the variability in monsoon precipitation linked to more frequent climatic events like el niño southern oscillation enso taylor et al 2013 ashoka et al 2017 in addition an increase in the groundwater abstraction has put exceptional pressure on this very valuable resource scanlon et al 2012 gleeson et al 2012 especially in the regions which receives low rainfall in india bhanja et al 2017 scanlon et al 2006 increasing water scarcity environmental degradation rapid rise in water demand has lead to prolific abstraction of groundwater resources thereby adversely affecting the capacity of aquifers for sustaining river flow during dry seasons sahuquillo 1985 gleeson et al 2012 mukherjee et al 2018 yao et al 2018 as a result cauvery river has experienced significant crises in water management involving the state governments of karnataka and tamil nadu there has been a prolonged inter state conflict on the equitable sharing and distribution of cauvery waters within the two states sharma et al 2020 anand 2004 vanham et al 2011 moreover cauvery river basin experiences tropical monsoon climate and receives rainfall from dual monsoon systems i e south west monsoon during june september jjas and north east monsoon spanning from october december ond and acts as a representative basin deshpande et al 2003 pattanaik et al 2013 warrier et al 2010 for assessing the seasonal variability of baseflow to the river in a tropical climate setting hameed et al 2015 pattanaik et al 2013 schwerdtfeger et al 2016 the stress on groundwater resources is further aggravated especially in semi arid and arid regions where groundwater is often the only alternate water resource available to sustain present and future water demand in the cauvery river basin stable isotopes δ2h δ18o in water act as unique tracers due to their remarkable ability to capture any changes in the physical condition of an environment clark and fritz 1997 rozanski et al 2001 winston and criss 2003 mcdonnell and kendall 1992 therefore these naturally occurring tracers have been used extensively in hydrology to estimate the contributions of different water sources to river flow isotopic tracers have been successfully utilized in mountainous regions to estimate contribution from glacier melt snowmelt and groundwater jeelani et al 2017 penna et al 2014 khan et al 2017 watersheds affected by anthropogenic disturbances such as urban streams are characterized using the stable isotope signatures to ascertain contributions of water from wastewater treatment plant agricultural runoff stormwater runoff and canal seepage bell et al 2016 diamond and jack 2018 follstad shah et al 2019 kuhlemann et al 2020 moreover stable isotope technique has been used to investigate the mechanism of recharge and discharge processes interaction between surface water and groundwater including anthropogenic impacts on surface water and groundwater resources gat and tzur 1967 gomez et al 2016 gonfiantini 1986 ingraham and taylor 1991 rozanski et al 1993 lee et al 1999 lee and kim 2007 ladouche et al 2001 reservoirs affect flow regulation in a river and cause fragmentation nilsson et al 2005 and its effects on seasonal isotopic composition of river water are usually neglected or overlooked reservoirs often lead to increased evaporation of stored water leading to transformation of river water isotopic composition to an isotopically heavier value thereby diminishing the natural variability of river water composition downstream of a dam or reservoir soulsby et al 2015 deng et al 2016 li et al 2016 kirkels et al 2020 an exhaustive isotopic datasets of surface waters of himalayan rivers draining the indian continental region has been studied for characterization of water resources ramesh and sarin 1992 pande et al 2000 dalai et al 2002 lambs et al 2005 singh et al 2013 kumar et al 2019 karim and veizer 2002 maurya et al 2011 khan

of evaporative enrichment and evidence of moisture recycling achyuthan et al 2010 tripti et al 2016 stable isotopic data on a basin wide scale at seasonal time scale encompassing the regional hydrological dynamics of east flowing rivers efr s of peninsular india is woefully inadequate therefore the present investigation was undertaken to ascertain key factors responsible for modulating stable isotope ratios of cauvery river water at seasonal time scale the present study utilizes stable isotope ratios of river water for the estimation of relative contribution of surface runoff precipitation and baseflow groundwater by assuming a two component end member mixing model we used isotopic mass balance approach for these estimates and constrained the end member isotopic composition using observational datasets collection of these datasets was possible based on intense monitoring of riverwater and groundwater at multiple stations across the length of the cauvery river the study helps in the identification of hydrological processes governing the spatio temporal variability of river water and groundwater isotopic composition at seasonal time scales including the role of large reservoirs in modulating stable isotopic composition of riverwater the present study intends to fill a crucial knowledge gap by providing the key hydrological factors controlling the seasonal stable isotopes dynamics of cauvery river water with multiple years of observational data 2 study area cauvery river basin the cauvery river or dakshin ganga is an important interstate river of peninsular india and originates at talacauvery at an elevation of about 1341 m above msl in the brahmagiri hills within the western ghat mountains kodagu district karnataka the basin extends in nw se direction with a total area of about 81 155 sq km and lies in a grid defined by 75 27 e 79 54 e and 10 9 n 13 30 n which is 2 7 of the country s total geographical area https indiawris gov in wris atlas the overall flow of the river is in a south easterly direction with a stream length of 765 km passing through the states of karnataka and tamil nadu thereby crossing the mysore plateau and descending to the eastern ghats in a series of cascading waterfalls e g shivasamudaram falls and hogenakkal falls after which the cauvery flows into the mettur reservoir the digital elevation map dem of the cauvery basin depicts location of river water rw n 103 and groundwater gw n 50 samples for all seasons combined along with an inset showing the boundary of cauvery basin situated in the south indian peninsula shown in fig 1 the western ghats are in the form of a continuous escarpment running parallel to the west coast of india and known for large tracts of highly heterogeneous forest cover the western ghats are regarded as one of the hotspots of biodiversity due to its range of ecosystems with highly diverse forest types consisting of evergreen semi evergreen deciduous thorn and scrub forests including the montane savanna vegetation at higher elevation also known as shola grasslands mittermeier et al 2005 the western ghats are characterized by an ecological fragility that makes them highly sensitive to environmental changes gadgil et al 2011 ramachandra et al 2018 western ghats also serve as water towers for the peninsular india as these act as an orographic barrier for south west monsoons with major rivers having their origins in the western ghats viviroli et al 2007 the western ghats are also known for different climosequences coupled with prominent climatic gradient induced due to the elevation and rainfall gunnell and bourgeon 1997 there is considerable spatial variation in rainfall across the cauvery river basin as it flows from the region of the humid zone in proximity to the west coast towards the rain shadow zone of the western ghats and finally to the semi arid and arid regions of karnataka and tamil nadu this is mainly due to sharp contrast in the amount of rainfall across the length of cauvery catchment and can be divided into different climatic zones i e humid 1200 mm to semi arid 800 mm to arid 600 mm the cauvery basin is divided into three distinct eco geographical zones the upper reaches consisting of the mountainous headwaters of the western ghats the middle reaches composed of the mysore plateau and the lower reaches forming the floodplain including the cauvery delta the cauvery basin experiences a dual monsoon system with upper and middle reaches of the basin receiving substantial rainfall during the indian summer monsoon ism also known as south west monsoon season june september while the lower basin receives most of its rainfall during north east monsoon october december north east monsoon also known as retreating monsoon refers to the withdrawal of the south west monsoon winds which carry moisture from the bay of bengal thereby causing rainfall in the east coast of tamil nadu chidambaram et al 2009 in cauvery basin base flow is typically derived from groundwater discharge whereas peak flow condition occurs due to increased input of surface runoff during the monsoon season each year low river flow condition is experienced in the months of march may whereas peak river flow condition is recorded during june september vörösmarty et al 1998 some of the prominent tributaries of cauvery river are harangi hemavati lakshmana tirtha kabini shimsha arkavati moyar bhavani and amaravati which contribute to the overall flow at seasonal time scales reservoir and canal networks have led to the development of intensive agriculture within the basin such as the mysore plateau and the floodplains of tamil nadu including the cauvery delta which are the most fertile and productive tracts in the entire basin the krishna raja sagar krs reservoir is a gravity dam built across cauvery river with two tributaries i e hemavati and lakshmana tirtha joining the krishna raja sagar reservoir the reservoir has a spread of about 129 5 sq km extending around 40 km upstream from the site of the reservoir the reservoir has live storage capacity of 1276 million cubic meters mcm it serves as the source of irrigation supply for the agricultural lands of mandya and mysore districts including source of drinking water for the cities of mysoreand bangalore at trichy the kallanai dam or grand anicut small barrage diverts the cauvery river into three main distributary branches kollidam cauvery and vennar leading to numerous irrigation tracts thereby forming the cauvery delta prior to joining the bay of bengal 3 material and methods 3 1 field work and sampling duration river water samples were collected during the months of may september and december 2014 covering the seasons of pre monsoon south west monsoon and north east monsoon respectively each sampling campaign was conducted within a week covering the entire length of the river these seasons were specifically chosen for the sampling campaign as these seasons coincide with periods of base flow and peak flow conditions in the cauvery river basin vörösmarty et al 1998 srinivas and srinivasan 2005 river water samples were collected at different locations along the stream length of the cauvery river during north east monsoon 2015 sampling at sites was repeated covering the middle and lower reaches of cauvery river as these locations were not sampled during 2014 due to logistical issues another campaign was conducted during pre monsoon 2016 to check for inter annual variability including effect of krishna raja sagar krs reservoir on the isotopic composition of the cauvery river water in the downstream segment the number of samples collected from the cauvery mainstream during different seasons pre monsoon n 26 south west monsoon n 34 north east monsoon n 10 in the year 2014 are listed in table 1 riverwater sampling was also conducted during north east monsoon 2015 n 8 pre monsoon 2016 n 11 and north east monsoon 2016 n 14 apart from riverwater samples groundwater samples were also collected during north east monsoon 2015 n 9 and north east monsoon 2016 n 9 during pre monsoon 2016 field campaign resulted in the large number of n 39 groundwater samples the groundwater samples from shallow aquifers hand pump and deep aquifers bore well within the basin were also collected the depth for shallow aquifers hand pumps ranged from 0 to 30 m below ground level mbgl whereas for deep aquifers bore well the water depth varied from 30 to 150 mbgl the details of which are given in table 2 3 2 sample collection and handling river water samples were collected from midstream either at bridges or embankments where the flow was maximum avoiding pools of stagnant water the collection procedure for river water samples involved lowering the sampler open lpde bucket tied with nylon rope from the road embankment over bridges and platforms in case of groundwater samples water from shallow and deep aquifers was withdrawn from hand pumps and bore wells respectively the sampling bottle was filled after pumping out at least one well volume of water in order to avoid sampling stagnant water prone to the process of evaporation narrow mouth low density polyethylene ldpe tarson bottles were used for sample collection of river water and groundwater the bottles were tightly capped and sealed with parafilm to avoid any post evaporative loss a calibrated handheld digital ph meter hanna instruments was used for measurements a calibrated thermo scientific orion 5 star meter thermo electron orion beverly ma usa enabled the assessment of water parameters which includes temperature dissolved oxygen conductivity latitude longitude and altitude of the sampling sites were recorded using garmin e trex gps receiver with horizontal accuracy using wide area augmentation system waas at 3 m whereas the vertical accuracy ranged from 12 to 15 m 3 3 analytical methods 3 3 1 hydrogen and oxygen isotopic analyses oxygen isotope analysis of cauvery river water samples was carried out at the operation and application of stable isotope systems oasis laboratory at indian institute of science iisc bangalore india the measurement of stable isotope ratios in water samples involves equilibration method employing thermo scientific gasbench ii interface connected to a thermo scientific mat 253 isotope ratio mass spectrometer thermo scientific bremen germany all the isotopic ratios reported are in the δ notation parts per thousand between the isotope ratio of the sample δ18osample and the water reference vsmow as in the following equation δsample rsample rvsmow 1 1000 the oxygen isotopic analysis was carried out using equilibration method epstein and mayeda 1953 routine analyses of water samples involved loading 200 μl of the sample water into labco exetainer glass vials which were equilibrated with a gaseous mixture of co2 he 0 25 of co2 in he at a constant bath temperature of 30 c a mixture of h2 and he 2 0 of h2 in he was purged as equilibrated gas for hydrogen isotope equilibration experiments for oxygen δ18o isotope measurement the equilibration time was set to 20 hrs while hydrogen δ2h isotopic ratios were measured after 2 h of equilibration in the presence of a pt catalyst rangarajan and ghosh 2011 the runtime for an individual sample was 12 min each which include the acquisition of four working gas peaks and five sample gas peaks the acquisition sequence of a typical batch comprising of water samples standards procedural blanks and replicates are kept consistently similar for analytical purposes the reproducibility of sample analysis based on analytical reproducibility of standards yielded standard deviation of 1 0 for δ2h and 0 05 for δ18o 3 3 2 contribution of groundwater to the cauvery river flow the seasonal contribution of groundwater to the cauvery river flow was estimated for the upper and middle reaches of the cauvery basin covering approximately 300 km of river length this was done as large cluster of groundwater samples lie in the region of western ghats and mysore plateau a two component mixing model consisting of surface runoff precipitation and base flow groundwater has been used to estimate seasonal contribution of groundwater f gw to the cauvery river flow the isotopic composition of the surface water is largely precipitation dependent which may get partially modified due to evaporation and soil infiltration process a total of 13 stations are considered for estimating the proportion of two end member components in the upper and middle segments covering 300 km of river length in the cauvery basin this 300 km long transect along the cauvery river was divided into 3 sectors covering river length of 100 km each considering f precip and f gw as the fractions of precipitation and groundwater end member contribution in the admixture δmix of riverwater following isotopic mass balance equations are used for the estimation of the proportional contribution of the end member 1 δ mix f precip δ precip f gw δ gw 2 f precip f gw 1 3 f precip δ mix δ gw δ precip δ gw 4 f gw δ mix δ precip δ precip δ gw the fractional contribution of groundwater to the river water at each station was computed using eq 4 where f precip and f gw are the fractional contributions of the individual components while δprecip δgw and δmix are the isotopic compositions of the two end members precipitation and groundwater and the river water admixture respectively schematic diagram depicting the methodology adopted for two component end member mixing model utilized in this study is shown in fig 2 during pre monsoon the hydraulic head between groundwater table and river stage leads to influent conditions for base flow whereas surface runoff is the main contributor to cauvery river flow during monsoon season precipitation values were obtained using online isotopes in precipitation opic calculator which provides an interpolated estimate of mean monthly δ2h and δ18o values table 3 at a given location these estimated values are available globally and are interpolated using an algorithm bowen and wilkinson 2002 that was later refined for more accurate values bowen and revenaugh 2003 bowen et al 2005 for calculating the baseflow contribution we employed groundwater datasets sampled at seasonal time intervals to constrain end member composition of groundwater here we assumed that the interannual or inter seasonal isotopic composition of groundwater within the cauvery basin was either constant or experiences minimal spatio temporal variability in the present study an uncertainty analysis for the two component mixing model was performed using the gaussian error propagation technique by considering three parameters 1 standard deviation of multiple samples and 2 analytical error with respect to each single sample 3 the standard deviation of δ18o values derived from the opic calculator 3 4 data sources and treatment daily discharge data for cauvery river basin site no 2042 was taken from dartmouth flood observatory dfo https floodobservatory colorado edu sitedisplays 2042 htm using the river and reservoir watch version 3 6 dataset which measures river discharge through satellite microwave radiometry the site lies at grand anicut trichy which is located at the apex of the cauvery delta covering an area of 75 506 sq km the data was obtained using remote orbital passive microwave sensor e g amsr e and tmi that directly monitors discharge through development of rating curves where the microwave discharge estimator signal is used to obtain the wbm a global hydrology model predicted values brakenridge et al 2007 brakenridge et al 2012 this allows for the calibration of remote sensing signal to discharge units m3 s or to catchment runoff mm daily precipitation mm day data at grand anicut for the study is derived from nasa s global precipitation mission gpm which uses integrated multi satellite retrievals for gpm imerg v06 huffman et al 2019 the dataset uses unified satellite precipitation product and estimates surface precipitation from microwave mw and infrared ir sensors for this study we used high quality precipitation estimates of merged microwave products in addition tropical rainfall measurement mission multi satellite precipitation analysis tmpa rainfall estimate product 3b43 ver 7 was utilized for the creation of spatial and temporal distribution rainfall maps over the cauvery basin and for calculating monthly rainfall amount huffman et al 2007 this dataset merges satellite rainfall estimates s with gauge data g into gridded estimates at monthly temporal resolution and spatial resolution of 0 25 x 0 25 the dataset was imported to arcgis and was overlaid on the cauvery basin shapefile shp which lead to 123 grid points of rainfall measurement during different seasons subsequently this precipitation dataset was then interpolated using the inverse distance weightage idw technique after interpolation the rainfall data was classified into different classes in order to create monthly rainfall maps basis for the cauvery river basin crb 4 results 4 1 variations of δ2h and δ18o in cauvery river water the stable isotope compositions of surface waters collected during pre monsoon 2014 2016 south west monsoon 2014 and north east monsoon 2014 2015 2016 from the cauvery main channel at several locations are presented in table 1 a bivariate plot consisting of δ2h and δ18o river water isotopic values is shown in fig 3 most of the river water samples fall below the global meteoric water line gmwl with few river water samples lying above or on the local meteoric water line lmwl designated for the southern indian precipitation dansgaard 1964 craig 1961 rozanski et al 1993 kumar et al 2010 the global meteoric water line gmwl and local meteoric water line lmwl help to trace the isotopic compositions of precipitation at global and regional scale south india respectively the river water line rwl for cauvery river eq 5 is derived using riverine isotopic composition for all seasons local meteoric water line lmwl for southern india eq 6 kumar et al 2010 and the global meteoric water line gmwl eq 7 gourcy et al 2005 and river water line rwl for cauvery river are governed by the following regression equations 5 δ 2 h 8 14 0 28 δ 18 o 10 43 1 27 n 93 r 2 0 91 6 δ 2 h 7 82 0 17 δ 18 o 10 23 0 85 n 62 r 2 0 97 7 δ 2 h 8 14 0 02 δ 18 o 10 9 0 2 r 2 0 98 cauvery river water δ2h δ18o isotopic values are strongly correlated with a distinct and distinguishable seasonality pattern observed between pre monsoon and monsoon seasons the isotopic composition of river water does overlap for the samples collected during the south west monsoon and north east monsoon seasons river water samples falling below the global meteoric water line gmwl indicate that they are derived from meteoric water especially during the monsoon season while some samples collected during the pre monsoon season show signature of evaporative enrichment 4 2 seasonal isotopic variation along the cauvery river course a significant seasonal variability in the isotopic composition δ2h δ18o of river water was recorded between pre monsoon dry and monsoon wet seasons the cauvery river water δ18o recorded average values of 3 6 1 1 mean 1sd n 26 hereafter 1σ 4 7 0 8 n 34 and 5 2 0 7 n 10 corresponding to the pre monsoon south west monsoon and north east monsoon 2014 similarly average δ18o isotopic values measured during north east monsoon 2015 are 4 7 0 4 n 8 while pre monsoon 2016 and north east monsoon 2016 recorded average δ18o isotopic composition of 3 1 0 4 n 11 and 4 9 0 7 n 14 respectively although inter annual variability exists in isotopic composition of river water the spatial trend recorded during different seasons remained consistent i e pre monsoon season records heavier isotopic values as compared to south west monsoon and north east monsoon seasons which are relatively lighter in the isotopic composition additionally the average δ2h of river water for pre monsoon south west monsoon and north east monsoon 2014 are 20 6 8 5 n 26 hereafter 1σ 31 1 5 0 n 26 and 32 5 3 9 n 10 respectively similarly average δ2h value recorded during north east monsoon 2015 is 29 7 3 5 n 6 while samples of pre monsoon and north east monsoon 2016 seasons yielded 11 8 3 0 n 11 and 28 3 8 9 n 14 respectively maximum variations in the isotopic δ2h δ18o values are recorded during the pre monsoon pm season while the variation is minimal during south west monsoon and north east monsoon seasons the results indicate towards the presence of a distinct seasonal pattern in the river water isotopic composition during the pre monsoon season as compared to the south west monsoon and north east monsoon seasons the pre monsoon season is characterized by heavier isotopic values of river water indicating the influence of evaporative process along with enhanced input of groundwater as base flow whereas the south west monsoon and north east monsoon seasons result in an increased contribution of precipitation into the stream flow thereby registering an overall lighter isotopic composition as the cauvery river flows downstream it gets progressively enriched in heavier isotopes and this trend is observed in all seasons this interpretation is consistent for δ18o and δ2h isotopic values suggesting dependency of physical processes explaining the composition of river water during the south west monsoon and north east monsoon seasons as shown in fig 4 4 3 isotopic composition compared to river discharge and precipitation time series datasets of daily average discharge q m3 sec and daily precipitation mm day at grand anicut are plotted along with the average seasonal isotopic values of cauvery river water samples for all seasonal field campaigns covering time interval from 2014 to 2016 and shown in fig 5 during the pre monsoon pm 2014 season the stream flow is minimal and the average isotopic composition of river water is relatively heavier registering mean value of 3 6 1 1 mean 1sd n 26 as the south west monsoon 2014 season commences the river discharge gradually starts to increase and the isotopic composition becomes lighter registering mean values of 4 7 0 8 n 34 during north east monsoon 2014 season retreating winds pick up moisture from bay of bengal which leads to intense precipitation in the middle and lower reaches of the cauvery river basin and the isotopic composition gets further lighter recording mean value of 5 2 0 7 n 10 similar trends in river discharge can also be seen during north east monsoon 2015 season where the average δ18o value measured is 4 7 0 4 n 8 during the pre monsoon 2016 season the river discharge again drops and the average isotopic composition measured is the highest recorded in all seasons with enriched values of 3 1 0 4 n 11 and during the north east monsoon 2016 season begins the average isotopic composition of river water was measured as 4 9 0 7 n 14 which is relatively lighter we can observe an inverse relationship between discharge q and isotopic composition such that as river discharge increases the δ18o isotopic composition tends to get lighter this inverse relationship between discharge q and isotopic composition δ18o is expected as high flows are associated with the seasons where the large scale convective activity leads to intense monsoon rainfall i e during south west monsoon and north east monsoon corresponding to jjas and ond respectively lekshmy et al 2014 period of lean flow in the cauvery river is associated with pre monsoon season during march may where the river discharge is primarily composed from the baseflow groundwater discharge and tends to show relatively heavier isotopic values when comparing the relationship between discharge q and isotopic composition δ18o in a bivariate plot fig 1 refer to supplementary text it is intresting to note that the measured seasonal average isotopic composition and the monthly river discharge q are strongly correlated r2 0 76 pre monsoon 2014 recieves adequate rainfall and records average δ18o isotopic value of river water as 3 6 1 1 n 26 whereas pre monsoon 2016 recieves scanty rainfall activity and measures isotopically heavier δ18o value of 3 1 0 4 n 11 the lowest rainfall was recorded during 2016 whereas rainfall events were more numerous in 2015 in addition 2015 was a strong el niño year with an oceanic niño index oni of 2 2 and a strongly positive indian ocean dipole iod helped in keeping sst warm over southern bob therefore the combined effects of the these processes resulted in numerous precipitation events especially during north east monsoon 2015 storm event which brings maximum daily precipitation was documented during august 2014 with a rainfall amount of 28 81 mm day earlier studies have established that amount effect has been observed in the relationship between the isotopic composition of monthly weighted mean precipitation and amount of monthly precipitation the effect is prominent in the tropical islands and showed much larger variability over continental interiors breitenbach et al 2010 lekshmy et al 2015 lee fung 2008 yadava et al 2007 lekshmy et al 2014 warrier et al 2010 correlation between monthly precipitation mm day and δ18o isotopic composition is shown in a bivariate plot in fig 6 these results indicates that the amount effect is weakly correlated across seasons in the cauvery river basin during 2014 the months of may september and december show a weak correlation with r2 0 44 r2 0 45 and r2 0 46 respectively as shown in fig 6 similarly during 2016 the months of may and december the δ18o isotopic values and the rainfall amount mm day are also weakly correlated with r2 0 34 and r2 0 48 respectively it is intresting to note similar trends in rainfall amount and δ18o isotopic composition during the months of december 2014 and december 2016 which primarily indicates near similar source water of precipitation occurring during the north east monsoon season the north east monsoon precipitation is derived from retreating monsoon winds which bring moisture from bay of bengal region and support cold weather condition in the south eastern parts of the cauvery basin during october to december ond 4 4 seasonal variation of groundwater in the cauvery basin the majority of the groundwater samples are collected during the pre monsoon pm season rendering minimal input from the rainwater or precipitation events the residence time of groundwater in the crystalline rocks of southern india is estimated to be 5 7 years based on injected tritium study rangarajan and athavale 2000 all types of groundwater data i e hand pump and bore hole in the cauvery basin fall within a narrow range of stable isotopic values except for the sampling locations at higher elevations western ghats and the nilgiris the δ18o and δ2h of groundwater samples varies between 11 4 to 2 3 and 55 7 and 8 4 for respectively a bivariate plot of δ18o and δ2h of the groundwater samples is used to obtain groundwater water line gwl for the cauvery basin fig 3 table 2 9 δ 2 h 5 53 0 35 δ 18 o 7 52 2 06 n 35 r 2 0 87 this groundwater water line gwl obtained for cauvery basin is comparable with earlier observations based on shallow groundwater samples from the cauvery basin eq 10 deshpande et al 2003 and can be described using the equation below 10 δ 2 h 7 25 δ 18 o 2 58 n 21 r 2 0 70 groundwater samples were classified based on aquifer depth with shallow groundwater handpump 30 mbgl and deep groundwater borewell 30 mbgl shallow groundwater samples showed a narrow range of δ2h δ18o isotopic values with notable heavier composition as compared to deeper groundwater the δ18o and δ2h isotopic values for shallow groundwater range between 5 4 to 2 3 and 8 4 to 26 9 respectively in contrast deep groundwater samples depths 30 mbgl show a broad range of δ18o isotopic values varying between 11 4 to 4 1 and δ2h between 55 7 to 14 13 in general isotopic composition of deeper groundwater shows a greater spatial variability as compared to shallow groundwater fig 2 supplementary text our results indicate that the isotopic characteristic of groundwater in the cauvery river basin vary spatially as well as with depth the regression equations defining the groundwater composition based on the survey of shallow and deep aquifers are given below eq 11 12 fig 2 refer to supplementary text 11 δ 2 h 5 35 1 02 δ 18 o 6 44 5 39 n 16 r 2 0 66 12 δ 2 h 5 59 0 37 δ 18 o 8 02 2 26 n 19 r 2 0 93 the seasonal variability of groundwater isotopic values across seasons was recorded in the cauvery river basin during the pre monsoon 2016 season the average δ2h and δ18o isotopic composition of groundwater was 17 5 4 1 n 19 and 4 8 0 9 n 36 respectively whereas during north east monsoon 2015 2016 seasons the average isotopic composition of δ2h and δ18o are 29 2 11 2 n 16 and 6 2 2 0 n 16 respectively as shown in table 2 groundwater line gwl during the pre monsoon 2016 and north east monsoon 2015 2016 are given in equations below 13 δ 2 h 3 61 δ 18 o 0 21 n 19 r 2 0 91 14 δ 2 h 5 36 δ 18 o 4 05 n 16 r 2 0 92 during both the seasons considerable change in the slope and intercept values is seen fig 3 refer to supplementary text similar trend of seasonal variation is also reflected in cauvery river water where the pre monsoon values show heavier values denoting evaporative effect as compared to north east monsoon season during which the bay of bengal acts as the source water for precipitation therefore the logical conclusion can be reached that the seasonal variations of river water in turn are also comparable with the seasonal groundwater isotopic values 4 5 seasonal contribution of groundwater to the cauvery river in this study field campaigns were conducted on seasonal intervals to measure river water and groundwater isotopic datasets so as to estimate the seasonal groundwater contribution to cauvery river flow using the isotope mass balance calculations equation 1 4 the end member contributions of groundwater for three different sectors were calculated during the pre monsoon and south west monsoon seasons table 1 supplementary text the groundwater contribution to cauvery river is spatially variable along the 300 km long river transect overall the average estimate of seasonal groundwater contribution during the pre monsoon season is 57 4 to the cauvery river flow whereas during the south west monsoon season groundwater contribution drops to 42 7 as shown in fig 7 a table 3 during the pre monsoon season sector i which covers the western ghats region records the highest groundwater contribution with average value of 85 5 x 1σ n 3 groundwater contribution steadily drops along the remaining transect with sector ii and sector iii recording 59 3 n 5 and 39 3 n 5 respectively as shown in fig 8 during the south west monsoon season sector i records the lowest groundwater contribution with average value of 32 7 n 3 whereas sector ii and sector iii record relatively higher groundwater contribution with average values of 42 7 n 5 and 47 7 n 5 respectively both the seasons record the presence of a distinct reservoir effect on baseflow contribution with sudden spike or drop in groundwater contribution at stations located just downstream of the krishna raja sagar krs reservoir the uncertainty of the estimated contribution from both the fractions i e precipitation and groundwater have been listed in table 3 the average uncertainty of the estimated contribution of the two fractions i e precipitation and groundwater during the pre monsoon and south west monsoon period was 4 and 7 respectively 5 discussion 5 1 seasonal river water composition the δ2h and δ18o isotopic values at the headwaters of cauvery river basin crb are similar during pre monsoon south west monsoon and north east monsoon seasons for the different years but continue to evolve differently along the stream length as the river traverses towards the sea bay of bengal the average δ18o value of the cauvery river registered during pre monsoon is 3 6 1 1 n 26 which coincide with the period of maximum baseflow in the cauvery basin srinivas and srinivasan 2005 similarly during south west monsoon the cauvery river waters recorded average δ18o value of 4 7 0 8 n 34 which is isotopically lighter and defines the peakflow period during which the basin receives 60 70 of the annual precipitation pattanaik et al 2013 the spatial distribution of isotopic values in the cauvery river as shown in fig 9 depicts that the river water is isotopically lighter in the region of headwater and becomes isotopically heavier along the river course due to evaporative process and similar pattern is observed across all seasons therefore based on isotopic variations of δ2h and δ18o in cauvery river the entire basin can it be divided into two distinct segments i upstream stations located in the mountainous upper reaches recorded lighter δ18o isotopic value ii downstream stations comprising of the mysore plateau and the floodplains of tamil nadu which registered relatively heavier δ18o values the isotopic values in these two river segments always follow distinct trends irrespective of the season the factors responsible for the seasonal variability are discussed in the subsequent section 5 2 influence of western ghats field observations from first order streams in small catchments of talacauvery region provide evidences that subsurface flow forms the primary component of stream flow and contributes nearly 60 of the total flow putty and prasad 2000 isotopically lighter δ18o values at the headwaters of cauvery can probably be explained by an altitudinal effect controlled by the topography of western ghat mountain escarpment defining an orographic barrier to force ascent of the moist air parcel and generating rain with isotopically lighter composition rozanski et al 1993 lambs et al 2011 tripti et al 2016 tripti et al 2019 deshpande et al 2003 furthermore the upstream stations within the catchment experience high condensation rates accompanied by lowering of temperatures with progressive change in elevation the headwater areas comprise of montane cloud forests and shola grasslands along with tropical evergreen and moist deciduous forests experience regular fog and dew formation due to high relative humidity level in atmospheric air shivanna et al 2004 lambs et al 2011 tripti et al 2016 the western ghats are also characterized by high relative humidity and low temperature which lead to negligible evaporation at higher reaches this implies that most of the south west monsoon precipitation infiltrates into the groundwater and remains available for the stream as baseflow in the subsequent pre monsoon season tripti et al 2016 siegenthaler and oeschger 1980 5 3 reservoir effect and inter seasonal shift in isotopic composition the δ2h and δ18o isotopic data in the middle and lower reaches of the cauvery basin is devoid of any gradual enrichment of δ18o isotopic value as the river traverses its path this observation explains the role of reservoirs within the mysore plateau dominating the downstream composition of the river water especially during pre monsoon season during the dry spell jan may the cauvery and its tributaries hemavathi and lakshmana teertha flow into the krishna raja sagar reservoir river flow during the pre monsoon has a significant component of ground water ingress minimal outflows during the dry season from the krishna raja sagar reservoir result in stocking up of inflows spanning 5 months jan may which assists in achieving a state of complete mixing of surface water with the storage of krishna raja sagar reservoir vörösmarty et al 1998 srinivas and srinivasan 2005 as shown in fig 10 c where 45 years of mean monthly discharge data from krishna raja sagar krs reservoir is depicted this discharge dataset is obtained from the global river discharge database rivdis v1 1 spanning from 1934 1979 vörösmarty et al 1998 the evaporative processes allow achieving well mixed homogenized body of water during the dry spell with prevailing high temperature and low atmospheric relative humidity the krishna raja sagar krs reservoir will be at its lowest level during the pre monsoon season and the outflow from the reservoir starts increasing from june onwards when the indian summer monsoon ism rainfall commences the evaporation and the low storage in the krishna raja sagar krs reservoir during the pre monsoon dominate in driving the δ2h and δ18o signtaure observed in the river water in the downstream segment since the flow during pre monsoon has a larger fraction of baseflow component the resultant composition of river water is isotopically heavier recent studies investigating the effect of large reservoirs on isotopic composition of river waters have showed a dampening effect on the seasonal variability of river water isotopic values on encountering a major reservoir soulsby et al 2015 deng et al 2016 li et al 2016 kirkels et al 2020 this dampening effect within the cauvery river basin can be seen at the 200 km mark along the stream length from where onwards no substantial variations in the isotopic values are observed as depicted in fig 10 a therefore it is logical to infer that the amplitude of seasonal variation in cauvery river basin gets obscured by the presence of krishna raja sagar reservoir storage which facilitates homogenization by a mixing process significant intra seasonal variations exist in the isotopic values of river water at the upper reaches as compared to the middle and the lower segments of the river during pre monsoon the difference in the isotopic compositions between the upper and middle segments of the river is 3 1 conversely during the south west monsoon season the difference in the isotopic composition between these two segments dropped to 1 3 during south west monsoon isotopically lighter values are recorded in cauvery river water which is characteristic of surface runoff and its isotopic composition is governed by large scale precipitation due to convective systems in operation over the region of southern indian ocean and the arabian sea lekshmy et al 2014 in contrast during pre monsoon season the isotopic composition is mainly governed by the composition of the baseflow and active evaporative processes this is depicted in the conceptual model diagram in fig 10 the overall pattern of variation remains similar across seasons e g pre monsoon seasons of 2014 and 2016 are both isotopically heavier and exhibit minimal inter annual variability the inter seasonal variation in δ18o of river water is primarily caused by the variable contribution from precipitation climate and hydrological factors gat and tzur 1967 5 4 factors influencing groundwater isotopic variability and recharge rates the groundwater isotopic values can be best represented by the long term average isotopic values in the precipitation and show low affinity to the isotopic composition of precipitation events occurring at seasonal to annual time intervals including storm events ingraham and taylor 1991 as evident from the distribution of groundwater samples fig 3 conspicuous deviation from the local meteoric water line lmwl indicate moisture recycling the non equilibrium process and making the residual water isotopically heavier the precipitation condensate from the moisture generated from the residual water lies above the gmwl which ultimately infiltrates and becomes part of groundwater most of the shallow ground waters in the mysore plateau are isotopically heavier as compared to the deeper borehole waters this implies modification of shallow ground water by the process of anthropogenic drawdown or by the process of mixing of surface water and groundwater the groundwater composition is isotopically heavier during the pre monsoon pm season as compared to lighter composition found during the post monsoon pom season this is shown in seasonal isoscape maps for groundwater in fig 11 in a previous study deshpande et al 2003 the average δ18o value recorded in the groundwater samples in the cauvery basin was 3 36 1 2 x 1σ n 23 whereas the present study measures the average groundwater δ18o values as 4 48 0 3 x 1σ n 17 this relative lighter groundwater value was noticed with insignificant seasonal variation in isotopic composition at the shallow level due to residence time ashoka et al 2017 rangarajan and athavale 2000 the depths of groundwater during pre monsoon 2014 and post monsoon 2014 are shown in fig 12 with groundwater dataset taken from central ground water board cgwb 2006 these groundwater depth maps show the probable locations blue shaded where surfacewater and groundwater interactions occur during respective seasons earlier studies done in the semi arid zone of karnataka have shown the effect of south west monsoon and north east monsoon storms on the groundwater isotopic values shivanna et al 2004 chidambaram et al 2009 within the cauvery basin studies conducted on small catchments in mule hole basin found that water percolation into the deep vadose zone was mainly concentrated during short rainy periods of the monsoon season usually lasting for a period of few days to 2 weeks followed by drier conditions maréchal et al 2006 maréchal et al 2009 ruiz et al 2010 geophysical and geochemical studies found that the average total porosity of the saprolite in the mule hole watershed was estimated at 12 braun et al 2009 the modelled watershed balance resulted in an average water flow of about 180 mm year out of which 80 mm was groundwater base flow maréchal et al 2009 this baseflow reaches the streams of higher order rivers like nugu or kabini which are tributaries of the cauvery river since mule hole experimental watershed falls in the transition zone between humid and semi arid zones the flow of groundwater produced is fairly constant and has significant importance in sustaining the base flow in large tributaries during the dry season studies carried out in north karnataka suggest that catchments with higher proportion of forest cover upstream can sustain flow during the dry season where higher groundwater recharge is a factor influenced by land use krishnaswamy et al 2013 5 5 groundwater contribution to cauvery river flow 5 5 1 contribution during pre monsoon our estimates of end member groundwater values in three sectors of the river transect during pre monsoon are 6 5 4 3 and 4 4 whereas during south west monsoon the groundwater end member values are 5 2 4 7 and 4 2 respectively table 1 supplementary text these values are used in the mixing model to arrive at fractional contribution of groundwater the average groundwater contribution to the river flow during pre monsoon time is 85 5 in sector i of cauvery river sector ii located upstream of the krishna raja sagar krs reservoir records average groundwater contribution of to 59 3 whereas sector iii located downstream of the krishna raja sagar krs reservoir records average groundwater contribution of to 39 3 during the pre monsoon season in the headwater regions of the cauvery river we see a significant contribution of baseflow contribution 85 which could be either due to mountain front recharge mfr or mountain block recharge mbr davidson 1973 ajami et al 2011 from the western ghats cauvery river is perennial in nature and the recharge of aquifers in the catchment occurs during the storms shivanna et al 2004 during the pre monsoon the presence of a negative hydraulic gradient between the water table and the river water level results in an infiltration of ground water into cauvery river as shown in the conceptual model fig 4 supplementary text but its validation and quantitative modelling will be the work of further research and monitoring experiments indirect recharge of groundwater in the mysore plateau area also happens due to infiltration of water from numerous lakes and water bodies in natural depressions where surface runoff adds water during the monsoon season the significant isotopic variation between seasons can also be ascribed partly due to the local topography of the elevated river section and the reservoir dynamics in the upper reaches of the cauvery river basin we also suspect the involvement of the process of localized recharge of groundwater from the accumulated water present in the krishna raja sagar reservoir and also from the numerous unlined irrigation canals these can act as additional sources of indirect recharge to the aquifers thereby affecting overall isotopic composition in the groundwater 5 5 2 contribution during south west monsoon during the south west monsoon season the scenario of groundwater contribution reverses where 58 7 of the river water is composed of water derived from precipitation in the cauvery basin while the remaining contribution is derived from the groundwater comprising of 42 7 similarly groundwater contribution to the river flow during monsoon season is 32 7 in the sector i of river transect denoting upstream segment of the river sector ii and iii the groundwater contribution increases to 42 7 and 47 7 this is well within our expectations as during the south west monsoon the catchment of cauvery basin receives maximum rainfall in the elevated region located in the western ghats the average rainfall in middle reaches of the cauvery basin mysore plateau is around 600 900 mm during the south west monsoon therefore the dominance of surface runoff derived from inland precipitation constitutes the major fraction of river water flow many areas within the cauvery river basin exhibited reduction in the proportional contribution of groundwater as it experiences greater magnitude of groundwater abstraction which is evident from the drop in the groundwater level within the cauvery basin cgwb 2006 there is apprehension that river flow during the pre monsoon would further diminish or seize with increasing drawdown of groundwater in near future in cauvery river basin 6 conclusions this study investigated the seasonal δ 18o isotopic variation within the cauvery river water and measured the presence of distinct isotopic ratios in the seasonal water collected during pre monsoon south west monsoon and north east monsoon seasons during the pre monsoon season the krishna raja sagar reservoir exhibits primary control in isotopic values of downstream river water this is explained by the enhanced evaporative loss our observation showed inter seasonal isotopic shift of around 1 from the pre monsoon to the south west monsoon seasons whereas isotopic values recorded during the north east monsoon were identical to the south west monsoon collection this study analysed simultaneous record of riverine and groundwater δ2h and δ 18o istopic values were used in a two component mixing model to ascertain ground water contribution to cauvery river flow our estimate of groundwater contribution is appreciablly higher in sector i with 85 7 during the pre monsoon season whereas during the south west monsoon season sector iii recorded the highest groundwater contribution of 47 7 to the cauvery river flow another important observation is the role of krishna raja sagar krs reservoir on isotopic composition of river water in the downstream segment of the cauvery river the location of krs in the semiarid zone allows large hydrological losses due to evaporative process which is captured in our

4344,hydrological processes over and through frozen and unfrozen ground were simulated in the well instrumented boreal forest basin of white gull creek saskatchewan canada using a model created using the flexible cold regions hydrological modelling crhm platform the crhm created boreal hydrology model was structured and initially parameterized using decades of process hydrology research in the southern boreal forest with minor parameter calibration and generally produced quite good performance on simultaneously reproducing the measurements of runoff snow water equivalent swe soil liquid water content and eddy correlation flux tower observations of evapotranspiration et over two decades to examine the sensitivity of basin hydrology to perturbed climate inputs air temperature t inputs were set up by linear increments in the reference observation of up to 6 and precipitation p inputs were generated by multiplying the reference observed p from 70 to 130 the model results showed that the basin hydrological variables showed quite different sensitivities to perturbations of p and t the volume of annual runoff and the annual runoff coefficient increased more rapidly with rising p at rates of 31 and 16 per 10 increase in p but decreased by only 3 8 and 4 7 per 1 of warming annual et increased rapidly with temperature by 7 per 1 of warming and therefore drove the streamflow volumetric changes with warming but increased only 1 per 10 increase in p perturbations of p and t had distinctively different influences on the streamflow regime increased p enhanced the intra and inter annual variabilities of basin runoff reduced the relative contribution of winter runoff to annual runoff and increased the relative contribution of summer runoff whilst rising t resulted in the inverse changes in the streamflow regime effects of warming on some hydrological processes could be compensated for to varying degrees by the effects of increases in p reductions in the annual runoff volume and runoff coefficient caused by warming up to 6 could be compensated for by increases of 20 in p however the maximum increase in p 30 examined could only compensate for the changes in snow processes caused by warming of less than 4 and snow cover duration decreases with 1 warming could not be compensated for by any precipitation increase considered these results inform the vulnerability of boreal forest hydrology to the first order changes in p and t and provide guidance for further climate impact assessments for hydrology in the southern boreal forest in canada keywords boreal forest basin crhm created boreal hydrology model sensitivities of hydrological processes perturbed precipitation and temperature 1 introduction the boreal zone covers the northern high latitudes in north america and eurasia about 28 of which is in canada spanning from the international border between yukon and alaska to newfoundland and labrador brandt et al 2013 the boreal forest that dominates this zone is approximately one third of the global forested area gauthier et al 2015 and plays an important role in the hydrology of northern rivers in the circumpolar north buttle et al 2000 boreal forests are currently experiencing more severe climate change than the global average price et al 2013 and this is expected to continue in the future one reason for the stronger climatic change in boreal zones is the reduced surface albedo caused by reduced snow cover bonan 2008 euskirchen et al 2010 kozii et al 2017 recent analyses from environment and climate change canada reported by bush and lemmen 2019 suggest median temperature t and annual precipitation p increases of 2 3 c and 7 5 respectively for the period 2031 2050 and 6 4 c and 18 4 respectively for 2081 2100 under rcp8 5 compared to 1986 2005 such changes in t and p are magnified in winter and so could have strong effects on the snow accumulation and losses as well as other hydrological processes in boreal forest kozii et al 2017 however the sensitivities of hydrological processes to climate changes in boreal forest are less well understood in comparison to warmer regions in canada buttle and metcalfe 2000 metcalfe and buttle 2001 the boreal forest is characterized by a long and cold winter hardy et al 1998 nelson et al 2014 snow mass and energy balance in the forest are regulated by the canopy through multiple processes such as interception and sublimation of snowfall reduced shortwave radiation and enhanced longwave radiation from the forest trunk pomeroy et al 1998 pomeroy et al 2009 ellis et al 2010 rasmus et al 2013 higher canopy coverage typically results in increased snow interception and snow sublimation as well as slower snowmelt below the mature boreal forests pomeroy and granger 1997 hedstrom and pomeroy 1998 kozii et al 2017 pomeroy et al 2002 gelfan et al 2004 as a result winter snow accumulation under mature boreal forests that are dominated by needleleaf trees is substantially lower than that in adjacent clearings or deciduous forest stands pomeroy and gray 1995 snow and forest cover also influence the seasonal freezing of soils and spring snowmelt infiltration to and runoff over frozen soils gray et al 2001 the strong effects of forest canopy on snow accumulation and snowmelt in turn dictate the complexity in the runoff generation processes however boreal forests are typically remote and extensive sulla menashe et al 2018 creating great challenges for surface observations of its hydrometeorological characteristics for example brown et al 2019 demonstrated a lower density of snow observation in the boreal forest than those in the prairies and western mountains in canada the strong spatial variability of snow accumulation across forest and open clearing sites impairs the representativeness of point or small area snow surveys for estimates at a basin scale pomeroy et al 2002 empirical snowmelt models that need detailed field measurements for temperature index melt parameter calibration have limited predictive capability in the boreal forest basins where stand snow density varies substantially and calibration datasets are often unavailable ellis et al 2010 a physically based cold regions hydrological model which requires minor to no parameter calibration by field measurements is needed to capture the complicated runoff processes for boreal forests pomeroy et al 1999 changes in t and p cause distinctive changes in the operation of hydrological processes in boreal forest ecosystem rising t generally leads to increasing evapotranspiration and reduces soil water availability for tree growth in boreal forests granger and pomeroy 1997 elliott et al 1998 peng et al 2011 whilst increasing p has the potential to compensate for reduced water availability caused by rising t however to what extent the effect of warming t on water availability could be compensated for by increasing p has not been evaluated in boreal forest river basins climate change scenarios simulated by global and regional climate models gcm and rcm contain large uncertainties for future hydroclimates due to coarse spatial resolution non explicit parameterisation of convective storms li et al 2019 and low capability to capture the effects of sub grid features of precipitation dynamics and land cover feedbacks rasouli et al 2014 rasouli et al 2019 alternatively linear changes of p and t produced by perturbing the current observed time series of p and t from instrumented basins up to the corresponding change ranges projected by an ensemble of climate models have been demonstrated as highly suited to investigate the hydrological sensitivity to climate change and the compensation effects between p and t perturbations in cold regions e g rasouli et al 2014 rasouli et al 2015 aygün et al 2020 he 2021 in light of this background the objective of this paper is to investigate the sensitivities of hydrological processes in a boreal forest drainage basin to p and t perturbations the specific research questions are three fold 1 can the full range of boreal forest hydrological processes be represented in a physically based hydrological model with minimal parameter calibration 2 how is basin hydrology in the boreal forest sensitive to a wide range of perturbations of p and t 3 to what extent can the effects of warming t on hydrological processes in the boreal forest be compensated for by increased precipitation the questions will be addressed using perturbed p and t simulations made with a physically based hydrological model that is suitable for cold regions boreal forest hydrology and was tested in a well instrumented boreal forest research basin 2 study area and data the study was conducted in the white gull creek wgc a boreal forest basin located in central saskatchewan in the southern canadian boreal forest fig 1 the basin has an effective drainage area of 603 km2 with elevations ranging from 472 m a s l

latent heat fluxes and net ecosystem exchange based on the changes of eddy fluxes and storage in the air underneath the ec system barr et al 2012 an energy closure factor calculated from the measured energy fluxes was used to estimate an energy closure adjusted et to convert to mm of water latent heat of vaporizations of 2 83 and 2 45 mj kg were used during the sublimation period and rainy period

hydrological modelling crhm platform crhm is an object oriented platform for assembling hydrological modules the user constructs a purpose built hydrological model with crhm by selecting modules that are suitable for the spatial configurations and physical hydrological processes in the basin of interest hydrological response units hrus are used to discretize the basin and are determined based on variability of basin attributes and level of physical complexity chosen for the model physical complexity is decided by the user given the data availability hydrological complexity and the objective

parametric infiltration algorithm zhao and gray 1999 gray et al 2001 and rainfall infiltration into unfrozen soils using ayers infiltration scheme ayers 1959 this module permits infiltration to soil

taylor 1972 was used to estimate evaporation from saturated surfaces of open water bodies wetlands and river channels both evaporation algorithms are restricted by water availability and subsequently update water storages in the interception and depression stores and soil layers 16 soil moisture simulates groundwater surface water interactions and calculates subsurface interflow from soil water

law for unsaturated hydraulic conductivity fang et al 2013 pomeroy et al 2016 18 routing uses the muskingum method chow 1964 to route runoff between hrus and the clark s lag and route algorithm clark 1945 for subsurface interflow and groundwater flow in wgc six hrus were used to discretize the basin based on the land cover types open water and channel hjp ojp asp obs and fen shown in fig 1 and table 2 meteorological forcing data for the hrus were estimated by lapse rates derived from the observations at the ojp and obs sites the simulation was conducted for 19 years starting from 1998 to 2016 the boreal hydrological model performance for the simulations of runoff snow water equivalent swe soil liquid water content vwc and evapotranspiration were examined by four statistical metrics

estimation for the key hydrological processes in the boreal hydrology model of wgc basin is as follows blowing snow parameters vegetation heights were estimated from site observations values of 7 6 m 11 m 8 m 13 m and 0 1 m were set for the hjp ojp asp obs fen hrus respectively for the blowing snow fetch distance 300 m minimum value was used for all hrus in the basin due to the short undisrupted upwind distance in the forest environment this parameterisation effectively restricted blowing snow to the fen hru canopy parameters effective leaf area index lai in winter for forest types were estimated as the mean values from the measurements in chen et al 1997 and barr et al 2012 mean winter effective lai values of 1 5 2 4 0 5 and 3 6 were assigned for the hjp ojp asp and obs hrus respectively a winter effective lai of 0 1 was set for the open water and fen hrus given their low plant canopy coverage the canopy snow interception capacity values were set based on similar forest types in studies of schmidt and gluns 1991 hedstrom and pomeroy 1998 and pomeroy et al 2002 small values were set for the deciduous forest hru as it does not have a high capacity to intercept and hold snow pomeroy and gray 1995 therefore a small canopy snow interception capacity of 0 5 kg m2 was assigned for the asp hru higher values of 6 0 kg m2 and 5 9 kg m2 were set for ojp and obs hrus respectively while a lower value of 3 3 kg m2 was selected for the regenerated forest i e hjp hru based on the process studies of pomeroy and granger 1997 soil moisture parameters the model started on 1 october 1996 and value of 1 0 was set for initial soil saturation parameter assuming the fall soil moisture is saturated after the rainy summer the soil saturation was then updated based on soil moisture storage value every fall in the following hydrological years saturated hydraulic conductivities and pore size distributions for various soil layers were initialized based on the soil textures in wgc basin and then slightly adjusted using trial and error based on the nse and lognse values of the streamflow simulation in the calibration period the water storage capacities of soil layers were determined by multiplying soil layer depth by soil porosity for the soil depth and porosity averaged values for hrus were estimated from the predominant soil texture in the basin agriculture and agri food canada 2015 groundwater storage capacity was relatively unknown and so a maximum value of 200 mm was set for all hrus for surface depression storage capacities values of 0 15 0 55 mm were set for all hrus the detention storage and runoff drainage factor which controls the rate of drainage from the organic layer were manually calibrated using trial and error based on the nse and lognse values of streamflow simulation in the calibration period of 1998 2007 routing parameters the routing distribution parameter described by fang et al 2010 was used to model routing sequence between the six hrus the routing sequence generally follows the channel flow order from the upstream to the downstream part of the basin routing length of the main channel in each hru was estimated from the terrain pre processing gis analysis manning s equation was used to calculate the average streamflow velocity based on longitudinal channel slope manning s roughness coefficient and hydraulic radius chow 1964 the longitudinal channel slope was estimated as the tangent of the average slope of the hru manning s roughness coefficient was set to 0 016 considering the rather natural river channel in the basin the hydraulic radius was assumed as 0 25 m for all hrus a value of 0 25 was assigned for the dimensionless weighting factor that controls the level of attenuation 3 3 perturbed precipitation and temperature inputs hourly observations of p and t in the period from 1 january 1998 to 31 december 2016 were used as reference climate inputs for the perturbed simulation linearly perturbed p and t time series were used to represent the possible ranges of climate until the end of the 21st century in the study basin perturbed t inputs were set up by adding one degree increments to the reference observed hourly air t up to 6 as the maximum t increase in the study area is projected to about 6 until 2100 according to eccc 2016 and the canada s changing climate report by zhang et al 2019 perturbed p inputs were generated by multiplying the reference observed hourly p from 70 to 130 because the maximum p change range in the study area is around 30 until 2100 according to eccc 2016 and the canada s changing climate report by zhang et al 2019 seasonality of p and t in the perturbed input time series were kept the same as that in the reference observations as p and t in different months were perturbed by the same ranges relative humidity and wind speed were held same as those in the reference period to focus on the hydrological sensitivity to climate perturbations the forest disturbance caused by wildfire and human activity and changes in the soil properties such as reduced soil moisture storage from soil compaction during harvesting were not considered perturbed p and t inputs are summarized in table 3 in total six simulations of the perturbed t and six simulations of the perturbed p were conducted compensation between the effects of p and t perturbations on basin hydrology were investigated by combining each of the seven p simulations six perturbed p and a reference p with seven t simulations six perturbed t and a reference t 3 4 quantifying the sensitivities of hydrological processes to perturbed climate inputs the sensitivities of hydrological processes in the wgc basin were examined by changes in the selected magnitude and timing indices of water balance components or hydrological fluxes selected magnitude indices are annual runoff seasonal runoff annual peak runoff annual peak swe annual snow sublimation annual runoff coefficient annual

affect the forest and snow processes simulations over the entire study period fig 3a b mb values were 0 1 and 0 15 and nrmse values were 0 43 and 0 48 for simulated swe at the ojp and obs sites respectively these small mb and nrmse values suggest that the model can adequately simulate snow accumulation and melt processes for mature jack pine and black spruce forests compared to the observations the model generally captured the seasonal evolution of swe in most years but had a large overestimation in two hydrological years 2003 2004 and 2013 2014 while in the 2015 2016 hydrological year the model underestimated the observed swe the relatively poor performance in these hydrological years is likely caused by the lack of accurate winter p measurements at both sites similarly to davison et al 2016 the model slightly overestimated annual et at the ojp and obs sites compared to the eddy correlation flux tower observations in the entire study period fig 4 no calibration was done for parameters in the evapotranspiration simulation mb value for simulated annual et at ojp was 0 11 while mb for simulated annual et at obs was only 0 03 this suggests that the overestimation is within 11 at both sites and the model could adequately obtain the annual et flux value for most years except for 2004 2006 and 2013 2014 when model estimated large differences in annual et compared to observations at the two forest sites modelled soil volumetric water content vwc in the ojp and obs hrus were compared with observations in fig 5 no calibration was performed for parameters to fit the soil moisture observation and comparisons were only conducted for unfrozen months 1 may to 30 september for observed vwc the weighted average of soil vwc of the layers of 0 15 cm and 15 30 cm was used to represent the vwc for the upper layer 0 28 cm and the weighted average of layers of 15 30 cm and 30 60 cm was used as vwc of the lower layer 28 45 cm for both modelled and observed soil vwc values at the ojp site were lower than those at the obs site as soil type is mainly loam sand at the ojp site and typically clay at the obs site at the ojp site fig 5a b the model generally overestimated vwc with mb values ranging from 0 11 for lower layer to 0 12 for upper layer nrmse values were no higher than 0 3 indicating reasonable model performance for seasonal soil moisture estimation at this site at the obs site fig 5c d the model underestimated vwc of the upper layer with mb values of 0 13 for the lower layer the model overestimated by 2 i e mb 0 02 the nrmse values were within 0 26 in both soil layers suggesting model adequately captured the seasonal fluctuations of soil moisture at the obs site fig 6 shows the comparisons of simulated and observed daily mean streamflow in wgc basin in two periods one for a parameter calibration period 1998 2007 and one for a validation period 2008 2016 observed streamflow in the year of 2011 was discarded for the evaluation considering the measurement errors noted in this year davison et al 2016 the model achieved lognse values of 0 8 and 0 74 in calibration and validation periods respectively indicating that model could simulate the low flows well in winter months nse values were 0 63 and 0 6 in the calibration and validation periods respectively suggesting that model s capability to predict high flows in spring and summer months was adequate but not as good as that for winter low flows mb values show that the model captured streamflow volume well in the wgc basin with 4 overestimation and 12 underestimation in the calibration and validation periods respectively considering the sparse observations of meteorological data uncertainty in streamflow estimates and the complex land cover condition in the basin the model generally obtains reasonable streamflow simulations and is comparable to results from the mesh hydrological land surface model previously applied to this basin in davison et al 2016 4 2 sensitivities of hydrological variables to perturbed p and t sensitivities of the selected magnitude and timing indices of hydrological variables to perturbed p and t are compared in fig 7 and table 4 annual runoff and maximum daily runoff responded directly to changing p and inversely with warming t however sensitivities varied markedly fig 7a for a decrease in p of 30 from the current climate the annual runoff and maximum runoff decreased by 61 and 52 respectively whereas they rose by 93 and 108 as the p increased by 30 table 4 with 6 of warming the annual runoff and maximum runoff declined by 23 and 35 respectively fig 7a the centre of mass timing cmt of annual runoff varied directly with changing precipitation fig 7b in which it advanced by 17 9 and 4 days in response to decreases in p of 30 20 and 10 respectively and recessed by 4 8 and 10 days when p increased by 10 20 and 30 respectively table 4 it responded to warming t in a near linear but inverse manner fig 7b and advanced by 19 days for 6 of warming however the timing of maximum runoff responded non linearly to p and t perturbations fig 7b there was little sensitivity of the maximum runoff timing to perturbed p except for increases in p of 20 30 for which the maximum runoff timing recessed sharply by up to 32 days table 4 this suggests threshold behaviour in runoff timing in the basin the annual maximum runoff occurred earlier with warming t but with substantial variability where 5 of warming resulted in an advance of 22 days but 6 of warming advanced the maximum runoff timing by only 14 days the volume of annual peak swe varied almost linearly with p fig 7c declining by 36 24 and 12 as p declined by 30 20 and 10 and increasing by 12 24 and 37 as p increased by 10 20 and 30 table 4 peak swe declined by 13 as t increased by 1 c and by 61 for an increase of 6 above reference levels fig 7c table 4 annual et was insensitive to perturbed p increasing very slightly by 3 for a p increase of 30 and declining by only 8 for a p decrease of 30 in contrast et was very sensitive to warming with a 42 increase for 6 of warming fig 7c and table 4 the timing of annual peak swe and the snow cover duration also responded more strongly to perturbed t than to perturbed p fig 7d when p increased by 30 the date of annual peak swe recessed by 4 days and the snow cover duration increased by 4 days whilst the date of annual peak swe advanced by 9 days and the snow cover duration shortened by 9 days for just 1 of warming remarkably 6 of warming resulted in a 36 day advance in the timing of peak swe and a 62 day decline in snow cover duration table 4 fig 7e compares the sensitivities of annual snow sublimation runoff coefficient and rainfall ratio to the perturbed p and t annual snow sublimation increased by 15 as the annual p rose by 30 whilst it decreased by around 18 with a p reduction of 30 the impact of warming t on annual snow sublimation is very high a 7 reduction in snow sublimation was caused by 1 of warming and a 36 decrease corresponded to 6 of warming the runoff coefficient was enhanced near linearly with increases in p at an average rate of 16 per 10 increase in p whilst reductions in the runoff coefficient were at an average rate of 4 7 per 1 of warming due to the enhanced annual et fig 7c rainfall ratio was insensitive to perturbed p but increased at an average rate of 3 per 1 of warming 4 3 changes of streamflow regime in response to p and t perturbations the simulated monthly runoff forced by reference p in 1998 2016 and 30 increase and decrease in p are compared to illustrate the intra annual variability of basin runoff for varied levels of p input fig 8 a lower p resulted in a smaller runoff volume that is distributed more evenly over the seasons in contrast to increasing p that leads to substantially larger runoff volumes being generated in warm months may to september and much greater runoff for low frequency events on the flow duration curve fdc calculated over the entire simulation period fig 8c the simulated monthly runoff from the reference t and warming of 1 and 6 are compared in fig 8b increasing t resulted in a more even distribution of monthly runoff with t increasing by 6 the runoff in april to september was reduced leading to reduced runoff for low frequency events as evident by changes to the fdc fig 8d the variations of monthly runoff in the boxplots fig 8a and 8b were estimated from the monthly runoff in each year of the entire study period indicating the inter annual variability of monthly runoff during the simulation period increasing p enhanced the inter annual variability of runoff especially for the warm months whilst raising t reduced the inter annual variability of runoff in the warm months but increased the inter annual variability of runoff in the cold months the higher variability of runoff in the cold months with warming t is due to increasing mid winter melt events and likely complex interactions with frozen soils and basal ice layers and the lower variability of runoff in warm months with warming t is result of lower antecedent soil moisture impact on rainfall runoff generation the inter annual variability of simulated daily hydrographs from the above perturbed p and t are illustrated in fig 8e f again the inter annual variability of daily runoff in warm months increased with p but decreased with t sensitivities of seasonal runoff and runoff components to p and t perturbations in wgc basin are shown in fig 9 and table 5 the seasonal runoff generally increased with p fig 9a but the relative contributions of spring mam march to may and winter djf december to february runoff to annual volumes declined as p increased fig 9c when p increased from 70 to 130 of the reference observation the winter and spring runoff increased by 4 mm and 45 mm table 5 whilst their contributions to the annual runoff volume decreased by 9 and 5 respectively fig 9c for the same p increase autumn son september to november runoff increased by about 40 mm with little change in its contribution to the annual runoff summer jja june to august runoff rose by about 91 mm with its contribution to annual runoff increasing by 14 fig 9c partly because of the enhanced rainfall storms in summer in contrast seasonal runoff volumes generally decreased with rising t except for winter runoff fig 9b the fractional contribution of summer runoff decreased by 11 as t rose by 6 fig 9d such t rise promoted increasing fractions of runoff generation in cold seasons resulting in 5 7 and 4 6 higher contributions for autumn and winter runoff respectively but little change in the fractional contributions from spring runoff sensitivities of the major runoff components deep groundwater flow subsurface interflow from soil water snowmelt overland flow and rainfall overland flow to the p and t perturbations are shown in fig 9a b and e f both p and t increases led to a higher contribution of subsurface interflow to total runoff and little change in the contribution of rainfall overland flow to total runoff fig 9e f groundwater flow generally increased with higher p and rose by about 70 mm when p increased from 70 to 130 of the reference observations table 5 but its contribution to total runoff diminished because there was much higher increase of 179 mm in total runoff dominated by an increase in subsurface interflow while groundwater flow decreased with warming t its fractional contribution to total runoff remained unchanged fig 9f snowmelt overland flow increased with higher p and declined with warmer t table 5 yet its fractional contribution to total runoff decreased when either p or t increased fig 9e f overall the contributions of runoff components tended to show higher sensitivities to p perturbation than to t perturbation 4 4 compensatory effects of p and t perturbations as shown in fig 7 increasing p resulted in higher annual runoff while warming t reduced the generation of runoff the compensatory effects of p and t perturbations on hydrological processes were therefore explored fig 10 shows strong sensitivities of annual runoff to changing precipitation snow covered duration to t and peak swe date cmt of annual runoff runoff coefficient and snow sublimation to both t and p reduction of annual runoff caused by 1 of warming could be compensated for by the runoff increase from a 1 7 increase in p fig 10a and the advance of the annual runoff cmt caused by 1 of warming could be compensated for by a 7 p increase fig 10b the reduction of annual runoff caused by 6 of warming could be compensated for by runoff increase generated by a 10 increase in precipitation however the maximum increase in p considered 30 could only compensate for the advance in cmt of annual runoff caused by 3 8 of warming the reduced magnitude of runoff coefficient caused by 1 of warming could be compensated for when a 4 5 increase in p occurred fig 10c a 19 increase in p could completely compensate for the reduction of runoff coefficient caused by the highest warming of 6 decreases in peak swe and annual snow sublimation caused by 1 of warming could be compensated for by 13 and 15 increases in p respectively fig 10d and f but the maximum increase of p 30 could only compensate for the reductions in peak swe and snow sublimation caused by 2 2 and 2 of warming respectively decrease in snow cover duration caused by 1 of warming could not be compensated for fig 10e even by the upper bound of 30 increase in precipitation fig 11 a d show that subsurface interflow and rainfall overland flow are most sensitive to p whilst groundwater flow and snowmelt overland flow are sensitive to both p and t compensatory behaviour by p and t in controlling the sensitivities of runoff components follows those relationships reduction of groundwater from 1 of warming could be compensated for by a 3 p increase while decreased subsurface interflow and snowmelt overland flow caused by 1 of warming were offset by 1 and 7 p increases respectively reduction of groundwater and subsurface interflow caused by the maximum warming of 6 could be offset by 18 and 5 p increases respectively however the maximum increase in p 30 could only compensate for reduction of snowmelt overland flow caused by around 4 of warming and there was no consistent compensatory behaviour by p and t for the sensitivity of rainfall overland flow fig 11d fig 11e h shows that spring and autumn runoff are strongly affected by increases in p and less affected by rises in t whilst winter runoff is more sensitive to warming t for the higher p i e 110 to 130 p perturbations the reduction of spring runoff caused by 1 of warming could be compensated for by a 4 p increase whilst decreased summer runoff and autumn runoff caused by 1 of warming were offset by 3 and 0 7 increases in p respectively the reductions of runoff in spring summer and autumn caused by the maximum t warming 6 could be compensated for by p increases of about 16 18 and 4 respectively increasing p and rising t both tended to result in higher winter runoff and thus the maximum warming of 6 could offset the loss in winter runoff caused by a 12 decrease in p 5 discussion 5 1 variable sensitivities of runoff and snow processes to p and t perturbations in white gull creek wgc basin the non linear sensitivity of hydrological variables to perturbed p could be partly attributed to the complex effects of soil storage in particular p had primary control on the water availability and its variation affected the runoff generation in wgc davison et al 2016 under low p input conditions p mainly supported infiltration into soils to fill the soil and groundwater storages and was exhausted by et loss back to atmosphere leading to lower runoff in contrast higher p more likely saturated the soil and groundwater storages and promoted greater runoff generation as a result the annual runoff and peak runoff showed larger sensitivity to the changes of p under high p input conditions table 4 and fig 7a subsurface interflow and groundwater flow were more sensitive to perturbed p compared to rainfall and snowmelt overland flows fig 9a and table 5 as p primarily infiltrated into the porous forest soils in wgc on the other hand the basin peak swe showed linear sensitivity to perturbed p as soil storage has no effect on the snow accumulation the sensitivities of runoff and snow processes to p perturbation are generally consistent with those findings in other cold regions such as lópez moreno et al 2012 rasouli et al 2014 the non linear sensitivities of runoff processes to perturbed t can be partly explained by the effects of warming on et snow cover disappearance and the thawing of frozen soil in particular warming leads to higher et and increases the infiltration capacity of frozen soil in this basin ireson et al 2015 for fixed p input the increased et due to warming has an important control on the annual volume of runoff from wgc nijssen and lettenmaier 2002 the complicated et increases in response to warming shown in fig 7c are results of complex processes in soil moisture transpiration season and rainfall interception that both affect annual et losses and this non linear sensitivity of et to perturbed t is consistent with the findings in boreal forest by brown et al 2014 on the other hand warming t accelerates the thawing of frozen soil endalamaw et al 2017 and promotes the contribution of subsurface interflow to the total runoff in addition the psychrometric energy balance method used for p phase partitioning harder and pomeroy 2013 and complex snow processes such as sublimation and interception in boreal forest hedstrom and pomeroy 1998 as well as energy balance based snowmelt estimation marks et al 1998 are sensitive to t and could be reasons for the non linear response of peak swe to t perturbation these non linear effects of warming on hydrological and snow processes in wgc are generally similar to the findings demonstrated by woo et al 2008 and holmberg et al 2014 in other boreal forests 5 2 limitations the effects of climate on forest canopy such as the increasing wildfire occurrence and intensity as well as the gradual reduction in canopy lai and snow interception capacity caused by t warming and drought boulanger et al 2016 were not considered the disturbance of forest by potential wildfire or disease and the regrowth of harvested forest as well as the change of soil properties in the basin were also not considered in this study when investigating the sensitivities of hydrological processes to p and t perturbations this investigation procedure is similar to the hydrological sensitivity analysis to perturbed climate by rasouli et al 2014 and rasouli et al 2015 this study focuses on the sensitivity of hydrological processes to perturbed p and t instead of projection of future hydrology using an ensemble forcing data from earth system models esms the linear perturbations of precipitation and temperature are not climate change scenarios projected by esms but rather provide a range of potential future changes this climate perturbation method was used because of its special function on investigating what combinations of precipitation and temperature changes can induce significant hydrological changes in the boreal forest basin rasouli et al 2014 and what the roles of particular p or t perturbations are in shaping the responses of specific hydrological processes this simple method avoided the heavy computational cost of dynamically downscaling climate models to the size of the study basin 600 km2 and provided climate inputs with reasonable spatial and temporal patterns with observed extremes such as dry cold warm and storm rasouli et al 2019 this sensitivity analysis serves as an early step to understand the shifts of boreal forest hydrology under a wide range of p and t perturbations one limitation of the linearly perturbed p and t inputs falls in that the seasonal patterns of p and t in the perturbed scenarios are kept same as that in the reference observations more extensive analysis to include the changes in seasonal p and t as well as the changes in rain and snow characteristics such as intensity and frequency could be helpful to provide more informative sensitivity estimation of hydrological process in the basin rasouli et al 2014 despite that the current simple method has informed the vulnerability of boreal forest hydrology to the changes in p and t and quantitatively revealed that the impacts of warming on hydrological processes depend strongly on p changes uncertainty in the hydrological modelling forms another limitation the selection of model parameter values has large effects on the estimated sensitivities of hydrological processes to climate perturbations in this study snow process soil and canopy parameter values were estimated based on field measurements and knowledge gained from fieldwork previous applications of crhm created models in the cold regions of canada indicate that setting these parameters based on understandings of the study basins from field research ellis et al 2010 fang et al 2013 and calibrating a small group of parameters such as soil hydraulic and storage by observed streamflow krogh et al 2017 had the potential to identify plausible values for the model parameters uncertainty of the model structure such as the insufficient representation for the poorly drained wetlands could lead to the underestimations of peak flow in summer davison et al 2016 to improve the representation for wetlands an alternative is to refine the hrus in the model however complex routing sequences among hrus when including more wetland hrus can potentially pose additional uncertainty for hydrological modelling in wgc 6 conclusions this study investigated the sensitivities of runoff and snow processes to perturbed climate in a well instrumented boreal forest basin white gull creek wgc in western canada a boreal hydrology model of the key hydrological processes and basin streamflow response was set up using the crhm platform and was parameterised primarily from knowledge of the basin with minor calibration using streamflow simulations for parameters describing drainage of the soil organic layer the model was verified against measurements of snow accumulation soil moisture and streamflow and eddy correlation flux tower observations of evapotranspiration et and was found to represent the hydrological cycle of the boreal forest reasonably well sensitivities of modelled hydrological processes to perturbed climate were quantified using perturbations of observed time series of precipitation p and air temperature t the major findings are 1 the basin hydrological variables presented variable sensitivities to perturbations of p and t annual runoff volume and maximum daily streamflow increased rapidly with rising p at rates of around 31 and 36 per 10 increase in p and declined with reduced p at lower rates of around 20 and 17 per 10 decrease in p annual runoff and maximum streamflow declined by around 4 and 6 respectively per 1 of warming annual et increased by 7 per 1 of warming a much stronger sensitivity than the 1 increase per 10 increase in p et changes with t controlled the streamflow volume sensitivity to t the onset of spring snowmelt advanced by 6 days per 1 warming and the snow cover duration declined by 10 days per 1 warming both showed stronger sensitivities to warming than to perturbed p change of centre of mass timing cmt of annual runoff per 1 warming was close but inverse to that per 10 increase in p runoff coefficient rc was more sensitive to perturbed p 16 per 10 increase in p and 15 per 10 decrease in p than to perturbed t 4 7 per 1 of warming 2 perturbations of p and t impacted the streamflow regime in very different ways increasing p enhanced the intra annual variability of basin runoff by generating substantially larger runoff volumes in the warm months may to september and much greater peak streamflow whilst warming t resulted in more even distribution of monthly runoff by reducing the fractional runoff volume in april to september and the magnitudes of peak streamflow meanwhile increasing p enhanced the inter annual variability of basin runoff in the warm months whilst rising t reduced the inter annual variability of runoff in the warm months but increased the inter annual variability of runoff in the cold months on the other hand increasing p reduced the relative contributions of spring and winter runoff to the annual runoff but enhanced the fractional contribution of summer runoff in contrast rising t reduced the fractional contribution of summer runoff but increased fractions of runoff generation in the autumn and winter seasons both p and t increases promoted a higher contribution of subsurface interflow to total runoff but the contributions of runoff components tended to show higher sensitivities to perturbed p than to perturbed t 3 effects of t warming on annual and seasonal runoff runoff components and basin snow accumulation could sometimes be compensated for by the effects of increasing p the annual runoff runoff components including subsurface interflow and rainfall overland flow and the seasonal runoff from autumn showed stronger sensitivities to changing p than to warming thus changes of these variables caused by warming from 1 to 6 could be compensated for by the changes forced by small increases of 10 in p variables such as runoff coefficient groundwater flow and seasonal runoff from spring summer and winter presented similar sensitivities to both changing p and t reductions of these variables caused by the maximum warming of 6 could be compensated for by the increases generated by 17 20 higher p other variables including the cmt of annual runoff and snow variables such as peak swe snow cover duration annual snow sublimation and snowmelt overland flow were more sensitive to warming than to perturbed p the maximum increase in p 30 could only compensate for the changes in these variables caused by warming of less than 4 credit authorship contribution statement zhihua he conceptualization methodology writing

4344,hydrological processes over and through frozen and unfrozen ground were simulated in the well instrumented boreal forest basin of white gull creek saskatchewan canada using a model created using the flexible cold regions hydrological modelling crhm platform the crhm created boreal hydrology model was structured and initially parameterized using decades of process hydrology research in the southern boreal forest with minor parameter calibration and generally produced quite good performance on simultaneously reproducing the measurements of runoff snow water equivalent swe soil liquid water content and eddy correlation flux tower observations of evapotranspiration et over two decades to examine the sensitivity of basin hydrology to perturbed climate inputs air temperature t inputs were set up by linear increments in the reference observation of up to 6 and precipitation p inputs were generated by multiplying the reference observed p from 70 to 130 the model results showed that the basin hydrological variables showed quite different sensitivities to perturbations of p and t the volume of annual runoff and the annual runoff coefficient increased more rapidly with rising p at rates of 31 and 16 per 10 increase in p but decreased by only 3 8 and 4 7 per 1 of warming annual et increased rapidly with temperature by 7 per 1 of warming and therefore drove the streamflow volumetric changes with warming but increased only 1 per 10 increase in p perturbations of p and t had distinctively different influences on the streamflow regime increased p enhanced the intra and inter annual variabilities of basin runoff reduced the relative contribution of winter runoff to annual runoff and increased the relative contribution of summer runoff whilst rising t resulted in the inverse changes in the streamflow regime effects of warming on some hydrological processes could be compensated for to varying degrees by the effects of increases in p reductions in the annual runoff volume and runoff coefficient caused by warming up to 6 could be compensated for by increases of 20 in p however the maximum increase in p 30 examined could only compensate for the changes in snow processes caused by warming of less than 4 and snow cover duration decreases with 1 warming could not be compensated for by any precipitation increase considered these results inform the vulnerability of boreal forest hydrology to the first order changes in p and t and provide guidance for further climate impact assessments for hydrology in the southern boreal forest in canada keywords boreal forest basin crhm created boreal hydrology model sensitivities of hydrological processes perturbed precipitation and temperature 1 introduction the boreal zone covers the northern high latitudes in north america and eurasia about 28 of which is in canada spanning from the international border between yukon and alaska to newfoundland and labrador brandt et al 2013 the boreal forest that dominates this zone is approximately one third of the global forested area gauthier et al 2015 and plays an important role in the hydrology of northern rivers in the circumpolar north buttle et al 2000 boreal forests are currently experiencing more severe climate change than the global average price et al 2013 and this is expected to continue in the future one reason for the stronger climatic change in boreal zones is the reduced surface albedo caused by reduced snow cover bonan 2008 euskirchen et al 2010 kozii et al 2017 recent analyses from environment and climate change canada reported by bush and lemmen 2019 suggest median temperature t and annual precipitation p increases of 2 3 c and 7 5 respectively for the period 2031 2050 and 6 4 c and 18 4 respectively for 2081 2100 under rcp8 5 compared to 1986 2005 such changes in t and p are magnified in winter and so could have strong effects on the snow accumulation and losses as well as other hydrological processes in boreal forest kozii et al 2017 however the sensitivities of hydrological processes to climate changes in boreal forest are less well understood in comparison to warmer regions in canada buttle and metcalfe 2000 metcalfe and buttle 2001 the boreal forest is characterized by a long and cold winter hardy et al 1998 nelson et al 2014 snow mass and energy balance in the forest are regulated by the canopy through multiple processes such as interception and sublimation of snowfall reduced shortwave radiation and enhanced longwave radiation from the forest trunk pomeroy et al 1998 pomeroy et al 2009 ellis et al 2010 rasmus et al 2013 higher canopy coverage typically results in increased snow interception and snow sublimation as well as slower snowmelt below the mature boreal forests pomeroy and granger 1997 hedstrom and pomeroy 1998 kozii et al 2017 pomeroy et al 2002 gelfan et al 2004 as a result winter snow accumulation under mature boreal forests that are dominated by needleleaf trees is substantially lower than that in adjacent clearings or deciduous forest stands pomeroy and gray 1995 snow and forest cover also influence the seasonal freezing of soils and spring snowmelt infiltration to and runoff over frozen soils gray et al 2001 the strong effects of forest canopy on snow accumulation and snowmelt in turn dictate the complexity in the runoff generation processes however boreal forests are typically remote and extensive sulla menashe et al 2018 creating great challenges for surface observations of its hydrometeorological characteristics for example brown et al 2019 demonstrated a lower density of snow observation in the boreal forest than those in the prairies and western mountains in canada the strong spatial variability of snow accumulation across forest and open clearing sites impairs the representativeness of point or small area snow surveys for estimates at a basin scale pomeroy et al 2002 empirical snowmelt models that need detailed field measurements for temperature index melt parameter calibration have limited predictive capability in the boreal forest basins where stand snow density varies substantially and calibration datasets are often unavailable ellis et al 2010 a physically based cold regions hydrological model which requires minor to no parameter calibration by field measurements is needed to capture the complicated runoff processes for boreal forests pomeroy et al 1999 changes in t and p cause distinctive changes in the operation of hydrological processes in boreal forest ecosystem rising t generally leads to increasing evapotranspiration and reduces soil water availability for tree growth in boreal forests granger and pomeroy 1997 elliott et al 1998 peng et al 2011 whilst increasing p has the potential to compensate for reduced water availability caused by rising t however to what extent the effect of warming t on water availability could be compensated for by increasing p has not been evaluated in boreal forest river basins climate change scenarios simulated by global and regional climate models gcm and rcm contain large uncertainties for future hydroclimates due to coarse spatial resolution non explicit parameterisation of convective storms li et al 2019 and low capability to capture the effects of sub grid features of precipitation dynamics and land cover feedbacks rasouli et al 2014 rasouli et al 2019 alternatively linear changes of p and t produced by perturbing the current observed time series of p and t from instrumented basins up to the corresponding change ranges projected by an ensemble of climate models have been demonstrated as highly suited to investigate the hydrological sensitivity to climate change and the compensation effects between p and t perturbations in cold regions e g rasouli et al 2014 rasouli et al 2015 aygün et al 2020 he 2021 in light of this background the objective of this paper is to investigate the sensitivities of hydrological processes in a boreal forest drainage basin to p and t perturbations the specific research questions are three fold 1 can the full range of boreal forest hydrological processes be represented in a physically based hydrological model with minimal parameter calibration 2 how is basin hydrology in the boreal forest sensitive to a wide range of perturbations of p and t 3 to what extent can the effects of warming t on hydrological processes in the boreal forest be compensated for by increased precipitation the questions will be addressed using perturbed p and t simulations made with a physically based hydrological model that is suitable for cold regions boreal forest hydrology and was tested in a well instrumented boreal forest research basin 2 study area and data the study was conducted in the white gull creek

law for unsaturated hydraulic conductivity fang et al 2013 pomeroy et al 2016 18 routing uses the muskingum method chow 1964 to route runoff between hrus and the clark s lag and route algorithm clark 1945 for subsurface interflow and groundwater flow in wgc six hrus were used to discretize the basin based on the land cover types open water and channel hjp ojp asp obs and fen shown in fig 1 and table 2 meteorological forcing data for the hrus were estimated by lapse rates derived from the observations at the ojp and obs sites the simulation was conducted for 19 years starting from 1998 to 2016 the boreal hydrological model performance for the simulations of runoff snow water equivalent swe soil liquid water content vwc and evapotranspiration were examined by four statistical metrics

estimation for the key hydrological processes in the boreal hydrology model of wgc basin is as follows blowing snow parameters vegetation heights were estimated from site observations values of 7 6 m 11 m 8 m 13 m and 0 1 m were set for the hjp ojp asp obs fen hrus respectively for the blowing snow fetch distance 300 m minimum value was used for all hrus in the basin due to the short undisrupted upwind distance in the forest environment this parameterisation effectively restricted blowing snow to the fen hru canopy parameters effective leaf area index lai in winter for forest types were estimated as the mean values from the measurements in chen et al 1997 and barr et al 2012 mean winter effective lai values of 1 5 2 4 0 5 and 3 6 were assigned for the hjp ojp asp and obs hrus respectively a winter effective lai of 0 1 was set for the open water and fen hrus given their low plant canopy coverage the canopy snow interception capacity values were set based on similar forest types in studies of schmidt and gluns 1991 hedstrom and pomeroy 1998 and pomeroy et al 2002 small values were set for the deciduous forest hru as it does not have a high capacity to intercept and hold snow pomeroy and gray 1995 therefore a small canopy snow interception capacity of 0 5 kg m2 was assigned for the asp hru higher values of 6 0 kg m2 and 5 9 kg m2 were set for ojp and obs hrus respectively while a lower value of 3 3 kg m2 was selected for the regenerated forest i e hjp hru based on the process studies of pomeroy and granger 1997 soil moisture parameters the model started on 1 october 1996 and value of 1 0 was set for initial soil saturation parameter assuming the fall soil moisture is saturated after the rainy summer the soil saturation was then updated based on soil moisture storage value every fall in the following hydrological years saturated hydraulic conductivities and pore size distributions for various soil layers were initialized based on the soil textures in wgc basin and then slightly adjusted using trial and error based on the nse and lognse values of the streamflow simulation in the calibration period the water storage capacities of soil layers were determined by multiplying soil layer depth by soil porosity for the soil depth and porosity averaged values for hrus were estimated from the predominant soil texture in the basin agriculture and agri food canada 2015 groundwater storage capacity was relatively unknown and so a maximum value of 200 mm was set for all hrus for surface depression storage capacities values of 0 15 0 55 mm were set for all hrus the detention storage and runoff drainage factor which controls the rate of drainage from the organic layer were manually calibrated using trial and error based on the nse and lognse values of streamflow simulation in the calibration period of 1998 2007 routing parameters the routing distribution parameter described by fang et al 2010 was used to model routing sequence between the six hrus the routing sequence generally follows the channel flow order from the upstream to the downstream part of the basin routing length of the main channel in each hru was estimated from the terrain pre processing gis analysis manning s equation was used to calculate the average streamflow velocity based on longitudinal channel slope manning s roughness coefficient and hydraulic radius chow 1964 the longitudinal channel slope was estimated as the tangent of the average slope of the hru manning s roughness coefficient was set to 0 016 considering the rather natural river channel in the basin the hydraulic radius was assumed as 0 25 m for all hrus a value of 0 25 was assigned for the dimensionless weighting factor that controls the level of attenuation 3 3 perturbed precipitation and temperature inputs hourly observations of p and t in the period from 1 january 1998 to 31 december 2016 were used as reference climate inputs for the perturbed simulation linearly perturbed p and t time series were used to represent the possible ranges of climate until the end of the 21st century in the study basin perturbed t inputs were set up by adding one degree increments to the reference observed hourly air t up to 6 as the maximum t increase in the study area is projected to about 6 until 2100 according to eccc 2016 and the canada s changing climate report by zhang et al 2019 perturbed p inputs were generated by multiplying the reference observed hourly p from 70 to 130 because the maximum p change range in the study area is around 30 until 2100 according to eccc 2016 and the canada s changing climate report by zhang et al 2019 seasonality of p and t in the perturbed input time series were kept the same as that in the reference observations as p and t in different months were perturbed by the same ranges relative humidity and wind speed were held same as those in the reference period to focus on the hydrological sensitivity to climate perturbations the forest disturbance caused by wildfire and human activity and changes in the soil properties such as reduced soil moisture storage from soil compaction during harvesting were not considered perturbed p and t inputs are summarized in table 3 in total six simulations of the perturbed t and six simulations of the perturbed p were conducted compensation between the effects of p and t perturbations on basin hydrology were investigated by combining each of the seven p simulations six perturbed p and a reference p with seven t simulations six perturbed t and a reference t 3 4 quantifying the sensitivities of hydrological processes to perturbed climate inputs the sensitivities of hydrological processes in the wgc basin were examined by changes in the selected magnitude and timing indices of water balance components or hydrological fluxes selected magnitude indices are annual runoff seasonal runoff annual peak runoff annual peak swe annual snow sublimation annual runoff coefficient annual rainfall ratio and annual evapotranspiration et runoff components include groundwater flow subsurface interflow from soil water and snowmelt and rainfall overland flow the investigated timing indices include timing of annual peak runoff centre of mass timing cmt of annual runoff timing of annual peak swe and duration of the snow covered period sensitivities of magnitude indices rm were quantified in eq 5 in which ms refers to the magnitude index produced by the perturbed climate inputs and mr refers to the magnitude index forced by the reference climate inputs sensitivities of timing indices rt were estimated by differencing as in eq 6 similarly ts refers to the timing index produced by the perturbed climate inputs and tr refers to the timing index forced by the reference climate inputs 5 r m m s m r m r 100 6 r t t s t r 4 results 4 1 model evaluation simulated swe in the ojp and obs hrus were compared to site observations in fig 3 no calibration was performed for parameters that affect the forest and snow processes simulations over the entire study period fig 3a b mb values were 0 1 and 0 15 and nrmse values were 0 43 and 0 48 for simulated swe at the ojp and obs sites respectively these small mb and nrmse values suggest that the model can adequately simulate snow accumulation and melt processes for mature jack pine and black spruce forests compared to the observations the model generally captured the seasonal evolution of swe in most years but had a large overestimation in two hydrological years 2003 2004 and 2013 2014 while in the 2015 2016 hydrological year the model underestimated the observed swe the relatively poor performance in these hydrological years is likely caused by the lack of accurate winter p measurements at both sites similarly to davison et al 2016 the model slightly overestimated annual et at the ojp and obs sites compared to the eddy correlation flux tower observations in the entire study period fig 4 no calibration was done for parameters in the evapotranspiration simulation mb value for simulated annual et at ojp was 0 11 while mb for simulated annual et at obs was only 0 03 this suggests that the overestimation is within 11 at both sites and the model could adequately obtain the annual et flux value for most years except for 2004 2006 and 2013 2014 when model estimated large differences in annual et compared to observations at the two forest sites modelled soil volumetric water content vwc in the ojp and obs hrus were compared with observations in fig 5 no calibration was performed for parameters to fit the soil moisture observation and comparisons were only conducted for unfrozen months 1 may to 30 september for observed vwc the weighted average of soil vwc of the layers of 0 15 cm and 15 30 cm was used to represent the vwc for the upper layer 0 28 cm and the weighted average of layers of 15 30 cm and 30 60 cm was used as vwc of the lower layer 28 45 cm for both modelled and observed soil vwc values at the ojp site were lower than those at the obs site as soil type is mainly loam sand at the ojp site and typically clay at the obs site at the ojp site fig 5a b the model generally overestimated vwc with mb values ranging from 0 11 for lower layer to 0 12 for upper layer nrmse values were no higher than 0 3 indicating reasonable model performance for seasonal soil moisture estimation at this site at the obs site fig 5c d the model underestimated vwc of the upper layer with mb values of 0 13 for the lower layer the model overestimated by 2 i e mb 0 02 the nrmse values were within 0 26 in both soil layers suggesting model adequately captured the seasonal fluctuations of soil moisture at the obs site fig 6 shows the comparisons of simulated and observed daily mean streamflow in wgc basin in two periods one for a parameter calibration period 1998 2007 and one for a validation period 2008 2016 observed streamflow in the year of 2011 was discarded for the evaluation considering the measurement errors noted in this year davison et al 2016 the model achieved lognse values of 0 8 and 0 74 in calibration and validation periods respectively indicating that model could simulate the low flows well in winter months nse values were 0 63 and 0 6 in the calibration and validation periods respectively suggesting that model s capability to predict high flows in spring and summer months was adequate but not as good as that for winter low flows mb values show that the model captured streamflow volume well in the wgc basin with 4 overestimation and 12 underestimation in the calibration and validation periods respectively considering the sparse observations of meteorological data uncertainty in streamflow estimates and the complex land cover condition in the basin the model generally obtains reasonable streamflow simulations and is comparable to results from the mesh hydrological land surface model previously applied to this basin in davison et al 2016 4 2 sensitivities of hydrological variables to perturbed p and t sensitivities of the selected magnitude and timing indices of hydrological variables to perturbed p and t are compared in fig 7 and table 4 annual runoff and maximum daily runoff responded directly to changing p and inversely with warming t however sensitivities varied markedly fig 7a for a decrease in p of 30 from the current climate the annual runoff and maximum runoff decreased by 61 and 52 respectively whereas they rose by 93 and 108 as the p increased by 30 table 4 with 6 of warming the annual runoff and maximum runoff declined by 23 and 35 respectively fig 7a the centre of mass timing cmt of annual runoff varied directly with changing precipitation fig 7b in which it advanced by 17 9 and 4 days in response to decreases in p of 30 20 and 10 respectively and recessed by 4 8 and 10 days when p increased by 10 20 and 30 respectively table 4 it responded to warming t in a near linear but inverse manner fig 7b and advanced by 19 days for 6 of warming however the timing of maximum runoff responded non linearly to p and t perturbations fig 7b there was little sensitivity of the maximum runoff timing to perturbed p except for increases in p of 20 30 for which the maximum runoff timing recessed sharply by up to 32 days table 4 this suggests threshold behaviour in runoff timing in the basin the annual maximum runoff occurred earlier with warming t but with substantial variability where 5 of warming resulted in an advance of 22 days but 6 of warming advanced the maximum runoff timing by only 14 days the volume of annual peak swe varied almost linearly with p fig 7c declining by 36 24 and 12 as p declined by 30 20 and 10 and increasing by 12 24 and 37 as p increased by 10 20 and 30 table 4 peak swe declined by 13 as t increased by 1 c and by 61 for an increase of 6 above reference levels fig 7c table 4 annual et was insensitive to perturbed p increasing very slightly by 3 for a p increase of 30 and declining by only 8 for a p decrease of 30 in contrast et was very sensitive to warming with a 42 increase for 6 of warming fig 7c and table 4 the timing of annual peak swe and the snow cover duration also responded more strongly to perturbed t than to perturbed p fig 7d when p increased by 30 the date of annual peak swe recessed by 4 days and the snow cover duration increased by 4 days whilst the date of annual peak swe advanced by 9 days and the snow cover duration shortened by 9 days for just 1 of warming remarkably 6 of warming resulted in a 36 day advance in the timing of peak swe and a 62 day decline in snow cover duration table 4 fig 7e compares the sensitivities of annual snow sublimation runoff coefficient and rainfall ratio to the perturbed p and t annual snow sublimation increased by 15 as the annual p rose by 30 whilst it decreased by around 18 with a p reduction of 30 the impact of warming t on annual snow sublimation is very high a 7 reduction in snow sublimation was caused by 1 of warming and a 36 decrease corresponded to 6 of warming the runoff coefficient was enhanced near linearly with increases in p at an average rate of 16 per 10 increase in p whilst reductions in the runoff coefficient were at an average rate of 4 7 per 1 of warming due to the enhanced annual et fig 7c rainfall ratio was insensitive to perturbed p but increased at an average rate of 3 per 1 of warming 4 3 changes of streamflow regime in response to p and t perturbations the simulated monthly runoff forced by reference p in 1998 2016 and 30 increase and decrease in p are compared to illustrate the intra annual variability of basin runoff for varied levels of p input fig 8 a lower p resulted in a smaller runoff volume that is distributed more evenly over the seasons in contrast to increasing p that leads to substantially larger runoff volumes being generated in warm months may to september and much greater runoff for low frequency events on the flow duration curve fdc calculated over the entire simulation period fig 8c the simulated monthly runoff from the reference t and warming of 1 and 6 are compared in fig 8b increasing t resulted in a more even distribution of monthly runoff with t increasing by 6 the runoff in april to september was reduced leading to reduced runoff for low frequency events as evident by changes to the fdc fig 8d the variations of monthly runoff in the boxplots fig 8a and 8b were estimated from the monthly runoff in each year of the entire study period indicating the inter annual variability of monthly runoff during the simulation period increasing p enhanced the inter annual variability of runoff especially for the warm months whilst raising t reduced the inter annual variability of runoff in the warm months but increased the inter annual variability of runoff in the cold months the higher variability of runoff in the cold months with warming t is due to increasing mid winter melt events and likely complex interactions with frozen soils and basal ice layers and the lower variability of runoff in warm months with warming t is result of lower antecedent soil moisture impact on rainfall runoff generation the inter annual variability of simulated daily hydrographs from the above perturbed p and t are illustrated in fig 8e f again the inter annual variability of daily runoff in warm months increased with p but decreased with t sensitivities of seasonal runoff and runoff components to p and t perturbations in wgc basin are shown in fig 9 and table 5 the seasonal runoff generally increased with p fig 9a but the relative contributions of spring mam march to may and winter djf december to february runoff to annual volumes declined as p increased fig 9c when p increased from 70 to 130 of the reference observation the winter and spring runoff increased by 4 mm and 45 mm table 5 whilst their contributions to the annual runoff volume decreased by 9 and 5 respectively fig 9c for the same p increase autumn son september to november runoff increased by about 40 mm with little change in its contribution to the annual runoff summer jja june to august runoff rose by about 91 mm with its contribution to annual runoff increasing by 14 fig 9c partly because of the enhanced rainfall storms in summer in contrast seasonal runoff volumes generally decreased with rising t except for winter runoff fig 9b the fractional contribution of summer runoff decreased by 11 as t rose by 6 fig 9d such t rise promoted increasing fractions of runoff generation in cold seasons resulting in 5 7 and 4 6 higher contributions for autumn and winter runoff respectively but little change in the fractional contributions from spring runoff sensitivities of the major runoff components deep groundwater flow subsurface interflow from soil water snowmelt overland flow and rainfall overland flow to the p and t perturbations are shown in fig 9a b and e f both p and t increases led to a higher contribution of subsurface interflow to total runoff and little change in the contribution of rainfall overland flow to total runoff fig 9e f groundwater flow generally increased with higher p and rose by about 70 mm when p increased from 70 to 130 of the reference observations table 5 but its contribution to total runoff diminished because there was much higher increase of 179 mm in total runoff dominated by an increase in subsurface interflow while groundwater flow decreased with warming t its fractional contribution to total runoff remained unchanged fig 9f snowmelt overland flow increased with higher p and declined with warmer t table 5 yet its fractional contribution to total runoff decreased when either p or t increased fig 9e f overall the contributions of runoff components tended to show higher sensitivities to p perturbation than to t perturbation 4 4 compensatory effects of p and t perturbations as shown in fig 7 increasing p resulted in higher annual runoff while warming t reduced the generation of runoff the compensatory effects of p and t perturbations on hydrological processes were therefore explored fig 10 shows strong sensitivities of annual runoff to changing precipitation snow covered duration to t and peak swe date cmt of annual runoff runoff coefficient and snow sublimation to both t and p reduction of annual runoff caused by 1 of warming could be compensated for by the runoff increase from a 1 7 increase in p fig 10a and the advance of the annual runoff cmt caused by 1 of warming could be compensated for by a 7 p increase fig 10b the reduction of annual runoff caused by 6 of warming could be compensated for by runoff increase generated by a 10 increase in precipitation however the maximum increase in p considered 30 could only compensate for the advance in cmt of annual runoff caused by 3 8 of warming the reduced magnitude of runoff coefficient caused by 1 of warming could be compensated for when a 4 5 increase in p occurred fig 10c a 19 increase in p could completely compensate for the reduction of runoff coefficient caused by the highest warming of 6 decreases in peak swe and annual snow sublimation caused by 1 of warming could be compensated for by 13 and 15 increases in p respectively fig 10d and f but the maximum increase of p 30 could only compensate for the reductions in peak swe and snow sublimation caused by 2 2 and 2 of warming respectively decrease in snow cover duration caused by 1 of warming could not be compensated for fig 10e even by the upper bound of 30 increase in precipitation fig 11 a d show that subsurface interflow and rainfall overland flow are most sensitive to p whilst groundwater flow and snowmelt overland flow are sensitive to both p and t compensatory behaviour by p and t in controlling the sensitivities of runoff components follows those relationships reduction of groundwater from 1 of warming could be compensated for by a 3 p increase while decreased subsurface interflow and snowmelt overland flow caused by 1 of warming were offset by 1 and 7 p increases respectively reduction of groundwater and subsurface interflow caused by the maximum warming of 6 could be offset by 18 and 5 p increases respectively however the maximum increase in p 30 could only compensate for reduction of snowmelt overland flow caused by around 4 of warming and there was no consistent compensatory behaviour by p and t for the sensitivity of rainfall overland flow fig 11d fig 11e h shows that spring and autumn runoff are strongly affected by increases in p and less affected by rises in t whilst winter runoff is more sensitive to warming t for the higher p i e 110 to 130 p perturbations the reduction of spring runoff caused by 1 of warming could be compensated for by a 4 p increase whilst decreased summer runoff and autumn runoff caused by 1 of warming were offset by 3 and 0 7 increases in p respectively the reductions of runoff in spring summer and autumn caused by the maximum t warming 6 could be compensated for by p increases of about 16 18 and 4 respectively increasing p and rising t both tended to result in higher winter runoff and thus the maximum warming of 6 could offset the loss in winter runoff caused by a 12 decrease in p 5 discussion 5 1 variable sensitivities of runoff and snow processes to p and t perturbations in white gull creek wgc basin the non linear sensitivity of hydrological variables to perturbed p could be partly attributed to the complex effects of soil storage in particular p had primary control on the water availability and its variation affected the runoff generation in wgc davison et al 2016 under low p input conditions p mainly supported infiltration into soils to fill the soil and groundwater storages and was exhausted by et loss back to atmosphere leading to lower runoff in contrast higher p more likely saturated the soil and groundwater storages and promoted greater runoff generation as a result the annual runoff and peak runoff showed larger sensitivity to the changes of p under high p input conditions table 4 and fig 7a subsurface interflow and groundwater flow were more sensitive to perturbed p compared to rainfall and snowmelt overland flows fig 9a and table 5 as p primarily infiltrated into the porous forest soils in wgc on the other hand the basin peak swe showed linear sensitivity to perturbed p as soil storage has no effect on the snow accumulation the sensitivities of runoff and snow processes to p perturbation are generally consistent with those findings in other cold regions such as lópez moreno et al 2012 rasouli et al 2014 the non linear sensitivities of runoff processes to perturbed t can be partly explained by the effects of warming on et snow cover disappearance and the thawing of frozen soil in particular warming leads to higher et and increases the infiltration capacity of frozen soil in this basin ireson et al 2015 for fixed p input the increased et due to warming has an important control on the annual volume of runoff from wgc nijssen and lettenmaier 2002 the complicated et increases in response to warming shown in fig 7c are results of complex processes in soil moisture transpiration season and rainfall interception that both affect annual et losses and this non linear sensitivity of et to perturbed t is consistent with the findings in boreal forest by brown et al 2014 on the other hand warming t accelerates the thawing of frozen soil endalamaw et al 2017 and promotes the contribution of subsurface interflow to the total runoff in addition the psychrometric energy balance method used for p phase partitioning harder and pomeroy 2013 and complex snow processes such as sublimation and interception in boreal forest hedstrom and pomeroy 1998 as well as energy balance based snowmelt estimation marks et al 1998 are sensitive to t and could be reasons for the non linear response of peak swe to t perturbation these non linear effects of warming on hydrological and snow processes in wgc are generally similar to the findings demonstrated by woo et al 2008 and holmberg et al 2014 in other boreal forests 5 2 limitations the effects of climate on forest canopy such as the increasing wildfire occurrence and intensity as well as the gradual reduction in canopy lai and snow interception capacity caused by t warming and drought boulanger et al 2016 were not considered the disturbance of forest by potential wildfire or disease and the regrowth of harvested forest as well as the change of soil properties in the basin were also not considered in this study when investigating the sensitivities of hydrological processes to p and t perturbations this investigation procedure is similar to the hydrological sensitivity analysis to perturbed climate by rasouli et al 2014 and rasouli et al 2015 this study focuses on the sensitivity of hydrological processes to perturbed p and t instead of projection of future hydrology using an ensemble forcing data from earth system models esms the linear perturbations of precipitation and temperature are not climate change scenarios projected by esms but rather provide a range of potential future changes this climate perturbation method was used because of its special function on investigating what combinations of precipitation and temperature changes can induce significant hydrological changes in the boreal forest basin rasouli et al 2014 and what the roles of particular p or t perturbations are in shaping the responses of specific hydrological processes this simple method avoided the heavy computational cost of dynamically downscaling climate models to the size of the study basin 600 km2 and provided climate inputs with reasonable spatial and temporal patterns with observed extremes such as dry cold warm and storm rasouli et al 2019 this sensitivity analysis serves as an early step to understand the shifts of boreal forest hydrology under a wide range of p and t perturbations one limitation of the linearly perturbed p and t inputs falls in that the seasonal patterns of p and t in the perturbed scenarios are kept same as that in the reference observations more extensive analysis to include the changes in seasonal p and t as well as the changes in rain and snow characteristics such as intensity and frequency could be helpful to provide more informative sensitivity estimation of hydrological process in the basin rasouli et al 2014 despite that the current simple method has informed the vulnerability of boreal forest hydrology to the changes in p and t and quantitatively revealed that the impacts of warming on hydrological processes depend strongly on p changes uncertainty in the hydrological modelling forms another limitation the selection of model parameter values has large effects on the estimated sensitivities of hydrological processes to climate perturbations in this study snow process soil and canopy parameter values were estimated based on field measurements and knowledge gained from fieldwork previous applications of crhm created models in the cold regions of canada indicate that setting these parameters based on understandings of the study basins from field research ellis et al 2010 fang et al 2013 and calibrating a small group of parameters such as soil hydraulic and storage by observed streamflow krogh et al 2017 had the potential to identify plausible values for the model parameters uncertainty of the model structure such as the insufficient representation for the poorly drained wetlands could lead to the underestimations of peak flow in summer davison et al 2016 to improve the representation for wetlands an alternative is to refine the hrus in the model however complex routing sequences among hrus when including more wetland hrus can potentially pose additional uncertainty for hydrological modelling in wgc 6 conclusions this study investigated the sensitivities of runoff and snow processes to perturbed climate in a well instrumented boreal forest basin white gull creek wgc in western canada a boreal hydrology model of the key hydrological processes and basin streamflow response was set up using the crhm platform and was parameterised primarily from knowledge of the basin with minor calibration using streamflow simulations for parameters describing drainage of the soil organic layer the model was verified against measurements of snow accumulation soil moisture and streamflow and eddy correlation flux tower observations of evapotranspiration et and was found to represent the hydrological cycle of the boreal forest reasonably well sensitivities of modelled hydrological processes to perturbed climate were quantified using perturbations of observed time series of precipitation p and air temperature t the major findings are 1 the basin hydrological variables presented variable sensitivities to perturbations of p and t annual runoff volume and maximum daily streamflow increased rapidly with rising p at rates of around 31 and 36 per 10 increase in p and declined with reduced p at lower rates of around 20 and 17 per 10 decrease in p annual runoff and maximum streamflow declined by around 4 and 6 respectively per 1 of warming annual et increased by 7 per 1 of warming a much stronger sensitivity than the 1 increase per 10 increase in p et changes with t controlled the streamflow volume sensitivity to t the onset of spring snowmelt advanced by 6 days per 1 warming and the snow cover duration declined by 10 days per 1 warming both showed stronger sensitivities to warming than to perturbed p change of centre of mass timing cmt of annual runoff per 1 warming was close but inverse to that per 10 increase in p runoff coefficient rc was more sensitive to perturbed p 16 per 10 increase in p and 15 per 10 decrease in p than to perturbed t 4 7 per 1 of warming 2 perturbations of p and t impacted the streamflow regime in very different ways increasing p enhanced the intra annual variability of basin runoff by generating substantially larger runoff volumes in the warm months may to september and much greater peak streamflow whilst warming t resulted in more even distribution of monthly runoff by reducing the fractional runoff volume in april to september and the magnitudes of peak streamflow meanwhile increasing p enhanced the inter annual variability of basin runoff in the warm months whilst rising t reduced the inter annual variability of runoff in the warm months but increased the inter annual variability of runoff in the cold months on the other hand increasing p reduced the relative contributions of spring and winter runoff to the annual runoff but enhanced the fractional contribution of summer runoff in contrast rising t reduced the fractional contribution of summer runoff but increased fractions of runoff generation in the autumn and winter seasons both p and t increases promoted a higher contribution of subsurface interflow to total runoff but the contributions of runoff components tended to show higher sensitivities to perturbed p than to perturbed t 3 effects of t warming on annual and seasonal runoff runoff components and basin snow accumulation could sometimes be compensated for by the effects of increasing p the annual runoff runoff components including subsurface interflow and rainfall overland flow and the seasonal runoff from autumn showed stronger sensitivities to changing p than to warming thus changes of these variables caused by warming from 1 to 6 could be compensated for by the changes forced by small increases of 10 in p variables such as runoff coefficient groundwater flow and seasonal runoff from spring summer and winter presented similar sensitivities to both changing p and t reductions of these variables caused by the maximum warming of 6 could be compensated for by the increases generated by 17 20 higher p other variables including the cmt of annual runoff and snow variables such as peak swe snow cover duration annual snow sublimation and snowmelt overland flow were more sensitive to warming than to perturbed p the maximum increase in p 30 could only compensate for the changes in these variables caused by warming of less than 4 credit authorship contribution statement zhihua he conceptualization methodology writing
