gfl gesellschaft für labortechnik mbh burgwede germany the 48 h culture was centrifuged model pk 120r thermo electron corporation waltham ma usa for 20 min at 4 c and 6000 rpm the pellet was resuspended in 1 ml of quarter strength ringer s solution ringer s solution ¼ strength lab m limited lancashire uk to yield an inoculum count of approximately 1011 cfu ml in order to determine the exact initial concentration of the inoculum appropriate serial decimal dilutions in ringer s solution were surface plated on cye agar 2 2 sample preparation and inoculation bottled water commercially available in the greek market was used as a model medium for all the experiments table 1 displays the main chemical and physicochemical characteristics of the water used in the present study as depicted on the label water bottles of 1 5 l were purchased from a local retail premise and transferred to the laboratory where they were kept under refrigeration 5 c portions 100 ml of the water were dispensed in 200 ml duran bottles and autoclaved after sterilization the ph of the water was adjusted to 7 5 with filtered 5 w v hydrochloric acid hydrochloric acid solution merck using a digital ph meter with an epoxy refillable ph probe orion 3 star ph benchtop thermo electron corporation beverly ma usa the water samples were then submerged in a preheated water bath nb 9 nüve sanayi malzemeleri imalat ve ticaret a ş ankara turkey in order to reach the desired temperature after preheating a 0 1 ml aliquot of the inoculum was inoculated in each water sample final concentration 108 cfu ml 2 3 thermal inactivation experiments inoculated water samples mixed manually for approximately 10 seconds after inoculation were heated under controlled isothermal 51 53 55 57 59 and 61 c and fluctuating temperature conditions submerged in a water bath the latter experiments were carried out by initially adjusting the water bath at the temperature set as the starting point of the dynamic profile and then resetting it to the final desired temperature thermal inactivation experiments at isothermal conditions were conducted thrice with two individual samples being analyzed for each replication n 6 for the dynamic temperature profiles one independent experiment was conducted with two replicates n 2 for all the thermal inactivation experiments under isothermal or dynamic temperature conditions the temperature of the samples was monitored during the heating period using electronic temperature monitoring devices cox tracer cox technologies belmont nc usa with a time interval of 30 seconds appropriate serial decimal dilutions of water samples 1ml in ringer s solution were surface plated on cye agar for the enumeration of l pneumophila colonies were counted after incubation of the plates at 35 c for 5 days 2 4 data analysis the experimental data log10 cfu ml of l pneumophila with time for each temperature were fitted to a log linear regression bigelow primary model using the microsoft office excel program as a result the kinetic parameter for inactivation d t value was estimated for each temperature condition the bigelow model considers a log linear relationship between the microbial population and the elapsed time t as shown in eq 1 the parameter d t equals the negative inverse of the slope of the line 1 log 10 n log 10 n 0 t d t where n 0 is the initial number of microorganisms and n their number at time t the effect of temperature on the kinetic parameter d t value was modelled using the following z value secondary model poschet et al 2005 originally proposed by bigelow 1921 2 log 10 d t log 10 d ref t ref t z where t ref is a reference temperature 55 c z is the temperature increase necessary to obtain a 10 fold reduction of the d t value and provides an indication of the sensitivity of the microorganism to temperature variations and d ref is the decimal reduction time at the reference temperature t ref in order to determine the values of z and log10 d ref as well as the confidence and the prediction intervals the fitting procedure was performed using the tablecurve 2d software systat software inc san jose ca usa the quality of the fitting was evaluated graphically and by estimating the coefficient of determination r2 the 95 prediction intervals for log10 d t were estimated as described in lindgren 1993 the developed model was further validated under five different dynamic temperature profiles prediction of inactivation was based on the differential equation of the primary model eq 3 while the evolution d t with temperature is ruled by eq 2 the initial concentration n 0 was determined experimentally by the plate count method upper and lower 95 prediction limits for the reduction of the population under dynamic temperature conditions were estimated based on the respective upper and lower 95 prediction limits for the corresponding log10 d t 3 d lo g 10 n d t 1 10 log 10 d ref t ref t z the performance of the model in predicting the inactivation of l pneumophila at dynamic temperature conditions was evaluated by a graphical comparison between observed and predicted inactivation and by estimating the performance indices of bias and accuracy factors ross 1996 eqn 4 and 5 bias b f and accuracy factors a f equal to 1 indicate a perfect agreement between predicted and observed values it is generally accepted that for b f a value in the range of 0 75 to 1 25 can be considered acceptable ross 1996 the accuracy factor is always equal to or greater than 1 and its distance from the later value indicates the difference between model s predictions and observed microbial behavior as proposed by ross 1996 b f and a f can be employed for time based responses such as lag time time to an n fold increase or rates thus in the present study the comparison was made between the observed time and the predicted time for a certain population reduction as following 4 b f 10 σ log x predicted x observed n 5 a f 10 σ log x predicted x observed n where x is the time predicted or observed for a certain population reduction and n is the number of observations used for the calculation the comparison was made for a total of 111 pairs of population reductions for evaluating the performance of the model for all the tested dynamic profiles but also for different subgroups referring to each dynamic temperature profile 3 results and discussion 3 1 model development inactivation curves of l pneumophila in model water at 51 53 55 57 59 and 61 c are illustrated in fig 1 the effect of heating on the population concentration was more profound with increasing temperature briefly the exposure of the population at 51οc resulted in a decrease of the concentration of approximately 1 6 logs after 35 min while the reduction at 53 55 57 59 and 61 οc was 3 6 5 4 6 4 6 6 and 6 logs after 35 25 12 5 and 2 min as expected the higher the temperature the higher the inactivation rate characteristically the time needed for 1 log reduction ranges from approximately 16 min at 51οc to less than 1 min at 59οc the results showed that the inactivation curves can be considered linear and can be described by the log linear primary model of bigelow 1921 thus the inactivation data for each temperature were fitted to the model fig 1b providing good statistical fits the estimated r2 values table 2 varied from 0 875 to 0 995 indicating that the selected model can adequately describe the inactivation kinetics furthermore as depicted in table 2 the inactivation kinetic parameter d value ranged from 0 23 to 0 35 min at 61 c up to 16 98 to 25 31 min at 51 c in order to describe the effect of temperature on the inactivation kinetics of l pneumophila in water the calculated d values for each temperature were further modeled with the use of a secondary model eq 2 the reference temperature t ref of the secondary model was fixed to 55 c as the mean of the temperature range tested according to dolan et al 2013 t ref has no biological meaning but contributes to better parameter identifiability in addition the authors highlighted the importance of individually setting t ref for each data set at the mean of the minimum and maximum temperatures studied a consideration that was also previously supported by poschet et al 2005 fig 2 shows the fitting of the secondary model characterized by a linear decrease of the logarithm of d value with increasing temperature the inverse of the slope of the regression line which is the z value was found to be 5 54 c while at the same time the logarithm of d ref log10 d ref was 0 54 a similar z value estimated at 4 98 c has also been reported by sanden et al 1989 the statistics for the parameters of the secondary model table 3 as well as the graphical evaluation of the fitting curve indicated the satisfactory performance of the developed model on the effect of temperature on the d value of l pneumophila thermal inactivation of l pneumophila has been previously described in several studies particularly in a pioneer work reported by dennis et al 1984 the d value of l pneumophila was found to be 111 27 and 6 min at 50 54 and 58 c respectively similarly other studies evidenced a decimal reduction time of approximately 2 min at 60 c schulze röbbecke et al 1987 stout et al 1986 however the findings of the present work bear differences from the abovementioned studies since the estimated d values in our study tend to be lower these discrepancies could be attributed to the bacterium s diverse thermal susceptibility allegra et al 2011 steinert et al 1998 whiley et al 2017 in most cases hotels and hospitals associated with legionnaires disease constitute isolation sources codony et al 2002 kool et al 1999 leoni et al 2005 environmental strains usually exhibit increased resistance to adverse conditions such as exposure to temperature fluctuations leading to increased d values this phenomenon usually occurs in amoeba grown l pneumophila intracellular replication within amoeba leads to the bacterium s phenotypic modulation with further implications in its resistance to eradication methods including high temperatures kwaik et al 1997 venkataraman and kwaik 2000 additionally environmental strains are possible to have been involved in bacterial communities such as biofilms which are characterized by increased resistance to various stresses barker et al 1992 cargill et al 1992 santegoeds et al 1998 besides the above another factor presumably responsible for the differences in legionella s thermal susceptibility may be the repeated exposure of the microorganism to high temperatures especially for short periods of time the emergence of strains that are more resistant to high temperatures due to adaptation to a wide range of temperatures is a possible explanation lesnik et al 2016 sharaby et al 2017 this hypothesis is supported by studies reporting that l pneumophila strains isolated after the performance of heat shocks exhibited increased survival ability allegra et al 2011 ghrairi et al 2013 taking into consideration that periodic curative thermal shocks are often employed for water sanitation it is not a surprise that l pneumophila is repeatedly isolated from such water systems mouchtouri et al 2007 papadakis et al 2018 this recurrent presence of l pneumophila can be attributed to a distinct composition of the bacterial membrane modifications in the lipid composition due to increases in growth temperature can lead to an increased saturation degree thus resulting in higher heat resistance mañas et al 2003 a similar correlation about the cell membrane playing an important role in the resistance to heat stress has been highlighted by chang et al 2007 but this time nutrient deficiency was the key factor the authors demonstrated that the induction of proteins and gene products and the stabilization of cell membrane due to starvation contributed to legionella s resistance to high temperatures in the majority of the studies described above a significant number of environmental factors were involved thus making it difficult to compare with the present study that was performed under carefully defined and well controlled laboratory conditions however differences can be observed even in the case of experiments conducted under laboratory conditions as well cervero aragό et al 2015 used the same strain as in the current work and reported a 4 log reduction in approximately 10 min at 55 c although the strain was observed to be less resistant to elevated temperatures thermo susceptibility differences could be attributed to the different methodology used even though l pneumophila can be a notable water related microbiological hazard there are other waterborne microorganisms that may imperil public health in a study by spinks et al 2006 the authors demonstrated that the d values of enterococcus faecalis haemolytic escherichia coli o157 h7 pseudomonas aeruginosa salmonella typhimurium serratia marcescens and klebsiella pneumoniae at 55 c were 633 223 304 77 71 and 22 s respectively on the one hand the d value of e coli o157 h7 was found to be similar with those of l pneumophila d 55 212 258 s on the other hand s typhimurium s marcescens and k pneumoniae exhibited much faster log reductions while at the same time e faecalis and p aeruginosa showed higher d values beside the differences in thermal resistances between the microorganisms and l pneumophila it became evident that the temperature control regimen of maintaining water temperature at 60 c should be followed in any case as highlighted by the authors of the abovementioned study spinks et al 2006 as a result thermal control measures against l pneumophila could be considered applicable regarding other water borne bacteria 3 2 model validation under dynamic temperature conditions validation is an essential step after modelling further external validation using new data not used for fitting the model seem to be indispensable to confirm the robustness of the developed model for this in the present study the developed model was further validated at non isothermal conditions in real life water temperature is constantly fluctuating because of the complexity of the water distribution systems and the heat losses that occur as a result lower temperatures can be encountered usually at distal points of the installation arvand et al 2011 serrano suárez et al 2013 a study of bérard et al 2015 reported temperature fluctuations in hot water distribution systems mainly because of the heat losses that occur at the water heater outlets return loops and points of use in the same study a decrease in temperature was observed from 60 to below 50 c because of stagnation the time period for fully insulated copper pipes was 30 min and for non insulated ones 10 min in order to simulate these realistic conditions it is required that the developed model be validated under dynamic temperature conditions validation experiments were carried out using five dynamic temperature profiles within a temperature range from 51 to 59 c the tested profiles included an abrupt temperature upshift also the performance of the model was graphically evaluated by comparing the experimentally observed and predicted inactivation at dynamic temperature conditions as illustrated in figs 3 to 7 in total for all the time temperature profiles tested the model provided satisfactory predictions regarding the inactivation of l pneumophila the effectiveness of thermal treatment applied for temperature upshifts figs 3 to 5 increased with the elevation of temperature and exposure time as expected respectively for temperature downshifts figs 6 and 7 the inactivation rate of the microbial population appeared to be initially higher as the microbial cells were gradually exposed to lower temperatures the inactivation rate was clearly slower it needs to be noted here that for the temperature profile from 59 to 53 c fig 6 it was observed that the temperature was maintained at high levels for a period of time enough to result in the fast eradication of l pneumophila population even before the temperature reaches the lowest desired one apart from the graphical comparison the bias b f and accuracy a f factors were also used to evaluate the performance of the model in predicting l pneumophila inactivation at dynamic temperature conditions bias factor is a measure of the relative average deviation between predicted and observed times for a certain population reduction indicating the extend of the systematic over or under prediction of the model accuracy factor which is estimated using absolute values provides a measure of the average difference between predicted and observed values mellefont et al 2003 ross 1996 the overall estimate of the bias factor was b f 1 05 indicating a negligible systematic error of the model the accuracy factor estimation was a f 1 28 indicating that the predicted times for a certain population reduction are slightly higher than the observed ones with model s errors being on the safe side furthermore b f and a f were estimated for each tested dynamic profile separately table 4 in almost all cases the bias factor was within the acceptable performance range of 0 75 1 25 ross 1996 and only for the dynamic profile presented in fig 7 was slightly higher accuracy factor was also acceptable for almost all the profiles tested given the number of environmental parameters of the model mellefont et al 2003 and the fact that the spread of the observed values about the predicted values increases at low population levels right part of the inactivation curves where the sampling error and the biological variability are increased aspridou and koutsoumanis 2015 although there is a significant amount of data regarding thermal inactivation for a wide range of foodborne pathogens buzrul and alpas 2007 huang 2013 2009 lang et al 2017 studies focusing on waterborne pathogens remain scarce as a result mathematical models for the thermal inactivation of water related bacteria is very limited in addition as chlorination is considered to be the most common disinfection method for drinking water and ozone related regimens are more and more frequently being employed experimental data from such works are more often modelled gyürék et al 1997 janex et al 2000 mecha et al 2019 with regard to l pneumophila the limited amount of studies related to modelling of inactivation kinetics are based on data derived from experiments conducted under the influence of ultraviolet radiation chemicals and ozone jakubek et al 2013 li et al 2017 rattanakul and oguma 2018 to the best of our knowledge the model developed in the present study is the first one describing the effect of temperature on l pneumophila inactivation in water even though temperature related regimens are applied to control the presence of the microorganism in water systems based on the model s satisfactory performance it would be safe to propose that it could be used in order to control l pneumophila during thermal treatments predictive microbiology is a really valuable tool and can constitute an alternative efficient and systematic approach for the control of water related pathogens ideally during temperature control regimens water should be kept between 55 and 60 c or even 80 c in the case of thermal shock as suggested by ecdc 2017 in the present study the kinetic behavior of l pneumophila was studied in the temperature range of 51 to 61 c and the developed model can be used to predict the time temperature combinations that are required in order to ensure the microbiological safety of the water even in the case that the target temperature cannot be achieved or maintained along the whole system it should be stressed here however that the model for the effect of temperature on the inactivation behavior of the pathogen was developed using sterilized bottled natural mineral water as a model system of great interest is to validate the developed model against tap water or even water used in other premises and closed systems it is possible that the diverse physicochemical probably microbial and chemical characteristics of the water may affect the inactivation behavior of the pathogen and an appropriate correction of the model cannot be excluded it should also be kept in mind that the water flow in plumbing systems as well as the design and the nature of the systems themselves may also affect the inactivation of l pneumophila boppe et al 2016 gavalda et al 2019 the plumbing systems in large buildings such as hotels or hospitals probably harbor the cells of the pathogen in their biofilm lifestyle however in the present study the model for the effect of temperature on the inactivation behavior of the pathogen was developed using planktonic cells of a single strain of special importance is to validate the developed model against others strains and with cells organized in biofilm environments it is known that biofilm cells are characterized by increased resistance against environmental stresses compared to the free living planktonic ones sauer 2003 thus in this respect further research is required in a future study the model could also be extended in a way in order to take into account factors such as strain variability water flow in plumbing systems biofilm cells and the presence and concentration of disinfectants such as hypochlorite and hydrogen peroxide with the aid of predictive microbiology better control of the water thermal disinfection can be achieved and the present study is only the first step towards this goal an integrated preventive system for the effective control of l pneumophila in large premises plumbing systems 4 conclusions the present study provides useful data regarding the development of a predictive model for the effect of temperature on the inactivation of l pneumophila in model water validation studies indicated that the model satisfactorily predicted the behavior of the pathogen in water under dynamic temperature conditions the application of the developed model in combination with an effective temperature monitoring system in water plumbing premises can be regarded a useful tool that could lead to the establishment of a more effective control system against l

agar cye biolab budapest hungary plates supplied with a growth supplement legionella bcye growth supplement with cysteine biolab and was renewed weekly the strain was activated by transferring a single colony from fresh cye plates into 10 ml of the growth supplement enriched with 10 yeast extract ye merck darmstadt germany and incubating for 48 h at 35 c under continuous shaking at 100 rpm gfl gesellschaft für labortechnik mbh burgwede germany the 48 h culture was centrifuged model pk 120r thermo electron corporation waltham ma usa for 20 min at 4 c and 6000 rpm the pellet was resuspended in 1 ml of quarter strength ringer s solution ringer s solution ¼ strength lab m limited lancashire uk to yield an inoculum count of approximately 1011 cfu ml in order to determine the exact initial concentration of the inoculum appropriate serial decimal dilutions in ringer s solution were surface plated on cye agar 2 2 sample preparation and inoculation bottled water commercially available in the greek market was used as a model medium for all the experiments table 1 displays the main chemical and physicochemical characteristics of the water used in the present study as depicted on the label water bottles of 1 5 l were purchased from a local retail premise and transferred to the laboratory where they were kept under refrigeration 5 c portions 100 ml of the water were dispensed in 200 ml duran bottles and autoclaved after sterilization the ph of the water was adjusted to 7 5 with filtered 5 w v hydrochloric acid hydrochloric acid solution merck using a digital ph meter with an epoxy refillable ph probe orion 3 star ph benchtop thermo electron corporation beverly ma usa the water samples were then submerged in a preheated water bath nb 9 nüve sanayi malzemeleri imalat ve ticaret a ş ankara turkey in order to reach the desired temperature after preheating a 0 1 ml aliquot of the inoculum was inoculated in each water sample final concentration 108 cfu ml 2 3 thermal inactivation experiments inoculated water samples mixed manually for approximately 10 seconds after inoculation were heated under controlled isothermal 51 53 55 57 59 and 61 c and fluctuating temperature conditions submerged in a water bath the latter experiments were carried out by initially adjusting the water bath at the temperature set as the starting point of the dynamic profile and then resetting it to the final desired temperature thermal inactivation experiments at isothermal conditions were conducted thrice with two individual samples being analyzed for each replication n 6 for the dynamic temperature profiles one independent experiment was conducted with two replicates n 2 for all the thermal inactivation experiments under isothermal or dynamic temperature conditions the temperature of the samples was monitored during the heating period using electronic temperature monitoring devices cox tracer cox technologies belmont nc usa with a time interval of 30 seconds appropriate serial decimal dilutions of water samples 1ml in ringer s solution were surface plated on cye agar for the enumeration of l pneumophila colonies were counted after incubation of the plates at 35 c for 5 days 2 4 data analysis the experimental data log10 cfu ml of l pneumophila with time for each temperature were fitted to a log linear regression bigelow primary model using the microsoft office excel program as a result the kinetic parameter for inactivation d t value was estimated for each temperature condition the bigelow model considers a log linear relationship between the microbial population and the elapsed time t as shown in eq 1 the parameter d t equals the negative inverse of the slope of the line 1 log 10 n log 10 n 0 t d t where n 0 is the initial number of microorganisms and n their number at time t the effect of temperature on the kinetic parameter d t value was modelled using the following z value secondary model poschet et al 2005 originally proposed by bigelow 1921 2 log 10 d t log 10 d ref t ref t z where t ref is a reference temperature 55 c z is the temperature increase necessary to obtain a 10 fold reduction of the d t value and provides an indication of the sensitivity of the microorganism to temperature variations and d ref is the decimal reduction time at the reference temperature t ref in order to determine the values of z and log10 d ref as well as the confidence and the prediction intervals the fitting procedure was performed using the tablecurve 2d software systat software inc san jose ca usa the quality of the fitting was evaluated graphically and by estimating the coefficient of determination r2 the 95 prediction intervals for log10 d t were estimated as described in lindgren 1993 the developed model was further validated under five different dynamic temperature profiles prediction of inactivation was based on the differential equation of the primary model eq 3 while the evolution d t with temperature is ruled by eq 2 the initial concentration n 0 was determined experimentally by the plate count method upper and lower 95 prediction limits for the reduction of the population under dynamic temperature conditions were estimated based on the respective upper and lower 95 prediction limits for the corresponding log10 d t 3 d lo g 10 n d t 1 10 log 10 d ref t ref t z the performance of the model in predicting the inactivation of l pneumophila at dynamic temperature conditions was evaluated by a graphical comparison between observed and predicted inactivation and by estimating the performance indices of bias and accuracy factors ross 1996 eqn 4 and 5 bias b f and accuracy factors a f equal to 1 indicate a perfect agreement between predicted and observed values it is generally accepted that for b f a value in the range of 0 75 to 1 25 can be considered acceptable ross 1996 the accuracy factor is always equal to or greater than 1 and its distance from the later value indicates the difference between model s predictions and observed microbial behavior as proposed by ross 1996 b f and a f can be employed for time based responses such as lag time time to an n fold increase or rates thus in the present study the comparison was made between the observed time and the predicted time for a certain population reduction as following 4 b f 10 σ log x predicted x observed n 5 a f 10 σ log x predicted x observed n where x is the time predicted or observed for a certain population reduction and n is the number of observations used for the calculation the comparison was made for a total of 111 pairs of population reductions for evaluating the performance of the model for all the tested dynamic profiles but also for different subgroups referring to each dynamic temperature profile 3 results and discussion 3 1 model development inactivation curves of l pneumophila in model water at 51 53 55 57 59 and 61 c are illustrated in fig 1 the effect of heating on the population concentration was more profound with increasing temperature briefly the exposure of the population at 51οc resulted in a decrease of the concentration of approximately 1 6 logs after 35 min while the reduction at 53 55 57 59 and 61 οc was 3 6 5 4 6 4 6 6 and 6 logs after 35 25 12 5 and 2 min as expected the higher the temperature the higher the inactivation rate characteristically the time needed for 1 log reduction ranges from approximately 16 min at 51οc to less than 1 min at 59οc the results showed that the inactivation curves can be considered linear and can be described by the log linear primary model of bigelow 1921 thus the inactivation data for each temperature were fitted to the model fig 1b providing good statistical fits the estimated r2 values table 2 varied from 0 875 to 0 995 indicating that the selected model can adequately describe the inactivation kinetics furthermore as depicted in table 2 the inactivation kinetic parameter d value ranged from 0 23 to 0 35 min at 61 c up to 16 98 to 25 31 min at 51 c in order to describe the effect of temperature on the inactivation kinetics of l pneumophila in water the calculated d values for each temperature were further modeled with the use of a secondary model eq 2 the reference temperature t ref of the secondary model was fixed to 55 c as the mean of the temperature range tested according to dolan et al 2013 t ref has no biological meaning but contributes to better parameter identifiability in addition the authors highlighted the importance of individually setting t ref for each data set at the mean of the minimum and maximum temperatures studied a consideration that was also previously supported by poschet et al 2005 fig 2 shows the fitting of the secondary model characterized by a linear decrease of the logarithm of d value with increasing temperature the inverse of the slope of the regression line which is the z value was found to be 5 54 c while at the same time the logarithm of d ref log10 d ref was 0 54 a similar z value estimated at 4 98 c has also been reported by sanden et al 1989 the statistics for the parameters of the secondary model table 3 as well as the graphical evaluation of the fitting curve indicated the satisfactory performance of the developed model on the effect of temperature on the d value of l pneumophila thermal inactivation of l pneumophila has been previously described in several studies particularly in a pioneer work reported by dennis et al 1984 the d value of l pneumophila was found to be 111 27 and 6 min at 50 54 and 58 c respectively similarly other studies evidenced a decimal reduction time of approximately 2 min at 60 c schulze röbbecke et al 1987 stout et al 1986 however the findings of the present work bear differences from the abovementioned studies since the estimated d values in our study tend to be lower these discrepancies could be attributed to the bacterium s diverse thermal susceptibility allegra et al 2011 steinert et al 1998 whiley et al 2017 in most cases hotels and hospitals associated with legionnaires disease constitute isolation sources codony et al 2002 kool et al 1999 leoni et al 2005 environmental strains usually exhibit increased resistance to adverse conditions such as exposure to temperature fluctuations leading to increased d values this phenomenon usually occurs in amoeba grown l pneumophila intracellular replication within amoeba leads to the bacterium s phenotypic modulation with further implications in its resistance to eradication methods including high temperatures kwaik et al 1997 venkataraman and kwaik 2000 additionally environmental strains are possible to have been involved in bacterial communities such as biofilms which are characterized by increased resistance to various stresses barker et al 1992 cargill et al 1992 santegoeds et al 1998 besides the above another factor presumably responsible for the differences in legionella s thermal susceptibility may be the repeated exposure of the microorganism to high temperatures especially for short periods of time the emergence of strains that are more resistant to high temperatures due to adaptation to a wide range of temperatures is a possible explanation lesnik et al 2016 sharaby et al 2017 this hypothesis is supported by studies reporting that l pneumophila strains isolated after the performance of heat shocks exhibited increased survival ability allegra et al 2011 ghrairi et al 2013 taking into consideration that periodic curative thermal shocks are often employed for water sanitation it is not a surprise that l pneumophila is repeatedly isolated from such water systems mouchtouri et al 2007 papadakis et al 2018 this recurrent presence of l pneumophila can be attributed to a distinct composition of the bacterial membrane modifications in the lipid composition due to increases in growth temperature can lead to an increased saturation degree thus resulting in higher heat resistance mañas et al 2003 a similar correlation about the cell membrane playing an important role in the resistance to heat stress has been highlighted by chang et al 2007 but this time nutrient deficiency was the key factor the authors demonstrated that the induction of proteins and gene products and the stabilization of cell membrane due to starvation contributed to legionella s resistance to high temperatures in the majority of the studies described above a significant number of environmental factors were involved thus making it difficult to compare with the present study that was performed under carefully defined and well controlled laboratory conditions however differences can be observed even in the case of experiments conducted under laboratory conditions as well cervero aragό et al 2015 used the same strain as in the current work and reported a 4 log reduction in approximately 10 min at 55 c although the strain was observed to be less resistant to elevated temperatures thermo susceptibility differences could be attributed to the different methodology used even though l pneumophila can be a notable water related microbiological hazard there are other waterborne microorganisms that may imperil public health in a study by spinks et al 2006 the authors demonstrated that the d values of enterococcus faecalis haemolytic escherichia coli o157 h7 pseudomonas aeruginosa salmonella typhimurium serratia marcescens and klebsiella pneumoniae at 55 c were 633 223 304 77 71 and 22 s respectively on the one hand the d value of e coli o157 h7 was found to be similar with those of l pneumophila d 55 212 258 s on the other hand s typhimurium s marcescens and k pneumoniae exhibited much faster log reductions while at the same time e faecalis and p aeruginosa showed higher d values beside the differences in thermal resistances between the microorganisms and l pneumophila it became evident that the temperature control regimen of maintaining water temperature at 60 c should be followed in any case as highlighted by the authors of the abovementioned study spinks et al 2006 as a result thermal control measures against l pneumophila could be considered applicable regarding other water borne bacteria 3 2 model validation under dynamic temperature conditions validation is an essential step after modelling further external validation using new data not used for fitting the model seem to be indispensable to confirm the robustness of the developed model for this in the present study the developed model was further validated at non isothermal conditions in real life water temperature is constantly fluctuating because of the complexity of the water distribution systems and the heat losses that occur as a result lower temperatures can be encountered usually at distal points of the installation arvand et al 2011 serrano suárez et al 2013 a study of bérard et al 2015 reported temperature fluctuations in hot water distribution systems mainly because of the heat losses that occur at the water heater outlets return loops and points of use in the same study a decrease in temperature was observed from 60 to below 50 c because of stagnation the time period for fully insulated copper pipes was 30 min and for non insulated ones 10 min in order to simulate these realistic conditions it is required that the developed model be validated under dynamic temperature conditions validation experiments were carried out using five dynamic temperature profiles within a temperature range from 51 to 59 c the tested profiles included an abrupt temperature upshift also the performance of the model was graphically evaluated by comparing the experimentally observed and predicted inactivation at dynamic temperature conditions as illustrated in figs 3 to 7 in total for all the time temperature profiles tested the model provided satisfactory predictions regarding the inactivation of l pneumophila the effectiveness of thermal treatment applied for temperature upshifts figs 3 to 5 increased with the elevation of temperature and exposure time as expected respectively for temperature downshifts figs 6 and 7 the inactivation rate of the microbial population appeared to be initially higher as the microbial cells were gradually exposed to lower temperatures the inactivation rate was clearly slower it needs to be noted here that for the temperature profile from 59 to 53 c fig 6 it was observed that the temperature was maintained at high levels for a period of time enough to result in the fast eradication of l pneumophila population even before the temperature reaches the lowest desired one apart from the graphical comparison the bias b f and accuracy a f factors were also used to evaluate the performance of the model in predicting l pneumophila inactivation at dynamic temperature conditions bias factor is a measure of the relative average deviation between predicted and observed times for a certain population reduction indicating the extend of the systematic over or under prediction of the model accuracy factor which is estimated using absolute values provides a measure of the average difference between predicted and observed values mellefont et al 2003 ross 1996 the overall estimate of the bias factor was b f 1 05 indicating a negligible systematic error of the model the accuracy factor estimation was a f 1 28 indicating that the predicted times for a certain population reduction are slightly higher than the observed ones with model s errors being on the safe side furthermore b f and a f were estimated for each tested dynamic profile separately table 4 in almost all cases the bias factor was within the acceptable performance range of 0 75 1 25 ross 1996 and only for the dynamic profile presented in fig 7 was slightly higher accuracy factor was also acceptable for almost all the profiles tested given the number of environmental parameters of the model mellefont et al 2003 and the fact that the spread of the observed values about the predicted values increases at low population levels right part of the inactivation curves where the sampling error and the biological variability are increased aspridou and koutsoumanis 2015 although there is a significant amount of data regarding thermal inactivation for a wide range of foodborne pathogens buzrul and alpas 2007 huang 2013 2009 lang et al 2017 studies focusing on waterborne pathogens remain scarce as a result mathematical models for the thermal inactivation of water related bacteria is very limited in addition as chlorination is considered to be the most common disinfection method for drinking water and ozone related regimens are more and more frequently being employed experimental data from such works are more often modelled gyürék et al 1997 janex et al 2000 mecha et al 2019 with regard to l pneumophila the limited amount of studies related to modelling of inactivation kinetics are based on data derived from experiments conducted under the influence of ultraviolet radiation chemicals and ozone jakubek et al 2013 li et al 2017 rattanakul and oguma 2018 to the best of our knowledge the model developed in the present study is the first one describing the effect of temperature on l pneumophila inactivation in water even though temperature related regimens are applied to control the presence of the microorganism in water systems based on the model s satisfactory performance it would be safe to propose that it could be used in order to control l pneumophila during thermal treatments predictive microbiology is a really valuable tool and can constitute an alternative efficient and systematic approach for the control of water related pathogens ideally during temperature control regimens water should be kept between 55 and 60 c or even 80 c in the case of thermal shock as suggested by ecdc 2017 in the present study the kinetic behavior of l pneumophila was studied in the temperature range of 51 to 61 c and the developed model can be used to predict the time temperature combinations that are required in order to ensure the microbiological safety of the water even in the case that the target temperature cannot be achieved or maintained along the whole system it should be stressed here however that the model for the effect of temperature on the inactivation behavior of the pathogen was developed using sterilized bottled natural mineral water as a model system of great interest is to validate the developed model against tap water or even water used in other premises and closed systems it is possible that the diverse physicochemical probably microbial and chemical characteristics of the water may affect the inactivation behavior of the pathogen and an appropriate correction of the model cannot be excluded it should also be kept in mind that the water flow in plumbing systems as well as the design and the nature of the systems themselves may also affect the inactivation of l pneumophila boppe et al 2016 gavalda et al 2019 the plumbing systems in large buildings such as hotels or hospitals probably harbor the cells of the pathogen in their biofilm lifestyle however in the present study the model for the effect of temperature on the inactivation behavior of the pathogen was developed using planktonic cells of a single strain of special importance is to validate the developed model against others strains and with cells organized in biofilm environments it is known that biofilm cells are characterized by increased resistance against environmental stresses compared to the free living planktonic ones sauer 2003 thus in this respect further research is required in a future study the model could also be extended in a way in order to take into account factors such as strain variability water flow in plumbing systems biofilm cells and the presence and concentration of disinfectants such as hypochlorite and hydrogen peroxide with the aid of predictive microbiology better control of the water thermal disinfection can be achieved and the present study is only the first step towards this goal an integrated preventive system for the effective control of l pneumophila in large premises plumbing systems 4 conclusions the present study provides useful data regarding the development of a predictive model for the effect of temperature on the inactivation of l pneumophila in model water validation studies indicated that the model satisfactorily predicted the behavior of the pathogen in water under dynamic temperature conditions the application of the developed model in combination with an effective temperature monitoring system in water plumbing premises can be regarded a useful tool that could lead to the establishment of a more effective control system against l

17291,coagulation flocculation followed by sedimentation or dissolved air flotation daf are processes routinely used for separating microalgae from water however during algae separation then can exhibit inconsistent separation high coagulant demand and high operating cost to circumvent these problems previous studies reported the development of a novel daf process in which bubbles were modified instead of particles while this process was shown to be sustainable and inexpensive the problem of inconsistent algal separation across species remained recent research has suggested that this could be due to the varying concentration and character of algal derived proteins and carbohydrates within the extracellular organic matter eom and their associated interactions this hypothesis is tested in the current study using the novel modified bubble daf process which has been highly susceptible to eom protein and carbohydrate concentrations and character biomolecular additives commercially available proteins and carbohydrates and algal extracted proteins of widely differing molecular weight mw and charge were dosed in varying proportions into samples containing either chlorella vulgaris cs 42 7 microcystis aeruginosa cs 564 01 or microcystis aeruginosa cs 555 1 after removing the intrinsic eom these cell rich suspensions were then subject to flotation using cationic bubbles modified with poly diallyldimethylammonium chloride pdadmac when additives were dosed independently separation increased from 5 to up to 62 the maximum separation was obtained when the dose was double the respective biopolymer concentration measured in the intrinsic eom for the equivalent species and in the case of protein additives when mw and charge were 50 kda and 0 5 meq g 1 respectively irrespective of the species tested when evaluating steric and charge based protein carbohydrate interactions on cell separation by simultaneously dosing high mw and high charge protein and carbohydrate additives enhanced separation of up to 79 was achieved it is suggested that enhanced cell separation is achieved due to proteins and carbohydrates bridging with cells and forming protein carbohydrate cell suprastructures in the presence of a flocculant e g pdadmac and this only occurs when the intrinsic eom comprises proteins and carbohydrates that have high mw 25 kda and charge 0 2 meq g 1 and interactions with each other and with the cell surface graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords algae harvesting coagulation flotation pdadmac water treatment 1 introduction solid liquid separation of algae and cyanobacteria is undertaken via processes such as membrane filtration sedimentation or dissolved air flotation daf for applications related to both water treatment and biotechnology industries anthony et al 2013 kempeneers et al 2001 weschler et al 2013 daf is frequently favoured for cell separation as it takes advantage of the natural buoyancy of algal cells edzwald et al 1994 han 2002 however like sedimentation it requires upstream coagulation flocculation where chemicals are dosed to modify particle surface characteristics to promote bubble particle interactions edzwald et al 1994 recent advances in the daf process have shown that surface modification of daf microbubbles instead of the particles can result in benefits such as reduced chemical demand and sludge volumes and an increased solid liquid ratio in the float hanotu et al 2012 henderson et al 2009 zhang et al 2019 hence this novel bubble modified daf process has received considerable attention in the fields of mineral flotation oliveira et al 2014 oliveira and rubio 2012 zhang and guiraud 2017 water treatment for contaminant removal han et al 2006 shi et al 2017 and algal separation and harvesting rao et al 2018a yap et al 2014 zhang et al 2019 in both conventional separation processes and in the novel modified bubble daf process 95 separation efficiencies of certain algae and cyanobacteria have been reported de godos et al 2011 lama et al 2016 rao et al 2018a however this high separation efficiency is not always attained with suggestions that this variability is species and strain dependent ghernaout et al 2010 gonzalez torres et al 2019 henderson et al 2010a oliveira et al 2018 zhang et al 2017 given this discrepancy has been observed even when cell morphology is similar several studies have attributed it to the presence and unique characteristics of algal derived extracellular organic matter eom baldev et al 2015 naceradska et al 2019 oliveira et al 2018 pivokonsky et al 2016 rao et al 2018b vergnes et al 2019 villacorte et al 2013 which has been demonstrated to vary widely as a function of the species or strain under examination in addition to the associated phase of growth henderson et al 2008 pivokonsky et al 2016 hence understanding the eom influence is critical to achieving effective algal separation eom comprises 80 of the total organic carbon in an algal sample including biopolymers carbohydrates and proteins humics and low molecular weight lmw compounds pivokonsky et al 2016 the eom biopolymer fraction which is a complex mixture of compounds including several enzymatic and non enzymatic proteins glycoproteins and neutral amino and acidic carbohydrates of differing mw and charge has a significant influence on algal cell separation baldev et al 2015 baresova et al 2017 guo et al 2013 henderson et al 2010a naceradska et al 2019 oliveira et al 2018 pivokonsky et al 2006

of protein or carbohydrate on separation for example decreased algal separation efficiencies have been attributed to the complexation of coagulants with either highly charged eom proteins pivokonsky et al 2006 takaara et al 2007 or highly charged carbohydrates such as uronic acids vandamme et al 2016 furthermore high concentrations of high molecular weight hmw 50 250 kda proteins have been observed to improve 90 coagulation efficiencies due to enhanced bridging effects demonstrating that the concentration and character of eom biopolymers could influence separation baresova et al 2017 henderson et al 2010a oliveira et al 2018 in contrast to studies that consider the independent influence of eom proteins or carbohydrates on cell separation recent work has suggested that eom biopolymers might also work synergistically to impact cell separation gonzalez torres et al 2017 rao et al 2018b for instance the generation of polymeric web like structures attributed to covalent and or non covalent protein carbohydrate interactions were observed to enhance the separation of a specific microcystis strain m aeruginosa cs 564 01 during both traditional coagulation sedimentation gonzalez torres et al 2017 and the modified bubble daf rao et al 2018b processes while these examples elucidate the influence of the eom biopolymer fraction on algal separation they also reveal gaps in our understanding as to how the different fractions of the eom impact cell separation the degree to which the concentration and character of eom proteins carbohydrates and the associated protein carbohydrate interactions impact algal cell separation is currently not fully understood whether one of these components influences the underlying separation mechanism more than the others has also not been investigated these two research gaps require systematic investigation and therefore investigating these two aspects is the aim of this study to achieve this biomolecular additives commercially available proteins and carbohydrates and algal derived proteins of differing concentration and character that are considered representative of intrinsic eom biopolymers following detailed characterisation conducted by rao et al 2020 were dosed during the separation of one green algal and two cyanobacterial species via the modified bubble daf process as the biomolecular additives were representative of the intrinsic eom biopolymers and were dosed to systematically evaluate the behaviour of these biopolymers in relation to separation all experiments in this study were conducted post the removal of intrinsic eom the variability in resultant cell separation was examined in relation to the character and concentration of the dosed bimolecular additives to provide insight into how intrinsic eom biopolymers are likely to influence the underlying mechanisms driving algal cell separation overall the addition of biomolecular additives was observed to drive significant variability in cell separation from negligible change to 78 separation it is concluded that algal separation is enhanced when high concentrations of hmw 25 kda proteins and highly charged 0 2 meq g 1 proteins and carbohydrates form suprastructures that then interact with the cell surface 2 materials methods 2 1 chemicals unless otherwise stated the following chemicals were obtained from sigma aldrich assay

pdadmac as previous studies have shown that the presence of both pdadmac and eom which comprises proteins and carbohydrates were vital for cell separation rao et al 2018b flotation performance was evaluated by analysing the effluent from the jar tests via a cell counting using a haemocytometer and a light microscope to determine residual cell concentration and b zeta potential analysis described in 2 2 4 as a qualitative indicator to evaluate polymer residuals in the effluent a highly negative effluent is indicative of negligible pdadmac concentrations and vice versa henderson et al 2010a rao et al 2018a unless otherwise specified all jar tests in this study were conducted in triplicate using different culture batches to provide a true assessment of experimental variability and the results are expressed as the mean with one standard deviation 2 3 2 evaluating concentration and character influences of protein and carbohydrate additives on cell separation the extent to which cell separation was impacted by variable concentrations mw and charge of eom proteins or carbohydrates were assessed by the addition of a variety of representative protein and carbohydrate additives at different doses these additives which include eom proteins from the three species as well as commercially available proteins and carbohydrates were characterised in detail by rao et al 2020 and encompassed a broad mw 0 18 250 kda and charge density 0 02 to 1 0 meq g 1 range table 2 as the biomolecular additives were representative of and dosed to mimic the biopolymers in the intrinsic eom experiments were conducted only on the cells post removal of the intrinsic eom removed following the procedure outlined in section 2 2 2 jar tests were conducted on the three species independently the biomolecular additives were dosed in the jar and stirred at 50 rpm for 1 min to ensure adequate mixing while maintaining ph 7 concentrations of 0 5 5 the total eom protein or carbohydrate concentrations at late exponential phase were selected to simulate influences at equivalent low to high eom concentrations 2 3 3 assessing the influence of protein carbohydrate interactions on cell separation experiments to assess the influence of protein carbohydrate interactions were conducted only for cv cells again with the intrinsic eom removed extracted based on section 2 2 2 similarly biomolecular additives were dosed into the jar along with the cells and stirred at 50 rpm for 1 min to ensure adequate mixing while maintaining ph 7 only non covalent protein carbohydrate interactions were examined covalent interactions were not investigated as these bonds are formed via enzymatic catalysis inside the cells which is not possible to investigate through jar testing rao et al 2020 two sets of experiments were conducted experiment 1 the impact of protein carbohydrate interactions caused by charge and steric factors on cell separation were evaluated to evaluate the impact of weakest to strongest steric and charge based protein carbohydrate interactions on cell separation the following biomolecular additives were paired a hmw and high charge protein additive with high charge carbohydrate additive b hmw and high charge protein additive with low charge carbohydrate additive c lmw and low charge protein additive with low charge carbohydrate additive d lmw and low charge protein additive with high charge carbohydrate additive the protein additive concentration was representative of eom protein concentration at the late exponential phase while the carbohydrate additive concentration varied from 0 5 5 eom carbohydrate concentration at the late exponential phase table 2 lists the biomolecular additives classified based on mw and charge experiment 2 the impact of hydrogen bonding and van der waals interactions between proteins and carbohydrates and their subsequent influence on cell separation were evaluated by dosing a lectin cona protein additive and carbohydrate additives that are known to have different binding affinities to cona such as galactose low glucose medium and mannose high protein and carbohydrate additive concentrations were representative of the total eom protein or carbohydrate concentrations respectively at the late exponential phase as determined in section 2 2 4 3 results 3 1 characterisation of the cells eom and the biomolecular additives characterisation of the cells and eom of all species was conducted to ensure that the cultures used in the current study were of approximately similar character to those used previously the cells from all the species were unicellular and spherical with diameters ranging from 2 5 5 6 µm table 1 for the current and previously used cultures khan et al 2019 li et al 2019 rao et al 2020 the dissolved organic carbon doc at the harvesting point was within the range 7 10 mg l 1 and the eom carbohydrate and protein concentrations were between 3 0 6 6 mg l 1 and 0 9 3 0 mg l 1 respectively table 1 while the charge of the cv and ma555 cultures used in this study were similar to the cv and ma cultures used previously the charge of the ma564 culture used in this study was marginally more negative when compared to previously characterised m aeruginosa table 1 overall the physicochemical properties of the cultures and the eom used in this study were largely similar to those used in previous studies thereby validating the assessment of cultures used in this study for elucidating eom protein carbohydrate influences on cell separation all the biomolecular additives evaluated in this study were negatively charged however the magnitude of this charge varied among the carbohydrate additives the uronic acids were at least two to four times more negatively charged 6 5 to 13 5 mv 0 38 to 0 81 meq g 1 compared to the neutral or amino carbohydrates table 2 interestingly while the formal charge of the non ionic carbohydrates neutral and amino is negligible these molecules had a slight negative charge possibly due to the weak dissociation of the oh groups in the buffered solution the analysis of the protein additives revealed that the algal derived proteins were generally more negative 6 5 to 13 5 mv 0 46 to 1 00 meq g 1 than the non algal proteins 0 9 to 8 5 mv 0 11 to 0 37 meq g 1 table 2 and these values were comparable to those reported previously rao et al 2020 the algal derived proteins were a mix of several proteins with previous protein analysis indicating that the protein mw ranged from 10 kda up to 250 kda rao et al 2020 of these the algal derived proteins that had the greatest concentration of proteins in the hmw range 50 kda were in the order ma564 protein 72 79 ma555 protein 12 13 cv protein 3 4 table 2 this was in sharp contrast to the non algal proteins which were mostly a mix of 2 3 proteins and had distinct mw in the order bsa 100 50 kda hsa 100 50 kda cona 1 50 kda table 2 the purity of all the protein additives exceeded 98 table 2 and were therefore of sufficient purity to use in jar tests 3 2 understanding fluctuations in algal cell separation efficiencies via biomolecular additive dosing 3 2 1 evaluating influences of concentrations mw and charge of protein and carbohydrate additives on algal cell separation efficiency the following biomolecular additives with differing mw and charge were dosed at varying concentrations to understand their impacts on cell separation protein extracted from ma564 ma555 and cv the proteins bsa and cona and the carbohydrates glucose glucosamine galacturonic acid the full characterisation information pertaining to the biomolecular additives is provided in table 2 3 2 1 1 analysing the impacts of concentrations mw and charge of protein additives on cell separation efficiency when no biomolecular additives were dosed into jars containing cell suspensions without eom the observed cell separations were cv 0 12 without eom and 61 69 with eom ma555 3 12 without eom and 28 38 with eom ma564 2 13 without eom and 95 100 with eom fig 1 a b these values were less than or comparable to that achieved when the protein additives were dosed into jars containing the equivalent cell suspensions without eom fig 1c g compared to the low medium mw 50 kda and low medium charge 0 5 meq g 1 protein additives trialling the ma564 protein hmw high charge at double the typical intrinsic eom protein concentration found in each species increased the cell separation to 33 for ma555 56 for cv and 62 for ma564 fig 1c g this is supported by henderson et al 2010b who observed that the hmw proteins present in the eom of another strain of m aeruginosa ccap 1450 3 enhanced separation efficiency among the hmw protein additives dosing of the ma564 protein fig 1c resulted in greater cell separation compared to bsa fig 1d possibly due to strong interactions between the dosed ma564 protein and the cell surface similar to that observed in other m aeruginosa species kehr and dittmann 2015 kehr et al 2006 this suggests that mw and charge of eom proteins can have a direct impact on cell separation by bridging between polymers and cells as proposed in previous studies garzon sanabria et al 2013 henderson et al 2010a rao et al 2018b safarikova et al 2013 at protein additive doses beyond 2 3 intrinsic eom protein concentrations cell separation decreased and stabilised between 2 16 for all the protein additives trialled fig 1c g the decrease in cell separation for low medium mw and low charge protein additives such as cv protein and cona from their respective peak separation was 20 for the high mw and high charge ma564 protein this value was 25 this could be attributed to steric effects an increase in charge demand for the protein additive and a negative charge restabilisation in the suspension associated with the manifold increase in protein additive concentrations consequences of which are poor protein additive cell pdadmac interactions and a lower cell separation 3 2 1 2 analysing impacts of concentrations mw and charge of carbohydrate additives on cell separation efficiency when dosing carbohydrate additives into the jar fig 1h j the cell separation observed between species varied from negligible to greater than what was achieved when no additives were dosed for the equivalent species fig 1a b for each of the carbohydrate additives trialled maximum cell separations were obtained at 2 3 intrinsic eom carbohydrate concentrations irrespective of species and a decrease in the cell separation was observed at doses higher than these concentrations fig 1h j this was possibly due to the high charge demand caused by the prevalence of negatively charged species at high concentrations vandamme et al 2016 despite the similarity of the mw of the carbohydrate additives table 2 galacturonic acid dosed at 2 3 the intrinsic eom carbohydrate concentration resulted in the greatest separation 28 for all three species fig 1j this suggests that the charge of the carbohydrate is the more important parameter this is likely because interactions between acidic carbohydrates such as galacturonic acid that are present in the eom and proteins on the cell surface can occur via charge stabilisation and influence cell separation similar to that observed in the web like structures that interacted with the cells and enhanced the separation of ma564 gonzalez torres et al 2017 rao et al 2018b overall the analysis of results from fig 1h j suggests that cell separation could be directly impacted by the concentrations and charge of the eom carbohydrates 3 2 1 3 understanding influences of biomolecular additives on cell separation through effluent zeta potential when increasing the dose of biomolecular additives the effluent zeta potential for all the species became more negative fig 2 c j compared to tests where no additives were dosed fig 2a b while the decrease in the effluent zeta potential was common among all the additives trialled the addition of some additives caused the zeta potential of the resulting treated water to become more negative than others for instance the effluent zeta potential ranged from 8 to 29 mv for the protein additive experiments fig 2c g and from 21 to 39 5 mv for the carbohydrate additive experiments fig 2h j likely reasons include the high charge demand of carbohydrates due to their higher molar concentrations compared to proteins and a decreased availability of pdadmac to neutralise both algal cells and the additives the zeta potential of the treated water also gives an indication of the residual pdadmac in the effluent a highly negative effluent is indicative of negligible pdadmac concentrations and vice versa henderson et al 2010a rao et al 2018a a combination of highly negative effluents with low cell separation could be indicative of a complete utilisation of pdadmac for electrostatic complexation with cells and or biomolecular additives and or b the presence of excess biomolecular additives in the treated water with the remaining cells due to the likely absence of pdadmac in the treated water increasing pdadmac concentrations in the saturator to compensate for the charge demand would seem a plausible way to improve cell separation however as observed in si fig s2 1 a 50 increase in pdadmac concentration in the saturator from 0 004 meq l 1 to 0 006 meq l 1 resulted in a 5 difference between the maximum and minimum cell separations and caused an increase in effluent zeta potential indicative of increased pdadmac concentrations therefore the combination of highly negative treated water with low cell separation is more likely a consequence of the absence of large complex macromolecular structures that can network with multiple cells which are typically formed via protein carbohydrate interactions in the eom as proposed previously rao et al 2020 this will be explored via collective dosing of protein and carbohydrate additives 3 2 2 assessing the impact of protein carbohydrate interactions on cell separation 3 2 2 1 protein carbohydrate interactions caused by charge and steric factors in experiment 1 a d paired dosing of one protein and one carbohydrate additive into jars containing cv cells without eom was conducted the pairs were chosen such that the additives had varying mw and charge as highlighted in experiment 1 a d in section 2 3 3 this was to evaluate how protein carbohydrate interactions caused by charge and steric factors impacted separation when the additive pairs were dosed the cell separations increased for all pairs and reached maximum values when the protein additive concentrations were equal to typical eom protein concentrations and carbohydrate additive concentrations were double the typical eom carbohydrate concentrations fig 3 a d the cell separation decreased at higher concentrations irrespective of the additive combination trialled when maximum cell separations obtained by dosing different additive pairs were compared it was observed that the pair that had the greatest mw and charge ma564 protein galacturonic acid resulted in at least four times higher cell separation fig 3a than cv protein glucose lowest mw and charge fig 3c the cell separation obtained when dosing the additives in tandem were also very different to what was achieved when dosing them individually for instance the maximum cell separation of 70 9 achieved by dosing ma564 protein galacturonic acid pair fig 3a was greater than that observed when these additives were dosed individually fig 1c 1j for cv these observations suggest that a stable electrostatic repulsion between ma564 protein uronic acid exists resulting in the formation of large open suprastructures similar to those commonly observed in protein carbohydrate complexes ganzevles et al 2006 sperber et al 2009 overall these results suggest that steric and electrostatic protein carbohydrate interactions can impact separation web like networks that have previously been suggested to enhance separation gonzalez torres et al 2017 rao et al 2018b yap et al 2014 were observed when dosing ma564 protein galacturonic acid however the web like networks observed in the current work were noted via visual observation to be smaller and fewer in number than those seen previously and moreover did not form at sizes visible to the naked eye in all jar tests in addition large standard deviations in cell separation of up to 10 were also observed upon several jar test repetitions fig 3 these observations are attributed to either the presence of intrinsic eom in low concentrations due to poor extraction or fresh production or the loss of proteins during extraction of algal derived protein additives as noted previously rao et al 2020 3 2 2 2 protein carbohydrate interactions caused by hydrogen bonding and van der waals interactions the influence of protein carbohydrate binding due to hydrogen bonding and van der waals forces on cv without eom separation was tested in experiment 2 by dosing three carbohydrates of similar mw and charge mannose glucose and galactose table 2 with the carbohydrate binding lectin cona significant variation in cell separation was observed between the different carbohydrate additives that were trialled fig 4 for instance dosing cona with mannose and glucose increased the cell separation to 36 4 and 24 5 respectively at 2 typical eom carbohydrate concentrations fig 4 in contrast the cv cell separation prior to dosing additives ranged between 3 14 as the mw and charge densities of the carbohydrate additives were comparable it is evident that the variations in cell separation are a function of the binding strength of different carbohydrate additives with the lectin specifically the binding affinities of cona with the carbohydrate additives are in the order mannose glucose galactose maupin et al 2012 and these variations are attributed to van der waals forces and hydrogen bonding between the protein and carbohydrate berg et al 1999 overall for the first time it is demonstrated that protein carbohydrate interactions induced by hydrogen bonding and van der waals forces can influence cell separation while the influence of this interaction on cell separation appears to be lower than that of charge and steric interactions demonstrated in the previous section it is not possible to state whether this would always be the case as only one lectin has been tested future research could examine additional combinations to elucidate the impact of varying lectin character 4 discussion when dosing protein and carbohydrate additives to cell suspensions in the absence of eom variations in process efficiency as determined via cell separation were observed and attributed to the manipulation of interactions between biomolecular additives and cells related to the 1 concentrations and character of the dosed biomolecular additives 2 protein carbohydrate interplay and 3 influence of cationic polymers it is proposed that none of these aspects is predominant rather their synergistic action contributes to the overall success of the separation process this is explored in the following 4 1 importance of concentrations mw and charge of biomolecular additives when understanding variations in cell separation across species protein additives within 2 the typical eom protein concentration and carbohydrate additives within 3 the typical eom carbohydrate concentration optimal 2 3 resulted in the greatest cell separation while a significant reduction in the cell separation was observed when additive concentrations were outside this range fig 1 irrespective of the additive character it is proposed that maximum cell separations were only observed within this range because higher concentrations likely led to an increase in the additive complexation with pdadmac resulting in low pdadmac availability for cell separation similar to that observed during the inhibition of alkaline flocculation of a european strain of c vulgaris due to high carbohydrate concentrations vandamme et al 2016 these results suggest that the concentration of protein and carbohydrate in intrinsic eom likely influences cell separation any further discussions on the impact of biomolecular additive concentrations on cell separation invariably leads to drawing conclusions based on protein carbohydrate character from fig 1 it was observed that hmw 50 250 kda and charged 0 5 meq g 1 biomolecular additives within 2 typical eom protein or carbohydrate concentrations resulted in greater cell separations when compared to lmw 50 kda and charged 0 5 meq g 1 biomolecular additives it is well understood that some hmw proteins can form networks with several cells via protein bridging leading to extensive protein cell attachments and a higher cell separation baresova et al 2017 henderson et al 2010b in addition the amide i groups in the protein additives can also electrostatically interact with the cooh groups on the algal cell surface leading to greater interactions between the protein additives and the cells gonzalez torres et al 2017 guo et al 2013 therefore by extrapolation it is suggested that the presence of hmw and highly charged biopolymers in the intrinsic eom can enhance cell separation while dosing hmw 50 250 kda and highly charged 0 5 meq g 1 biomolecular protein additives enhanced cell separation dosing these protein additives in tandem with carbohydrate additives resulted in cell separations that were up to 35 higher fig 3a than what was obtained when dosing the respective protein or carbohydrate additives individually fig 1 this implies that protein and carbohydrate additives worked synergistically to influence cell separation this will be explored in the following subsection 4 2 importance of protein carbohydrate cell networks when understanding variations in cell separation across species it is suggested that protein carbohydrate interactions in the eom and with the cell surface along with their interactions with pdadmac bubble modifier could further enhance cell separation than what was achieved by dosing only the protein or the carbohydrate previously protein carbohydrate interactions that could influence algal cell separation were proposed to occur via a irreversible covalent protein carbohydrate interactions catalysed by enzymes such as glycosyltransferases and b non covalent protein carbohydrate interactions rao et al 2020 while it was impossible to evaluate the influence of covalent protein carbohydrate interactions on cell separation via jar testing the results from experiments that analyse non covalent interactions provide clues regarding the importance of eom protein carbohydrate interactions on the variability of cell separation across species protein carbohydrate interactions can occur due to electrostatic complexation similar to that observed in species such as tetraselmis sp schwenzfeier et al 2013a schwenzfeier et al 2013b soluble protein carbohydrate complexes are typically formed due to stabilisation by electrostatic repulsion and these large complexes usually carry charge with the same sign as the carbohydrate ganzevles et al 2006 schwenzfeier et al 2014 sperber et al 2009 another way by which proteins and carbohydrates can interact is through glycation conjugation via hydrogen bonding and van der waals forces as observed in species such as microcystis aeruginosa kehr and dittmann 2015 kehr et al 2006 overall when proteins and carbohydrates interact with the cells via steric effects electrostatic influences hydrogen bonding and van der waals forces negatively charged protein carbohydrate cell networks are formed which on interaction with cationic polymers enhance separation fig 3 4 the application of cationic polymers in the modified bubble daf process has been extensively studied from the perspective of polymer bubble attachment rao et al 2018a yap et al 2014 but it is suggested that the ability of charged polymers to interlock the protein carbohydrate cell linkages and bubbles during flotation is of equal if not of greater importance during the flotation of cv cells without eom using ma564 protein and galacturonic acid web like suprastructures were formed and enhanced separation section 3 2 2 1 ft ir analysis of similar web like suprastructures during the separation of ma564 cells and intrinsic eom in a previous study revealed that these suprastructures were formed from protein carbohydrate networks that existed naturally in the algal suspension rao et al 2018b although the web like networks are attributed to protein carbohydrate interactions those formed in this study or in algal suspensions with eom were not visible prior to or enhanced separation until the cationic bubbles were introduced into the jar section 3 2 2 1 rao et al 2018a this suggests that despite the existence of protein carbohydrate cell networks it is only the introduction of the cationic bubbles that helps build these linkages into larger suprastructures 5 conclusions this study demonstrates that the modified bubble daf process efficiency is influenced by the manipulation of polymer protein carbohydrate cell linkages caused by dosing biomolecular additives of varying concentrations and character to algal cell suspensions specific conclusions drawn from this study are as follows dosing protein and carbohydrate additives at concentrations at 2 the typical eom protein and 3 the typical eom carbohydrate concentrations resulted in an increase in cell separation compared to what was observed in standard modified bubble daf experiments without eom beyond those concentrations cell separations declined possibly due to low polymer availability because of polymer additive complexation cell separation varied significantly as a function of mw and charge of the biomolecular additives hmw protein additives and high charged protein and carbohydrate additives 50 250 kda 0 5 meq g 1 resulted in greater cell separations compared to lmw and low charge additives 50 kda 0 5 meq g 1 by forming suprastructures that interacted with the cell surface it is suggested that protein carbohydrate interactions occurring via electrostatic complexation steric influences hydrogen bonding and van der waals forces form negatively charged protein carbohydrate cell networks these negatively charged networks interact with cationic polymers to form large suprastructures that enhance separation by extrapolation it is suggested that high intrinsic eom biopolymer concentrations resulting in coagulant biopolymer complexation lmw and charge of proteins and carbohydrates and limited protein carbohydrate interactions could be characteristic features of algal suspensions that exhibit poor cell separation future recommendations include expanding the suite of algae tested by evaluating other species of microcystis aeruginosa that naturally have the protein and carbohydrate properties identified in this study evaluating the interaction mechanisms between the additives

17291,coagulation flocculation followed by sedimentation or dissolved air flotation daf are processes routinely used for separating microalgae from water however during algae separation then can exhibit inconsistent separation high coagulant demand and high operating cost to circumvent these problems previous studies reported the development of a novel daf process in which bubbles were modified instead of particles while this process was shown to be sustainable and inexpensive the problem of inconsistent algal separation across species remained recent research has suggested that this could be due to the varying concentration and character of algal derived proteins and carbohydrates within the extracellular organic matter eom and their associated interactions this hypothesis is tested in the current study using the novel modified bubble daf process which has been highly susceptible to eom protein and carbohydrate concentrations and character biomolecular additives commercially available proteins and carbohydrates and algal extracted proteins of widely differing molecular weight mw and charge were dosed in varying proportions into samples containing either chlorella vulgaris cs 42 7 microcystis aeruginosa cs 564 01 or microcystis aeruginosa cs 555 1 after removing the intrinsic eom these cell rich suspensions were then subject to flotation using cationic bubbles modified with poly diallyldimethylammonium chloride pdadmac when additives were dosed independently separation increased from 5 to up to 62 the maximum separation was obtained when the dose was double the respective biopolymer concentration measured in the intrinsic eom for the equivalent species and in the case of protein additives when mw and charge were 50 kda and 0 5 meq g 1 respectively irrespective of the species tested when evaluating steric and charge based protein carbohydrate interactions on cell separation by simultaneously dosing high mw and high charge protein and carbohydrate additives enhanced separation of up to 79 was achieved it is suggested that enhanced cell separation is achieved due to proteins and carbohydrates bridging with cells and forming protein carbohydrate cell suprastructures in the presence of a flocculant e g pdadmac and this only occurs when the intrinsic eom comprises proteins and carbohydrates that have high mw 25 kda and charge 0 2 meq g 1 and interactions with each other and with the cell surface graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords algae harvesting coagulation flotation pdadmac water treatment 1 introduction solid liquid separation of algae and cyanobacteria is undertaken via processes such as membrane filtration sedimentation or dissolved air flotation daf for applications related to both water treatment and biotechnology industries anthony et al 2013 kempeneers et al 2001 weschler et al 2013 daf is frequently favoured for cell separation as it takes advantage of the natural buoyancy of algal cells edzwald et al 1994 han 2002 however like sedimentation it requires upstream coagulation flocculation where chemicals are dosed to modify particle surface characteristics to promote bubble particle interactions edzwald et al 1994 recent advances in the daf process have shown that surface modification of daf microbubbles instead of the particles can result in benefits such as reduced chemical demand and sludge volumes and an increased solid liquid ratio in the float hanotu et al 2012 henderson et al 2009 zhang et al 2019 hence this novel bubble modified daf process has received considerable attention in the fields of mineral flotation oliveira et al 2014 oliveira and rubio 2012 zhang and guiraud 2017 water treatment for contaminant removal han et al 2006 shi et al 2017 and algal separation and harvesting rao et al 2018a yap et al 2014 zhang et al 2019 in both conventional separation processes and in the novel modified bubble daf process 95 separation efficiencies of certain algae and cyanobacteria have been reported de godos et al 2011 lama et al 2016 rao et al 2018a however this high separation efficiency is not always attained with suggestions that this variability is species and strain dependent ghernaout et al 2010 gonzalez torres et al 2019 henderson et al 2010a oliveira et al 2018 zhang et al 2017 given this discrepancy has been observed even when cell morphology is similar several studies have attributed it to the presence and unique characteristics of algal derived extracellular organic matter eom baldev et al 2015 naceradska et al 2019 oliveira et al 2018 pivokonsky et al 2016 rao et al 2018b vergnes et al 2019 villacorte et al 2013 which has been demonstrated to vary widely as a function of the species or strain under examination in addition to the associated phase of growth henderson et al 2008 pivokonsky et al 2016 hence understanding the eom influence is critical to achieving effective algal separation eom comprises 80 of the total organic carbon in an algal sample including biopolymers carbohydrates and proteins humics and low molecular weight lmw compounds pivokonsky et al 2016 the eom biopolymer fraction which is a complex mixture of compounds including several enzymatic and non enzymatic proteins glycoproteins and neutral amino and acidic carbohydrates of differing mw and charge has a significant influence on algal cell separation baldev et al 2015 baresova et al 2017 guo et al 2013 henderson et al 2010a naceradska et al 2019 oliveira et al 2018 pivokonsky et al 2006 pivokonsky et al 2016 rao et al 2020 rao et al 2018b takaara et al 2007 vandamme et al 2016 vandamme et al 2013 vergnes et al 2019 villacorte et al 2013 most studies tend to focus on either the role of protein or carbohydrate on separation for example decreased algal separation efficiencies have been attributed to the complexation of coagulants with either highly charged eom proteins pivokonsky et al 2006 takaara et al 2007 or highly charged carbohydrates such as uronic acids vandamme et al 2016 furthermore high concentrations of high molecular weight hmw 50 250 kda proteins have been observed to improve 90 coagulation efficiencies due to enhanced bridging effects demonstrating that the concentration and character of eom biopolymers could influence separation baresova et al 2017 henderson et al 2010a oliveira et al 2018 in contrast to studies that consider the independent influence of eom proteins or carbohydrates on cell separation recent work has suggested that eom biopolymers might also work synergistically to impact cell separation gonzalez torres et al 2017 rao et al 2018b for instance the generation of polymeric web like structures attributed to covalent and or non covalent protein carbohydrate interactions were observed to enhance the separation of a specific microcystis strain m aeruginosa cs 564 01 during both traditional coagulation sedimentation gonzalez torres et al 2017 and the modified bubble daf rao et al 2018b processes while these examples elucidate the influence of the eom biopolymer fraction on algal separation they also reveal gaps in our understanding as to how the different fractions of the eom impact cell separation the degree to which the concentration and character of eom proteins carbohydrates and the associated protein carbohydrate interactions impact algal cell separation is currently not fully understood whether one of these components influences the underlying separation mechanism more than the others has also not been investigated these two research gaps require systematic investigation and therefore investigating these two aspects is the aim of this study to achieve this biomolecular additives commercially available proteins and carbohydrates and algal derived proteins of differing concentration and character that are considered representative of intrinsic eom biopolymers following detailed characterisation conducted by rao et al 2020 were dosed during the separation of one green algal and two cyanobacterial species via the modified bubble daf process as the biomolecular additives were representative of the intrinsic eom biopolymers and were dosed to systematically evaluate the behaviour of these biopolymers in relation to separation all experiments in this study were conducted post the removal of intrinsic eom the variability in resultant cell separation was examined in relation to the character and concentration of the dosed bimolecular additives to provide insight into how intrinsic eom biopolymers are likely to influence the underlying mechanisms driving algal cell separation overall the addition of biomolecular additives was observed to drive significant variability in cell separation from negligible change to 78 separation it is concluded that algal separation is enhanced when high concentrations of hmw 25 kda proteins and highly charged 0 2 meq g 1 proteins and carbohydrates form suprastructures that then interact with the cell surface 2 materials methods 2 1 chemicals unless otherwise stated the following chemicals were obtained from sigma aldrich assay

were re cultured and grown according to protocols established previously gonzalez torres et al 2019 rao et al 2018b and harvested at the late exponential phase of growth 12 14 days after culturing for jar testing experiments 2 2 2 separation of the cells and intrinsic extracellular organic matter from the suspension the intrinsic eom was separated from the cells based on previously described methods henderson et al 2008 khan et al 2019 li et al 2019 rao et al 2020 briefly the cells were separated from the intrinsic eom by centrifugation at 10 000 g for 15 min with an allegra x 15r centrifuge beckman coulter australia and then filtered using 934 ah glass microfiber filters 0 45 µm nominal pore size whatman usa the eom samples were then lyophilised prior to any further use or analysis 2 2 3 extraction of algal proteins from the intrinsic eom following the method outlined in rao et al 2020 the extracted lyophilised intrinsic eom samples were subjected to the ice cold acetone precipitation method following which the precipitated proteins were centrifuged air dried suspended in milli q water and lyophilised prior to any further use 2 2 4 characterisation of the algal system and biomolecular additives cell and intrinsic eom characterisation was undertaken at the late exponential phase of growth as described previously gonzalez torres et al 2017 henderson et al 2008 khan et al 2019 li et al 2019 rao et al 2020 briefly cell counting was conducted using a haemocytometer and a light microscope leica dm750 microscope switzerland and the cell size was measured using mastersizer 3000 malvern australia a toc vsch analyser shimadzu australia was used to determine the total organic carbon toc concentration of the intrinsic eom the modified lowry method frølund et al 1995 and phenol sulphuric acid method zhang et al 1999 were used to quantify the associated total protein and carbohydrate concentrations respectively these two assays were also applied for biomolecular additives the purity of the protein additives was evaluated via bradford s assay kruger 2009 the charge of the algal suspension intrinsic eom and the biomolecular additives was measured via both the particle charge detector pcd 04 travel mütek btg eclépens switzerland and zetasizer nano zs malvern australia all assays in section 2 2 were conducted in triplicate using different algal culture batches and the results are expressed as the mean with one standard deviation 2 3 jar test procedures to determine influences of biomolecular additives on flotation separation 2 3 1 jar tester set up the jar testing conditions applied were the same as previous modified bubble daf studies to ensure comparability henderson et al 2010b rao et al 2018a yap et al 2014 briefly a bench scale daf batch tester model dbt6 ec engineering canada was used jar tests were conducted at room temperature using a saturator pressure of 450 470 kpa and a recycle ratio of 20 to maximise bubble particle interactions algal suspensions of 1 l of each species were prepared at a concentration of 8 105 cells ml 1 and at ph 7 using a buffered 0 5 mm nahco3 solution low mw pdadmac was dosed directly into the daf saturator to modify bubble charge following previous studies si fig s1 1 rao et al 2018a the pdadmac concentration that had previously been shown to provide the maximum cell separation for each species was chosen for application in this study this was 0 004 meq l 1 for cv and 0 001 meq l 1 for ma564 and ma555 rao et al 2018a yap et al 2014 jar tests were not conducted in the absence of pdadmac as previous studies have shown that the presence of both pdadmac and eom which comprises proteins and carbohydrates were vital for cell separation rao et al 2018b flotation performance was evaluated by analysing the effluent from the jar tests via a cell counting using a haemocytometer and a light microscope to determine residual cell concentration and b zeta potential analysis described in 2 2 4 as a qualitative indicator to evaluate polymer residuals in the effluent a highly negative effluent is indicative of negligible pdadmac concentrations and vice versa henderson et al 2010a rao et al 2018a unless otherwise specified all jar tests in this study were conducted in triplicate using different culture batches to provide a true assessment of experimental variability and the results are expressed as the mean with one standard deviation 2 3 2 evaluating concentration and character influences of protein and carbohydrate additives on cell separation the extent to which cell separation was impacted by variable concentrations mw and charge of eom proteins or carbohydrates were assessed by the addition of a variety of representative protein and carbohydrate additives at different doses these additives which include eom proteins from the three species as well as commercially available proteins and carbohydrates were characterised in detail by rao et al 2020 and encompassed a broad mw 0 18 250 kda and charge density 0 02 to 1 0 meq g 1 range table 2 as the biomolecular additives were representative of and dosed to mimic the biopolymers in the intrinsic eom experiments were conducted only on the cells post removal of the intrinsic eom removed following the procedure outlined in section 2 2 2 jar tests were conducted on the three species independently the biomolecular additives were dosed in the jar and stirred at 50 rpm for 1 min to ensure adequate mixing while maintaining ph 7 concentrations of 0 5 5 the total eom protein or carbohydrate concentrations at late exponential phase were selected to simulate influences at equivalent low to high eom concentrations 2 3 3 assessing the influence of protein carbohydrate interactions on cell separation experiments to assess the influence of protein carbohydrate interactions were conducted only for cv cells again with the intrinsic eom removed extracted based on section 2 2 2 similarly biomolecular additives were dosed into the jar along with the cells and stirred at 50 rpm for 1 min to ensure adequate mixing while maintaining ph 7 only non covalent protein carbohydrate interactions were examined covalent interactions were not investigated as these bonds are formed via enzymatic catalysis inside the cells which is not possible to investigate through jar testing rao et al 2020 two sets of experiments were conducted experiment 1 the impact of protein carbohydrate interactions caused by charge and steric factors on cell separation were evaluated to evaluate the impact of weakest to strongest steric and charge based protein carbohydrate interactions on cell separation the following biomolecular additives were paired a hmw and high charge protein additive with high charge carbohydrate additive b hmw and high charge protein additive with low charge carbohydrate additive c lmw and low charge protein additive with low charge carbohydrate additive d lmw and low charge protein additive with high charge carbohydrate additive the protein additive concentration was representative of eom protein concentration at the late exponential phase while the carbohydrate additive concentration varied from 0 5 5 eom carbohydrate concentration at the late exponential phase table 2 lists the biomolecular additives classified based on mw and charge experiment 2 the impact of hydrogen bonding and van der waals interactions between proteins and carbohydrates and their subsequent influence on cell separation were evaluated by dosing a lectin cona protein additive and carbohydrate additives that are known to have different binding affinities to cona such as galactose low glucose medium and mannose high protein and carbohydrate additive concentrations were representative of the total eom protein or carbohydrate concentrations respectively at the late exponential phase as determined in section 2 2 4 3 results 3 1 characterisation of the cells eom and the biomolecular additives characterisation of the cells and eom of all species was conducted to ensure that the cultures used in the current study were of approximately similar character to those used previously the cells from all the species were unicellular and spherical with diameters ranging from 2 5 5 6 µm table 1 for the current and previously used cultures khan et al 2019 li et al 2019 rao et al 2020 the dissolved organic carbon doc at the harvesting point was within the range 7 10 mg l 1 and the eom carbohydrate and protein concentrations were between 3 0 6 6 mg l 1 and 0 9 3 0 mg l 1 respectively table 1 while the charge of the cv and ma555 cultures used in this study were similar to the cv and ma cultures used previously the charge of the ma564 culture used in this study was marginally more negative when compared to previously characterised m aeruginosa table 1 overall the physicochemical properties of the cultures and the eom used in this study were largely similar to those used in previous studies thereby validating the assessment of cultures used in this study for elucidating eom protein carbohydrate influences on cell separation all the biomolecular additives evaluated in this study were negatively charged however the magnitude of this charge varied among the carbohydrate additives the uronic acids were at least two to four times more negatively charged 6 5 to 13 5 mv 0 38 to 0 81 meq g 1 compared to the neutral or amino carbohydrates table 2 interestingly while the formal charge of the non ionic carbohydrates neutral and amino is negligible these molecules had a slight negative charge possibly due to the weak dissociation of the oh groups in the buffered solution the analysis of the protein additives revealed that the algal derived proteins were generally more negative 6 5 to 13 5 mv 0 46 to 1 00 meq g 1 than the non algal proteins 0 9 to 8 5 mv 0 11 to 0 37 meq g 1 table 2 and these values were comparable to those reported previously rao et al 2020 the algal derived proteins were a mix of several proteins with previous protein analysis indicating that the protein mw ranged from 10 kda up to 250 kda rao et al 2020 of these the algal derived proteins that had the greatest concentration of proteins in the hmw range 50 kda were in the order ma564 protein 72 79 ma555 protein 12 13 cv protein 3 4 table 2 this was in sharp contrast to the non algal proteins which were mostly a mix of 2 3 proteins and had distinct mw in the order bsa 100 50 kda hsa 100 50 kda cona 1 50 kda table 2 the purity of all the protein additives exceeded 98 table 2 and were therefore of sufficient purity to use in jar tests 3 2 understanding fluctuations in algal cell separation efficiencies via biomolecular additive dosing 3 2 1 evaluating influences of concentrations mw and charge of protein and carbohydrate additives on algal cell separation efficiency the following biomolecular additives with differing mw and charge were dosed at varying concentrations to understand their impacts on cell separation protein extracted from ma564 ma555 and cv the proteins bsa and cona and the carbohydrates glucose glucosamine galacturonic acid the full characterisation information pertaining to the biomolecular additives is provided in table 2 3 2 1 1 analysing the impacts of concentrations mw and charge of protein additives on cell separation efficiency when no biomolecular additives were dosed into jars containing cell suspensions without eom the observed cell separations were cv 0 12 without eom and 61 69 with eom ma555 3 12 without eom and 28 38 with eom ma564 2 13 without eom and 95 100 with eom fig 1 a b these values were less than or comparable to that achieved when the protein additives were dosed into jars containing the equivalent cell suspensions without eom fig 1c g compared to the low medium mw 50 kda and low medium charge 0 5 meq g 1 protein additives trialling the ma564 protein hmw high charge at double the typical intrinsic eom protein concentration found in each species increased the cell separation to 33 for ma555 56 for cv and 62 for ma564 fig 1c g this is supported by henderson et al 2010b who observed that the hmw proteins present in the eom of another strain of m aeruginosa ccap 1450 3 enhanced separation efficiency among the hmw protein additives dosing of the ma564 protein fig 1c resulted in greater cell separation compared to bsa fig 1d possibly due to strong interactions between the dosed ma564 protein and the cell surface similar to that observed in other m aeruginosa species kehr and dittmann 2015 kehr et al 2006 this suggests that mw and charge of eom proteins can have a direct impact on cell separation by bridging between polymers and cells as proposed in previous studies garzon sanabria et al 2013 henderson et al 2010a rao et al 2018b safarikova et al 2013 at protein additive doses beyond 2 3 intrinsic eom protein concentrations cell separation decreased and stabilised between 2 16 for all the protein additives trialled fig 1c g the decrease in cell separation for low medium mw and low charge protein additives such as cv protein and cona from their respective peak separation was 20 for the high mw and high charge ma564 protein this value was 25 this could be attributed to steric effects an increase in charge demand for the protein additive and a negative charge restabilisation in the suspension associated with the manifold increase in protein additive concentrations consequences of which are poor protein additive cell pdadmac interactions and a lower cell separation 3 2 1 2 analysing impacts of concentrations mw and charge of carbohydrate additives on cell separation efficiency when dosing carbohydrate additives into the jar fig 1h j the cell separation observed between species varied from negligible to greater than what was achieved when no additives were dosed for the equivalent species fig 1a b for each of the carbohydrate additives trialled maximum cell separations were obtained at 2 3 intrinsic eom carbohydrate concentrations irrespective of species and a decrease in the cell separation was observed at doses higher than these concentrations fig 1h j this was possibly due to the high charge demand caused by the prevalence of negatively charged species at high concentrations vandamme et al 2016 despite the similarity of the mw of the carbohydrate additives table 2 galacturonic acid dosed at 2 3 the intrinsic eom carbohydrate concentration resulted in the greatest separation 28 for all three species fig 1j this suggests that the charge of the carbohydrate is the more important parameter this is likely because interactions between acidic carbohydrates such as galacturonic acid that are present in the eom and proteins on the cell surface can occur via charge stabilisation and influence cell separation similar to that observed in the web like structures that interacted with the cells and enhanced the separation of ma564 gonzalez torres et al 2017 rao et al 2018b overall the analysis of results from fig 1h j suggests that cell separation could be directly impacted by the concentrations and charge of the eom carbohydrates 3 2 1 3 understanding influences of biomolecular additives on cell separation through effluent zeta potential when increasing the dose of biomolecular additives the effluent zeta potential for all the species became more negative fig 2 c j compared to tests where no additives were dosed fig 2a b while the decrease in the effluent zeta potential was common among all the additives trialled the addition of some additives caused the zeta potential of the resulting treated water to become more negative than others for instance the effluent zeta potential ranged from 8 to 29 mv for the protein additive experiments fig 2c g and from 21 to 39 5 mv for the carbohydrate additive experiments fig 2h j likely reasons include the high charge demand of carbohydrates due to their higher molar concentrations compared to proteins and a decreased availability of pdadmac to neutralise both algal cells and the additives the zeta potential of the treated water also gives an indication of the residual pdadmac in the effluent a highly negative effluent is indicative of negligible pdadmac concentrations and vice versa henderson et al 2010a rao et al 2018a a combination of highly negative effluents with low cell separation could be indicative of a complete utilisation of pdadmac for electrostatic complexation with cells and or biomolecular additives and or b the presence of excess biomolecular additives in the treated water with the remaining cells due to the likely absence of pdadmac in the treated water increasing pdadmac concentrations in the saturator to compensate for the charge demand would seem a plausible way to improve cell separation however as observed in si fig s2 1 a 50 increase in pdadmac concentration in the saturator from 0 004 meq l 1 to 0 006 meq l 1 resulted in a 5 difference between the maximum and minimum cell separations and caused an increase in effluent zeta potential indicative of increased pdadmac concentrations therefore the combination of highly negative treated water with low cell separation is more likely a consequence of the absence of large complex macromolecular structures that can network with multiple cells which are typically formed via protein carbohydrate interactions in the eom as proposed previously rao et al 2020 this will be explored via collective dosing of protein and carbohydrate additives 3 2 2 assessing the impact of protein carbohydrate interactions on cell separation 3 2 2 1 protein carbohydrate interactions caused by charge and steric factors in experiment 1 a d paired dosing of one protein and one carbohydrate additive into jars containing cv cells without eom was conducted the pairs were chosen such that the additives had varying mw and charge as highlighted in experiment 1 a d in section 2 3 3 this was to evaluate how protein carbohydrate interactions caused by charge and steric factors impacted separation when the additive pairs were dosed the cell separations increased for all pairs and reached maximum values when the protein additive concentrations were equal to typical eom protein concentrations and carbohydrate additive concentrations were double the typical eom carbohydrate concentrations fig 3 a d the cell separation decreased at higher concentrations irrespective of the additive combination trialled when maximum cell separations obtained by dosing different additive pairs were compared it was observed that the pair that had the greatest mw and charge ma564 protein galacturonic acid resulted in at least four times higher cell separation fig 3a than cv protein glucose lowest mw and charge fig 3c the cell separation obtained when dosing the additives in tandem were also very different to what was achieved when dosing them individually for instance the maximum cell separation of 70 9 achieved by dosing ma564 protein galacturonic acid pair fig 3a was greater than that observed when these additives were dosed individually fig 1c 1j for cv these observations suggest that a stable electrostatic repulsion between ma564 protein uronic acid exists resulting in the formation of large open suprastructures similar to those commonly observed in protein carbohydrate complexes ganzevles et al 2006 sperber et al 2009 overall these results suggest that steric and electrostatic protein carbohydrate interactions can impact separation web like networks that have previously been suggested to enhance separation gonzalez torres et al 2017 rao et al 2018b yap et al 2014 were observed when dosing ma564 protein galacturonic acid however the web like networks observed in the current work were noted via visual observation to be smaller and fewer in number than those seen previously and moreover did not form at sizes visible to the naked eye in all jar tests in addition large standard deviations in cell separation of up to 10 were also observed upon several jar test repetitions fig 3 these observations are attributed to either the presence of intrinsic eom in low concentrations due to poor extraction or fresh production or the loss of proteins during extraction of algal derived protein additives as noted previously rao et al 2020 3 2 2 2 protein carbohydrate interactions caused by hydrogen bonding and van der waals interactions the influence of protein carbohydrate binding due to hydrogen bonding and van der waals forces on cv without eom separation was tested in experiment 2 by dosing three carbohydrates of similar mw and charge mannose glucose and galactose table 2 with the carbohydrate binding lectin cona significant variation in cell separation was observed between the different carbohydrate additives that were trialled fig 4 for instance dosing cona with mannose and glucose increased the cell separation to 36 4 and 24 5 respectively at 2 typical eom carbohydrate concentrations fig 4 in contrast the cv cell separation prior to dosing additives ranged between 3 14 as the mw and charge densities of the carbohydrate additives were comparable it is evident that the variations in cell separation are a function of the binding strength of different carbohydrate additives with the lectin specifically the binding affinities of cona with the carbohydrate additives are in the order mannose glucose galactose maupin et al 2012 and these variations are attributed to van der waals forces and hydrogen bonding between the protein and carbohydrate berg et al 1999 overall for the first time it is demonstrated that protein carbohydrate interactions induced by hydrogen bonding and van der waals forces can influence cell separation while the influence of this interaction on cell separation appears to be lower than that of charge and steric interactions demonstrated in the previous section it is not possible to state whether this would always be the case as only one lectin has been tested future research could examine additional combinations to elucidate the impact of varying lectin character 4 discussion when dosing protein and carbohydrate additives to cell suspensions in the absence of eom variations in process efficiency as determined via cell separation were observed and attributed to the manipulation of interactions between biomolecular additives and cells related to the 1 concentrations and character of the dosed biomolecular additives 2 protein carbohydrate interplay and 3 influence of cationic polymers it is proposed that none of these aspects is predominant rather their synergistic action contributes to the overall success of the separation process this is explored in the following 4 1 importance of concentrations mw and charge of biomolecular additives when understanding variations in cell separation across species protein additives within 2 the typical eom protein concentration and carbohydrate additives within 3 the typical eom carbohydrate concentration optimal 2 3 resulted in the greatest cell separation while a significant reduction in the cell separation was observed when additive concentrations were outside this range fig 1 irrespective of the additive character it is proposed that maximum cell separations were only observed within this range because higher concentrations likely led to an increase in the additive complexation with pdadmac resulting in low pdadmac availability for cell separation similar to that observed during the inhibition of alkaline flocculation of a european strain of c vulgaris due to high carbohydrate concentrations vandamme et al 2016 these results suggest that the concentration of protein and carbohydrate in intrinsic eom likely influences cell separation any further discussions on the impact of biomolecular additive concentrations on cell separation invariably leads to drawing conclusions based on protein carbohydrate character from fig 1 it was observed that hmw 50 250 kda and charged 0 5 meq g 1 biomolecular additives within 2 typical eom protein or carbohydrate concentrations resulted in greater cell separations when compared to lmw 50 kda and charged 0 5 meq g 1 biomolecular additives it is well understood that some hmw proteins can form networks with several cells via protein bridging leading to extensive protein cell attachments and a higher cell separation baresova et al 2017 henderson et al 2010b in addition the amide i groups in the protein additives can also electrostatically interact with the cooh groups on the algal cell surface leading to greater interactions between the protein additives and the cells gonzalez torres et al 2017 guo et al 2013 therefore by extrapolation it is suggested that the presence of hmw and highly charged biopolymers in the intrinsic eom can enhance cell separation while dosing hmw 50 250 kda and highly charged 0 5 meq g 1 biomolecular protein additives enhanced cell separation dosing these protein additives in tandem with carbohydrate additives resulted in cell separations that were up to 35 higher fig 3a than what was obtained when dosing the respective protein or carbohydrate additives individually fig 1 this implies that protein and carbohydrate additives worked synergistically to influence cell separation this will be explored in the following subsection 4 2 importance of protein carbohydrate cell networks when understanding variations in cell separation across species it is suggested that protein carbohydrate interactions in the eom and with the cell surface along with their interactions with pdadmac bubble modifier could further enhance cell separation than what was achieved by dosing only the protein or the carbohydrate previously protein carbohydrate interactions that could influence algal cell separation were proposed to occur via a irreversible covalent protein carbohydrate interactions catalysed by enzymes such as glycosyltransferases and b non covalent protein carbohydrate interactions rao et al 2020 while it was impossible to evaluate the influence of covalent protein carbohydrate interactions on cell separation via jar testing the results from experiments that analyse non covalent interactions provide clues regarding the importance of eom protein carbohydrate interactions on the variability of cell separation across species protein carbohydrate interactions can occur due to electrostatic complexation similar to that observed in species such as tetraselmis sp schwenzfeier et al 2013a schwenzfeier et al 2013b soluble protein carbohydrate complexes are typically formed due to stabilisation by electrostatic repulsion and these large complexes usually carry charge with the same sign as the carbohydrate ganzevles et al 2006 schwenzfeier et al 2014 sperber et al 2009 another way by which proteins and carbohydrates can interact is through glycation conjugation via hydrogen bonding and van der waals forces as observed in species such as microcystis aeruginosa kehr and dittmann 2015 kehr et al 2006 overall when proteins and carbohydrates interact with the cells via steric effects electrostatic influences hydrogen bonding and van der waals forces negatively charged protein carbohydrate cell networks are formed which on interaction with cationic polymers enhance separation fig 3 4 the application of cationic polymers in the modified bubble daf process has been extensively studied from the perspective of polymer bubble attachment rao et al 2018a yap et al 2014 but it is suggested that the ability of charged polymers to interlock the protein carbohydrate cell linkages and bubbles during flotation is of equal if not of greater importance during the flotation of cv cells without eom using ma564 protein and galacturonic acid web like suprastructures were formed and enhanced separation section 3 2 2 1 ft ir analysis of similar web like suprastructures during the separation of ma564 cells and intrinsic eom in a previous study revealed that these suprastructures were formed from protein carbohydrate networks that existed naturally in the algal suspension rao et al 2018b although the web like networks are attributed to protein carbohydrate interactions those formed in this study or in algal suspensions with eom were not visible prior to or enhanced separation until the cationic bubbles were introduced into the jar section 3 2 2 1 rao et al 2018a this suggests that despite the existence of protein carbohydrate cell networks it is only the introduction of the cationic bubbles that helps build these linkages into larger suprastructures 5 conclusions this study demonstrates that the modified bubble daf process efficiency is influenced by the manipulation of polymer protein carbohydrate cell linkages caused by dosing biomolecular additives of varying concentrations and character to algal cell suspensions specific conclusions drawn from this study are as follows dosing protein and carbohydrate additives at concentrations at 2 the typical eom protein and 3 the typical eom carbohydrate concentrations resulted in an increase in cell separation compared to what was observed in standard modified bubble daf experiments without eom beyond those concentrations cell separations declined possibly due to low polymer availability because of polymer additive complexation cell separation varied significantly as a function of mw and charge of the biomolecular additives hmw protein additives and high charged protein and carbohydrate additives 50 250 kda 0 5 meq g 1 resulted in greater cell separations compared to lmw and low charge additives 50 kda 0 5 meq g 1 by forming suprastructures that interacted with the cell surface it is suggested that protein carbohydrate interactions occurring via electrostatic complexation steric influences hydrogen bonding and van der waals forces form negatively charged protein carbohydrate cell networks these negatively charged networks interact with cationic polymers to form large suprastructures that enhance separation by extrapolation it is suggested that high intrinsic eom biopolymer concentrations resulting in coagulant biopolymer complexation lmw and charge of proteins and carbohydrates and limited protein carbohydrate interactions could be characteristic features of algal suspensions that exhibit poor cell separation future recommendations include expanding the suite of algae tested by evaluating other species of microcystis aeruginosa that naturally have the protein and carbohydrate properties identified in this study evaluating the interaction mechanisms between the additives

electrochemical technologies mets for treating groundwater contaminated with nitrate no3 while containing arsenic in form of arsenite as iii as a co contaminant the treatment was based on the combination of nitrate reduction to dinitrogen gas and arsenite oxidation to arsenate exhibiting less toxicity solubility and mobility which can be removed more easily in further post treatment we operated a bioelectrochemical reactor at continuous flow mode with synthetic contaminated groundwater 33 mg n no3 l 1 and 5 mg as iii l 1 identifying the key operational conditions different hydraulic

simultaneously arsenic oxidation was complete at all hrt tested down to 1 6 h reaching an oxidation rate of up to 90 g as iii m 3 net reactor volume d 1 electrochemical and microbiological characterization of single granules suggested that arsenite at 5 mg l 1 did not have an inhibitory effect on a denitrifying biocathode mainly represented by sideroxydans sp although the coexistence of

bioelectrochemical system continuous bioreactor electroactive microorganism 1 introduction groundwater constitutes the largest reservoir of drinking water however the presence of different pollutants compromises its usage european commission 2008 the coexistence of several and different types of contaminants from anthropogenic and geological sources is a common thread that requires the development of sustainable technologies capable of treating these mixtures of pollutants zhang et al 2017 the world health organization who has defined nitrate and arsenic as hazardous inorganic contaminants in groundwater who 2017 nitrate is one of the most widespread pollutants in groundwater due to intensive agriculture and has become a worldwide concern for human health and safety the nitrates directive 91 767 eu sets a nitrate concentration limit of 11 3 mg n no3 l 1 in drinking water conventional nitrate polluted groundwater treatments are usually based on separation technologies besides being

biological denitrification by a sequential reduction of nitrate to dinitrogen gas n2 through four reduction steps table 1 although biological treatments hold environmental and economic advantages electron donors are limited in groundwater and a continuous supply of chemicals such as acetate or hydrogen gas is required electro bioremediation is a primary microbial electrochemical technology met and emerges as a sustainable alternative for groundwater treatment pous et al 2018 met is based on bioelectrochemical systems bes harnessing the capacity of electroactive microorganisms to perform oxidation and reduction reactions with solid electron conductors e g electrodes thereby these electroactive microorganisms are able to use the anode and the cathode as an inexhaustible electron acceptor or donor respectively logan et al 2019 when nitrate is the target pollutant autotrophic denitrification can be performed using only the cathode as electron donor and inorganic carbon as carbon source clauwaert et al 2007 so far denitrification by met have been widely studied ranging from a first proof of concept gregory et al 2004 to investigations on the underlying mechanism to technological applications clauwaert et al 2009 virdis et al 2008 few studies showed nitrate treatment in combination with other contaminants performed by met to identify potential electron donor acceptor competitors or inhibitory effects the literature has been mostly focused on organic compounds and sulfate lai et al 2015 nguyen et al 2016a arsenic contamination of groundwater in many cases occurs naturally due to reductive dissolution of arsenic rich minerals the world health organization who has established a temporal guideline value of 10 µg l 1 as a permissive limit for drinking water who 2017 the predominant oxidation states of inorganic arsenic are arsenite as iii and arsenate as v in reducing conditions arsenic is mostly found as arsenite which is the most toxic soluble and mobile form in line with this the groundwater redox potential has an essential role in the arsenic contaminated groundwater in general it has been observed that the reductive arsenic dissolution can be low in nitrate contaminated groundwater hosono et al 2011 however arsenic and nitrate do co exist in groundwaters that present a high content of bicarbonate piqué et al 2010 due to punctual arsenic dissolution related to drought periods ventura houle et al 2018 or punctual industrial dumpings leakages e g some industrial activities that include the use of insecticides pesticides and wood preservatives jang et al 2016 arsenic removal in water treatment is traditionally carried out by arsenite oxidation to arsenate table 1 as a preliminary step to decrease the arsenic solubility followed by precipitation using metal salts borho and wilderer 1996 adsorption based removal methods i e granulated ferric hydroxide are more effective also with arsenate banerjee et al 2008 arsenite oxidation to arsenate is conventionally performed by chemical oxidation by ozone iron and manganese oxide or photochemical oxidation bissen and frimmel 2003 standard redox potential shown in table 1 however these oxidation methods have low selectivity resulting in toxic by products generation such as nitroaromatic compounds ji et al 2017 besides chemical treatments are characterized by constant chemical consumption and the possible use of catalysts resulting in a high operational cost wang and zhao 2009 recently an environmentally friendly process for arsenite oxidation using microorganisms as sustainable catalysts is attracting interest in environments lacking organic matter e g groundwater autotrophic bacteria can be applied to oxidise arsenite using external oxygen or nitrate as electron acceptor crognale et al 2017 wang et al 2017 for instance arsenite can be linked to denitrification by some microorganisms nevertheless arsenite can inhibit chemolithotrophic denitrification in a wide range of concentrations in adapted microbial communities inhibition was found in the range of 150 to 375 mg as iii l 1 sun et al 2009 2008 recent studies indicated that mets represent a novel and suitable approach to arsenite oxidation to arsenate li et al 2016 nguyen et al 2016b 2017 pous et al 2015a the present study proposes a bioelectrochemical system to treat nitrate contaminated groundwater that contains arsenic as a co contaminant arsenic was included in form of arsenite over arsenate due to its higher toxicity and mobility the main goal is the exploration whether nitrate can be successfully converted into dinitrogen gas having arsenic in the same water while pursuing arsenite oxidation at the same time so far one preliminary study demonstrated the combined electrochemical treatment of arsenic and nitrate in a single reactor nguyen et al 2016b coupled anodic arsenite oxidation and cathodic denitrification in a compartmentalized system where enriched arsenic and nitrate solutions were separately fed to the anodic and cathodic compartment respectively the present study explores the presence of both pollutants in the same water matrix a novel continuous flow met was developed and operated for simultaneous nitrate removal and arsenite oxidation thereby the operational conditions e g recirculation and hydraulic retention time were adapted for treating groundwater furthermore the effects of arsenite on denitrifying biocathode performance were investigated and arsenite oxidation pathways were elucidated 2 materials and methods 2 1 reactor setup two identical tubular bes reactors were assembled and operated as replicates reactor a and b fig 1 schematically presents the reactor configuration used in this study the anode and cathode were separated by a tubular cation exchange membrane with an internal diameter of 45 mm cem cmi 7000 membranes int usa the structure was built with pvc tube diameter of 55 mm and length of 350 mm the cathode inner part and anode outer part compartments were filled with granular graphite diameter 1 5 5 mm enviro cell germany previously washed with 1 m hcl and 1 m naoh and graphite rods 8 400 mm and 4 2500 mm for cathode and anode compartment respectively mersen ibérica spain were used as current collectors assuming that each chamber was filled with spherical particles average diameter of 3 25 mm with a fixed bed porosity of 50 electrode surfaces of 0 51 m2 and 0 29 m2 were calculated for the cathode and anode compartment respectively the net liquid volumes of cathode ncc and anode nac compartment were 0 3 l and 0 15 l respectively the reactors were equipped with an ag agcl sat kcl reference electrode 0 197 v vs standard hydrogen electrode she se 11 xylem analytics germany sales gmbh co kg sensortechnik meinsberg germany resulting in a three electrode setup the cathode potential was poised at 0 123 v vs she using a potentiostat vsp biologic france to drive complete nitrate reduction to dinitrogen gas according with previous knowledge pous et al 2015b if not stated otherwise all redox potentials are provided in respect of she the cathode and the anode were hydraulically connected the influent was directly pumped upwards through the cathode compartment and spilled over at its top to the anode compartment subsequently it circulated from the top to the bottom of the anode compartment where the outlet was located in certain operational periods a fraction of the effluent was recirculated to the influent to increase internal flow fig 1 the recirculation increased the fluid velocity in the cathode compartment from 1 10 5 m s 1 without recirculation to 4 10 4 and 9 10 4 m s 1 with recirculation flow rate of 35 l d 1 and 85 l d 1 respectively the increase of the internal fluid velocity reinforced the mass transfer of substrate as well as counter ions from the bulk liquid to inner biofilm layers additional benefits were the decrease of possible dead zones and increase homogeneity inside the reactor 2 2 reactor inoculation the anode and cathode compartments were simultaneously inoculated for 30 days before the continuous operation a solution was prepared containing 79 of synthetic groundwater 20 of effluent from a denitrifying bes reactor pous et al 2017 and 1 of an enriched autotrophic arsenite oxidizing culture this solution was used to fill both reactors and an external 1 l tank the influent and the effluent of the reactors were connected to the 1 l tank and a peristaltic pump was used to continuously recirculate the solution at a flow rate of 35 l d 1 i e closed loop mode when nitrate and arsenite were depleted i e concentrations of both compounds were below 1 mg l 1 the medium of the 1 l tank was replaced with a fresh solution the cathode potential was poised at 0 123 v to promote growth of denitrifying bacteria autotrophic arsenite oxidizing culture was obtained from arsenic contaminated sites in the province of girona spain samples were collected from surface and contaminated groundwater seven samples each sample 25 ml was added to 125 ml of mineral medium without any organic carbon source with a final concentration of 15 mg as iii l 1 following the same methodology as described in pous et al 2015a each sample was incubated aerobically by constant aeration at room temperature 20 2 c and with constant agitation 200 rpm after 50 days the enriched microorganisms were sub cultured in a fresh mineral medium in a dilution of 1 all sub cultured enrichments showed a mean arsenite oxidation rate of 0 4 0 2 g as iii m 3 d 1 without any observable differentiation between the enrichments these sub cultured enrichments were blended resulting in the enriched autotrophic arsenite oxidizing culture used for inoculation of reactors a and b 2 3 reactor continuous operation after the inoculation period the reactors were operated in continuous flow mode at 1 4 l d 1 hydraulic retention time hrt of 7 5 h without recirculation flow using synthetic groundwater after 25 days the reactors were operated applying a recirculation flow of 35 l d 1 to reinforce the substrate distribution and promote mass transfer following these operating conditions the hrt was progressively decreased from 7 5 to 1 6 h two recirculation flow rates were tested i from hrt of 7 5 to 4 4 h with a recirculation flow rate of 35 l d 1 and ii from hrt of 5 0 to 1 6 h with a recirculation flow rate of 85 l d 1 an overview of all tests is listed in table s1 supplementary data each condition had a minimum duration of 7 days 2 4 synthetic groundwater synthetic medium mimicking nitrate and arsenic contaminated groundwater was used to feed the reactors the synthetic groundwater was prepared considering the main characteristics of groundwater from navata village girona spain 28 6 mg n no3 l 1 1 0 0 1 ms cm 1 and ph of 8 0 0 2 pous et al 2013 the arsenic in groundwater is typically in the concentration range of some µg l 1 van halem et al 2009 at the sample site of navata spain the arsenic concentration was below 10 µg l 1 nevertheless the arsenite concentration was adjusted to high concentration of 5 mg as iii l 1 to test the potential of the system under more severe conditions the synthetic groundwater was prepared with distillate water and contained 203 9 mg l 1 nano3 33 mg n no3 l 1 8 7 mg l 1 asnao2 5 mg as iii l 1 420 0 mg l 1 nahco3 as inorganic carbon source 7 5 mg l 1 kh2po4 1 9 mg l 1 na2hpo4 100 0 mg l 1 nacl 75 2 mg l 1 mgso4 7h2o 10 0 mg l 1 nh4cl and 0 1 ml l 1 of a trace minerals solution balch et al 1979 in addition the influent contained 10 of effluent from a denitrifying bes reactor pous et al 2017 during all operational periods to simulate the presence of microorganisms in the groundwater this effluent with a od600 of 0 05 was composed by proteobacteria phylum 78 being acidithiobacillus sp as the most abundant genus the electric conductivity of the synthetic groundwater was 1 3 0 2 ms cm 1 and the initial ph was 8 1 0 2 for simulating groundwater from navata girona spain 2 5 abiotic arsenite oxidation tests a series of abiotic tests were performed to determine chemical using nitrate and oxygen and electrochemical arsenite oxidation in addition the putative role of granular graphite as catalyst for arsenite oxidation and its arsenic sorption capacity were also investigated all abiotic tests are shown in table 2 and experiment set ups are shown in supplementary data figure s1 each test was performed in duplicates for 24 h in batch mode using 100 ml flasks with 75 ml of synthetic groundwater as described above anoxic with nitrate and aerobic tests were performed in the absence and presence of granular graphite in addition an aerobic test was also performed in presence of pvc granules as non conductive material the corresponding tests used 50 ml of granular graphite or of pvc granules both materials with an average diameter of 3 5 mm and estimated surface of 0 05 m2 anoxic conditions were established by flushing the medium with n2 during 10 minutes before each test the tests under aerobic conditions were carried out under continuous aeration using a domestic aquarium air pump finally the electrochemical arsenite oxidation was studied with a granular graphite bed poised at 1 15 v by a potentiostat nav 3 2 nanoelectra spain in the electrochemical test a single chamber configuration was used with a three electrode setup using two graphite rods diameter 6 mm mersen ibéria spain serving as current collector for the granular graphite bed working electrode and as counter electrode and a ag agcl sat kcl electrode as reference electrode 2 6 electrochemical characterization of isolated granules the granular graphite from both bes reactors was further characterized using electrochemical measurements the present study uses an improved version of the e clamp firstly introduced by rodrigo quejigo et al 2018 the improved e clamp consists of four spring steel wires 1 4310 febrotec gmbh germany forming a gripper that is encased by a peek tube figure s2 supplementary data the e clamp can be mechanically moved the electrochemical experiments were conducted in a four neck round bottom flask lenz laborglas gmbh co kg germany with an integrated three electrode setup with a graphite rod as counter electrode 10 50 mm mersen ibéria spain and with an ag agcl sat kcl as reference electrode thereby the working electrode was the e clamp holding three granules per test with an average wet weight of 0 31 0 01 g directly measured after each test the sampled granules for electrochemical measurements were taken in triplicates during operation at hrt of 1 6 0 1 h days 187 194 from i the top of the cathode compartment of both reactors and ii the bottom of the anode compartment of reactor b abiotic controls were performed using non inoculated granular graphite the experiments were carried out at room temperature 23 2 c with constant agitation magnetic stirring 150 rpm and with continuous flushing of n2 to ensure anoxic conditions directly after sampling granules were immersed in synthetic groundwater medium without nitrate nor arsenite buffer non turnover conditions and chronoamperometry ca was performed with the working electrode poised at 0 12 or 0 50 v for the cathodic and anodic pous et al 2015a granules respectively when current density reached a stable value cyclic voltammetry cv was conducted in a potential range from 0 60 to 0 20 and 0 20 to 1 00 v for the cathodic and anodic granules respectively three cycles were performed at scan rate of 1 mv s 1 the third cycle was used for data analysis by soas fourmond et al 2009 after cv the ca was switched to turnover conditions thereby cathodic granules were tested by sequential addition of nitrate 33 mg n no3 l 1 and arsenite 5 mg as iii l 1 to the same medium anodic granules were tested under turnover conditions by addition of arsenite to the medium 5 mg as iii l 1 2 7 analytical methods and calculations samples of effluent and influent were taken and analysed from both reactors three times per week resulting in a minimum of three analytical measurements for each condition all liquid samples were analysed according to apha standard water measurements apha 2005 for nitrate n no3 nitrite n no2 and arsenate as v by ionic chromatography ics 5000 dionex usa total arsenic was analysed by adding an oxidizing agent 100 mm kmno₄ to fully oxidize all arsenic forms into arsenate arsenite concentration was calculated as the difference between total arsenic and arsenate three measurements of arsenic forms to the arsenic balance were obtained total arsenic arsenite and arsenate the ph and electrical conductivity of the samples were measured with a ph meter ph meter basic 20 crison spain and a conductivity meter ec meter basic 30 crison spain respectively nitrous oxide n2o was measured once per week using a n2o liquid phase microsensor unisense denmark located in the effluent of the reactors the hydraulic retention time was calculated considering the net cathodic volume hrtcat and whole net reactor volume hrt for denitrification and arsenite oxidation respectively in order to analyse the performance of each condition in continuous operation nitrate reduction rno3 and arsenite oxidation ras iii rates were calculated eq s1 and s4 supplementary data the coulombic efficiency of denitrifying biocathode cecat was calculated as proposed pous et al 2017 it was calculated considering all reduction steps from nitrate to dinitrogen gas considering nitrite and nitrous oxide accumulation eq s6 supplementary data for the arsenite oxidation at the bioanode anodic columbic efficiency cean were calculated considering the oxidation from arsenite to arsenate eq s8 supplementary data 2 8 microbiological analysis granular graphite was sampled for dna extraction two times from the upper part of the anode and cathode compartment of running reactors at hrt of 2 8 and 2 3 h day 145 and 180 dna was extracted as described previously in vilajeliu pons et al 2016 the obtained dna was quantified using a nanodrop nd 1000 spectrophotometer nanodrop technologies inc wilmington usa and stored at 20 c illumina miseq flow cell v2 sequencing was conducted by the rtsf core facilities at the michigan state university usa https rtsf atsci msu edu the primers 515f and 806r were used for the amplification of the v4 region of 16s rdna according to the method described by kozich et al 2013 sequence data from the miseq platform were quality filtered trimmed dereplicated merged and after a process of chimera removal were clustered into amplicon sequence variants asvs using the dada2 pipeline callahan et al 2016 afterwards asvs tabulation and taxonomy assignment were performed using the silva taxonomic database v132 finally the phyloseq package was used to tabulate relative abundances at various taxonomic levels mcmurdie and holmes 2013 all analyses were performed with r v 3 6 3 using packages dada2 v 1 14 1 and phyloseq v 1 30 0 representative sequences for each amplicon sequence variant asvs were assigned taxonomically using blast searches at ncbi 3 results and discussion 3 1 denitrification and arsenite oxidation performance in mets both reactors were operated as replicates in continuous flow mode after the inoculation period the cathode potential was controlled at 0 123 v to promote denitrifying biocathodes pous et al 2015b while arsenite oxidation was expected to occur in the anode compartment fig 2 a and b show the nitrate and arsenite loading and reduction rates the continuous operation started with hrt of 7 5 0 3 h hrtcat of 5 0 0 3 h without recirculation after 13 days the reactor reached a steady state performance with a nitrate reduction rate rno3 of 24 10 g n no3 m 3 ncc d 1 nitrate removal of 15 5 although nitrate was removed at a low rate it was completely reduced to dinitrogen gas with low nitrite accumulation 3 4 3 0 of nitrogen removed and no nitrous oxide emissions were detected table s1 supplementary data hence about 95 of the nitrate was reduced into dinitrogen gas the low denitrification rate compared to previous studies 849 g n no3 mncc 3 d 1 pous et al 2017 could be mainly explained by mass transfer limitations the low fluid velocity in the cathode compartment during the operation 1 10 5 m s 1 resulted in a limited mass transfer restricting catalytic rates moreover the low mass transfer also affects the transfer of charge balancing ions mainly sodium but also protons outwards the electroactive biofilm inhibiting electrochemical reactions puig et al 2012 to reduce limitations and to enhance denitrification performance the fluid dynamics of the reactors was improved by including a recirculation a recirculation flow of 35 l d 1 25 fold more compared to the influent at the same hrtcat of 5 h resulted in an improved rno3 of 166 22 g n no3 m 3 ncc d 1 representing a 7 fold increase compared to previous operation without recirculation thereby nitrate removal increased to 99 1 in both reactors without accumulation of neither nitrite nor nitrous oxide recirculation reduced the ph in the cathode compartment from 9 0 0 2 to 8 0 0 3 due to an improved transport of protons between both compartments thus the denitrifying performance was enhanced as the ph was closer to the optimal ph of 7 clauwaert et al 2009 glass and silverstein 1998 wang et al 2018 subsequently hrtcat was continuously decreased to increase the nitrate loading rate while maintaining the recirculation flow at 35 l d 1 fig 2a the nitrate reduction rate increased in both reactors until the hrtcat was reduced to 3 6 0 2 h resulting in a nitrate reduction rate of 247 22 g n no3 m 3 ncc d 1 99 1 nitrate removal however the nitrate removal decreased to 54 10 at a lower hrtcat of 3 0 0 2 h therefore the recirculation was increased from 35 to 85 l d 1 to overcome the above mentioned denitrification limitations as result at hrtcat of 3 0 0 2 h the denitrification performance was recovered in both reactors reaching nitrate removal of 91 10 the hrtcat was further decreased to 1 5 0 1 h to explore the maximum nitrate removal rate resulting in rno3 of 519 53 g n no3 m 3 ncc d 1 90 6 of nitrate removed and 456 61 g n no3 m 3 ncc d 1 71 13 of nitrate removed of reactors a and b respectively at this condition the effluent from both reactors achieved the quality standards for drinking water regarding nitrate and nitrite concentration 11 mg n no3 l 1 and 0 15 mg n no2 l 1 table s1 in supplementary data according to nitrates directive 91 767 eu moreover no nitrite accumulation was observed and the emitted nitrous oxide only represented 3 5 2 0 of removed nitrate in consequence it can be considered that about 95 of removed nitrate was converted into dinitrogen gas besides working at relatively high ph around 8 0 at both influent and effluent could imply the accumulation of denitrification intermediates glass and silverstein 1998 molognoni et al 2017 such accumulation was not detected in our study further decreasing hrtcat to 1 1 0 1 h resulted in lower nitrate reduction rates of 444 90 g n no3 m 3 ncc d 1 in both reactors thereby the nitrate removal decreased to 51 11 arsenite oxidation to arsenate was stable in both reactors during the whole experimental period reaching arsenite concentrations below the analytical quantification limit 0 1 mg as iii l 1 the maximum arsenite oxidation rate ras iii was 92 5 g as iii m 3 nac ncc d 1 at hrt of 1 6 0 1 h well above the maximum reported volumetric arsenite oxidation rate in mets 30 g as iii m 3 d 1 nguyen et al 2016b however considerably higher biological arsenite oxidation rates are reported using nitrate as the electron acceptor e g 1000 mg as iii l 1 d 1 in continuous granular sludge reactors sun et al 2009 nevertheless the observed trend of ras iii during the tested hrts fig 2b suggests that the maximum oxidation rate was not reached under the applied experimental conditions and lower hrt would probably lead to higher ras iii the effluent ph was at the upper limit for biological arsenite oxidation according to previous studies optimum ph between 6 and 8 bachate et al 2012 arsenic concentrations were stable at 6 4 1 1 mg l 1 in the influent effluent no decrease of total arsenic was observed during the 194 days of reactor operation suggesting negligible arsenic adsorption precipitation inside the bes reactor the cecat based on the electron balance for reduction of nitrate to dinitrogen gas reached values close to 100 in both reactors table s1 supplementary data it suggested that secondary reactions e g oxygen reduction or arsenate reduction were not significantly occurring at the cathode arsenic stabilized in form of arsenate less mobile easy to adsorb form over the reactor operation in spite of the reductive environment of the cathode in the range of the measured anode potentials 0 56 0 13 to 1 87 0 33 v supplementary data figure s3 biological arsenite oxidation has been reported pous et al 2015a however if it is considered that arsenite oxidation to arsenate was the main anode reaction a cean of 2 0 0 7 is obtained thus secondary reactions such as graphite lai et al 2017 and water oxidation were required to provide the electrons for the denitrifying biocathode the arsenite oxidation pathways in the reactors were further investigated in the following section 3 2 arsenite oxidation pathways due to the coexistence of different terminal electrons acceptors in these bes reactors arsenite oxidation could proceed via different pathways fig 3 b f i the anode ii nitrate and iii oxygen formed by water oxidation at the anode for this reason abiotic and biotic tests were performed with the three possible acceptors in the absence and presence of graphite granules to elucidate the predominant pathways table 2 summarizes the results of abiotic 24 h tests in batch mode oxygen has been reported as an oxidant capable of arsenite oxidation at a low rate bissen and frimmel 2003 no oxidation was detected under constant aeration without granular graphite during 24 h due to low oxygen dissolution from the air bubbles to the liquid phase when a pvc granules bed was added to the setup littler air bubbles could be formed improving oxygen diffusion this slightly increased the maximum arsenite oxidation rate to 0 2 0 1 mg as iii l 1 d 1 oxidation of 5 2 however maximum arsenite oxidation rate was improved by 10 fold in presence of granular graphite under aerobic condition ras iii of 2 1 0 5 g m 3 d 1 45 7 in addition polarizing granular graphite at 1 15 v potential in the range of anode potentials during reactors operation yielded an even higher oxidation rate 4 0 0 1 g m 3 d 1 75 5 at this condition arsenite could be directly oxidized by the anode eo 0 02 v at ph 7 table 1 or via oxygen that can be formed by water oxidation eo 0 81 v at ph 7 the considerably improved arsenite oxidation rate in the presence of granular graphite compared to a non conductive material pvc suggested a catalytic role of granular graphite furthermore no variation of total arsenic 1 was measured during the abiotic tests this supports the results observed in the bioreactors section 3 1 suggesting that arsenic adsorption precipitation was negligible to our knowledge it is not reported in literature that pure carbon materials e g pure graphite have catalytic properties for the arsenite oxidation however granular graphite from its production process can contain some impurities that could possess a catalytic role elemental analysis of granular graphite revealed the presence of iron at a concentration of 5 7 0 2 mg fe kggraphite 1 table s2 supplementary data for example some studies report that carbon materials supplemented with iron can oxidize and absorb arsenite chen et al 2007 furthermore electrochemical analysis of abiotic granular graphite with the e clamp fig 4 a and c showed an oxidative peak at 0 55 v in cvs in the absence and in the presence of arsenite non turnover and turnover condition respectively this further indicates that redox active compounds were present in granular graphite e g iron or quinones further the current density increased in abiotic cv at turnover condition at a voltage between of 0 55 to 1 00 v compared to cv at non turnover condition fig 4a and c suggesting the electrochemical arsenite oxidation using granular graphite fig 3e the arsenite oxidation rate observed in the electrochemical abiotic test using the anode as electron acceptor 6 5 0 1 mgas iii manode 2 d 1 and the abiotic test in the presence of oxygen 3 4 0 2 mg as iii manode 2 d 1 can only explain the observed arsenite oxidation rate in the bes 142 7 7 mgas iii manode 2 d 1 at lower hrt of 1 6h to a minor extent 10 the role of biological arsenite oxidation independent of electrochemical pathways was analysed by operating reactor a under open circuit voltage ocv conditions at hrt of 2 9 0 1 h under these conditions complete arsenite oxidation was observed 95 with a ras iii of 91 5 1 5 mgas iii manode 2 d 1 59 1 g as iii m 3 nac ncc d 1 fig 2b this suggested the capacity of the microbial community to oxidize arsenite without current supply during ocv the denitrification rate was 43 12 g n no3 m 3 ncc d 1 7 2 of nitrate removed and the conversion was virtually complete to n2 table s1 supplementary data in this period the observed molar ratio between arsenite oxidation and nitrate reduction was 0 4 0 1 as n this is in a good concordance with the theoretical molar ratio of 0 4 as n considering the electrons provided by as iii oxidation to as v and the electrons required for no3 reduction to n2 therefore the possibility of arsenite oxidation linked to denitrification in the reactor is proved fig 3b and is substantially contributing to the overall arsenite oxidation however it cannot be fully excluded that also aerobic arsenite oxidation fig 3d occurred in the reactors due to accumulation of oxygen formed by water oxidation prior to ocv or by air intrusions additional electrochemical analysis of granular graphite sampled from the anodic compartment of reactor b was performed to reveal if bioelectrochemical arsenite oxidation also played a role in the inoculated reactor however there are no remarkable differences between turnover and non turnover cvs of inoculated graphite granules indicating that bioelectrochemical arsenite oxidation is of minor importance under the tested experimental conditions fig 4b and d taking all results together the both abiotic and biotic arsenite oxidation pathways in the studied mets was demonstrated thereby arsenite oxidation was mainly performed by microorganisms using nitrate electron acceptors fig 3b associating the denitrification with arsenite oxidation nevertheless electrochemical oxidation fig 3e and abiotic oxidation with oxygen catalysed by granular graphite fig 3f was also demonstrated with a minor influence on total arsenite oxidation 3 3 microbial community the microbiological communities of the reactors a and b were analysed through dna extraction of granular graphite of both compartments at hrt of 2 8 and 2 3 h day 145 and 180 the analysis was performed at genus level of most abundant asvs by blastn searches table 3 the biocathode inhabited a complex microbial community predominantly composed of proteobacteria 81 89 in reactor a and b respectively betaproteobacteriales accounted for up to 68 84 of all sequences the taxon is characterized to contain bacterial species with a broad range of metabolic capabilities including redox transformation of metals e g iron and arsenic and denitrification chakraborty et al 2020 he et al 2016 this class of bacteria are widely found in bioelectrochemical denitrifying reactors pous et al 2015b at genus level both reactors were clearly dominated by sideroxydans 80 54 denitratisoma 4 5 and achromobacter 2 5 sideroxydans lithotrophicus es 1 is included in the gallionellaceae family and is reported as fe ii oxidizing chemoautotrophic bacteria some studies revealed its presence in autotrophic fe ii oxidizing and nitrate reducing enrichment culture shelobolina et al 2012 recently it was reported that gallinionellaceae sp are not necessarily able to perform the complete denitrification process he et al 2016 the presence of other denitrifiers e g achromobacter agilis and denitratisoma oestradiolicum should be required for complete denitrification through cooperative sequential reactions in addition some studies revealed that sideroxydans lithotrophicus grows when treating an arsenic contaminated groundwater with nitrate chakraborty et al 2020 suggesting that this genus is resistant to an arsenic rich environment and may be involved in redox cycling of arsenic too betaproteobacteriales are also involved in redox cycling of arsenic in particular achromobacter spp has been described as autotrophic bacterial capable of arsenite oxidation using oxygen nguyen et al 2017 nitrate su et al 2018 or an electrode as electron acceptor nguyen et al 2016b pous et al 2015a indeed the genetic analyses of the bioanodes revealed a high relative abundance of achromobacter agilis 77 47 thus this microbial community could perform three arsenite oxidation pathways that were previously discussed fig 3c and d however as it was demonstrated that bioelectrochemical arsenite oxidation is not likely to occur please see section 3 2 arsenite oxidation coupled to denitrification is the most probable pathway fig 3b this hypothesis is further supported by the consideration that the usage of a soluble electron acceptor e g nitrate provides more catabolic energy for microbial growth and activity than transferring electron to an insoluble electron acceptor e g electrode korth and harnisch 2019 the arsenite oxidation linked to nitrate reduction could be carried out in both compartments as achromobacter agilis is also present also in the biocathode 2 5 3 4 electrochemical characterization of denitrifying biocathodes by sampling single granules the electrochemical characterisation of granular graphite electrode is challenging due to their high internal resistance some studies analysed the performance of a single granule fixed with a platinum wire borsje et al 2016 caizán juanarena et al 2019 nevertheless it was recently introduced the unique approach of using the e clamp for analysing single granules sampled from a running bioelectrochemical bed electrode rodrigo quejigo et al 2018 thereby single granules were sampled from the top of the cathode compartments and electrochemically analysed with the e clamp see section 2 6 and figure s2 in supplementary data chronoamperometry ca at 0 123 v and cyclic voltammetry cv were performed with granules sampled during the terminal reactor operation days 187 194 hrt of 1 6 0 1 h n 6 buffer solutions without nitrate and arsenite were used in the beginning followed by the subsequent addition of nitrate 33 g n no3 m 1 as well as arsenite 5 g as iii m 1 fig 5 the electrochemical characterization revealed that arsenite concentration of 5 mg l 1 did not inhibit the denitrifying biocathode performance fig 3a during cas the average specific current density was 0 07 0 02 ma g 1 graphite n 6 fig 5a and b show representative results from reactor a and b respectively either exposed to nitrate alone or together with arsenite cvs performed with arsenite are similar to cvs performed only with nitrate fig 5c and d the derived formal potential of the eet related to nitrate reduction was 0 02 0 01 v ph 7 75 0 2 this is close to reported values for denitrifying biocathodes composed predominantly by betaproteobacteriales cultivated in buffered mediums without arsenite for example gregoire et al 2014 and pous et al 2014 observed a formal potential of 0 03 v at ph 7 and 0 10 v at ph 8 respectively the observation of a similar formal potentials for denitrifying biocathodes grown under different poised potentials and with different media suggested a common metabolic trait for this group of electroactive denitrifying bacteria 4 conclusions the present study introduced primary microbial electrochemical technologies for the simultaneous and sustainable treatment of common groundwater pollutants the developed system combined nitrate reduction and arsenite oxidation in a single bioelectrochemical reactor fluid dynamics was identified as an important parameter for denitrification performance and internal recirculation mitigated mass transfer limitations maximum nitrate reduction rate 519 g n no3 m 3 ncc d 1 was achieved at hrt of 2 3 h hrtcat 1 5h and a maximum arsenite oxidation rate of 90 g as iii m 3 nac ncc d 1 was reached until hrt of 1 6h nitrate was completely converted into dinitrogen gas reaching the effluent the standard drinking water quality in terms of nitrate and nitrite concentration nitrates directive 91 767 eu besides the denitrification performance by sideroxydans lithotrophicus es 1 was not affected by arsenite 5 mg l 1 in the medium regarding the oxidation of arsenite several biotic and abiotic oxidation pathways played a role in the bes reactor nevertheless the microbial community developed was capable of arsenic oxidation linked to denitrification in both compartments reaching high efficiencies 95 achromobacter agilis was identified as the candidate for microbial arsenite oxidation coupled to nitrate reduction contrary to expectations the biological arsenic oxidation was not sustained through the anode as a sole electron acceptor furthermore abiotic experiments suggested a catalytic activity of granular graphite for arsenite oxidation through some impurities such as iron from the manufacturing process this research fosters the real application of electro bioremediation technology in terms of groundwater treatment with different pollutants thereby met s capability to denitrify while being unaffected by the presence of arsenite and under low electrical conductivity was proved moreover the feasibility of this technology to oxidize arsenite as a pre treatment for its removal by other methods was also demonstrated

electrochemical technologies mets for treating groundwater contaminated with nitrate no3 while containing arsenic in form of arsenite as iii as a co contaminant the treatment was based on the combination of nitrate reduction to dinitrogen gas and arsenite oxidation to arsenate exhibiting less toxicity solubility and mobility which can be removed more easily in further post treatment we operated a bioelectrochemical reactor at continuous flow mode with synthetic contaminated groundwater 33 mg n no3 l 1 and 5 mg as iii l 1 identifying the key operational conditions different hydraulic retention times hrt were evaluated reaching a maximum nitrate reduction rate of 519 g n no3 m3 net cathodic compartment d 1 at hrt of 2 3 h with a cathodic coulombic efficiency of around 100 simultaneously arsenic oxidation was complete at all hrt tested down to 1 6 h reaching an oxidation rate of up to 90 g as iii m 3 net reactor volume d 1 electrochemical and microbiological characterization of single granules suggested that arsenite at 5 mg l 1 did not have an inhibitory effect on a denitrifying biocathode mainly represented by sideroxydans sp although the coexistence of abiotic and biotic arsenic oxidation pathways was shown to be likely microbial arsenite oxidation linked to denitrification by achromobacter sp was the most probable pathway this research paves the ground towards a real application for treating groundwater with widespread pollutants graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords arsenic denitrification microbial electrochemical technology bioelectrochemical system continuous bioreactor electroactive microorganism 1 introduction groundwater constitutes the largest reservoir of drinking water however the presence of different pollutants compromises its usage european commission 2008 the coexistence of several and different types of contaminants from anthropogenic and geological sources is a common thread that requires the development of sustainable technologies capable of treating these mixtures of pollutants zhang et al 2017 the world health organization who has defined nitrate and arsenic as hazardous inorganic contaminants in groundwater who 2017 nitrate is one of the most widespread pollutants in groundwater due to intensive agriculture and has become a worldwide concern for human health and safety the nitrates directive 91 767 eu sets a nitrate concentration limit of 11 3 mg n no3 l 1 in drinking water conventional nitrate polluted groundwater treatments are usually based on separation technologies besides being effective these technologies are energy intensive 1 03 2 56 kwh m treated 3 and produce waste brines demanding additional post treatment twomey et al 2010 other conventional treatments are based on biological denitrification by a sequential reduction of nitrate to dinitrogen gas n2 through four reduction steps table 1 although biological treatments hold environmental and economic advantages electron donors are limited in groundwater and a continuous supply of chemicals such as acetate or hydrogen gas is required electro bioremediation is a primary microbial electrochemical technology met and emerges as a sustainable alternative for groundwater treatment pous et al 2018 met is based on bioelectrochemical systems bes harnessing the capacity of electroactive microorganisms to perform oxidation and reduction reactions with solid electron conductors e g electrodes thereby these electroactive microorganisms are able to use the anode and the cathode as an inexhaustible electron acceptor or donor respectively logan et al 2019 when nitrate is the target pollutant autotrophic denitrification can be performed using only the cathode as electron donor and inorganic carbon as carbon source clauwaert et al 2007 so far denitrification by met have been widely studied ranging from a first proof of concept gregory et al 2004 to investigations on the underlying mechanism to technological applications clauwaert et al 2009 virdis et al 2008 few studies showed nitrate treatment in combination with other contaminants performed by met to identify potential electron donor acceptor competitors or inhibitory effects the literature has been mostly focused on organic compounds and sulfate lai et al 2015 nguyen et al 2016a arsenic contamination of groundwater in many cases occurs naturally due to reductive dissolution of arsenic rich minerals the world health organization who has established a temporal guideline value of 10 µg l 1 as a permissive limit for drinking water who 2017 the predominant oxidation states of inorganic arsenic are arsenite as iii and arsenate as v in reducing conditions arsenic is mostly found as arsenite which is the most toxic soluble and mobile form in line with this the groundwater redox potential has an essential role in the arsenic contaminated groundwater in general it has been observed that the reductive arsenic dissolution can be low in nitrate contaminated groundwater hosono et al 2011 however arsenic and nitrate do co exist in groundwaters that present a high content of bicarbonate piqué et al 2010 due to punctual arsenic dissolution related to drought periods ventura houle et al 2018 or punctual industrial dumpings leakages e g some industrial activities that include the use of insecticides pesticides and wood preservatives jang et al 2016 arsenic removal in water treatment is traditionally carried out by arsenite oxidation to arsenate table 1 as a preliminary step to decrease the arsenic solubility followed by precipitation using metal salts borho and wilderer 1996 adsorption based removal methods i e granulated ferric hydroxide are more effective also with arsenate banerjee et al 2008 arsenite oxidation to arsenate is conventionally performed by chemical oxidation by ozone iron and manganese oxide or photochemical oxidation bissen and frimmel 2003 standard redox potential shown in table 1 however these oxidation methods have low selectivity resulting in toxic by products generation such as nitroaromatic compounds ji et al 2017 besides chemical treatments are characterized by constant chemical consumption and the possible use of catalysts resulting in a high operational cost wang and zhao 2009 recently an environmentally friendly process for arsenite oxidation using microorganisms as sustainable catalysts is attracting interest in environments lacking organic matter e g groundwater autotrophic bacteria can be applied to oxidise arsenite using external oxygen or nitrate as electron acceptor crognale et al 2017 wang et al 2017 for instance arsenite can be linked to denitrification by some microorganisms nevertheless arsenite can inhibit chemolithotrophic denitrification in a wide range of concentrations in adapted microbial communities inhibition was found in the range of 150 to 375 mg as iii l 1 sun et al 2009 2008 recent studies indicated that mets represent a novel and suitable approach to arsenite oxidation to arsenate li et al 2016 nguyen et al 2016b 2017 pous et al 2015a the present study proposes a bioelectrochemical system to treat nitrate contaminated groundwater that contains arsenic as a co contaminant arsenic was included in form of arsenite over arsenate due to its higher toxicity and mobility the main goal is the exploration whether nitrate can be successfully converted into dinitrogen gas having arsenic in the same water while pursuing arsenite oxidation at the same time so far one preliminary study demonstrated the combined electrochemical treatment of arsenic and nitrate in a single reactor nguyen et al 2016b coupled anodic arsenite oxidation and cathodic denitrification in a compartmentalized system where enriched arsenic and nitrate solutions were separately fed to the anodic and cathodic compartment respectively the present study explores the presence of both pollutants in the same water matrix a novel continuous flow met was developed and operated for simultaneous nitrate removal and arsenite oxidation thereby the operational conditions e g recirculation and hydraulic retention time were adapted for treating groundwater furthermore the effects of arsenite on denitrifying biocathode performance were investigated and arsenite oxidation pathways were elucidated 2 materials and methods 2 1 reactor setup two identical tubular bes reactors were assembled and operated as replicates reactor a and b fig 1 schematically presents the reactor configuration used in this study the anode and cathode were separated by a tubular cation exchange membrane with an internal diameter of 45 mm cem cmi 7000 membranes int usa the structure was built with pvc tube diameter of 55 mm and length of 350 mm the cathode inner part and anode outer part compartments were filled with granular graphite diameter 1 5 5 mm enviro cell germany previously washed with 1 m hcl and 1 m naoh and graphite rods 8 400 mm and 4 2500 mm for cathode and anode compartment respectively mersen ibérica spain were used as current collectors assuming that each chamber was filled with spherical particles average diameter of 3 25 mm with a fixed bed porosity of 50 electrode surfaces of 0 51 m2 and 0 29 m2 were calculated for the cathode and anode compartment respectively the net liquid volumes of cathode ncc and anode nac compartment were 0 3 l and 0 15 l respectively the reactors were equipped with an ag agcl sat kcl reference electrode 0 197 v vs standard hydrogen electrode she se 11 xylem analytics germany sales gmbh co kg sensortechnik meinsberg germany resulting in a three electrode setup the cathode potential was poised at 0 123 v vs she using a potentiostat vsp biologic france to drive complete nitrate reduction to dinitrogen gas according with previous knowledge pous et al 2015b if not stated otherwise all redox potentials are provided in respect of she the cathode and the anode were hydraulically connected the influent was directly pumped upwards through the cathode compartment and spilled over at its top to the anode compartment subsequently it circulated from the top to the bottom of the anode compartment where the outlet was located in certain operational periods a fraction of the effluent was recirculated to the influent to increase internal flow fig 1 the recirculation increased the fluid velocity in the cathode compartment from 1 10 5 m s 1 without recirculation to 4 10 4 and 9 10 4 m s 1 with recirculation flow rate of 35 l d 1 and 85 l d 1 respectively the increase of the internal fluid velocity reinforced the mass transfer of substrate as well as counter ions from the bulk liquid to inner biofilm layers additional benefits were the decrease of possible dead zones and increase homogeneity inside the reactor 2 2 reactor inoculation the anode and cathode compartments were simultaneously inoculated for 30 days before the continuous operation a solution was prepared containing 79 of synthetic groundwater 20 of effluent from a denitrifying bes reactor pous et al 2017 and 1 of an enriched autotrophic arsenite oxidizing culture this solution was used to fill both reactors and an external 1 l tank the influent and the effluent of the reactors were connected to the 1 l tank and a peristaltic pump was used to continuously recirculate the solution at a flow rate of 35 l d 1 i e closed loop mode when nitrate and arsenite were depleted i e concentrations of both compounds were below 1 mg l 1 the medium of the 1 l tank was replaced with a fresh solution the cathode potential was poised at 0 123 v to promote growth of denitrifying bacteria autotrophic arsenite oxidizing culture was obtained from arsenic contaminated sites in the province of girona spain samples were collected from surface and contaminated groundwater seven samples each sample 25 ml was added to 125 ml of mineral medium without any organic carbon source with a final concentration of 15 mg as iii l 1 following the same methodology as described in pous et al 2015a each sample was incubated aerobically by constant aeration at room temperature 20 2 c and with constant agitation 200 rpm after 50 days the enriched microorganisms were sub cultured in a fresh mineral medium in a dilution of 1 all sub cultured enrichments showed a mean arsenite oxidation rate of 0 4 0 2 g as iii m 3 d 1 without any observable differentiation between the enrichments these sub cultured enrichments were blended resulting in the enriched autotrophic arsenite oxidizing culture used for inoculation of reactors a and b 2 3 reactor continuous operation after the inoculation period the reactors were operated in continuous flow mode at 1 4 l d 1 hydraulic retention time hrt of 7 5 h without recirculation flow using synthetic groundwater after 25 days the reactors were operated applying a recirculation flow of 35 l d 1 to reinforce the substrate distribution and promote mass transfer following these operating conditions the hrt was progressively decreased from 7 5 to 1 6 h two recirculation flow rates were tested i from hrt of 7 5 to 4 4 h with a recirculation flow rate of 35 l d 1 and ii from hrt of 5 0 to 1 6 h with a recirculation flow rate of 85 l d 1 an overview of all tests is listed in table s1 supplementary data each condition had a minimum duration of 7 days 2 4 synthetic groundwater synthetic medium mimicking nitrate and arsenic contaminated groundwater was used to feed the reactors the synthetic groundwater was prepared considering the main characteristics of groundwater from navata village girona spain 28 6 mg n no3 l 1 1 0 0 1 ms cm 1 and ph of 8 0 0 2 pous et al 2013 the arsenic in groundwater is typically in the concentration range of some µg l 1 van halem et al 2009 at the sample site of navata spain the arsenic concentration was below 10 µg l 1 nevertheless the arsenite concentration was adjusted to high concentration of 5 mg as iii l 1 to test the potential of the system under more severe conditions the synthetic groundwater was prepared with distillate water and contained 203 9 mg l 1 nano3 33 mg n no3 l 1 8 7 mg l 1 asnao2 5 mg as iii l 1 420 0 mg l 1 nahco3 as inorganic carbon source 7 5 mg l 1 kh2po4 1 9 mg l 1 na2hpo4 100 0 mg l 1 nacl 75 2 mg l 1 mgso4 7h2o 10 0 mg l 1 nh4cl and 0 1 ml l 1 of a trace minerals solution balch et al 1979 in addition the influent contained 10 of effluent from a denitrifying bes reactor pous et al 2017 during all operational periods to simulate the presence of microorganisms in the groundwater this effluent with a od600 of 0 05 was composed by proteobacteria phylum 78 being acidithiobacillus sp as the most abundant genus the electric conductivity of the synthetic groundwater was 1 3 0 2 ms cm 1 and the initial ph was 8 1 0 2 for simulating groundwater from navata girona spain 2 5 abiotic arsenite oxidation tests a series of abiotic tests were performed to determine chemical using nitrate and oxygen and electrochemical arsenite oxidation in addition the putative role of granular graphite as catalyst for arsenite oxidation and its arsenic sorption capacity were also investigated all abiotic tests are shown in table 2 and experiment set ups are shown in supplementary data figure s1 each test was performed in duplicates for 24 h in batch mode using 100 ml flasks with 75 ml of synthetic groundwater as described above anoxic with nitrate and aerobic tests were performed in the absence and presence of granular graphite in addition an aerobic test was also performed in presence of pvc granules as non conductive material the corresponding tests used 50 ml of granular graphite or of pvc granules both materials with an average diameter of 3 5 mm and estimated surface of 0 05 m2 anoxic conditions were established by flushing the medium with n2 during 10 minutes before each test the tests under aerobic conditions were carried out under continuous aeration using a domestic aquarium air pump finally the electrochemical arsenite oxidation was studied with a granular graphite bed poised at 1 15 v by a potentiostat nav 3 2 nanoelectra spain in the electrochemical test a single chamber configuration was used with a three electrode setup using two graphite rods diameter 6 mm mersen ibéria spain serving as current collector for the granular graphite bed working electrode and as counter electrode and a ag agcl sat kcl electrode as reference electrode 2 6 electrochemical characterization of isolated granules the granular graphite from both bes reactors was further characterized using electrochemical measurements the present study uses an improved version of the e clamp firstly introduced by rodrigo quejigo et al 2018 the improved e clamp consists of four spring steel wires 1 4310 febrotec gmbh germany forming a gripper that is encased by a peek tube figure s2 supplementary data the e clamp can be mechanically moved the electrochemical experiments were conducted in a four neck round bottom flask lenz laborglas gmbh co kg germany with an integrated three electrode setup with a graphite rod as counter electrode 10 50 mm mersen ibéria spain and with an ag agcl sat kcl as reference electrode thereby the working electrode was the e clamp holding three granules per test with an average wet weight of 0 31 0 01 g directly measured after each test the sampled granules for electrochemical measurements were taken in triplicates during operation at hrt of 1 6 0 1 h days 187 194 from i the top of the cathode compartment of both reactors and ii the bottom of the anode compartment of reactor b abiotic controls were performed using non inoculated granular graphite the experiments were carried out at room temperature 23 2 c with constant agitation magnetic stirring 150 rpm and with continuous flushing of n2 to ensure anoxic conditions directly after sampling granules were immersed in synthetic groundwater medium without nitrate nor arsenite buffer non turnover conditions and chronoamperometry ca was performed with the working electrode poised at 0 12 or 0 50 v for the cathodic and anodic pous et al 2015a granules respectively when current density reached a stable value cyclic voltammetry cv was conducted in a potential range from 0 60 to 0 20 and 0 20 to 1 00 v for the cathodic and anodic granules respectively three cycles were performed at scan rate of 1 mv s 1 the third cycle was used for data analysis by soas fourmond et al 2009 after cv the ca was switched to turnover conditions thereby cathodic granules were tested by sequential addition of nitrate 33 mg n no3 l 1 and arsenite 5 mg as iii l 1 to the same medium anodic granules were tested under turnover conditions by addition of arsenite to the medium 5 mg as iii l 1 2 7 analytical methods and calculations samples of effluent and influent were taken and analysed from both reactors three times per week resulting in a minimum of three analytical measurements for each condition all liquid samples were analysed according to apha standard water measurements apha 2005 for nitrate n no3 nitrite n no2 and arsenate as v by ionic chromatography ics 5000 dionex usa total arsenic was analysed by adding an oxidizing agent 100 mm kmno₄ to fully oxidize all arsenic forms into arsenate arsenite concentration was calculated as the difference between total arsenic and arsenate three measurements of arsenic forms to the arsenic balance were obtained total arsenic arsenite and arsenate the ph and electrical conductivity of the samples were measured with a ph meter ph meter basic 20 crison spain and a conductivity meter ec meter basic 30 crison spain respectively nitrous oxide n2o was measured once per week using a n2o liquid phase microsensor unisense denmark located in the effluent of the reactors the hydraulic retention time was calculated considering the net cathodic volume hrtcat and whole net reactor volume hrt for denitrification and arsenite oxidation respectively in order to analyse the performance of each condition in continuous operation nitrate reduction rno3 and arsenite oxidation ras iii rates were calculated eq s1 and s4 supplementary data the coulombic efficiency of denitrifying biocathode cecat was calculated as proposed pous et al 2017 it was calculated considering all reduction steps from nitrate to dinitrogen gas considering nitrite and nitrous oxide accumulation eq s6 supplementary data for the arsenite oxidation at the bioanode anodic columbic efficiency cean were calculated considering the oxidation from arsenite to arsenate eq s8 supplementary data 2 8 microbiological analysis granular graphite was sampled for dna extraction two times from the upper part of the anode and cathode compartment of running reactors at hrt of 2 8 and 2 3 h day 145 and 180 dna was extracted as described previously in vilajeliu pons et al 2016 the obtained dna was quantified using a nanodrop nd 1000 spectrophotometer nanodrop technologies inc wilmington usa and stored at 20 c illumina miseq flow cell v2 sequencing was conducted by the rtsf core facilities at the michigan state university usa https rtsf atsci msu edu the primers 515f and 806r were used for the amplification of the v4 region of 16s rdna according to the method described by kozich et al 2013 sequence data from the miseq platform were quality filtered trimmed dereplicated merged and after a process of chimera removal were clustered into amplicon sequence variants asvs using the dada2 pipeline callahan et al 2016 afterwards asvs tabulation and taxonomy assignment were performed using the silva taxonomic database v132 finally the phyloseq package was used to tabulate relative abundances at various taxonomic levels mcmurdie and holmes 2013 all analyses were performed with r v 3 6 3 using packages dada2 v 1 14 1 and phyloseq v 1 30 0 representative sequences for each amplicon sequence variant asvs were assigned taxonomically using blast searches at ncbi 3 results and discussion 3 1 denitrification and arsenite oxidation performance in mets both reactors were operated as replicates in continuous flow mode after the inoculation period the cathode potential was controlled at 0 123 v to promote denitrifying biocathodes pous et al 2015b while arsenite oxidation was expected to occur in the anode compartment fig 2 a and b show the nitrate and arsenite loading and reduction rates the continuous operation started with hrt of 7 5 0 3 h hrtcat of 5 0 0 3 h without recirculation after 13 days the reactor reached a steady state performance with a nitrate reduction rate rno3 of 24 10 g n no3 m 3 ncc d 1 nitrate removal of 15 5 although nitrate was removed at a low rate it was completely reduced to dinitrogen gas with low nitrite accumulation 3 4 3 0 of nitrogen removed and no nitrous oxide emissions were detected table s1 supplementary data hence about 95 of the nitrate was reduced into dinitrogen gas the low denitrification rate compared to previous studies 849 g n no3 mncc 3 d 1 pous et al 2017 could be mainly explained by mass transfer limitations the low fluid velocity in the cathode compartment during the operation 1 10 5 m s 1 resulted in a limited mass transfer restricting catalytic rates moreover the low mass transfer also affects the transfer of charge balancing ions mainly sodium but also protons outwards the electroactive biofilm inhibiting electrochemical reactions puig et al 2012 to reduce limitations and to enhance denitrification performance the fluid dynamics of the reactors was improved by including a recirculation a recirculation flow of 35 l d 1 25 fold more compared to the influent at the same hrtcat of 5 h resulted in an improved rno3 of 166 22 g n no3 m 3 ncc d 1 representing a 7 fold increase compared to previous operation without recirculation thereby nitrate removal increased to 99 1 in both reactors without accumulation of neither nitrite nor nitrous oxide recirculation reduced the ph in the cathode compartment from 9 0 0 2 to 8 0 0 3 due to an improved transport of protons between both compartments thus the denitrifying performance was enhanced as the ph was closer to the optimal ph of 7 clauwaert et al 2009 glass and silverstein 1998 wang et al 2018 subsequently hrtcat was continuously decreased to increase the nitrate loading rate while maintaining the recirculation flow at 35 l d 1 fig 2a the nitrate reduction rate increased in both reactors until the hrtcat was reduced to 3 6 0 2 h resulting in a nitrate reduction rate of 247 22 g n no3 m 3 ncc d 1 99 1 nitrate removal however the nitrate removal decreased to 54 10 at a lower hrtcat of 3 0 0 2 h therefore the recirculation was increased from 35 to 85 l d 1 to overcome the above mentioned denitrification limitations as result at hrtcat of 3 0 0 2 h the denitrification performance was recovered in both reactors reaching nitrate removal of 91 10 the hrtcat was further decreased to 1 5 0 1 h to explore the maximum nitrate removal rate resulting in rno3 of 519 53 g n no3 m 3 ncc d 1 90 6 of nitrate removed and 456 61 g n no3 m 3 ncc d 1 71 13 of nitrate removed of reactors a and b respectively at this condition the effluent from both reactors achieved the quality standards for drinking water regarding nitrate and nitrite concentration 11 mg n no3 l 1 and 0 15 mg n no2 l 1 table s1 in supplementary data according to nitrates directive 91 767 eu moreover no nitrite accumulation was observed and the emitted nitrous oxide only represented 3 5 2 0 of removed nitrate in consequence it can be considered that about 95 of removed nitrate was converted into dinitrogen gas besides working at relatively high ph around 8 0 at both influent and effluent could imply the accumulation of denitrification intermediates glass and silverstein 1998 molognoni et al 2017 such accumulation was not detected in our study further decreasing hrtcat to 1 1 0 1 h resulted in lower nitrate reduction rates of 444 90 g n no3 m 3 ncc d 1 in both reactors thereby the nitrate removal decreased to 51 11 arsenite oxidation to arsenate was stable in both reactors during the whole experimental period reaching arsenite concentrations below the analytical quantification limit 0 1 mg as iii l 1 the maximum arsenite oxidation rate ras iii was 92 5 g as iii m 3 nac ncc d 1 at hrt of 1 6 0 1 h well above the maximum reported volumetric arsenite oxidation rate in mets 30 g as iii m 3 d 1 nguyen et al 2016b however considerably higher biological arsenite oxidation rates are reported using nitrate as the electron acceptor e g 1000 mg as iii l 1 d 1 in continuous granular sludge reactors sun et al 2009 nevertheless the observed trend of ras iii during the tested hrts fig 2b suggests that the maximum oxidation rate was not reached under the applied experimental conditions and lower hrt would probably lead to higher ras iii the effluent ph was at the upper limit for biological arsenite oxidation according to previous studies optimum ph between 6 and 8 bachate et al 2012 arsenic concentrations were stable at 6 4 1 1 mg l 1 in the influent effluent no decrease of total arsenic was observed during the 194 days of reactor operation suggesting negligible arsenic adsorption precipitation inside the bes reactor the cecat based on the electron balance for reduction of nitrate to dinitrogen gas reached values close to 100 in both reactors table s1 supplementary data it suggested that secondary reactions e g oxygen reduction or arsenate reduction were not significantly occurring at the cathode arsenic stabilized in form of arsenate less mobile easy to adsorb form over the reactor operation in spite of the reductive environment of the cathode in the range of the measured anode potentials 0 56 0 13 to 1 87 0 33 v supplementary data figure s3 biological arsenite oxidation has been reported pous et al 2015a however if it is considered that arsenite oxidation to arsenate was the main anode reaction a cean of 2 0 0 7 is obtained thus secondary reactions such as graphite lai et al 2017 and water oxidation were required to provide the electrons for the denitrifying biocathode the arsenite oxidation pathways in the reactors were further investigated in the following section 3 2 arsenite oxidation pathways due to the coexistence of different terminal electrons acceptors in these bes reactors arsenite oxidation could proceed via different pathways fig 3 b f i the anode ii nitrate and iii oxygen formed by water oxidation at the anode for this reason abiotic and biotic tests were performed with the three possible acceptors in the absence and presence of graphite granules to elucidate the predominant pathways table 2 summarizes the results of abiotic 24 h tests in batch mode oxygen has been reported as an oxidant capable of arsenite oxidation at a low rate bissen and frimmel 2003 no oxidation was detected under constant aeration without granular graphite during 24 h due to low oxygen dissolution from the air bubbles to the liquid phase when a pvc granules bed was added to the setup littler air bubbles could be formed improving oxygen diffusion this slightly increased the maximum arsenite oxidation rate to 0 2 0 1 mg as iii l 1 d 1 oxidation of 5 2 however maximum arsenite oxidation rate was improved by 10 fold in presence of granular graphite under aerobic condition ras iii of 2 1 0 5 g m 3 d 1 45 7 in addition polarizing granular graphite at 1 15 v potential in the range of anode potentials during reactors operation yielded an even higher oxidation rate 4 0 0 1 g m 3 d 1 75 5 at this condition arsenite could be directly oxidized by the anode eo 0 02 v at ph 7 table 1 or via oxygen that can be formed by water oxidation eo 0 81 v at ph 7 the considerably improved arsenite oxidation rate in the presence of granular graphite compared to a non conductive material pvc suggested a catalytic role of granular graphite furthermore no variation of total arsenic 1 was measured during the abiotic tests this supports the results observed in the bioreactors section 3 1 suggesting that arsenic adsorption precipitation was negligible to our knowledge it is not reported in literature that pure carbon materials e g pure graphite have catalytic properties for the arsenite oxidation however granular graphite from its production process can contain some impurities that could possess a catalytic role elemental analysis of granular graphite revealed the presence of iron at a concentration of 5 7 0 2 mg fe kggraphite 1 table s2 supplementary data for example some studies report that carbon materials supplemented with iron can oxidize and absorb arsenite chen et al 2007 furthermore electrochemical analysis of abiotic granular graphite with the e clamp fig 4 a and c showed an oxidative peak at 0 55 v in cvs in the absence and in the presence of arsenite non turnover and turnover condition respectively this further indicates that redox active compounds were present in granular graphite e g iron or quinones further the current density increased in abiotic cv at turnover condition at a voltage between of 0 55 to 1 00 v compared to cv at non turnover condition fig 4a and c suggesting the electrochemical arsenite oxidation using granular graphite fig 3e the arsenite oxidation rate observed in the electrochemical abiotic test using the anode as electron acceptor 6 5 0 1 mgas iii manode 2 d 1 and the abiotic test in the presence of oxygen 3 4 0 2 mg as iii manode 2 d 1 can only explain the observed arsenite oxidation rate in the bes 142 7 7 mgas iii manode 2 d 1 at lower hrt of 1 6h to a minor extent 10 the role of biological arsenite oxidation independent of electrochemical pathways was analysed by operating reactor a under open circuit voltage ocv conditions at hrt of 2 9 0 1 h under these conditions complete arsenite oxidation was observed 95 with a ras iii of 91 5 1 5 mgas iii manode 2 d 1 59 1 g as iii m 3 nac ncc d 1 fig 2b this suggested the capacity of the microbial community to oxidize arsenite without current supply during ocv the denitrification rate was 43 12 g n no3 m 3 ncc d 1 7 2 of nitrate removed and the conversion was virtually complete to n2 table s1 supplementary data in this period the observed molar ratio between arsenite oxidation and nitrate reduction was 0 4 0 1 as n this is in a good concordance with the theoretical molar ratio of 0 4 as n considering the electrons provided by as iii oxidation to as v and the electrons required for no3 reduction to n2 therefore the possibility of arsenite oxidation linked to denitrification in the reactor is proved fig 3b and is substantially contributing to the overall arsenite oxidation however it cannot be fully excluded that also aerobic arsenite oxidation fig 3d occurred in the reactors due to accumulation of oxygen formed by water oxidation prior to ocv or by air intrusions additional electrochemical analysis of granular graphite sampled from the anodic compartment of reactor b was performed to reveal if bioelectrochemical arsenite oxidation also played a role in the inoculated reactor however there are no remarkable differences between turnover and non turnover cvs of inoculated graphite granules indicating that bioelectrochemical arsenite oxidation is of minor importance under the tested experimental conditions fig 4b and d taking all results together the both abiotic and biotic arsenite oxidation pathways in the studied mets was demonstrated thereby arsenite oxidation was mainly performed by microorganisms using nitrate electron acceptors fig 3b associating the denitrification with arsenite oxidation nevertheless electrochemical oxidation fig 3e and abiotic oxidation with oxygen catalysed by granular graphite fig 3f was also demonstrated with a minor influence on total arsenite oxidation 3 3 microbial community the microbiological communities of the reactors a and b were analysed through dna extraction of granular graphite of both compartments at hrt of 2 8 and 2 3 h day 145 and 180 the analysis was performed at genus level of most abundant asvs by blastn searches table 3 the biocathode inhabited a complex microbial community predominantly composed of proteobacteria 81 89 in reactor a and b respectively betaproteobacteriales accounted for up to 68 84 of all sequences the taxon is characterized to contain bacterial species with a broad range of metabolic capabilities including redox transformation of metals e g iron and arsenic and denitrification chakraborty et al 2020 he et al 2016 this class of bacteria are widely found in bioelectrochemical denitrifying reactors pous et al 2015b at genus level both reactors were clearly dominated by sideroxydans 80 54 denitratisoma 4 5 and achromobacter 2 5 sideroxydans lithotrophicus es 1 is included in the gallionellaceae family and is reported as fe ii oxidizing chemoautotrophic bacteria some studies revealed its presence in autotrophic fe ii oxidizing and nitrate reducing enrichment culture shelobolina et al 2012 recently it was reported that gallinionellaceae sp are not necessarily able to perform the complete denitrification process he et al 2016 the presence of other denitrifiers e g achromobacter agilis and denitratisoma oestradiolicum should be required for complete denitrification through cooperative sequential reactions in addition some studies revealed that sideroxydans lithotrophicus grows when treating an arsenic contaminated groundwater with nitrate chakraborty et al 2020 suggesting that this genus is resistant to an arsenic rich environment and may be involved in redox cycling of arsenic too betaproteobacteriales are also involved in redox cycling of arsenic in particular achromobacter spp has been described as autotrophic bacterial capable of arsenite oxidation using oxygen nguyen et al 2017 nitrate su et al 2018 or an electrode as electron acceptor nguyen et al 2016b pous et al 2015a indeed the genetic analyses of the bioanodes revealed a high relative abundance of achromobacter agilis 77 47 thus this microbial community could perform three arsenite oxidation pathways that were previously discussed fig 3c and d however as it was demonstrated that bioelectrochemical arsenite oxidation is not likely to occur please see section 3 2 arsenite oxidation coupled to denitrification is the most probable pathway fig 3b this hypothesis is further supported by the consideration that the usage of a soluble electron acceptor e g nitrate provides more catabolic energy for microbial growth and activity than transferring electron to an insoluble electron acceptor e g electrode korth and harnisch 2019 the arsenite oxidation linked to nitrate reduction could be carried out in both compartments as achromobacter agilis is also present also in the biocathode 2 5 3 4 electrochemical characterization of denitrifying biocathodes by sampling single granules the electrochemical characterisation of granular graphite electrode is challenging due to their high internal resistance some studies analysed the performance of a single granule fixed with a platinum wire borsje et al 2016 caizán juanarena et al 2019 nevertheless it was recently introduced the unique approach of using the e clamp for analysing single granules sampled from a running bioelectrochemical bed electrode rodrigo quejigo et al 2018 thereby single granules were sampled from the top of the cathode compartments and electrochemically analysed with the e clamp see section 2 6 and figure s2 in supplementary data chronoamperometry ca at 0 123 v and cyclic voltammetry cv were performed with granules sampled during the terminal reactor operation days 187 194 hrt of 1 6 0 1 h n 6 buffer solutions without nitrate and arsenite were used in the beginning followed by the subsequent addition of nitrate 33 g n no3 m 1 as well as arsenite 5 g as iii m 1 fig 5 the electrochemical characterization revealed that arsenite concentration of 5 mg l 1 did not inhibit the denitrifying biocathode performance fig 3a during cas the average specific current density was 0 07 0 02 ma g 1 graphite n 6 fig 5a and b show representative results from reactor a and b respectively either exposed to nitrate alone or together with arsenite cvs performed with arsenite are similar to cvs performed only with nitrate fig 5c and d the derived formal potential of the eet related to nitrate reduction was 0 02 0 01 v ph 7 75 0 2 this is close to reported values for denitrifying biocathodes composed predominantly by betaproteobacteriales cultivated in buffered mediums without arsenite for example gregoire et al 2014 and pous et al 2014 observed a formal potential of 0 03 v at ph 7 and 0 10 v at ph 8 respectively the observation of a similar formal potentials for denitrifying biocathodes grown under different poised potentials and with different media suggested a common metabolic trait for this group of electroactive denitrifying bacteria 4 conclusions the present study introduced primary microbial electrochemical technologies for the simultaneous and sustainable treatment of common groundwater pollutants the developed system combined nitrate reduction and arsenite oxidation in a single bioelectrochemical reactor fluid dynamics was identified as an important parameter for denitrification performance and internal recirculation mitigated mass transfer limitations maximum nitrate reduction rate 519 g n no3 m 3 ncc d 1 was achieved at hrt of 2 3 h hrtcat 1 5h and a maximum arsenite oxidation rate of 90 g as iii m 3 nac ncc d 1 was reached until hrt of 1 6h nitrate was completely converted into dinitrogen gas reaching the effluent the standard drinking water quality in terms of nitrate and nitrite concentration nitrates directive 91 767 eu besides the denitrification performance by sideroxydans lithotrophicus es 1 was not affected by arsenite 5 mg l 1 in the medium regarding the oxidation of arsenite several biotic and abiotic oxidation pathways played a role in the bes reactor nevertheless the microbial community developed was capable of arsenic oxidation linked to denitrification in both compartments reaching high efficiencies 95 achromobacter agilis was identified as the candidate for microbial arsenite oxidation coupled to nitrate reduction contrary to expectations the biological arsenic oxidation was not sustained through the anode as a sole electron acceptor furthermore abiotic experiments suggested a catalytic activity of granular graphite for arsenite oxidation through some impurities such as iron from the manufacturing process this research fosters the real application of electro bioremediation technology in terms of groundwater treatment with different pollutants thereby met s capability to denitrify while being unaffected by the presence of arsenite and under low electrical conductivity was proved moreover the feasibility of this technology to oxidize arsenite as a pre treatment for its removal by other methods was also demonstrated

17293,monitoring the removal of organic micropollutants omps in advanced wastewater treatment facilities requires expensive and time consuming analytical methods that cannot be installed online spectroscopic techniques such as fluorescence excitation emission spectroscopy were demonstrated to offer the potential for monitoring omps removal in conventional wastewater treatment plants or ozonation pilots but their application to activated carbon ac adsorption processes was only investigated at lab scale and not in real treatment facilities in this study indexes from fluorescence emission excitation matrices eems were used to find correlations with the removal of 28 omps from a large scale ac pilot in fluidized bed employed for wastewater advanced treatment as well as from batch experiments differences in omps removal could be observed depending on the operational conditions i e pilot or batch experiments contact time type of ac and the physico chemical properties of the molecules 7 parafac components were derived from the fluorescence eems of 60 samples obtained before and after adsorption positive correlations were obtained between the removal of fluorescence indexes and most omps and correlation coefficients were much higher than the ones obtained with uv254 confirming the interesting potential of fluorescence spectroscopy to accurately monitor adsorption performances at the industrial scale the highest correlation coefficients were obtained for omps having the best removals while the ones that were refractory to adsorption as well as to interactions with dom exhibited weak correlations these results suggest that interactions between omps and fluorescing dom and their subsequent co adsorption onto ac were at the origin of the correlations found lower correlations were also found for the most biodegradable omps which indicated that the occurrence of biological effects could make the monitoring of these compounds more challenging graphical

membrane separation snyder et al 2007 and activated carbon ac adsorption benstoem et al 2017 margot et al 2013 the efficiency of a given technology is generally assessed by the determination of omps

study of dissolved organic matter dom in wastewater treatment plants wwtp carstea et al 2016 goffin et al 2018 different methods have been developed to interpret data from fluorescence excitation emission matrix eem spectroscopy and to track dom changes in terms of quality and quantity in aquatic ecosystems and water treatment facilities chen et al 2003 coble 1996 parlanti et al 2000 efforts have been made to monitor various families of omps by using the direct fluorescence signal of organic molecules e g polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons pesticides pharmaceuticals volatile organic compounds carstea et al 2016 ferretto et al 2014 but the high concentrations of bulk dom in wastewater hinders the direct detection of trace levels of omps wasswa et al 2019 eems can nevertheless be used as surrogates for the prediction of omps removal for example during primary and secondary wastewater treatment sgroi et al 2017 because omps and dom undergo common elimination mechanisms in this context the removal of specific components related to aromatic proteins and tyrosine like substances was successfully correlated with the elimination of easily removed omps while another component related to humic like substances was correlated with some moderately removed omps both uv absorbance at 254 nm uv254 and fluorescence eem spectroscopy have been used for over ten years as surrogate parameters to monitor omps removal during ozonation of wastewater effluents chys et al 2017 gerrity et al 2012 nanaboina and korshin 2010 park et al 2017 spectroscopic methods were also applied for the monitoring of omp removals by ac adsorption satisfactory linear correlations were obtained between the removal of uv254 and the removal of specific omps or the average removal of several omps and for different types of ac powdered pac micro grain µgac and granular activated carbon gac sgroi et al 2018 zietzschmann et al 2014a zietzschmann et al 2016 compared to uv254 better correlations were obtained using total fluorescence tf calculated as the total volume integrated under an eem for the removal of 13 omps by gac filtration using rapid small scale columns anumol et al 2015 because of its higher sensitivity and selectivity ziska et al 2016 also successfully developed surrogate models for the removal of 14 omps with pac in batch reactors using power functions based on uv254 or tf again showing better sensitivity of tf this was attributed to the greater affinity of fluorophores for ac than uv absorbing matter recently sgroi et al 2018 used parafac analysis to study the breakthrough of dom through gac rapid small scale columns both uv254 and parafac fluorescence components were successful in predicting the breakthrough of 11 omps a better sensitivity was observed with fluorescence indicators parafac components than with uv254 to our knowledge no study reported the use of fluorescence indexes to predict omps removal by ac processes at the industrial scale apart from the study of sgroi et al 2018 only uv254 and tf were employed in models to predict omps behavior and no other eem data processing methods were used e g fluorescence regional integration peak picking or parafac analysis moreover the physico chemical mechanisms and potential biological effects underlying the correlations between the removal of omps and spectroscopic indexes are not known and are often overlooked in the literature the aim of this study was to find correlations between the removal of fluorescence eem indexes and omps from wastewater effluents by adsorption onto ac at the industrial scale and to show that 3d fluorescence is a promising tool for the monitoring of omps especially since online applications of fluorescence spectroscopy are being developed data were gathered both from a pilot used for wastewater advanced treatment with µgac at the industrial scale and from batch experiments using pac experimental conditions covered a range of various conditions to obtain statistically significant variations of omps removal 28 omps exhibiting a wide range of physico chemical properties were targeted based on their occurrence in the wastewater effluent correlation coefficients between each omp and each fluorescence index were explored and discussed by considering the various effects of interactions between dom and omps and their implication on the adsorption processes and the monitoring of omps the occurrence of biological processes in adsorption based treatments has been reported but their contribution to the elimination of omps is difficult to estimate especially at the industrial scale piai et al 2019 zietzschmann et al 2019 the potential influence of biodegradation on the correlations was thus also investigated finally the perspective of building models for the prediction of omps elimination was discussed 2 materials and methods 2 1 ac pilot tests the ac industrial pilot carboplus saur figure s1 in supplementary information was based on a 1000 kg bed of micro grain ac being continuously renewed by equivalent addition daily and extraction weekly guillossou et al 2019 mailler et al 2016a a dose of 10 g of fresh ac per m3 of wastewater effluent was applied daily corresponding to 8 6 kg of ac per day for a flow rate of 860 m3 day once a week after washing the filter to remove the retained suspended solids 60 kg of ac was removed from the bed to maintain a constant age and mass of ac over time this mode of operation ensures that fresh ac is available at all times thus guaranteeing a high and continuous adsorption efficiency the bed was fluidized in a 5 m high and 2 39 m² surface reactor with an ascendant fluid velocity of 15 m h and an average hydraulic retention time of about 20 min the pilot was continuously fed with denitrified water sampled after the third biofiltration stage from the seine centre wwtp colombes france the plant is operated by the paris public sanitation service siaap and treats wastewater for 800 000 inhabitants with a flow of 240 000 m3 day the treatment is composed of a pre treatment step screening grit and oil removal followed by primary treatment physico chemical lamellar settling removal of suspended particles colloids and phosphorus and biological treatment 3 stages of biofiltration removal of carbon nitrification and denitrification 17 sampling campaigns each consisting of one 24 h composite sample from the inlet of the pilot and one from the outlet were carried out between 2015 and 2019 with the industrial pilot table 1 the pilot was successively operated using two μgacs cyclecarb 305 chemviron carbon from 2015 to 2017 sampling campaigns 1 12 and norit 3040 cabot from 2018 to 2019 sampling campaigns 13 17 the first 16 sampling campaigns occurred while the ac bed was being continuously renewed nominal condition and one last occurred at a time of no renewal for approximately 60 days renewal of the bed was stopped to study the kinetics of omps removal in the absence of fresh ac and to obtain lower values of removal rates from the pilot for each campaign the wwtp effluent and the pilot effluent were sampled consisting in 20 l of 24 h composite samples collected by automatic samplers equipped with teflon pipes in cleaned glass bottles refrigerated at 4 c the properties of the ac are available in table s1 and conventional wastewater quality parameters during each sampling campaigns are provided in table s2 supplementary information 2 2 batch experiments 13 adsorption experiments experiments 18 30 were carried out using various types of pac at a dose of 10 mg l between 2018 and 2019 at the laboratory i e batch tests table 2 pac was prepared from μgac crushed and sieved to retain a fraction between 50 and 63 µm in order to ensure fast adsorption kinetics wastewater effluent was sampled from the seine centre wwtp at two different stages with a similar quality nitrified water before the third biofiltration stage i e denitrification stage and denitrified water after the third biofiltration stage i e similar to ac pilot tests 8 different pacs and two contact times 30 min and 72 h were used for adsorption experiments for each experiment samples were collected before and after adsorption in cleaned glass bottles for analyses the properties of the pac are available in table s1 and conventional wastewater quality parameters during each experiment are provided in table s2 supplementary information 2 3 analytical procedures 28 omps 20 pharmaceuticals 5 pesticides 2 hormones and 1 perfluorinated acid were analyzed within 48 h at the institute of analytical sciences isa villeurbanne france by liquid chromatography coupled to tandem mass spectroscopy prior to analysis all samples were homogenized and filtered on 0 7 µm gf f glass filters whatman more information on the analytical methods can be found in the literature vulliet et al 2011 details about omps physico chemical properties and the analytical procedures are provided in the supporting material table s3 supplementary information dissolved organic carbon doc was analyzed for each experiment and sampling campaign by the certified siaap laboratory after filtration on 0 45 µm polyvinylidene fluoride filters milex merck limit of quantification 0 3 mgc l spectroscopic measurements were performed at room temperature directly after sampling and filtration on 0 45 µm polyvinylidene fluoride filters milex merck uv254 was measured using a spectrophotometer genesys 10s uv vis thermo scientific eems fluorescence excitation emission matrix were obtained using a spectrofluorometer fp 8300 150 w xenon lamp jasco with the scanning range from excitation wavelength 240 nm to 450 nm at an interval of 5 nm and emission wavelength from 250 nm to 600 nm at an interval of 2 nm if the uv254 was higher than 0 080 cm 1 the samples were diluted with ultrapure water to avoid inner filter effects due to adsorbing species present in the wastewater alberts and takács 2004 since uv254 of wastewater effluents was always 0 15 cm 1 low dilution factors 2 were used to minimize sources of errors kothawala et al 2013 eems of ultrapure water were subtracted from the sample eems and normalized by the raman peak of ultrapure water at an excitation wavelength of 350 nm to obtain fluorescence data in raman units r u and fluorescence intensities were corrected with dilution factors when needed lawaetz and stedmon 2009 2 4 fluorescence data treatment three methods were used to process fluorescence data table s4 all of them were performed using a peak picking approach which consists of extracting fluorescence intensities measured at specific pairs of ex em excitation emission wavelengths from measured eems the first extraction method used ex em wavelengths defined by parlanti et al 2000 α α and β indexes related to humic like components γ and δ indexes related to protein like components as they are frequently used in the literature for a large range of aquatic environments a second peak picking approach was chosen based on ex em maximum localization of 6 parafac components c1 c3 related to protein like components and c4 c6 related to humic like components previously obtained with raw wastewater from the same wwtp than the one studied in this work goffin et al 2018 finally a set of ex em wavelengths was based on ex em maximum localization of 7 parafac components f1 f7 obtained in this study the parafac analysis was performed using matlab with the dreem toolbox murphy et al 2013 from 30 wwtp effluent samples before and after adsorption onto ac n 60 further details on the procedure used for parafac analysis are presented in goffin et al 2018 eems contours plots and ex em loadings of the seven fluorescent components identified in this study are presented in figure s2 2 5 data processing omps removal was calculated following the approach of choubert et al 2017 which stated that the uncertainty of omp concentrations in wastewater generally ranges between 30 and 100 when the measured value is lower than 2 5 to 10 times the limit of quantification loq of the compound therefore when a compound was quantified at levels above 5 times the loq in the wwtp effluent and above the loq in the pilot effluent the removal was conventionally calculated when a compound concentration was above 5 times the loq in the wwtp effluent but below the loq in the pilot effluent the removal was estimated using loq 2 removals were not calculated when concentrations in both the wwtp and the pilot effluent ranged between the loq and 5 times the loq the relationships between the removal of omps and spectroscopic indexes was examined using the r software r core team 2007 pearson correlations with a p value higher than 0 05 were discarded to ensure that results were statistically significant 3 results and discussion 3 1 omps removal out of the 28 omps analyzed 7 molecules ciprofloxacin clothianidin imidacloprid estrone estradiol thiacloprid and thiamethoxam were detected less than 10 times among the 30 wastewater effluent samples analyzed before adsorption the results for these molecules were therefore not presented to only retain statistically significant results concentrations of omps in the wastewater effluent typically ranged from ng l levels up to several µg l e g acetaminophen or sulfamethoxazole at the time of each sampling campaign or batch experiment table s5 supplementary information the removal of the 21 omps selected and the average removal for each experiment sampling campaigns 17 sampling campaigns on the pilot and 13 batch experiments are presented in table 3 various removals were observed depending on the experimental conditions i e pilot scale or batch experiments contact time and type of ac used and the affinity of omps toward ac figure s3 s6 the average removals obtained from the industrial pilot 61 in average sampling campaigns 1 16 were higher than those obtained at lab scale 30 in average experiments 18 28 for a close contact time 20 min and 30 min respectively the performances observed in the pilot were higher due to the large mass of ac permanently present in the bed 1000 kg and the amount of available adsorption site similarly to a gac filter most importantly the dose of fresh ac added daily 8 7 kg was previously demonstrated to be the major parameter controlling the adsorption efficiency 40 removals at a 5 mg l dose and up to 95 at a 70 mg l dose mailler et al 2016b 2015 when the ac bed was not renewed for 2 months sampling campaign 17 a decrease in adsorption performance was thus observed from 61 to 35 due to the absence of fresh ac and the progressive saturation of the adsorption sites at lab scale the average removal increased from 30 to 79 when the contact time increased from 30 min experiments 18 28 to 72 h experiments 29 and 30 it is well known that when the contact time increases the molecules can diffuse from the liquid phase and adsorb onto the ac more easily moreno castilla 2004 the presence of dom hinders the diffusion of omps into the ac porosity which therefore need more time to adsorb newcombe et al 2002 5 omps acetamiprid diuron norfloxacin propranolol and trimethoprim were better eliminated than the others both in the industrial pilot and in laboratory figure s3 supplementary information among these omps some have physico chemical properties that may promote their adsorption such as a small molecular size acetamiprid and diuron or a positive charge norfloxacin propranolol and trimethoprim in wwtp effluent alves et al 2018 margot et al 2013 on the contrary 5 omps erythromycin pfos roxithromycin sulfadiazine and sulfamethoxazole were less eliminated than the others figure s4 supplementary information erythromycin and roxithromycin are large molecules and thus could be subjected to steric hindrance when they diffuse to adsorption sites and could compete with dom for adsorption sites in large micropores and mesopores sulfadiazine and sulfamethoxazole are negatively charged and thus can be subjected to repulsive electrostatic interactions with the adsorbed dom also negatively charged pfos is also a large and negatively charged molecule exhibiting a low removal despite the presence of a long hydrophobic chain which should allow hydrophobic interactions with the surface of the ac 6 omps atenolol carbamazepine diclofenac naproxen ofloxacin and oxazepam had a removal close to the average removal of all omps figure s5 supplementary information interestingly several omps acetaminophen ibuprofen lorazepam and sulfadiazine clearly exhibited higher removals in the pilot in optimal conditions than in batch experiments after 72 h of contact time table 3 figure s6 since some biological activity has been indirectly observed in the industrial pilot through the occurrence of nitratation guillossou et al 2019 mailler et al 2016a this could be due to the occurrence of biodegradation in the ac bed of the industrial pilot although it is recognized that degradation biosorption by biomass processes e g biological activated carbon filters sand filters fixed bed moving bed have a limited efficiency regarding the removal of most omps 16 bourgin et al 2018 falås et al 2016 biodegradation could still be significant for the most biodegradable compounds except lorazepam these molecules i e acetaminophen ibuprofen and sulfadiazine were indeed demonstrated to be highly removed by conventional wwtp 78 and thus to be easily amenable to biodegradation ben et al 2018 guillossou et al 2019 verlicchi et al 2012 other easily biodegradable compounds e g naproxen erythromycin did not follow the same behavior and were less eliminated in the pilot than after 72 h in batch experiments other elimination processes e g different adsorption kinetics interactions with dom or other components of wastewater effluents might thus compensate the effect of biodegradation more detailed information on the performances of the ac pilot and the influence of omps physico chemical properties on their adsorption can be found in previous studies guillossou et al 2019 2020a mailler et al 2016a 3 2 spectroscopic indexes removal 7 components were obtained from fluorescence eems n 60 using parafac analysis figure s2 f1 f2 and f3 indexes were located at excitation emission wavelengths associated with aromatic proteins ex em 250 302 nm tyrosine like ex em 280 316 nm and tryptophan like ex em 285 354 nm components respectively f4 ex em 325 384 nm f5 ex em 250 420 nm f6 ex em 345 432 nm and f7 ex em 385 472 nm indexes were related to humic and fulvic like components table s4 si chen et al 2003 f7 exhibited a second peak of lower intensity ex em 270 472 nm also related to fulvic like compounds a significant loss of intensity was observed in all regions of eems after adsorption illustrating the efficiency of ac in removing fluorescing dom figure s7 supplementary information the removal of doc uv254 and all fluorescence indexes was like the removal of omps higher in the industrial pilot in nominal configuration and at lab scale for a longer contact time table 4 apart from the f1 index close to the background noise of fluorescence eems the removal of uv254 and doc was most of the time lower than those of fluorescence indexes indicating that fluorescing moieties of dom were preferentially eliminated similar trends in the removal of fluorescence indexes were observed both in the industrial pilot and at lab scale slightly higher removals were obtained for tryptophan like f2 and tyrosine like f3 indexes table 4 other organic compounds i e humic like and fulvic like material f4 f7 were slightly less removed especially at lab scale after 30 min similar results were obtained with indexes derived from other studies goffin et al 2018 parlanti et al 2000 table s6 humic like indexes f4 f7 were more affected by the absence of ac renewal and thus saturation of the adsorption sites than protein like indexes f1 f3 for example the reduction of the f5 index went from 36 sampling campaigns 1 16 to 16 sampling campaigns 17 while the f2 index only decreased from 40 to 35 these results could indicate that protein like components are less sensitive to adsorption phenomena but also that they could be more easily biodegraded however these results would need to be confirmed with more data in the absence of fresh ac 3 3 correlations between omps removal and spectroscopic indexes a regression analysis was performed to examine relationships between the removal of omps and spectroscopic indexes correlation coefficients rpearson from the statistically significant regressions p value 0 05 are reported in table 5 positive correlations were obtained between the removal of spectroscopic indexes and all omps indicating that an increase in the elimination of fluorescing dom i e represented by the elimination of the indexes did not hinder the elimination of omps e g through competitive mechanisms the adsorption of fluorescing dom thus did not block all micropores where omps are preferentially adsorbed li et al 2002 these positive correlations also suggested that omps and dom despite different physicochemical properties e g molecular weight or electric charge followed similar adsorption kinetics and mechanisms and or that they interacted and were adsorbed together the formation of dom omps complexes in the dissolved phase and their subsequent adsorption on pac was indeed reported in similar conditions guillossou et al 2020b in complex wastewater matrix interactions between omps and extracellular polymeric substances eps have also been reported through adsorption by the proteinaceous components of eps or some binding with metal ions yu 2020 zhang et al 2018 this could also play a role in the common adsorption observed between omps and fluorescence indexes since the soluble eps fraction show fluorescence signals in both protein like and humic like regions ni et al 2009 sheng and yu 2006 all the studied indexes provided statistically significant correlations with most omps i e p values 0 05 despite the use of different brands of ac and various grain sizes which suggests that these results could be transposed to other activated carbons the correlation coefficients between the removal of omps and tf frequently used in omps adsorption studies were similar to results obtained with other indexes especially f4 and f5 despite being less specific than indexes derived from peak peaking tf is a promising spectroscopic index to be used in future prediction models of omps removal interestingly there were no significant differences between the correlation coefficients obtained with the indexes obtained by parafac analysis and other indexes from the literature goffin et al 2018 parlanti et al 2000 table s7 because of the proximity of their ex em wavelengths this indicates that the development of specific eems indexes does not appear essential to improve the correlation results in the case of adsorption studies however the removal of doc and more importantly of uv254 the most used spectroscopic index in omps adsorption studies were much less correlated with omps removal than most fluorescence indexes fluorescence spectroscopy thus offers the advantage of being more specific to several fractions of dom with various chemical structures as compared to uv254 which is mostly related to dom aromaticity leenheer and croué 2003 fluorescence eems thus take into account numerous dom fractions that interact with omps or that follow similar adsorption mechanisms despite their different molecular properties strong correlations rpearson 0 90 were obtained between the removal of tf and fluorescence indexes related to humic and fulvic like compounds f4 f5 f6 and f7 and the removal of 6 omps acetamiprid atenolol diuron ofloxacine propranolol and trimethoprim figure s8 the average removal was also best correlated rpearson 0 92 with humic like fluorescence indexes from recent biological activity f4 f5 fig 1 moderate correlations rpearson 0 80 were also obtained between these indexes and the removal of carbamazepine diclofenac ibuprofen ketoprofen naproxen norfloxacin and oxazepam fig 1 figure s8 the best correlations for acetaminophen and tetracycline were obtained with the indexes related to tyrosine like compound γ and f2 while the highest correlation coefficient for pfos was obtained with uv254 rpearson 0 73 weaker correlations rpearson 0 80 were found for erythromycin lorazepam roxithromycin sulfadiazine or sulfamethoxazole with any index interestingly the most biodegradable omps acetaminophen ibuprofen lorazepam and sulfadiazine which exhibited higher removals in the pilot than in batch experiments also showed low correlation coefficients with spectroscopic indexes rpearson 0 82 table 5 which confirms that other processes than adsorption influenced their elimination monitoring these specific omps might thus prove more challenging the occurrence of biodegradation might also explain the lower correlation coefficients globally obtained with protein like indexes overall even if some biodegradation could be expected for the most biodegradable compounds robust correlations were obtained between the average removal and humic like indexes which indicated that biological effects had a low influence on the whole pool of omps high correlation coefficients obtained with several omps e g atenolol trimethoprim also suggested that these specific molecules were mostly eliminated by adsorption processes 3 4 interactions between omps fluorescing dom and ac there was no apparent link between a specific physico chemical property of omps and the indexes with which they were correlated complex interactions e g electrostatic hydrophobic and van der walls exist between ac omps and dom and a single property cannot account for all these phenomena for example the removal of both atenolol and ofloxacin was well correlated rpearson 0 90 with the removal of the f4 component humic like from recent biological activity but atenolol is positively charged while ofloxacin is negatively charged in wastewater effluents as mentioned earlier the correlations observed between omps and fluorescing dom could be due to similar adsorption kinetics and mechanisms and or to dom omps interactions and co adsorption the hypothesis of similar adsorption mechanisms and kinetics of both omps and dom can be first considered since it is known that smaller fractions of dom can compete with omps for adsorption sites newcombe et al 2002 zietzschmann et al 2014b such competition was associated with higher proportions of small acid and neutral compounds of dom and was assumed to result from the similar molecular size range of these dom compounds and most omps which in turn targeted similar adsorption sites zietzschmann et al 2014b it is however uncertain if such competition would lead to correlations between the removals of dom and omps especially when considering their respective concentrations i e mg l levels of dom compounds and ng l µg l levels of omps moreover omps with different molecular properties and different adsorption behaviors were affected differently by these competition effects zietzschmann et al 2014b in our study it is also not possible to infer that the obtained correlations were due to common molecular sizes since fluorophores cannot be associated with specific ranges of molecular size additional experiments would thus be needed to evaluate the relevance of competition effects with small fractions of dom to the adsorption of omps presented in this study the occurrence of interactions between fluorescing dom or eps and omps could also explain the observed correlations such interactions e g hydrogen bonding hydrophobic van der waals or dipole dipole interactions were demonstrated between various omps and several types and fractions of natural dom caupos et al 2015 mott 2002 yamamoto et al 2003 effluent dom guillossou et al 2020b ilani et al 2005 and eps yu 2020 zhang et al 2018 hernandez ruiz et al 2012 used fluorescence quenching to examine whether some omps could interact with fluorescent moieties of dom and found that bisphenol a interacted with microbial byproduct like and humic acid like fluorophores while carbamazepine and ibuprofen interacted with fulvic acid like fluorophores the impact of these dom omps associations on the adsorption processes and the occurrence of co adsorption was recently observed for ciprofloxacin and humic acid adsorption onto ac and various resins jin et al 2018 as well as for effluent dom and various omps adsorption on ac guillossou et al 2020b this dom omps co adsorption hypothesis is reinforced by the fact that the best correlations were obtained for the omps reaching the highest removals e g diuron and propranolol while the omps that were more refractory to adsorption exhibited weaker correlations e g roxithromycin and sulfadiazine fig 2 the latter omps indeed have physico chemical properties that are unfavorable to interactions with dom i e a negative charge for sulfadiazine and sulfamethoxazole or to diffusion through ac porosity i e a large size erythromycin and roxithromycin due to the presence of dom their lower interactions with dom or the competition with dom during adsorption i e adsorption of dom favored over adsorption of the omp can thus explain the weaker correlations this result indicates that fluorescence eem could be a suitable tool for the online monitoring of omps that are more easily removed by adsorption on ac but not for omps that are more refractory to adsorption 3 5 toward a prediction of omps removal fluorescence spectroscopy appears as an effective tool for the online monitoring of the average removal of omps during adsorption processes which could facilitate the supervision of advanced wastewater treatment facilities the large variety of physico chemical properties of selected omps suggests that fluorescence spectroscopy could be used to predict the removal of other omps found in wastewater notably the 12 compounds suggested as indicator substances for wastewater treatment in switzerland office fédéral de l environnement and division eaux 2014 fluorescence spectroscopy appeared much more accurate than uv254 for the prediction of omps removal while uv254 is currently the only spectroscopic option for high frequency monitoring the online measurement of fluorescence is currently under development and would provide more information and accuracy for the monitoring of omps adsorption considering the lower correlations obtained with highly biodegradable compounds or with omps refractory to adsorption it is worth noting that such application appears more accurate with the average concentration of omps and that monitoring specific omps could be more challenging robust model development for accurate high frequency monitoring would require a larger number of samples to allow training and validation of regression models chys et al 2017 in addition to simple linear regression models a large dataset would allow to study multiple linear regression models combining different spectroscopic indexes to predict omps removal these models could have greater predictive power than simple models as suggested by several studies carstea et al 2016 goffin et al 2019 henderson et al 2009 the combination of different indexes related to different fractions of dom could account for the possible interactions between omps and dom more accurately and thus improve the prediction of their removal the adsorption specific fluorescence indexes i e specific parafac components found in this study may also be more accurate than generic indexes for this type of models 4 conclusion out of 28 targeted omps 21 were detected in wastewater over a significant number of sampling campaigns n 10 differences in omps removal in an industrial pilot and in batch experiments were observed depending on the operational conditions i e pilot or batch experiments contact time type of ac and the physico chemical properties of the molecules to be eliminated robust positive correlations were obtained between the removal of spectroscopic indexes obtained by parafac analysis and most omps this indicates that these correlations show the potential of being used to monitor the removal of omps in a wide range of operational conditions overall the average removal of all omps was well correlated rpearson 0 92 with humic like fluorescing dom and correlations were much more accurate than with uv254 these positive correlations suggested that omps and dom followed similar adsorption mechanisms or more likely that they interacted and were adsorbed together however there was no apparent link between a specific omps physico chemical property and the indexes with which they were correlated the most biodegradable omps and omps refractory to adsorption exhibited lower correlations so their monitoring in full scale adsorption processes might be more challenging especially in the presence of biomass an even higher number of samples in the dataset especially originating from data acquired in even more various experimental conditions would confirm the observed trends and could be used to build robust regression models by performing cross validation this study is nonetheless demonstrating that the application of fluorescence spectroscopy to the monitoring of adsorption processes at the industrial scale can accurately track the evolution of omps

17293,monitoring the removal of organic micropollutants omps in advanced wastewater treatment facilities requires expensive and time consuming analytical methods that cannot be installed online spectroscopic techniques such as fluorescence excitation emission spectroscopy were demonstrated to offer the potential for monitoring omps removal in conventional wastewater treatment plants or ozonation pilots but their application to activated carbon ac adsorption processes was only investigated at lab scale and not in real treatment facilities in this study indexes from fluorescence emission excitation matrices eems were used to find correlations with the removal of 28 omps from a large scale ac pilot in fluidized bed employed for wastewater advanced treatment as well as from batch experiments differences in omps removal could be observed depending on the operational conditions i e pilot or batch experiments contact time type of ac and the physico chemical properties of the molecules 7 parafac components were derived from the fluorescence eems of 60 samples obtained before and after adsorption positive correlations were obtained between the removal of fluorescence indexes and most omps and correlation coefficients were much higher than the ones obtained with uv254 confirming the interesting potential of fluorescence spectroscopy to accurately monitor adsorption performances at the industrial scale the highest correlation coefficients were obtained for omps having the best removals while the ones that were refractory to adsorption as well as to interactions with dom exhibited weak correlations these results suggest that interactions between omps and fluorescing dom and their subsequent co adsorption onto ac were at the origin of the correlations found lower correlations were also found for the most biodegradable omps which indicated that the occurrence of biological effects could make the monitoring of these compounds more challenging graphical

study of dissolved organic matter dom in wastewater treatment plants wwtp carstea et al 2016 goffin et al 2018 different methods have been developed to interpret data from fluorescence excitation emission matrix eem spectroscopy and to track dom changes in terms of quality and quantity in aquatic ecosystems and water treatment facilities chen et al 2003 coble 1996 parlanti et al 2000 efforts have been made to monitor various families of omps by using the direct fluorescence signal of organic molecules e g polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons pesticides pharmaceuticals volatile organic compounds carstea et al 2016 ferretto et al 2014 but the high concentrations of bulk dom in wastewater hinders the direct detection of trace levels of omps wasswa et al 2019 eems can nevertheless be used as surrogates for the prediction of omps removal for example during primary and secondary wastewater treatment sgroi et al 2017 because omps and dom undergo common elimination mechanisms in this context the removal of specific components related to aromatic proteins and tyrosine like substances was successfully correlated with the elimination of easily removed omps while another component related to humic like substances was correlated with some moderately removed omps both uv absorbance at 254 nm uv254 and fluorescence eem spectroscopy have been used for over ten years as surrogate parameters to monitor omps removal during ozonation of wastewater effluents chys et al 2017 gerrity et al 2012 nanaboina and korshin 2010 park et al 2017 spectroscopic methods were also applied for the monitoring of omp removals by ac adsorption satisfactory linear correlations were obtained between the removal of uv254 and the removal of specific omps or the average removal of several omps and for different types of ac powdered pac micro grain µgac and granular activated carbon gac sgroi et al 2018 zietzschmann et al 2014a zietzschmann et al 2016 compared to uv254 better correlations were obtained using total fluorescence tf calculated as the total volume integrated under an eem for the removal of 13 omps by gac filtration using rapid small scale columns anumol et al 2015 because of its higher sensitivity and selectivity ziska et al 2016 also successfully developed surrogate models for the removal of 14 omps with pac in batch reactors using power functions based on uv254 or tf again showing better sensitivity of tf this was attributed to the greater affinity of fluorophores for ac than uv absorbing matter recently sgroi et al 2018 used parafac analysis to study the breakthrough of dom through gac rapid small scale columns both uv254 and parafac fluorescence components were successful in predicting the breakthrough of 11 omps a better sensitivity was observed with fluorescence indicators parafac components than with uv254 to our knowledge no study reported the use of fluorescence indexes to predict omps removal by ac processes at the industrial scale apart from the study of sgroi et al 2018 only uv254 and tf were employed in models to predict omps behavior and no other eem data processing methods were used e g fluorescence regional integration peak picking or parafac analysis moreover the physico chemical mechanisms and potential biological effects underlying the correlations between the removal of omps and spectroscopic indexes are not known and are often overlooked in the literature the aim of this study was to find correlations between the removal of fluorescence eem indexes and omps from wastewater effluents by adsorption onto ac at the industrial scale and to show that 3d fluorescence is a promising tool for the monitoring of omps especially since online applications of fluorescence spectroscopy are being developed data were gathered both from a pilot used for wastewater advanced treatment with µgac at the industrial scale and from batch experiments using pac experimental conditions covered a range of various conditions to obtain statistically significant variations of omps removal 28 omps exhibiting a wide range of physico chemical properties were targeted based on their occurrence in the wastewater effluent correlation coefficients between each omp and each fluorescence index were explored and discussed by considering the various effects of interactions between dom and omps and their implication on the adsorption processes and the monitoring of omps the occurrence of biological processes in adsorption based treatments has been reported but their contribution to the elimination of omps is difficult to estimate especially at the industrial scale piai et al 2019 zietzschmann et al 2019 the potential influence of biodegradation on the correlations was thus also investigated finally the perspective of building models for the prediction of omps elimination was discussed 2 materials and methods 2 1 ac pilot tests the ac industrial pilot carboplus saur figure s1 in supplementary information was based on a 1000 kg bed of micro grain ac being continuously renewed by equivalent addition daily and extraction weekly guillossou et al 2019 mailler et al 2016a a dose of 10 g of fresh ac per m3 of wastewater effluent was applied daily corresponding to 8 6 kg of ac per day for a flow rate of 860 m3 day once a week after washing the filter to remove the retained suspended solids 60 kg of ac was removed from the bed to maintain a constant age and mass of ac over time this mode of operation ensures that fresh ac is available at all times thus guaranteeing a high and continuous adsorption efficiency the bed was fluidized in a 5 m high and 2 39 m² surface reactor with an ascendant fluid velocity of 15 m h and an average hydraulic retention time of about 20 min the pilot was continuously fed with denitrified water sampled after the third biofiltration stage from the seine centre wwtp colombes france the plant is operated by the paris public sanitation service siaap and treats wastewater for 800 000 inhabitants with a flow of 240 000 m3 day the treatment is composed of a pre treatment step screening grit and oil removal followed by primary treatment physico chemical lamellar settling removal of suspended particles colloids and phosphorus and biological treatment 3 stages of biofiltration removal of carbon nitrification and denitrification 17 sampling campaigns each consisting of one 24 h composite sample from the inlet of the pilot and one from the outlet were carried out between 2015 and 2019 with the industrial pilot table 1 the pilot was successively operated using two μgacs cyclecarb 305 chemviron carbon from 2015 to 2017 sampling campaigns 1 12 and norit 3040 cabot from 2018 to 2019 sampling campaigns 13 17 the first 16 sampling campaigns occurred while the ac bed was being continuously renewed nominal condition and one last occurred at a time of no renewal for approximately 60 days renewal of the bed was stopped to study the kinetics of omps removal in the absence of fresh ac and to obtain lower values of removal rates from the pilot for each campaign the wwtp effluent and the pilot effluent were sampled consisting in 20 l of 24 h composite samples collected by automatic samplers equipped with teflon pipes in cleaned glass bottles refrigerated at 4 c the properties of the ac are available in table s1 and conventional wastewater quality parameters during each sampling campaigns are provided in table s2 supplementary information 2 2 batch experiments 13 adsorption experiments experiments 18 30 were carried out using various types of pac at a dose of 10 mg l between 2018 and 2019 at the laboratory i e batch tests table 2 pac was prepared from μgac crushed and sieved to retain a fraction between 50 and 63 µm in order to ensure fast adsorption kinetics wastewater effluent was sampled from the seine centre wwtp at two different stages with a similar quality nitrified water before the third biofiltration stage i e denitrification stage and denitrified water after the third biofiltration stage i e similar to ac pilot tests 8 different pacs and two contact times 30 min and 72 h were used for adsorption experiments for each experiment samples were collected before and after adsorption in cleaned glass bottles for analyses the properties of the pac are available in table s1 and conventional wastewater quality parameters during each experiment are provided in table s2 supplementary information 2 3 analytical procedures 28 omps 20 pharmaceuticals 5 pesticides 2 hormones and 1 perfluorinated acid were analyzed within 48 h at the institute of analytical sciences isa villeurbanne france by liquid chromatography coupled to tandem mass spectroscopy prior to analysis all samples were homogenized and filtered on 0 7 µm gf f glass filters whatman more information on the analytical methods can be found in the literature vulliet et al 2011 details about omps physico chemical properties and the analytical procedures are provided in the supporting material table s3 supplementary information dissolved organic carbon doc was analyzed for each experiment and sampling campaign by the certified siaap laboratory after filtration on 0 45 µm polyvinylidene fluoride filters milex merck limit of quantification 0 3 mgc l spectroscopic measurements were performed at room temperature directly after sampling and filtration on 0 45 µm polyvinylidene fluoride filters milex merck uv254 was measured using a spectrophotometer genesys 10s uv vis thermo scientific eems fluorescence excitation emission matrix were obtained using a spectrofluorometer fp 8300 150 w xenon lamp jasco with the scanning range from excitation wavelength 240 nm to 450 nm at an interval of 5 nm and emission wavelength from 250 nm to 600 nm at an interval of 2 nm if the uv254 was higher than 0 080 cm 1 the samples were diluted with ultrapure water to avoid inner filter effects due to adsorbing species present in the wastewater alberts and takács 2004 since uv254 of wastewater effluents was always 0 15 cm 1 low dilution factors 2 were used to minimize sources of errors kothawala et al 2013 eems of ultrapure water were subtracted from the sample eems and normalized by the raman peak of ultrapure water at an excitation wavelength of 350 nm to obtain fluorescence data in raman units r u and fluorescence intensities were corrected with dilution factors when needed lawaetz and stedmon 2009 2 4 fluorescence data treatment three methods were used to process fluorescence data table s4 all of them were performed using a peak picking approach which consists of extracting fluorescence intensities measured at specific pairs of ex em excitation emission wavelengths from measured eems the first extraction method used ex em wavelengths defined by parlanti et al 2000 α α and β indexes related to humic like components γ and δ indexes related to protein like components as they are frequently used in the literature for a large range of aquatic environments a second peak picking approach was chosen based on ex em maximum localization of 6 parafac components c1 c3 related to protein like components and c4 c6 related to humic like components previously obtained with raw wastewater from the same wwtp than the one studied in this work goffin et al 2018 finally a set of ex em wavelengths was based on ex em maximum localization of 7 parafac components f1 f7 obtained in this study the parafac analysis was performed using matlab with the dreem toolbox murphy et al 2013 from 30 wwtp effluent samples before and after adsorption onto ac n 60 further details on the procedure used for parafac analysis are presented in goffin et al 2018 eems contours plots and ex em loadings of the seven fluorescent components identified in this study are presented in figure s2 2 5 data processing omps removal was calculated following the approach of choubert et al 2017 which stated that the uncertainty of omp concentrations in wastewater generally ranges between 30 and 100 when the measured value is lower than 2 5 to 10 times the limit of quantification loq of the compound therefore when a compound was quantified at levels above 5 times the loq in the wwtp effluent and above the loq in the pilot effluent the removal was conventionally calculated when a compound concentration was above 5 times the loq in the wwtp effluent but below the loq in the pilot effluent the removal was estimated using loq 2 removals were not calculated when concentrations in both the wwtp and the pilot effluent ranged between the loq and 5 times the loq the relationships between the removal of omps and spectroscopic indexes was examined using the r software r core team 2007 pearson correlations with a p value higher than 0 05 were discarded to ensure that results were statistically significant 3 results and discussion 3 1 omps removal out of the 28 omps analyzed 7 molecules ciprofloxacin clothianidin imidacloprid estrone estradiol thiacloprid and thiamethoxam were detected less than 10 times among the 30 wastewater effluent samples analyzed before adsorption the results for these molecules were therefore not presented to only retain statistically significant results concentrations of omps in the wastewater effluent typically ranged from ng l levels up to several µg l e g acetaminophen or sulfamethoxazole at the time of each sampling campaign or batch experiment table s5 supplementary information the removal of the 21 omps selected and the average removal for each experiment sampling campaigns 17 sampling campaigns on the pilot and 13 batch experiments are presented in table 3 various removals were observed depending on the experimental conditions i e pilot scale or batch experiments contact time and type of ac used and the affinity of omps toward ac figure s3 s6 the average removals obtained from the industrial pilot 61 in average sampling campaigns 1 16 were higher than those obtained at lab scale 30 in average experiments 18 28 for a close contact time 20 min and 30 min respectively the performances observed in the pilot were higher due to the large mass of ac permanently present in the bed 1000 kg and the amount of available adsorption site similarly to a gac filter most importantly the dose of fresh ac added daily 8 7 kg was previously demonstrated to be the major parameter controlling the adsorption efficiency 40 removals at a 5 mg l dose and up to 95 at a 70 mg l dose mailler et al 2016b 2015 when the ac bed was not renewed for 2 months sampling campaign 17 a decrease in adsorption performance was thus observed from 61 to 35 due to the absence of fresh ac and the progressive saturation of the adsorption sites at lab scale the average removal increased from 30 to 79 when the contact time increased from 30 min experiments 18 28 to 72 h experiments 29 and 30 it is well known that when the contact time increases the molecules can diffuse from the liquid phase and adsorb onto the ac more easily moreno castilla 2004 the presence of dom hinders the diffusion of omps into the ac porosity which therefore need more time to adsorb newcombe et al 2002 5 omps acetamiprid diuron norfloxacin propranolol and trimethoprim were better eliminated than the others both in the industrial pilot and in laboratory figure s3 supplementary information among these omps some have physico chemical properties that may promote their adsorption such as a small molecular size acetamiprid and diuron or a positive charge norfloxacin propranolol and trimethoprim in wwtp effluent alves et al 2018 margot et al 2013 on the contrary 5 omps erythromycin pfos roxithromycin sulfadiazine and sulfamethoxazole were less eliminated than the others figure s4 supplementary information erythromycin and roxithromycin are large molecules and thus could be subjected to steric hindrance when they diffuse to adsorption sites and could compete with dom for adsorption sites in large micropores and mesopores sulfadiazine and sulfamethoxazole are negatively charged and thus can be subjected to repulsive electrostatic interactions with the adsorbed dom also negatively charged pfos is also a large and negatively charged molecule exhibiting a low removal despite the presence of a long hydrophobic chain which should allow hydrophobic interactions with the surface of the ac 6 omps atenolol carbamazepine diclofenac naproxen ofloxacin and oxazepam had a removal close to the average removal of all omps figure s5 supplementary information interestingly several omps acetaminophen ibuprofen lorazepam and sulfadiazine clearly exhibited higher removals in the pilot in optimal conditions than in batch experiments after 72 h of contact time table 3 figure s6 since some biological activity has been indirectly observed in the industrial pilot through the occurrence of nitratation guillossou et al 2019 mailler et al 2016a this could be due to the occurrence of biodegradation in the ac bed of the industrial pilot although it is recognized that degradation biosorption by biomass processes e g biological activated carbon filters sand filters fixed bed moving bed have a limited efficiency regarding the removal of most omps 16 bourgin et al 2018 falås et al 2016 biodegradation could still be significant for the most biodegradable compounds except lorazepam these molecules i e acetaminophen ibuprofen and sulfadiazine were indeed demonstrated to be highly removed by conventional wwtp 78 and thus to be easily amenable to biodegradation ben et al 2018 guillossou et al 2019 verlicchi et al 2012 other easily biodegradable compounds e g naproxen erythromycin did not follow the same behavior and were less eliminated in the pilot than after 72 h in batch experiments other elimination processes e g different adsorption kinetics interactions with dom or other components of wastewater effluents might thus compensate the effect of biodegradation more detailed information on the performances of the ac pilot and the influence of omps physico chemical properties on their adsorption can be found in previous studies guillossou et al 2019 2020a mailler et al 2016a 3 2 spectroscopic indexes removal 7 components were obtained from fluorescence eems n 60 using parafac analysis figure s2 f1 f2 and f3 indexes were located at excitation emission wavelengths associated with aromatic proteins ex em 250 302 nm tyrosine like ex em 280 316 nm and tryptophan like ex em 285 354 nm components respectively f4 ex em 325 384 nm f5 ex em 250 420 nm f6 ex em 345 432 nm and f7 ex em 385 472 nm indexes were related to humic and fulvic like components table s4 si chen et al 2003 f7 exhibited a second peak of lower intensity ex em 270 472 nm also related to fulvic like compounds a significant loss of intensity was observed in all regions of eems after adsorption illustrating the efficiency of ac in removing fluorescing dom figure s7 supplementary information the removal of doc uv254 and all fluorescence indexes was like the removal of omps higher in the industrial pilot in nominal configuration and at lab scale for a longer contact time table 4 apart from the f1 index close to the background noise of fluorescence eems the removal of uv254 and doc was most of the time lower than those of fluorescence indexes indicating that fluorescing moieties of dom were preferentially eliminated similar trends in the removal of fluorescence indexes were observed both in the industrial pilot and at lab scale slightly higher removals were obtained for tryptophan like f2 and tyrosine like f3 indexes table 4 other organic compounds i e humic like and fulvic like material f4 f7 were slightly less removed especially at lab scale after 30 min similar results were obtained with indexes derived from other studies goffin et al 2018 parlanti et al 2000 table s6 humic like indexes f4 f7 were more affected by the absence of ac renewal and thus saturation of the adsorption sites than protein like indexes f1 f3 for example the reduction of the f5 index went from 36 sampling campaigns 1 16 to 16 sampling campaigns 17 while the f2 index only decreased from 40 to 35 these results could indicate that protein like components are less sensitive to adsorption phenomena but also that they could be more easily biodegraded however these results would need to be confirmed with more data in the absence of fresh ac 3 3 correlations between omps removal and spectroscopic indexes a regression analysis was performed to examine relationships between the removal of omps and spectroscopic indexes correlation coefficients rpearson from the statistically significant regressions p value 0 05 are reported in table 5 positive correlations were obtained between the removal of spectroscopic indexes and all omps indicating that an increase in the elimination of fluorescing dom i e represented by the elimination of the indexes did not hinder the elimination of omps e g through competitive mechanisms the adsorption of fluorescing dom thus did not block all micropores where omps are preferentially adsorbed li et al 2002 these positive correlations also suggested that omps and dom despite different physicochemical properties e g molecular weight or electric charge followed similar adsorption kinetics and mechanisms and or that they interacted and were adsorbed together the formation of dom omps complexes in the dissolved phase and their subsequent adsorption on pac was indeed reported in similar conditions guillossou et al 2020b in complex wastewater matrix interactions between omps and extracellular polymeric substances eps have also been reported through adsorption by the proteinaceous components of eps or some binding with metal ions yu 2020 zhang et al 2018 this could also play a role in the common adsorption observed between omps and fluorescence indexes since the soluble eps fraction show fluorescence signals in both protein like and humic like regions ni et al 2009 sheng and yu 2006 all the studied indexes provided statistically significant correlations with most omps i e p values 0 05 despite the use of different brands of ac and various grain sizes which suggests that these results could be transposed to other activated carbons the correlation coefficients between the removal of omps and tf frequently used in omps adsorption studies were similar to results obtained with other indexes especially f4 and f5 despite being less specific than indexes derived from peak peaking tf is a promising spectroscopic index to be used in future prediction models of omps removal interestingly there were no significant differences between the correlation coefficients obtained with the indexes obtained by parafac analysis and other indexes from the literature goffin et al 2018 parlanti et al 2000 table s7 because of the proximity of their ex em wavelengths this indicates that the development of specific eems indexes does not appear essential to improve the correlation results in the case of adsorption studies however the removal of doc and more importantly of uv254 the most used spectroscopic index in omps adsorption studies were much less correlated with omps removal than most fluorescence indexes fluorescence spectroscopy thus offers the advantage of being more specific to several fractions of dom with various chemical structures as compared to uv254 which is mostly related to dom aromaticity leenheer and croué 2003 fluorescence eems thus take into account numerous dom fractions that interact with omps or that follow similar adsorption mechanisms despite their different molecular properties strong correlations rpearson 0 90 were obtained between the removal of tf and fluorescence indexes related to humic and fulvic like compounds f4 f5 f6 and f7 and the removal of 6 omps acetamiprid atenolol diuron ofloxacine propranolol and trimethoprim figure s8 the average removal was also best correlated rpearson 0 92 with humic like fluorescence indexes from recent biological activity f4 f5 fig 1 moderate correlations rpearson 0 80 were also obtained between these indexes and the removal of carbamazepine diclofenac ibuprofen ketoprofen naproxen norfloxacin and oxazepam fig 1 figure s8 the best correlations for acetaminophen and tetracycline were obtained with the indexes related to tyrosine like compound γ and f2 while the highest correlation coefficient for pfos was obtained with uv254 rpearson 0 73 weaker correlations rpearson 0 80 were found for erythromycin lorazepam roxithromycin sulfadiazine or sulfamethoxazole with any index interestingly the most biodegradable omps acetaminophen ibuprofen lorazepam and sulfadiazine which exhibited higher removals in the pilot than in batch experiments also showed low correlation coefficients with spectroscopic indexes rpearson 0 82 table 5 which confirms that other processes than adsorption influenced their elimination monitoring these specific omps might thus prove more challenging the occurrence of biodegradation might also explain the lower correlation coefficients globally obtained with protein like indexes overall even if some biodegradation could be expected for the most biodegradable compounds robust correlations were obtained between the average removal and humic like indexes which indicated that biological effects had a low influence on the whole pool of omps high correlation coefficients obtained with several omps e g atenolol trimethoprim also suggested that these specific molecules were mostly eliminated by adsorption processes 3 4 interactions between omps fluorescing dom and ac there was no apparent link between a specific physico chemical property of omps and the indexes with which they were correlated complex interactions e g electrostatic hydrophobic and van der walls exist between ac omps and dom and a single property cannot account for all these phenomena for example the removal of both atenolol and ofloxacin was well correlated rpearson 0 90 with the removal of the f4 component humic like from recent biological activity but atenolol is positively charged while ofloxacin is negatively charged in wastewater effluents as mentioned earlier the correlations observed between omps and fluorescing dom could be due to similar adsorption kinetics and mechanisms and or to dom omps interactions and co adsorption the hypothesis of similar adsorption mechanisms and kinetics of both omps and dom can be first considered since it is known that smaller fractions of dom can compete with omps for adsorption sites newcombe et al 2002 zietzschmann et al 2014b such competition was associated with higher proportions of small acid and neutral compounds of dom and was assumed to result from the similar molecular size range of these dom compounds and most omps which in turn targeted similar adsorption sites zietzschmann et al 2014b it is however uncertain if such competition would lead to correlations between the removals of dom and omps especially when considering their respective concentrations i e mg l levels of dom compounds and ng l µg l levels of omps moreover omps with different molecular properties and different adsorption behaviors were affected differently by these competition effects zietzschmann et al 2014b in our study it is also not possible to infer that the obtained correlations were due to common molecular sizes since fluorophores cannot be associated with specific ranges of molecular size additional experiments would thus be needed to evaluate the relevance of competition effects with small fractions of dom to the adsorption of omps presented in this study the occurrence of interactions between fluorescing dom or eps and omps could also explain the observed correlations such interactions e g hydrogen bonding hydrophobic van der waals or dipole dipole interactions were demonstrated between various omps and several types and fractions of natural dom caupos et al 2015 mott 2002 yamamoto et al 2003 effluent dom guillossou et al 2020b ilani et al 2005 and eps yu 2020 zhang et al 2018 hernandez ruiz et al 2012 used fluorescence quenching to examine whether some omps could interact with fluorescent moieties of dom and found that bisphenol a interacted with microbial byproduct like and humic acid like fluorophores while carbamazepine and ibuprofen interacted with fulvic acid like fluorophores the impact of these dom omps associations on the adsorption processes and the occurrence of co adsorption was recently observed for ciprofloxacin and humic acid adsorption onto ac and various resins jin et al 2018 as well as for effluent dom and various omps adsorption on ac guillossou et al 2020b this dom omps co adsorption hypothesis is reinforced by the fact that the best correlations were obtained for the omps reaching the highest removals e g diuron and propranolol while the omps that were more refractory to adsorption exhibited weaker correlations e g roxithromycin and sulfadiazine fig 2 the latter omps indeed have physico chemical properties that are unfavorable to interactions with dom i e a negative charge for sulfadiazine and sulfamethoxazole or to diffusion through ac porosity i e a large size erythromycin and roxithromycin due to the presence of dom their lower interactions with dom or the competition with dom during adsorption i e adsorption of dom favored over adsorption of the omp can thus explain the weaker correlations this result indicates that fluorescence eem could be a suitable tool for the online monitoring of omps that are more easily removed by adsorption on ac but not for omps that are more refractory to adsorption 3 5 toward a prediction of omps removal fluorescence spectroscopy appears as an effective tool for the online monitoring of the average removal of omps during adsorption processes which could facilitate the supervision of advanced wastewater treatment facilities the large variety of physico chemical properties of selected omps suggests that fluorescence spectroscopy could be used to predict the removal of other omps found in wastewater notably the 12 compounds suggested as indicator substances for wastewater treatment in switzerland office fédéral de l environnement and division eaux 2014 fluorescence spectroscopy appeared much more accurate than uv254 for the prediction of omps removal while uv254 is currently the only spectroscopic option for high frequency monitoring the online measurement of fluorescence is currently under development and would provide more information and accuracy for the monitoring of omps adsorption considering the lower correlations obtained with highly biodegradable compounds or with omps refractory to adsorption it is worth noting that such application appears more accurate with the average concentration of omps and that monitoring specific omps could be more challenging robust model development for accurate high frequency monitoring would require a larger number of samples to allow training and validation of regression models chys et al 2017 in addition to simple linear regression models a large dataset would allow to study multiple linear regression models combining different spectroscopic indexes to predict omps removal these models could have greater predictive power than simple models as suggested by several studies carstea et al 2016 goffin et al 2019 henderson et al 2009 the combination of different indexes related to different fractions of dom could account for the possible interactions between omps and dom more accurately and thus improve the prediction of their removal the adsorption specific fluorescence indexes i e specific parafac components found in this study may also be more accurate than generic indexes for this type of models 4 conclusion out of 28 targeted omps 21 were detected in wastewater over a significant number of sampling campaigns n 10 differences in omps removal in an industrial pilot and in batch experiments were observed depending on the operational conditions i e pilot or batch experiments contact time type of ac and the physico chemical properties of the molecules to be eliminated robust positive correlations were obtained between the removal of spectroscopic indexes obtained by parafac analysis and most omps this indicates that these correlations show the potential of being used to monitor the removal of omps in a wide range of operational conditions overall the average removal of all omps was well correlated rpearson 0 92 with humic like fluorescing dom and correlations were much more accurate than with uv254 these positive correlations suggested that omps and dom followed similar adsorption mechanisms or more likely that they interacted and were adsorbed together however there was no apparent link between a specific omps physico chemical property and the indexes with which they were correlated the most biodegradable omps and omps refractory to adsorption exhibited lower correlations so their monitoring in full scale adsorption processes might be more challenging especially in the presence of biomass an even higher number of samples in the dataset especially originating from data acquired in even more various experimental conditions would confirm the observed trends and could be used to build robust regression models by performing cross validation this study is nonetheless demonstrating that the application of fluorescence spectroscopy to the monitoring of adsorption processes at the industrial scale can accurately track the evolution of omps

17294,herein we discovered and reported oxygen vacancies in silicon oxycarbide containing granular palm shell activated carbon si psac as a photocatalyst under uv irradiation a strong correlation between the atomic content of si1 oxygen vacancies and photocatalytic performance of si psac was obtained based on the electron paramagnetic resonance and photoluminescence analyses si psac under uva365 irradiation exhibited a higher donor density better charge transfer and lower electron hole recombination than that under the other light sources leading to a higher o2 production efficiency si psac exhibited effective removal performance for various anionic dyes and endocrine disrupting chemicals under uva365 irradiation continuous flow column tests revealed the life span of si psac under uva365 irradiation was extended by more than 16 fold compared to adsorption column since the oxygen vacancies can be created from the naturally present si in the biomass derived si psac during the activation this unexpected discovery of o2 production can extend commercially available si psac into the full scale photocatalysis graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords granular palm shell activated carbon oxygen vacancies superoxide radical adsorption photocatalyst 1 introduction in recent years defect engineering has been recognized to be a successful attempt to improve the photocatalysis properties by introducing low coordinated surface atoms present as a defect and creating high surface reactive sites this strategy significantly improves charge transfer optical absorption and surface reaction until now numerous strategies have been reported to create defects in photocatalytic materials including chemical reduction laser modification high temperature reduction with hydrogen and so on naldoni et al 2019 sambaza et al 2019 velo gala et al 2013 among cationic and anionic defects sophisticated designing for oxygen defects or vacancies in lattice crystal have been widely studied for improving photocatalytic performance due to its relatively low energy requirement by inducing surface oxygen vacancies the photoexcited carrier separation can be improved and those surface defects can act as a facilitator for adsorbing the reactants and promoting the surface reaction islam et al 2016 lei et al 2014 reported that the induced oxygen vacancies in in2o3 sheets led to a higher density of state dos at valence band maximum vbm and formed a new donor potential near conduction band cb that could narrow down the overall bandgap ebg and improve the visible light absorption in contrast bulk oxygen vacancies could act as a recombination center and increase the recombination rate of photoexcited carriers diminishing the photocatalytic performance for example the reduction of tio2 could extend the light absorption by creating oxygen vacancies however it may also result in poor electron mobility in the bulk trochowski et al 2019 thus it is still challenging to properly create oxygen vacancies since many other factors including degree and location of defects as well as pathway of electron hole migration are inherently complex and heavily debatable furthermore the creation of oxygen vacancies on photocatalyst usually requires high temperature or pressure and multiple synthesis routes in a controlled environment resulting in a high consumption of time and energy therefore it is highly desirable to seek a simple and massive producible approach using existing manufacturing process for obtaining oxygen vacancies contained photocatalyst as a commercialized sorbent activated carbon ac contains sp2 and sp3 hybridized bonds highly porous structures large surface areas and excellent conductivities nonetheless only a limited number of studies have investigated the photocatalytic performance using commercial ac as a photocatalyst for organic pollutant degradation which lacks systematic study from batch to continuous mode photocatalysis systems tuning the surface functional groups and the density of defects can improve the photocatalytic properties of ac cao and yu 2016 as shown recently studies by velo gala et al 2014 attempted to improve the photocatalytic effect by modifying commercial ac with gamma rays by increasing the number of surface oxygen quinone groups to enhance the removal efficiency of sodium diatrizoate under uv irradiation in batch scale experimentation in addition this strategy succeeded in increasing the sp2 hybridization of carbon atoms while reducing sp3 hybridization further reducing the ebg of ac and generating higher amounts of hydroxyl radicals oh however the reusability of continuous photocatalytic systems and the scale up potential of commercial activated carbon as a photocatalyst remain mostly unknown palm shell waste activated carbon psac is produced from palm kernel shell biomass which is one of the most abundant biowaste sources in southeast asia our previous studies reported the promising application of psac as an adsorbent for the removal of organic and inorganic pollutants choong et al 2018a choong et al 2018b choong et al 2020 it is worth to highlight our current study discovering that psac contains silicon oxycarbide sicxoy with 1 31 atomic percentages of si associated to oxygen vacancies from the xps analysis naturally biowastes such as bamboo rice husk ash and palm shell consist of si in the form of silicic acid si oh 4 or sio2 up to 40 during the pyrolysis process the removal of organic moieties increases the yield of the polymeric ceramics amorphous siox or sicxoy via a reduction reaction barroso et al 2019 sicxoy compounds are excellent uv absorbing materials with high mechanical stability chemical inertness and have a wide ebg so that they are likely to induce photocatalytic redox processes under ultraviolet uv irradiation barroso et al 2019 kousaalya et al 2018 taking advantages of the versatility commercial availability and well established production it is possible to directly apply sicxoy containing psac designated as si psac as a multifunctional medium that provides simultaneous adsorptive and photocatalytic removal of organic contaminants the application of si psac as a photocatalyst has not been reported and the photocatalytic mechanism is not fully elucidated profound understanding of the photocatalytic ability of si psac will open new horizons for the application of ordinary granular activated carbon as a photocatalyst to the best of our knowledge for the first time we have reported the photoelectrochemical pec properties of si psac including the photo response behavior electron hole recombination efficiency band energy position and quasi fermi level under photoexcitation using various uv sources based on the pec results coupled to various spectroscopic analyses as shown below we tried to investigate the photocatalytic mechanism of si psac for the degradation of organic pollutants x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps and electron paramagnetic resonance epr results revealed that oxygen vacancies associated to si1 in si psac contribute the superoxide radical o2 production for the photodegradation of organic pollutants finally we showed the enhanced performances of si psac as a photocatalyst under uva365 via continuous fixed bed column

obtained from dojindo molecular technologies inc japan all chemicals were analytical grade reagents and used without further purification si psac 10 20 mesh 75 μm was purchased from bravo green sdn bhd kuching malaysia the si psac was washed repeatedly with distilled water to remove dust conductivity 300 µs cm 1 and dried in an oven at 50 c for 24 h 2 2 photocatalytic experiments photocatalytic degradation of mb by si psac was carried out in a 100 ml beaker covered with aluminum foil to prevent ambient light penetration the suspension was stirred with a magnet at 200 rpm at room temperature fig s1 as uv light sources philips tl 4 w λmax 365 nm 120 lux namely uva365 philips tuv 4 w λmax 254 nm 120 lux namely uvc254 and led seoul viosys stu7t16c λmax 400 nm 100 lux namely led400 were purchased and used for the kinetics of photocatalysis the light power was measured by a digital lux meter sk 1300 skm electronic co korea in this study we found the light intensity 120 350 lux of uva365 has insignificant effect on the mb removal by psac thus we focused on the effect of light wavelength and the slight differences on the light intensity are negligible in this study to differentiate the adsorption and photocatalytic performance of si psac in mb removal dark adsorption without light irradiation was considered as the control for the overall experiments in a typical run 0 1 g of si psac was added to 100 ml of mb solution with an initial concentration of 10 mg l 1 all runs were performed in duplicate two milliliters of each sample were collected and centrifuged at time intervals of 5 min to 120 min the obtained supernatants were analyzed using a uv vis spectrophotometer at 668 nm all batch experiments had duplicate measurements in addition the consecutive cycles of the catalyst were studied using 0 1 g of si psac in 100 ml of mb solution 10 mg l 1 with the same manner of operation previously described si psac was filtered using filter paper 0 45 µm pore whatman and used directly for further consecutive cycle tests without washing for 10 cycles to compare the mb degradation kinetic rate the kinetic data were fitted with the pseudo first order model as follows 1 l n c 0 c t k 1 t where c0 is the initial solution concentration mg l 1 ct is the concentration at time t mg l 1 and k1 min 1 is the rate constant for the pseudo first order kinetic models further the effect of the initial ph was investigated by adjusting the ph to 5 9 using 0 01 m naoh or hno3 while the effect of nacl was assessed using 0 0 1 m nacl at ph 7 the effect of the solution temperature was examined at 25 45 c while the influence of the initial mb concentration was evaluated with 10 50 mg l 1 at ph 7 to investigate the dominant effect of the active species on mb degradation electron e hole h o2 hydroxy radical oh scavenger experiments were conducted in the dark and under uva365 uvc254 and led400 irradiation tert butyl alcohol 10 mm sodium sulfate 10 mm sodium

dissolved with each scavenger before si psac addition and lamp irradiation meanwhile the influence of dissolved oxygen on mb photodegradation was conducted by purging nitrogen gas to maintain anoxic

sulfamethoxazole smx and the influence of uva365 light intensity or mass transfer effect on mb removal were conducted in batch experiments refereed to si 1 further a si1 oxidation experiment was conducted using an alkaline solution to investigate the effect of si1 on the mb removal performance ten grams of si psac was added to 100 ml of naoh solution 1 m or 2 m and stirred for 1 h at room temperature the suspension was filtered and dried in an oven at 50 c for 24 h after drying the resulting media treated with 1 m and 2 m naoh solution were designated rsi1m psac and rsi2m psac respectively and were applied for further mb removal tests in the same manner as in previous tests to investigate the practicability of si psac for mb removal conventional fixed bed columns length 100 mm and internal diameter 5 mm packed with 2 g of si psac were used for continuous flow through column cfc experiments in the dark with uva365 λmax 365 nm as the light irradiation source fig s2 the control column dark condition was covered with aluminum foil under dark conditions while another column was exposed to uva365 light light intensity 500 lux mb solution 10 mg l 1 was pumped up flow into columns with a peristaltic pump at a flow rate of 1 ml min 1 additional cfc experiments were conducted using actual wastewaters obtained from a local wastewater treatment facility spiked with smx solution 10 mg l 1 see details in supporting information 2 3 material characterization of si psac chemical and physical characterization of si psac was performed by standard methods including x ray

cm³ g 1 fig s3 and table s1 moreover si psac exhibited a ebg of 4 3 ev according to tauc relation fig s3c 2 4 photochemical measurement photochemical measurements were performed using a potentiostat ivium compact stat and ivium software eindhoven equipped with a standard 3 electrode system including indium tin oxide glass ito surface resistance 200 ω a platinum electrode and a ag agcl electrode as the working counter and reference electrodes respectively details about the preparation of working electrode the pec measurement are presented in supporting information si 3 3 results and discussion 3 1 photocatalytic performance of si psac under various types of uv irradiation although si psac exhibited photocatalytic ability according to the ebg structure fig s3 it is also important to investigate the photocatalytic performance of si psac on organic pollutant degradation and the type of ros that can be produced hence we conducted mb photodegradation using si psac in the dark or under uva365 uvc254 or led400 irradiation which allowed us to comprehend the basic photocatalytic mechanism of si psac for the first cycle of kinetics the removal rates of mb by si psac under various types of uv or dark conditions were found to be in the following order uva365 uvc254 led400 dark fig 1 a the kinetic data fit well to the pseudo first order kinetic model with high r2 values 0 98 presenting reliable kinetic rate constants table s2 interestingly the mb removal kinetic rate constant under uva365 irradiation 0 0596 min 1 was 4 5 1 5 and 1 2 fold higher than that in the dark and under led400 and uvc254 irradiation respectively for further scrutiny consecutive mb removal cycles were conducted to differentiate the contribution of adsorption or photocatalytic performance without post treatment of si psac ten consecutive cycles of kinetics using si psac in the dark or under uva365 uvc254 or led400 irradiation were conducted fig 1b d for the first 5 cycles we also conducted control experiments in the dark or under different uv sources in the absence of si psac fig 1b as a result mb was not photodegraded demonstrating its high stability toward uv light molla et al 2015 overall for 10 cycles si psac under uva365 irradiation showed the highest mb removal kinetic rate constants fig 1b d for 10 consecutive cycles of kinetics the removal rate of mb using si psac under various types of uv or dark conditions were found to be in the following order uva365 uvc254 led400 dark as the number of consecutive cycles increased the mb removal rate constants continued to decrease for all conditions however among the uv light sources only uva365 had 100 mb removal for the first 5 cycles in contrast uvc254 led400 and dark conditions had 22 28 and 49 of mb removal respectively on the 5th cycle to differentiate mb removal via adsorption or photodegradation the fraction of photodegradation of mb was calculated as shown in section si 4 interestingly the removal fractions of photocatalysis by uva365 were 50 80 for 10 cycles table s3 and fig s5 in detail the mb removal fractions by adsorption appear to be the dominant mechanism with uvc254 42 57 and led400 45 100 revealing the insignificant photocatalytic effect of those light sources especially the mb removal fractions by photocatalysis appear to be least with led400 1 68 compared to uvc254 51 1 and uva365 68 58 for 10th cycle as the number of consecutive cycles increased cod removal efficiencies continued to decrease from 96 to 27 for 5 cycles in dark condition meanwhile si psac under uva365 irradiation maintained the high cod removal efficiencies 98 73 indicating its excellent photocatalytic performance for demineralization fig s5d to confirm adsorptive and photocatalytic mb removal uv vis spectra 200 1000 nm for si psac in the dark and under uva365 uvc254 and led400 irradiation were obtained at both the 5th and 10th cycles fig s6 and s7 respectively to identify the shifted or changed absorbances as a result the sequence of mb removal rate constants was similar to that of the previous kinetic data and the mb photocatalytic degradation efficiency was significantly affected by the wavelength of the light source to gain better insight into mb removal various important parameters including the ionic strength initial ph fig s8 temperature and mb concentration fig s9 were investigated using si psac under uva365 uvc254 and led400 irradiation and in the dark si 8 all the experimental results indicated that si psac under uva365 irradiation had excellent mb removal efficiencies compared to those under uvc254 and led400 irradiation normally the photon energy is related to the wavelength of the light source and shorter wavelength irradiation results in a higher density of excited electrons from the catalyst promoting a better photocatalytic performance sambaza et al 2019 showed that ag tio2 pani had a higher bpa degradation rate under a uv mercury lamp 400 w than under a visible light halogen lamp 500 w kočí et al 2011 reported that ag tio2 had better performance for co2 reduction under shorter wavelength irradiation 254 nm than under longer wavelength irradiation 365 nm due to a higher efficiency of electron hole pair generation with the former interestingly compared to a longer wavelength lamp uva365 a shorter wavelength lamp uvc254 is unlikely to improve the overall efficiency of mb removal by si psac ebg 4 3 ev unlike other findings associated with photocatalytic excitation our kinetic results conflicted with the fact that the ebg of si psac requires a high photon energy for electron excitation because of this contradiction we made the following hypothesis si psac under different uv sources will have dissimilar photoelectric behaviors directly influencing photocatalysis hence the photoelectric properties of si psac were analyzed to understand the relationship between the irradiation wavelengths and mb removal efficiencies in the following section 3 2 photoelectrochemical properties of si psac under various types of uv irradiation mott schottky m s analysis was conducted to investigate the influence of various uv light sources on the quasi fermi levels and donor densities of si psac fig s10 fig 3a shows the positive slopes of the m s plots in the linear region for si psac under all uv irradiation conditions this result indicated that si psac behaves as an n type semiconductor where the electrons accumulate near the cb the m s plots of si psac at 500 hz presented quasi fermi levels located at 0 23 0 229 and 0 225 ev below the cb 2 2 ev under uva365 uvc254 and led400 irradiation respectively fig 2 b as a result the quasi fermi level 1 95 ev of si psac under uva365 irradiation had the potential most distant from that of the cb morgenstern et al 2016 reported that more trapping of charge carriers before charge extraction can result in a lowering of the quasi fermi level in addition the calculated donor densities for si psac under uva365 irradiation were higher than those under uvc254 and led400 irradiation indicating a higher accumulation of charge carriers fig 2c generally the donor energy must be filled to facilitate ionization the increase in the donor density causes a decrease in the width of the space charge layer in turn a larger depletion layer is formed which is effective for electron hole pair separation and reduces the spatial charge recombination rate liu et al 2019 pesci et al 2013 more importantly si psac under uva365 irradiation showed an abundance of shallow trap states through quasi fermi level pinning which would push the quasi fermi level far from the cb eventually reducing the recombination rate of electrons and holes mohamed et al 2016 the flat band potentials efb determined by extrapolating the linear part of the m s plots showed that si psac under uva365 irradiation had the lowest efb fig 2d requiring the lowest overpotential to start the charge transfer reaction treekamol et al 2019 reported that a lower efb value results in less charge recombination therefore the m s plots indicated that si psac under uva365 irradiation had better charge transfer and a lower recombination rate than those under the other uv irradiation sources this result was consistent with the mb removal results shown in section 3 1 the photocurrents under uva365 uvc254 and led400 irradiation at a constant bias of 0 5 v were measured to further understand the photoelectric properties of si psac fig 3 a as a result uvc254 exhibited the strongest photocurrent the photocurrent pattern sharp peaks under uvc254 irradiation implicated that the electrons recombine with trapped holes exhibiting a non steady state peter et al 2012 fig 3b shows that the photocurrents of si psac obtained after the 5th run of consecutive kinetics had a 20 reduction under uva365 irradiation compared to that of fresh si psac fig s 3c and 3d show the electrochemical impedance spectroscopy eis results of si psac under uva365 uvc254 and led400 irradiation the nyquist impedance plots showed that si psac under uva365 irradiation had a smaller hemicycle radius fig 3c than that under the other irradiation sources indicating a lower interfacial electron transfer resistance which is beneficial for photoexcited charge separation zhao et al 2020 moreover the nyquist admittance plots showed that uva365 had a smaller radius than that of uvc254 indicating better charge transfer fig 3d overall the eis and m s analyses concluded that si psac under uva365 irradiation had better charge separation and transfer these results are strong evidence for the fact that uva365 gave the highest mb removal efficiency 3 3 scavenger experiments a series of radical quenching experiments were performed to investigate the main ros in mb photodegradation fig 4 in particular mb degradation was significantly suppressed by bq indicating the strongest scavenging effect for o2 in the mb photodegradation process under uva365 uvc254 and led400 irradiation fig 4a since all kinetic results obtained under light were not much different from those obtained under dark conditions overall through comparing the kinetics in all scavenging tests the scavenging effect in photocatalytic degradation followed the order o2 h e oh in particular uvc254 showed higher mb removal rates than did uva365 in the presence of h e and oh scavengers fig 4b d generally a shorter wavelength leads to more electron and hole generation resulting in a higher vb oxidation capability in the presence of sodium oxalate h scavenger h is consumed and unavailable for the recombination of electrons so that the reaction between electrons and adsorbed oxygen can be promoted to increase the degradation performance of mb sodium sulfate e scavenger quenches the electrons to prevent electron hole recombination so that higher numbers of available holes at the vb can enhance mb removal meanwhile the mb removal rates were retarded in dark conditions in the presence of o2 e or oh scavengers due to the competition effect between the scavenger ions and mb molecules conclusively the kinetic rates under uvc254 irradiation were higher than those under uva365 irradiation in the presence of h e and oh scavengers since o2 can oxidize mb the influence of dissolved oxygen o2 on the photodegradation of mb under various uv light sources was also examined fig s11 as a result all kinetic rates under uva365 uvc254 and led400 irradiation were decreased under anoxic conditions do 0 5 mg l 1 this result implied that o2 serves as a major source for photogenerated o2 3 4 photodegradation mechanism based on the mb photodegradation and scavenger experimental results we found that si psac under uva365 irradiation exhibited the fastest removal rate and that o2 was the main ros to understand the photodegradation mechanism epr pl and xps analyses were also conducted first the production of ros using si psac under uva365 uvc254 led400 and dark conditions was investigated by epr analysis fig 5 a among the uv light sources uva365 exhibited the strongest intensity of o2 signals 1 1 1 1 while o2 peaks were not found under dark conditions in contrast oh signals 1 2 2 1 were not detected in the epr analysis with dmpo water under all conditions fig 5b this result corresponds to the fact that the production of oh under uv irradiation of si psac is not favorable because the redox potential 2 5 v of the h2o oh couple is higher than the vb 2 2 ev in general light with a longer wavelength leads to less electron hole pair production resulting in lower ros generation however we found that the o2 generation using si psac was much higher under uva365 irradiation therefore based on the above results we believe that the spatial recombination between electrons and holes for si psac can vary under different light sources pl analysis was conducted to investigate the electron hole recombination efficiencies under uv light irradiation fig 5c two different excitation wavelengths 325 and 266 nm were used to simulate uva365 and uvc254 irradiation respectively the 325 nm excitation light exhibited a lower pl intensity than that at 266 nm indicating that uva365 results in a lower electron hole recombination than uvc254 does notably the epr and pl analyses revealed that uva365 generates more o2 than uvc254 does due to its higher charge transfer capability and lower electron hole recombination furthermore the eis and m s analyses also provided strong evidence for better charge transfer and lower spatial recombination efficiency on si psac under uva365 irradiation overall these interesting results regarding the photoelectrochemical behaviors provided evidence that si psac consists of a light conversion composite thus xps analysis of si psac was conducted to examine the chemical composition of this material wide scan xps spectra were acquired for not only si psac itself but also si psac obtained after mb removal in the dark and under uva365 irradiation which are designated upsac dark and upsac uva365 respectively fig s12 c1s o1s n1s and si2p peaks were obtained on all media while additional peaks of s2p were detected on upsac dark and upsac uva365 corresponding to the sulfur molecules of mb the si2p spectrum of si psac was deconvoluted into 2 peaks at 101 5 and 103 3 ev attributed to sioc3 and sio3c compounds in the form of si1 and si3 respectively fig 6 a c in particular it was found that the si3 peak was shifted from 103 3 ev si psac to 102 5 ev in upsac dark and upsac uva365 this phenomenon occurred due to the si o electrostatic interaction with mb molecules for the case of upsac dark the si1 peak remained similar to that of si psac before mb adsorption in contrast the si1 peak not only narrowed but also became a significant shake up satellite peak in upsac uva365 these shake up satellite peaks on upsac uva365 are associated with oxygen vacancies in the o1s spectrum fig s13 the o1s xps spectra were deconvoluted into 3 peaks at 531 2 532 9 and 535 ev attributed to oxygen vacancies o si and o c c o and c oh on si psac respectively fig s13 after mb removal upsac dark and upsac uva365 formed a new peak at 530 3 530 4 ev which corresponds to lattice oxygen o2 dupin et al 2000 compared to that under dark conditions upsac uva365 exhibited an increase in the intensity of the oxygen vacancy peak 532 1 ev this increase is due to the oxidation of mb molecules with a surface oxygen atom resulting in the loss of lattice oxygen to form more surface oxygen defects pan et al 2013a uv irradiation could also induce the formation of oxygen vacancies from lattice oxygen pan et al 2013b further the s2p spectra for upsac dark were deconvoluted into 2 peaks at 164 and 164 7 ev which correspond to c s and c s bonds respectively these peaks refer to mb molecules adsorbed on si psac fig 6d e on the other hand 3 peaks at 164 164 7 and 167 5 ev on upsac uva365 were identified as c s c s and s o bonds respectively the intensity of the c s peak was greatly decreased for upsac uva365 while that of the c s bond significantly increased as evidence of the photodegradation of mb these intensity changes indicate the degradation of c s into c s and s o yang et al 2017 remarkably si1 on si psac was found to have potential photocatalytic behavior under uv light according to the pl analysis fig 5c si psac under two types of excitation wavelengths exhibited a peak at 516 nm corresponding to 2 4 ev which is the ebg of the sicxoy compound accordingly the xps and pl results provide strong evidence indicating that the si1 compound sioc3 is the main contributor to the photocatalytic effect under uv irradiation moreover in the photocurrent measurements si psac under uvc254 irradiation exhibited the phenomenon that the yielded electrons are being trapped by holes considering the existence of si1 in psac and the low recombination of e h in si psac under uva365 irradiation it can infer that the recombination dynamic under uvc254 irradiation is dominated by shockley read hall nonradiative recombination takanabe 2017 the reason might be because the deep traps on si could act as recombination zones and prevent annihilation of minority carriers resulting in a higher recombination rate danno and kimoto 2006 therefore excess photon energy by uvc254 has a negative impact on photocatalysis by si psac compared to uva365 the pl spectra under 266 and 325 nm irradiation were further deconvoluted into gaussian like peaks fig 6f under 266 nm irradiation the pl spectra were fitted by 3 gaussian peaks at 506 peak i 553 peak ii and 619 nm peak iii however the 3 gaussian peaks under 325 nm irradiation were shifted to 514 576 and 645 nm the si related oxygen deficiency obtained from the si dangling bond by pyrolysis could result in emission at peak i while peak ii corresponds to oxygen carbon related defect giving strong luminescence in the blue green range gallis et al 2010 the nonbridging oxygen hole center o3 si o cleaves the si o bonds leading to a transition between si o σ and the nonbonded oxygen and resulting in peak iii formation nikas et al 2011 powder epr spectra of si psac in the dark were obtained to investigate the defect structure fig s14 as a result si psac exhibited a strong isotropic signal at g 2 005 due to the presence of intrinsic defects which are related to the si dangling bonds localized in si o or si c vacancies fait et al 2019 savchenko et al 2018 as shown in the pl and powder epr powder analyses si dangling bonds exist as paramagnetic intrinsic defects in si psac the si dangling bond generally introduces a one electron vacancy form of si si1 wimmer et al 2016 theoretically combined with the results of the powder epr and xps analyses the si1 species donate their electrons converting to higher oxidation state i e si2 and this reaction is reversible under uv irradiation therefore si1 exhibited a role in mb photodegradation under uv light tga and ftir analyses were also conducted to investigate the adsorbed molecules and surface functional groups of si psac upsac dark and upsac uva365 fig s15 tga analysis indicated that upsac dark contained higher amounts of adsorbed mb than upsac uva365 in addition tga and ftir analysis revealed that photodegraded compounds were found on upsac uva365 indicating the occurrence of mb photodegradation on the surface of si psac through considering the results of mb kinetics and tga analysis we found that si psac under uva365 irradiation exhibited higher mb removal efficiency and contained lower amounts of organic compounds than si psac in the dark accordingly these results evidently showed the phenomenon of simultaneous mb adsorption and photocatalysis implying that mb first adsorbs onto si psac and that the o2 generated under light irradiation is operative in mb photodegradation in general mb can be absorbing onto activated carbon via π π electron donor acceptor interaction wong et al 2016 electrostatic interaction and ligand exchange subsequently the photodegradation process regenerates the available sorption sites to further adsorb mb molecules resulting in higher removal efficiency under uva365 irradiation overall it was found that si1 in si psac has potential for the photocatalytic degradation of mb to further understand the contribution of si1 to the photocatalytic performance we prepared and used rsi1m psac and rsi2m psac for mb removal in the same manner as that in section 3 1 in this regard we made another hypothesis if si1 on si psac is the main contributor to the photocatalytic removal of mb then mb removal by either rsi1m psac or rsi2m psac under uva365 irradiation will be the same as that under dark conditions to prove the hypothesis mentioned above we performed xps analysis fig s16a to determine the chemical compositions of rsi1m psac and rsi2m psac compared to si psac fig s12 rsi1m psac and rsi2m psac had significant changes in the si2p and o1s peaks due to the leaching of si compounds induced by the alkaline solution in the si2p peak the intensity of the si1 peak for rsi1m psac 0 121 as si1 atomic percentages was reduced compared to that of si psac 0 215 and rsi2m psac 0 had no si1 peak fig 7 a thus this result indicates that si1 in si psac was oxidized via alkaline washing sinha 2018 wang et al 2017 further a new peak formed at 103 5 and 104 2 ev corresponding to si4 was indexed as sio2 on rsi1m psac and rsi2m psac respectively interestingly the si oxidation states and leaching efficiencies increased with increasing naoh solution concentration the o1s xps spectra were deconvoluted into 4 peaks at 530 4 531 3 532 6 and 534 8 ev corresponding to lattice oxygen oxygen vacancies c o and c oh on rsi1m psac respectively fig 7b in the case of rsi2m psac 4 peaks were deconvoluted at 530 9 532 4 533 6 and 534 7 ev attributed to lattice oxygen c o c o c and c oh respectively compared to si psac fig s13a rsi1m psac had a slight decrease in the number of oxygen vacancies while rsi2m psac had an absence of oxygen vacancies sun et al 2017 reported that alkaline treatment of a catalyst can removes brønsted acid sites leading to a lower content of oxygen vacancies meanwhile the content of oxygen vacancies in rsi1m psac and rsi2m psac is strongly associated with the si oxidation states from the si2p spectrum hence a higher oxidation state of si si3 si4 corresponds to a lower amount of surface oxygen vacancies in general sio2 ebg 5 8 5 ev has a stable atomic structure that could have an even photoelectric distribution under uv light and its higher si oxidation state could lead to a higher ebg cuko et al 2019 as indicated by the xps results the increased si oxidation states of rsi1m psac and rsi2m psac could have a significant impact on the photocatalytic performance the mb removal kinetic rate constant of psac under dark was higher than rsi1m psac and rsi1m psac indicated alkaline treatment of a psac exhibited negative impact on the adsorption of mb fig 7c furthermore the mb removal rate constant by rsi1m psac under uva365 irradiation k1 0 0259 min 1 was slightly higher than that under dark conditions k1 0 0154 min 1 moreover rsi2m psac showed similar mb removal tendencies in the dark k1 0 0278 min 1 and under uva365 irradiation k1 0 0277 min 1 demonstrating that rsi2m psac exhibited a lack of photocatalytic properties in addition the photocurrent measurement showed no photocurrent on rsi2m psac under uva365 irradiation fig s16b corresponding to the absence of a photocatalytic effect with this material the reduction in the si1 atomic content significantly suppressed the mb photodegradation performance fig 7c d interestingly a linear correlation fig 7d insert was obtained between the si1 atomic content and photocatalytic kinetic constants for si psac rsi1m psac and rsi2m psac this result strongly suggests that an increase in the si1 atomic content can lead to a higher photocatalytic performance hence the presence of oxygen vacancies associated with si1 is a key feature responsible for mb removal by si psac under uva365 irradiation 3 6 continuous flow column experiments to demonstrate the technical feasibility of si psac under uva365 irradiation for treating dye containing wastewater cfc tests were conducted in the dark and under uva365 irradiation as shown in fig 8 100 mb removal was obtained using si psac in the dark only for 500 bed volumes bvs after that point the mb concentrations in the outlet by si psac in the dark sharply increased and full saturation occurred at 4 000 bvs in contrast the si psac column under uva365 irradiation showed 100 removal up to 8 000 bvs thus cfc tests revealed that compared to the life span of the dark adsorption column the life span of si psac under uva365 was extended by more than 16 fold due to not only a high light intensity 500 lux but also relatively higher ratio of si psac mass 2 g to mb concentration 10 mg l 1 applied in the column as shown in fig s17a the mb removal rate constant increased with increasing light intensity moreover mb removal efficiency in cfc tests strongly associates fast diffusion of mb to relatively abundant numbers of sorption sites of si psac through equivalently increasing si psac and mb concentrations with a fixed ratio of 10 g g 1 in a constant reactor volume we tried find the effect of mass transfer phenomena on photocatalytic performance fig s17b as a result the kinetic rate constant under uva365 increased dramatically with increasing both si psac and mb concentration compared to dark condition fig s17c indicating that higher mass transfer enhances the pollutant s sorption rate and subsequently improves the overall adsorptive photocatalytic degradation rate however the increment of the kinetic rate constant under uva365 was less prominent as the si psac concentration was higher than 1 5 g l 1 when the amount of photocatalyst increases beyond a saturation level and lead to a high turbidity in a slurry type photoreactor this could cause the decrease of light absorption coefficient scattering effect and reduce the photocatalytic performance chong et al 2010 meanwhile the photocatalytic efficiency for fixed bed mode cfc tests is often related with mass transfer rates of target pollutants in cfc tests light scattering effect can be neglected due to the high volume fraction of solid to solution inside the column this ensures strong light absorption which make the scattering effect insignificant visan et al 2019 in addition higher volume fraction of solid to solution promotes higher mass transfer rate between pollutant and photocatalyst subsequently enhancing the photocatalytic performance hence given the negligible scattering and high solid volume fraction for cfc tests the mb removal efficiency under uva365 is more prominent compared to batch experiments slurry system in section 3 1 the uv vis analysis of the liquid samples obtained from si psac under uva365 irradiation indicated the absence of byproducts fig 8 representing the possibility of demineralization of the mb molecules in the previous section the cod removal efficiencies fig s5d and tga ftir analyses of upsac uva365 fig s15 presented reliable evidence for mb demineralization as additional batch tests si psac under uva365 irradiation was examined for the removal of representative anionic dyes mo and mr and edcs bpa and smx fig s18 the kinetic rate constants for mo mr bpa and smx removal by si psac under uva365 irradiation were 8 7 1 5 and 1 6 fold higher respectively than that of si psac under dark conditions further mb removal by si psac under uva365 irradiation was higher than commercial tio2 fig s19 in addition cfc tests using si psac under uva365 irradiation for treating actual smx containing wastewater were also conducted in the dark and under uva365 irradiation fig s20 it was found that for smx containing wastewater achieved full saturation at 1800 bvs in the dark condition while the si psac column under uva365 irradiation had it at 3500 bvs these results provided strong proof that si psac under uva365 irradiation generates o2 producing nonselective oxidation potentials for organic pollutants in the aqueous phase since si psac under uva365 irradiation could adsorb and photodegrade organic pollutants simultaneously it could lead to a self cleaning mechanism for the adsorbent surface extending the life span of si psac for the treatment of wastewater containing dyes and edcs 4 conclusion in this study ten consecutive kinetic cycles indicated that si psac had the highest kinetic rate constants for mb removal under uva365 irradiation compared to those of the other light led400 and uvc254 and dark conditions scavenger experiments and epr spin trap analysis revealed that o2 is the main ros for mb photodegradation compared to that with a higher photon energy light uvc254 si psac under uva365 irradiation showed lower electron hole recombination better charge transfer and higher donor density enhancing the o2 generation through m s analysis si psac exhibited n type semiconductor behavior where the electrons accumulate near the cb and shallow traps obtained under uva365 irradiation push the quasi fermi level lower away from the cb potential eventually resulting in lower electron hole recombination through xps analysis si1 associated with oxygen vacancies in si psac was found to be the main contributor to o2 generation in particular the si1 associated with oxygen vacancies in the si dangling bond was recorded in the powder epr analysis revealing that its paramagnetic intrinsic defects are responsible for the photocatalytic performance under uv irradiation further the correlation of the si1 atomic content and photocatalytic efficiency provided direct evidence to clarify that si1 associated with oxygen vacancies is the key element for mb photodegradation si psac under uva365 irradiation showed in addition to mb removal excellent removal efficiencies of anionic dyes and edcs owing to the properties of adsorption and photocatalysis si1 containing si psac showed a high application potential in wastewater treatment for not only dyes but also other organic pollutants in addition continuous flow column experiments showed that si psac under uva365 irradiation extended the column lifespan by more than 16 fold for mb removal compared to the lifespan for a pure adsorption column since this research initiated and focused on the fundamental understanding of si psac which can be abundantly supplied a study on the actual application of si psac or si1 doped carbon materials for wastewater treatment is highly recommended to extend full scale wastewater treatment declaration of competing interest none acknowledgement this work was supported by national research foundation

17294,herein we discovered and reported oxygen vacancies in silicon oxycarbide containing granular palm shell activated carbon si psac as a photocatalyst under uv irradiation a strong correlation between the atomic content of si1 oxygen vacancies and photocatalytic performance of si psac was obtained based on the electron paramagnetic resonance and photoluminescence analyses si psac under uva365 irradiation exhibited a higher donor density better charge transfer and lower electron hole recombination than that under the other light sources leading to a higher o2 production efficiency si psac exhibited effective removal performance for various anionic dyes and endocrine disrupting chemicals under uva365 irradiation continuous flow column tests revealed the life span of si psac under uva365 irradiation was extended by more than 16 fold compared to adsorption column since the oxygen vacancies can be created from the naturally present si in the biomass derived si psac during the activation this unexpected discovery of o2 production can extend commercially available si psac into the full scale photocatalysis graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords granular palm shell activated carbon oxygen vacancies superoxide radical adsorption photocatalyst 1 introduction in recent years defect engineering has been recognized to be a successful attempt to improve the photocatalysis properties by introducing low coordinated surface atoms present as a defect and creating high surface reactive sites this strategy significantly improves charge transfer optical absorption and surface reaction until now numerous strategies have been reported to create defects in photocatalytic materials including chemical reduction laser modification high temperature reduction with hydrogen and so on naldoni et al 2019 sambaza et al 2019 velo gala et al 2013 among cationic and anionic defects sophisticated designing for oxygen defects or vacancies in lattice crystal have been widely studied for improving photocatalytic performance due to its relatively low energy requirement by inducing surface oxygen vacancies the photoexcited carrier separation can be improved and those surface defects can act as a facilitator for adsorbing the reactants and promoting the surface reaction islam et al 2016 lei et al 2014 reported that the induced oxygen vacancies in in2o3 sheets led to a higher density of state dos at valence band maximum vbm and formed a new donor potential near conduction band cb that could narrow down the overall bandgap ebg and improve the visible light absorption in contrast bulk oxygen vacancies could act as a recombination center and increase the recombination rate of photoexcited carriers diminishing the photocatalytic performance for example the reduction of tio2 could extend the light absorption by creating oxygen vacancies however it may also result in poor electron mobility in the bulk trochowski et al 2019 thus it is still challenging to properly create oxygen vacancies since many other factors including degree and location of defects as well as pathway of electron hole migration are inherently complex and heavily debatable furthermore the creation of oxygen vacancies on photocatalyst usually requires high temperature or pressure and multiple synthesis routes in a controlled environment resulting in a high consumption of time and energy therefore it is highly desirable to seek a simple and massive producible approach using existing manufacturing process for obtaining oxygen vacancies contained photocatalyst as a commercialized sorbent activated carbon ac contains sp2 and sp3 hybridized bonds highly porous structures large surface areas and excellent conductivities nonetheless only a limited number of studies have investigated the photocatalytic performance using commercial ac as a photocatalyst for organic pollutant degradation which lacks systematic study from batch to continuous mode photocatalysis systems tuning the surface functional groups and the density of defects can improve the photocatalytic properties of ac cao and yu 2016 as shown recently studies by velo gala et al 2014 attempted to improve the photocatalytic effect by modifying commercial ac with gamma rays by increasing the number of surface oxygen quinone groups to enhance the removal efficiency of sodium diatrizoate under uv irradiation in batch scale experimentation in addition this strategy succeeded in increasing the sp2 hybridization of carbon atoms while reducing sp3 hybridization further reducing the ebg of ac and generating higher amounts of hydroxyl radicals oh however the reusability of continuous photocatalytic systems and the scale up potential of commercial activated carbon as a photocatalyst remain mostly unknown palm shell waste activated carbon psac is produced from palm kernel shell biomass which is one of the most abundant biowaste sources in southeast asia our previous studies reported the promising application of psac as an adsorbent for the removal of organic and inorganic pollutants choong et al 2018a choong et al 2018b choong et al 2020 it is worth to highlight our current study discovering that psac contains silicon oxycarbide sicxoy with 1 31 atomic percentages of si associated to oxygen vacancies from the xps analysis naturally biowastes such as bamboo rice husk ash and palm shell consist of si in the form of silicic acid si oh 4 or sio2 up to 40 during the pyrolysis process the removal of organic moieties increases the yield of the polymeric ceramics amorphous siox or sicxoy via a reduction reaction barroso et al 2019 sicxoy compounds are excellent uv absorbing materials with high mechanical stability chemical inertness and have a wide ebg so that they are likely to induce photocatalytic redox processes under ultraviolet uv irradiation barroso et al 2019 kousaalya et al 2018 taking advantages of the versatility commercial availability and well established production it is possible to directly apply sicxoy containing psac designated as si psac as a multifunctional medium that provides simultaneous adsorptive and photocatalytic removal of organic contaminants the application of si psac as a photocatalyst has not been reported and the photocatalytic mechanism is not fully elucidated profound understanding of the photocatalytic ability of si psac will open new horizons for the application of ordinary granular activated carbon as a photocatalyst to the best of our knowledge for the first time we have reported the photoelectrochemical pec properties of si psac including the photo response behavior electron hole recombination efficiency band energy position and quasi fermi level under photoexcitation using various uv sources based on the pec results coupled to various spectroscopic analyses as shown below we tried to investigate the photocatalytic mechanism of si psac for the degradation of organic pollutants x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps and electron paramagnetic resonance epr results revealed that oxygen vacancies associated to si1 in si psac contribute the superoxide radical o2 production for the photodegradation of organic pollutants finally we showed the enhanced performances of si psac as a photocatalyst under uva365 via continuous fixed bed column

obtained from dojindo molecular technologies inc japan all chemicals were analytical grade reagents and used without further purification si psac 10 20 mesh 75 μm was purchased from bravo green sdn bhd kuching malaysia the si psac was washed repeatedly with distilled water to remove dust conductivity 300 µs cm 1 and dried in an oven at 50 c for 24 h 2 2 photocatalytic experiments photocatalytic degradation of mb by si psac was carried out in a 100 ml beaker covered with aluminum foil to prevent ambient light penetration the suspension was stirred with a magnet at 200 rpm at room temperature fig s1 as uv light sources philips tl 4 w λmax 365 nm 120 lux namely uva365 philips tuv 4 w λmax 254 nm 120 lux namely uvc254 and led seoul viosys stu7t16c λmax 400 nm 100 lux namely led400 were purchased and used for the kinetics of photocatalysis the light power was measured by a digital lux meter sk 1300 skm electronic co korea in this study we found the light intensity 120 350 lux of uva365 has insignificant effect on the mb removal by psac thus we focused on the effect of light wavelength and the slight differences on the light intensity are negligible in this study to differentiate the adsorption and photocatalytic performance of si psac in mb removal dark adsorption without light irradiation was considered as the control for the overall experiments in a typical run 0 1 g of si psac was added to 100 ml of mb solution with an initial concentration of 10 mg l 1 all runs were performed in duplicate two milliliters of each sample were collected and centrifuged at time intervals of 5 min to 120 min the obtained supernatants were analyzed using a uv vis spectrophotometer at 668 nm all batch experiments had duplicate measurements in addition the consecutive cycles of the catalyst were studied using 0 1 g of si psac in 100 ml of mb solution 10 mg l 1 with the same manner of operation previously described si psac was filtered using filter paper 0 45 µm pore whatman and used directly for further consecutive cycle tests without washing for 10 cycles to compare the mb degradation kinetic rate the kinetic data were fitted with the pseudo first order model as follows 1 l n c 0 c t k 1 t where c0 is the initial solution concentration mg l 1 ct is the concentration at time t mg l 1 and k1 min 1 is the rate constant for the pseudo first order kinetic models further the effect of the initial ph was investigated by adjusting the ph to 5 9 using 0 01 m naoh or hno3 while the effect of nacl was assessed using 0 0 1 m nacl at ph 7 the effect of the solution temperature was examined at 25 45 c while the influence of the initial mb concentration was evaluated with 10 50 mg l 1 at ph 7 to investigate the dominant effect of the active species on mb degradation electron e hole h o2 hydroxy radical oh scavenger experiments were conducted in the dark and under uva365 uvc254 and led400 irradiation tert butyl alcohol 10 mm sodium sulfate 10 mm sodium

dissolved with each scavenger before si psac addition and lamp irradiation meanwhile the influence of dissolved oxygen on mb photodegradation was conducted by purging nitrogen gas to maintain anoxic conditions 0 5 mg l 1 additionally the photocatalytic performance for the removal of anionic dyes methyl orange mo and methyl red mr and endocrine disrupting chemicals edcs bisphenol a bpa and sulfamethoxazole smx and the influence of uva365 light intensity or mass transfer effect on mb removal were conducted in batch experiments refereed to si 1 further a si1 oxidation experiment was conducted using an alkaline solution to investigate the effect of si1 on the mb removal performance ten grams of si psac was added to 100 ml of naoh solution 1 m or 2 m and stirred for 1 h at room temperature the suspension was filtered and dried in an oven at 50 c for 24 h after drying the resulting media treated with 1 m and 2 m naoh solution were designated rsi1m psac and rsi2m psac respectively and were applied for further mb removal tests in the same manner as in previous tests to investigate the practicability of si psac for mb removal conventional fixed bed columns length 100 mm and internal diameter 5 mm packed with 2 g of si psac were used for continuous flow through column cfc experiments in the dark with uva365 λmax 365 nm as the light irradiation source fig s2 the control column dark condition was covered with aluminum foil under dark conditions while another column was exposed to uva365 light light intensity 500 lux mb solution 10 mg l 1 was pumped up flow into columns with a peristaltic pump at a flow rate of 1 ml min 1 additional cfc experiments were conducted using actual wastewaters obtained from a local wastewater treatment facility spiked with smx solution 10 mg l 1 see details in supporting information 2 3 material characterization of si psac chemical and physical characterization of si psac was performed by standard methods including x ray diffraction xrd n2 adsorption desorption field emission scanning electron microscopy fesem ultraviolet visible spectroscopy uv vis fourier transform infrared spectroscopy ftir thermogravimetric analysis tga photoluminescence pl analysis x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps analyses and electron paramagnetic resonance epr the details information about the material characterizations are

cm³ g 1 fig s3 and table s1 moreover si psac exhibited a ebg of 4 3 ev according to tauc relation fig s3c 2 4 photochemical measurement photochemical measurements were performed using a potentiostat ivium compact stat and ivium software eindhoven equipped with a standard 3 electrode system including indium tin oxide glass ito surface resistance 200 ω a platinum electrode and a ag agcl electrode as the working counter and reference electrodes respectively details about the preparation of working electrode the pec measurement are presented in supporting information si 3 3 results and discussion 3 1 photocatalytic performance of si psac under various types of uv irradiation although si psac exhibited photocatalytic ability according to the ebg structure fig s3 it is also important to investigate the photocatalytic performance of si psac on organic pollutant degradation and the type of ros that can be produced hence we conducted mb photodegradation using si psac in the dark or under uva365 uvc254 or led400 irradiation which allowed us to comprehend the basic photocatalytic mechanism of si psac for the first cycle of kinetics the removal rates of mb by si psac under various types of uv or dark conditions were found to be in the following order uva365 uvc254 led400 dark fig 1 a the kinetic data fit well to the pseudo first order kinetic model with high r2 values 0 98 presenting reliable kinetic rate constants table s2 interestingly the mb removal kinetic rate constant under uva365 irradiation 0 0596 min 1 was 4 5 1 5 and 1 2 fold higher than that in the dark and under led400 and uvc254 irradiation respectively for further scrutiny consecutive mb removal cycles were conducted to differentiate the contribution of adsorption or photocatalytic performance without post treatment of si psac ten consecutive cycles of kinetics using si psac in the dark or under uva365 uvc254 or led400 irradiation were conducted fig 1b d for the first 5 cycles we also conducted control experiments in the dark or under different uv sources in the absence of si psac fig 1b as a result mb was not photodegraded demonstrating its high stability toward uv light molla et al 2015 overall for 10 cycles si psac under uva365 irradiation showed the highest mb removal kinetic rate constants fig 1b d for 10 consecutive cycles of kinetics the removal rate of mb using si psac under various types of uv or dark conditions were found to be in the following order uva365 uvc254 led400 dark as the number of consecutive cycles increased the mb removal rate constants continued to decrease for all conditions however among the uv light sources only uva365 had 100 mb removal for the first 5 cycles in contrast uvc254 led400 and dark conditions had 22 28 and 49 of mb removal respectively on the 5th cycle to differentiate mb removal via adsorption or photodegradation the fraction of photodegradation of mb was calculated as shown in section si 4 interestingly the removal fractions of photocatalysis by uva365 were 50 80 for 10 cycles table s3 and fig s5 in detail the mb removal fractions by adsorption appear to be the dominant mechanism with uvc254 42 57 and led400 45 100 revealing the insignificant photocatalytic effect of those light sources especially the mb removal fractions by photocatalysis appear to be least with led400 1 68 compared to uvc254 51 1 and uva365 68 58 for 10th cycle as the number of consecutive cycles increased cod removal efficiencies continued to decrease from 96 to 27 for 5 cycles in dark condition meanwhile si psac under uva365 irradiation maintained the high cod removal efficiencies 98 73 indicating its excellent photocatalytic performance for demineralization fig s5d to confirm adsorptive and photocatalytic mb removal uv vis spectra 200 1000 nm for si psac in the dark and under uva365 uvc254 and led400 irradiation were obtained at both the 5th and 10th cycles fig s6 and s7 respectively to identify the shifted or changed absorbances as a result the sequence of mb removal rate constants was similar to that of the previous kinetic data and the mb photocatalytic degradation efficiency was significantly affected by the wavelength of the light source to gain better insight into mb removal various important parameters including the ionic strength initial ph fig s8 temperature and mb concentration fig s9 were investigated using si psac under uva365 uvc254 and led400 irradiation and in the dark si 8 all the experimental results indicated that si psac under uva365 irradiation had excellent mb removal efficiencies compared to those under uvc254 and led400 irradiation normally the photon energy is related to the wavelength of the light source and shorter wavelength irradiation results in a higher density of excited electrons from the catalyst promoting a better photocatalytic performance sambaza et al 2019 showed that ag tio2 pani had a higher bpa degradation rate under a uv mercury lamp 400 w than under a visible light halogen lamp 500 w kočí et al 2011 reported that ag tio2 had better performance for co2 reduction under shorter wavelength irradiation 254 nm than under longer wavelength irradiation 365 nm due to a higher efficiency of electron hole pair generation with the former interestingly compared to a longer wavelength lamp uva365 a shorter wavelength lamp uvc254 is unlikely to improve the overall efficiency of mb removal by si psac ebg 4 3 ev unlike other findings associated with photocatalytic excitation our kinetic results conflicted with the fact that the ebg of si psac requires a high photon energy for electron excitation because of this contradiction we made the following hypothesis si psac under different uv sources will have dissimilar photoelectric behaviors directly influencing photocatalysis hence the photoelectric properties of si psac were analyzed to understand the relationship between the irradiation wavelengths and mb removal efficiencies in the following section 3 2 photoelectrochemical properties of si psac under various types of uv irradiation mott schottky m s analysis was conducted to investigate the influence of various uv light sources on the quasi fermi levels and donor densities of si psac fig s10 fig 3a shows the positive slopes of the m s plots in the linear region for si psac under all uv irradiation conditions this result indicated that si psac behaves as an n type semiconductor where the electrons accumulate near the cb the m s plots of si psac at 500 hz presented quasi fermi levels located at 0 23 0 229 and 0 225 ev below the cb 2 2 ev under uva365 uvc254 and led400 irradiation respectively fig 2 b as a result the quasi fermi level 1 95 ev of si psac under uva365 irradiation had the potential most distant from that of the cb morgenstern et al 2016 reported that more trapping of charge carriers before charge extraction can result in a lowering of the quasi fermi level in addition the calculated donor densities for si psac under uva365 irradiation were higher than those under uvc254 and led400 irradiation indicating a higher accumulation of charge carriers fig 2c generally the donor energy must be filled to facilitate ionization the increase in the donor density causes a decrease in the width of the space charge layer in turn a larger depletion layer is formed which is effective for electron hole pair separation and reduces the spatial charge recombination rate liu et al 2019 pesci et al 2013 more importantly si psac under uva365 irradiation showed an abundance of shallow trap states through quasi fermi level pinning which would push the quasi fermi level far from the cb eventually reducing the recombination rate of electrons and holes mohamed et al 2016 the flat band potentials efb determined by extrapolating the linear part of the m s plots showed that si psac under uva365 irradiation had the lowest efb fig 2d requiring the lowest overpotential to start the charge transfer reaction treekamol et al 2019 reported that a lower efb value results in less charge recombination therefore the m s plots indicated that si psac under uva365 irradiation had better charge transfer and a lower recombination rate than those under the other uv irradiation sources this result was consistent with the mb removal results shown in section 3 1 the photocurrents under uva365 uvc254 and led400 irradiation at a constant bias of 0 5 v were measured to further understand the photoelectric properties of si psac fig 3 a as a result uvc254 exhibited the strongest photocurrent the photocurrent pattern sharp peaks under uvc254 irradiation implicated that the electrons recombine with trapped holes exhibiting a non steady state peter et al 2012 fig 3b shows that the photocurrents of si psac obtained after the 5th run of consecutive kinetics had a 20 reduction under uva365 irradiation compared to that of fresh si psac fig s 3c and 3d show the electrochemical impedance spectroscopy eis results of si psac under uva365 uvc254 and led400 irradiation the nyquist impedance plots showed that si psac under uva365 irradiation had a smaller hemicycle radius fig 3c than that under the other irradiation sources indicating a lower interfacial electron transfer resistance which is beneficial for photoexcited charge separation zhao et al 2020 moreover the nyquist admittance plots showed that uva365 had a smaller radius than that of uvc254 indicating better charge transfer fig 3d overall the eis and m s analyses concluded that si psac under uva365 irradiation had better charge separation and transfer these results are strong evidence for the fact that uva365 gave the highest mb removal efficiency 3 3 scavenger experiments a series of radical quenching experiments were performed to investigate the main ros in mb photodegradation fig 4 in particular mb degradation was significantly suppressed by bq indicating the strongest scavenging effect for o2 in the mb photodegradation process under uva365 uvc254 and led400 irradiation fig 4a since all kinetic results obtained under light were not much different from those obtained under dark conditions overall through comparing the kinetics in all scavenging tests the scavenging effect in photocatalytic degradation followed the order o2 h e oh in particular uvc254 showed higher mb removal rates than did uva365 in the presence of h e and oh scavengers fig 4b d generally a shorter wavelength leads to more electron and hole generation resulting in a higher vb oxidation capability in the presence of sodium oxalate h scavenger h is consumed and unavailable for the recombination of electrons so that the reaction between electrons and adsorbed oxygen can be promoted to increase the degradation performance of mb sodium sulfate e scavenger quenches the electrons to prevent electron hole recombination so that higher numbers of available holes at the vb can enhance mb removal meanwhile the mb removal rates were retarded in dark conditions in the presence of o2 e or oh scavengers due to the competition effect between the scavenger ions and mb molecules conclusively the kinetic rates under uvc254 irradiation were higher than those under uva365 irradiation in the presence of h e and oh scavengers since o2 can oxidize mb the influence of dissolved oxygen o2 on the photodegradation of mb under various uv light sources was also examined fig s11 as a result all kinetic rates under uva365 uvc254 and led400 irradiation were decreased under anoxic conditions do 0 5 mg l 1 this result implied that o2 serves as a major source for photogenerated o2 3 4 photodegradation mechanism based on the mb photodegradation and scavenger experimental results we found that si psac under uva365 irradiation exhibited the fastest removal rate and that o2 was the main ros to understand the photodegradation mechanism epr pl and xps analyses were also conducted first the production of ros using si psac under uva365 uvc254 led400 and dark conditions was investigated by epr analysis fig 5 a among the uv light sources uva365 exhibited the strongest intensity of o2 signals 1 1 1 1 while o2 peaks were not found under dark conditions in contrast oh signals 1 2 2 1 were not detected in the epr analysis with dmpo water under all conditions fig 5b this result corresponds to the fact that the production of oh under uv irradiation of si psac is not favorable because the redox potential 2 5 v of the h2o oh couple is higher than the vb 2 2 ev in general light with a longer wavelength leads to less electron hole pair production resulting in lower ros generation however we found that the o2 generation using si psac was much higher under uva365 irradiation therefore based on the above results we believe that the spatial recombination between electrons and holes for si psac can vary under different light sources pl analysis was conducted to investigate the electron hole recombination efficiencies under uv light irradiation fig 5c two different excitation wavelengths 325 and 266 nm were used to simulate uva365 and uvc254 irradiation respectively the 325 nm excitation light exhibited a lower pl intensity than that at 266 nm indicating that uva365 results in a lower electron hole recombination than uvc254 does notably the epr and pl analyses revealed that uva365 generates more o2 than uvc254 does due to its higher charge transfer capability and lower electron hole recombination furthermore the eis and m s analyses also provided strong evidence for better charge transfer and lower spatial recombination efficiency on si psac under uva365 irradiation overall these interesting results regarding the photoelectrochemical behaviors provided evidence that si psac consists of a light conversion composite thus xps analysis of si psac was conducted to examine the chemical composition of this material wide scan xps spectra were acquired for not only si psac itself but also si psac obtained after mb removal in the dark and under uva365 irradiation which are designated upsac dark and upsac uva365 respectively fig s12 c1s o1s n1s and si2p peaks were obtained on all media while additional peaks of s2p were detected on upsac dark and upsac uva365 corresponding to the sulfur molecules of mb the si2p spectrum of si psac was deconvoluted into 2 peaks at 101 5 and 103 3 ev attributed to sioc3 and sio3c compounds in the form of si1 and si3 respectively fig 6 a c in particular it was found that the si3 peak was shifted from 103 3 ev si psac to 102 5 ev in upsac dark and upsac uva365 this phenomenon occurred due to the si o electrostatic interaction with mb molecules for the case of upsac dark the si1 peak remained similar to that of si psac before mb adsorption in contrast the si1 peak not only narrowed but also became a significant shake up satellite peak in upsac uva365 these shake up satellite peaks on upsac uva365 are associated with oxygen vacancies in the o1s spectrum fig s13 the o1s xps spectra were deconvoluted into 3 peaks at 531 2 532 9 and 535 ev attributed to oxygen vacancies o si and o c c o and c oh on si psac respectively fig s13 after mb removal upsac dark and upsac uva365 formed a new peak at 530 3 530 4 ev which corresponds to lattice oxygen o2 dupin et al 2000 compared to that under dark conditions upsac uva365 exhibited an increase in the intensity of the oxygen vacancy peak 532 1 ev this increase is due to the oxidation of mb molecules with a surface oxygen atom resulting in the loss of lattice oxygen to form more surface oxygen defects pan et al 2013a uv irradiation could also induce the formation of oxygen vacancies from lattice oxygen pan et al 2013b further the s2p spectra for upsac dark were deconvoluted into 2 peaks at 164 and 164 7 ev which correspond to c s and c s bonds respectively these peaks refer to mb molecules adsorbed on si psac fig 6d e on the other hand 3 peaks at 164 164 7 and 167 5 ev on upsac uva365 were identified as c s c s and s o bonds respectively the intensity of the c s peak was greatly decreased for upsac uva365 while that of the c s bond significantly increased as evidence of the photodegradation of mb these intensity changes indicate the degradation of c s into c s and s o yang et al 2017 remarkably si1 on si psac was found to have potential photocatalytic behavior under uv light according to the pl analysis fig 5c si psac under two types of excitation wavelengths exhibited a peak at 516 nm corresponding to 2 4 ev which is the ebg of the sicxoy compound accordingly the xps and pl results provide strong evidence indicating that the si1 compound sioc3 is the main contributor to the photocatalytic effect under uv irradiation moreover in the photocurrent measurements si psac under uvc254 irradiation exhibited the phenomenon that the yielded electrons are being trapped by holes considering the existence of si1 in psac and the low recombination of e h in si psac under uva365 irradiation it can infer that the recombination dynamic under uvc254 irradiation is dominated by shockley read hall nonradiative recombination takanabe 2017 the reason might be because the deep traps on si could act as recombination zones and prevent annihilation of minority carriers resulting in a higher recombination rate danno and kimoto 2006 therefore excess photon energy by uvc254 has a negative impact on photocatalysis by si psac compared to uva365 the pl spectra under 266 and 325 nm irradiation were further deconvoluted into gaussian like peaks fig 6f under 266 nm irradiation the pl spectra were fitted by 3 gaussian peaks at 506 peak i 553 peak ii and 619 nm peak iii however the 3 gaussian peaks under 325 nm irradiation were shifted to 514 576 and 645 nm the si related oxygen deficiency obtained from the si dangling bond by pyrolysis could result in emission at peak i while peak ii corresponds to oxygen carbon related defect giving strong luminescence in the blue green range gallis et al 2010 the nonbridging oxygen hole center o3 si o cleaves the si o bonds leading to a transition between si o σ and the nonbonded oxygen and resulting in peak iii formation nikas et al 2011 powder epr spectra of si psac in the dark were obtained to investigate the defect structure fig s14 as a result si psac exhibited a strong isotropic signal at g 2 005 due to the presence of intrinsic defects which are related to the si dangling bonds localized in si o or si c vacancies fait et al 2019 savchenko et al 2018 as shown in the pl and powder epr powder analyses si dangling bonds exist as paramagnetic intrinsic defects in si psac the si dangling bond generally introduces a one electron vacancy form of si si1 wimmer et al 2016 theoretically combined with the results of the powder epr and xps analyses the si1 species donate their electrons converting to higher oxidation state i e si2 and this reaction is reversible under uv irradiation therefore si1 exhibited a role in mb photodegradation under uv light tga and ftir analyses were also conducted to investigate the adsorbed molecules and surface functional groups of si psac upsac dark and upsac uva365 fig s15 tga analysis indicated that upsac dark contained higher amounts of adsorbed mb than upsac uva365 in addition tga and ftir analysis revealed that photodegraded compounds were found on upsac uva365 indicating the occurrence of mb photodegradation on the surface of si psac through considering the results of mb kinetics and tga analysis we found that si psac under uva365 irradiation exhibited higher mb removal efficiency and contained lower amounts of organic compounds than si psac in the dark accordingly these results evidently showed the phenomenon of simultaneous mb adsorption and photocatalysis implying that mb first adsorbs onto si psac and that the o2 generated under light irradiation is operative in mb photodegradation in general mb can be absorbing onto activated carbon via π π electron donor acceptor interaction wong et al 2016 electrostatic interaction and ligand exchange subsequently the photodegradation process regenerates the available sorption sites to further adsorb mb molecules resulting in higher removal efficiency under uva365 irradiation overall it was found that si1 in si psac has potential for the photocatalytic degradation of mb to further understand the contribution of si1 to the photocatalytic performance we prepared and used rsi1m psac and rsi2m psac for mb removal in the same manner as that in section 3 1 in this regard we made another hypothesis if si1 on si psac is the main contributor to the photocatalytic removal of mb then mb removal by either rsi1m psac or rsi2m psac under uva365 irradiation will be the same as that under dark conditions to prove the hypothesis mentioned above we performed xps analysis fig s16a to determine the chemical compositions of rsi1m psac and rsi2m psac compared to si psac fig s12 rsi1m psac and rsi2m psac had significant changes in the si2p and o1s peaks due to the leaching of si compounds induced by the alkaline solution in the si2p peak the intensity of the si1 peak for rsi1m psac 0 121 as si1 atomic percentages was reduced compared to that of si psac 0 215 and rsi2m psac 0 had no si1 peak fig 7 a thus this result indicates that si1 in si psac was oxidized via alkaline washing sinha 2018 wang et al 2017 further a new peak formed at 103 5 and 104 2 ev corresponding to si4 was indexed as sio2 on rsi1m psac and rsi2m psac respectively interestingly the si oxidation states and leaching efficiencies increased with increasing naoh solution concentration the o1s xps spectra were deconvoluted into 4 peaks at 530 4 531 3 532 6 and 534 8 ev corresponding to lattice oxygen oxygen vacancies c o and c oh on rsi1m psac respectively fig 7b in the case of rsi2m psac 4 peaks were deconvoluted at 530 9 532 4 533 6 and 534 7 ev attributed to lattice oxygen c o c o c and c oh respectively compared to si psac fig s13a rsi1m psac had a slight decrease in the number of oxygen vacancies while rsi2m psac had an absence of oxygen vacancies sun et al 2017 reported that alkaline treatment of a catalyst can removes brønsted acid sites leading to a lower content of oxygen vacancies meanwhile the content of oxygen vacancies in rsi1m psac and rsi2m psac is strongly associated with the si oxidation states from the si2p spectrum hence a higher oxidation state of si si3 si4 corresponds to a lower amount of surface oxygen vacancies in general sio2 ebg 5 8 5 ev has a stable atomic structure that could have an even photoelectric distribution under uv light and its higher si oxidation state could lead to a higher ebg cuko et al 2019 as indicated by the xps results the increased si oxidation states of rsi1m psac and rsi2m psac could have a significant impact on the photocatalytic performance the mb removal kinetic rate constant of psac under dark was higher than rsi1m psac and rsi1m psac indicated alkaline treatment of a psac exhibited negative impact on the adsorption of mb fig 7c furthermore the mb removal rate constant by rsi1m psac under uva365 irradiation k1 0 0259 min 1 was slightly higher than that under dark conditions k1 0 0154 min 1 moreover rsi2m psac showed similar mb removal tendencies in the dark k1 0 0278 min 1 and under uva365 irradiation k1 0 0277 min 1 demonstrating that rsi2m psac exhibited a lack of photocatalytic properties in addition the photocurrent measurement showed no photocurrent on rsi2m psac under uva365 irradiation fig s16b corresponding to the absence of a photocatalytic effect with this material the reduction in the si1 atomic content significantly suppressed the mb photodegradation performance fig 7c d interestingly a linear correlation fig 7d insert was obtained between the si1 atomic content and photocatalytic kinetic constants for si psac rsi1m psac and rsi2m psac this result strongly suggests that an increase in the si1 atomic content can lead to a higher photocatalytic performance hence the presence of oxygen vacancies associated with si1 is a key feature responsible for mb removal by si psac under uva365 irradiation 3 6 continuous flow column experiments to demonstrate the technical feasibility of si psac under uva365 irradiation for treating dye containing wastewater cfc tests were conducted in the dark and under uva365 irradiation as shown in fig 8 100 mb removal was obtained using si psac in the dark only for 500 bed volumes bvs after that point the mb concentrations in the outlet by si psac in the dark sharply increased and full saturation occurred at 4 000 bvs in contrast the si psac column under uva365 irradiation showed 100 removal up to 8 000 bvs thus cfc tests revealed that compared to the life span of the dark adsorption column the life span of si psac under uva365 was extended by more than 16 fold due to not only a high light intensity 500 lux but also relatively higher ratio of si psac mass 2 g to mb concentration 10 mg l 1 applied in the column as shown in fig s17a the mb removal rate constant increased with increasing light intensity moreover mb removal efficiency in cfc tests strongly associates fast diffusion of mb to relatively abundant numbers of sorption sites of si psac through equivalently increasing si psac and mb concentrations with a fixed ratio of 10 g g 1 in a constant reactor volume we tried find the effect of mass transfer phenomena on photocatalytic performance fig s17b as a result the kinetic rate constant under uva365 increased dramatically with increasing both si psac and mb concentration compared to dark condition fig s17c indicating that higher mass transfer enhances the pollutant s sorption rate and subsequently improves the overall adsorptive photocatalytic degradation rate however the increment of the kinetic rate constant under uva365 was less prominent as the si psac concentration was higher than 1 5 g l 1 when the amount of photocatalyst increases beyond a saturation level and lead to a high turbidity in a slurry type photoreactor this could cause the decrease of light absorption coefficient scattering effect and reduce the photocatalytic performance chong et al 2010 meanwhile the photocatalytic efficiency for fixed bed mode cfc tests is often related with mass transfer rates of target pollutants in cfc tests light scattering effect can be neglected due to the high volume fraction of solid to solution inside the column this ensures strong light absorption which make the scattering effect insignificant visan et al 2019 in addition higher volume fraction of solid to solution promotes higher mass transfer rate between pollutant and photocatalyst subsequently enhancing the photocatalytic performance hence given the negligible scattering and high solid volume fraction for cfc tests the mb removal efficiency under uva365 is more prominent compared to batch experiments slurry system in section 3 1 the uv vis analysis of the liquid samples obtained from si psac under uva365 irradiation indicated the absence of byproducts fig 8 representing the possibility of demineralization of the mb molecules in the previous section the cod removal efficiencies fig s5d and tga ftir analyses of upsac uva365 fig s15 presented reliable evidence for mb demineralization as additional batch tests si psac under uva365 irradiation was examined for the removal of representative anionic dyes mo and mr and edcs bpa and smx fig s18 the kinetic rate constants for mo mr bpa and smx removal by si psac under uva365 irradiation were 8 7 1 5 and 1 6 fold higher respectively than that of si psac under dark conditions further mb removal by si psac under uva365 irradiation was higher than commercial tio2 fig s19 in addition cfc tests using si psac under uva365 irradiation for treating actual smx containing wastewater were also conducted in the dark and under uva365 irradiation fig s20 it was found that for smx containing wastewater achieved full saturation at 1800 bvs in the dark condition while the si psac column under uva365 irradiation had it at 3500 bvs these results provided strong proof that si psac under uva365 irradiation generates o2 producing nonselective oxidation potentials for organic pollutants in the aqueous phase since si psac under uva365 irradiation could adsorb and photodegrade organic pollutants simultaneously it could lead to a self cleaning mechanism for the adsorbent surface extending the life span of si psac for the treatment of wastewater containing dyes and edcs 4 conclusion in this study ten consecutive kinetic cycles indicated that si psac had the highest kinetic rate constants for mb removal under uva365 irradiation compared to those of the other light led400 and uvc254 and dark conditions scavenger experiments and epr spin trap analysis revealed that o2 is the main ros for mb photodegradation compared to that with a higher photon energy light uvc254 si psac under uva365 irradiation showed lower electron hole recombination better charge transfer and higher donor density enhancing the o2 generation through m s analysis si psac exhibited n type semiconductor behavior where the electrons accumulate near the cb and shallow traps obtained under uva365 irradiation push the quasi fermi level lower away from the cb potential eventually resulting in lower electron hole recombination through xps analysis si1 associated with oxygen vacancies in si psac was found to be the main contributor to o2 generation in particular the si1 associated with oxygen vacancies in the si dangling bond was recorded in the powder epr analysis revealing that its paramagnetic intrinsic defects are responsible for the photocatalytic performance under uv irradiation further the correlation of the si1 atomic content and photocatalytic efficiency provided direct evidence to clarify that si1 associated with oxygen vacancies is the key element for mb photodegradation si psac under uva365 irradiation showed in addition to mb removal excellent removal efficiencies of anionic dyes and edcs owing to the properties of adsorption and photocatalysis si1 containing si psac showed a high application potential in wastewater treatment for not only dyes but also other organic pollutants in addition continuous flow column experiments showed that si psac under uva365 irradiation extended the column lifespan by more than 16 fold for mb removal compared to the lifespan for a pure adsorption column since this research initiated and focused on the fundamental understanding of si psac which can be abundantly supplied a study on the actual application of si psac or si1 doped carbon materials for wastewater treatment is highly recommended to extend full scale wastewater treatment declaration of competing interest none acknowledgement this work was supported by national research foundation
