17595,the poor biodegradability of waste activated sludge was is widely regarded as one of the main bottlenecks in the fermentation of sludge and is attributed mainly to the complex nature of sludge in this study the physical structure and interfacial thermodynamics of sludge which reflect its complex nature were explored to reveal the effects of isoelectric point pi pretreatment on enhancing the production of volatile fatty acids vfa it was observed that the maximum vfa production and the initial vfa production rate increased by 151 2 and 46 6 respectively after pi pretreatment which indicates that pi pretreatment significantly improved the generation efficiency of vfa the experimental results of 12 day acidogenic fermentation assays following pi pretreatment show that the maximum concentrations of soluble total organic carbon soluble protein and soluble polysaccharide increased by 209 8 148 9 and 84 5 respectively and the maximal proportion of low molecular weight 1 kda soluble organic substances increased by 92 4 thus confirming that pi pretreatment can promote organic solubilisation and hydrolysis in sludge the analyses of changes in the fractal dimension df the spatial configuration of extracellular polymeric substances and the interfacial non covalent interaction energy of sludge during the fermentation process reveal that pi pretreatment can loosen the physical structure promote the spatial extension of biopolymer molecular chains and increase the driving forces of solid liquid interfacial enzymatic reactions it is thus hypothesised that these changes could be responsible for the high degree of organic solubilisation hydrolysis and acidification of was which is further confirmed by correlation analyses of the df and interfacial free energy versus vfa production these findings are expected to provide a possible means to improve the biodegradability of sludge via its pi to trigger dismantling of the sludge structure and increase the driving forces of interfacial enzymatic reactions graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords energy anaerobic digestion sewage sludge sludge structure interfacial tension biodegradability 1 introduction the activated sludge process is amongst the world s most widely used biological technologies for wastewater treatment large amounts of waste activated sludge was are inevitably produced in wastewater treatment plants fang et al 2020 xu et al 2020a by the end of 2019 sludge production calculated with an 80 moisture content in china exceeded 50 0 million tons year and it is estimated to exceed 65 0 million tons year between 2020 and 2025 more importantly was contains large amounts of perishable organic pollutants that can cause extensive environmental pollution if left untreated fermentation of was for production of volatile fatty acids vfa has attracted increasing interest and has become a promising technology in sludge stabilisation and resource recovery fang et al 2020 alloul et al 2018 the produced vfa is a high value product that can be used as a raw substrate for the production of biodegradable plastic for the generation of bioenergy and as a preferred carbon source for biological nutrient removal microbes wang et al 2018 lee et al 2014 however the production of vfa from was is usually limited by a slow hydrolysis rate and poor biodegradation due to the poor understanding of functional anaerobic microorganisms and the complex nature of sludge various strategies have been considered to overcome these problems and improve vfa production some studies have focused on the operating conditions of acidogenic fermentation reactors i e temperature ph hydraulic retention time headspace pressure organic loading rate and co fermentation and sought to enhance vfa production by promoting the activities of functional anaerobic microorganisms and enzymes for instance many studies have indicated that vfa production can be improved by 20 to 200 by increasing the fermentation temperature which is attributed mainly to increases in the activities of enzymes fang et al 2020 yuan et al 2016 2011 because alkaline conditions can inhibit methanogenesis and enhance organic solubilisation azman et al 2015 concluded that the optimal ph for the maximum accumulation of vfa lies between 8 and 11 in addition ersahin et al 2016 proposed that a long hydraulic retention time results in a long contact time between the organic matter and the acetogens resulting in high fermentative efficiency which was further proven by jankowska et al 2015 yan et al 2014 reported that reducing the headspace pressure can create a sustainable structure in which the h2 and co2 could be used by homo acetogenic bacteria and thus lead to the accumulation of vfas yuan et al 2019 reviewed current studies of the effect of the organic loading rate on vfa production and found that although a high organic load is usually used to improve acid production the organic loading rate cannot exceed the threshold appropriate value or it will deteriorate the balance of functional microorganisms and reduce vfa production huang et al 2016 found that hydrolysis and biodegradation can be improved by co fermentation mainly due to the optimisation of microbial metabolism although it is important to understand and regulate the functional microorganisms in an acidogenic fermentation system it is also crucial to dismantle the complex structure of sludge for example with the same operating conditions in the fermentation reactor the vfa production from other organic solid wastes such as food waste kitchen waste and vegetable waste is far greater than that from was lee et al 2014 because of the complex structure of sludge it is widely acknowledged that hydrolysis of sludge is the rate limiting step during the fermentation process gonzalez et al 2018 xu et al 2020a sanders 2001 therefore some other studies have examined various pretreatment methods to enhance the organic solubilisation and hydrolysis of sludge liu et al 2009 gonzalez et al 2018 ariunbaatar et al 2014 based on the published literatures the pretreatment methods used before acidogenic fermentation of sludge can usually be classified as physical pretreatments ultrasonic thermal microwave etc neumann et al 2017 yu et al 2010 chemical pretreatments free nitrous acid alkali surfactant ozone etc lu et al 2020 wang et al 2013 braguglia et al 2012 xiao et al 2015 huang et al 2015 biological pretreatments enzymes fang et al 2020 yang et al 2010 and combined pretreatments thermo acid thermo alkaline surfactant enzyme microwave alkaline etc fang et al 2020 ruffino et al 2015 xu et al 2014 although different levels of these pretreatment methods have been reported to effectively improve vfa production they are usually tailored to certain conditions and are therefore difficult to compare for example thermal pretreatment has been reported to effectively improve vfa production but this improvement is mainly due to the enhancement of sludge organic solubilisation gonzalez et al 2018 xue et al 2015 dai et al 2017 enzyme pretreatments can also effectively promote the vfa production which has been attributed to the enhancement of sludge organic hydrolysis fang et al 2020 in fact the organic solubilisation hydrolysis and even biodegradability of sludge are usually determined by the sludge s complex structure but which key factors for maintaining this complex structure are eliminated by pretreatment unfortunately the traditional pretreatment methods have ignored this question in our previous study we proposed that as organic binding metals are the cornerstone of the structural stability of sludge xu et al 2017a the complex structure of sludge could be dismantled by removing organic binding metals via isoelectric point pi pretreatment which is a novel strategy that allows most organic matter in the sludge to be retained while removing organic binding metals via solid liquid separation we also found that anaerobic digestion of sludge was significantly enhanced after pi pretreatment xu et al 2018a which suggests that pi pretreatment could be an effective method for dismantling the complex structure of sludge and thereby improving its biodegradability in general in the acidogenic fermentation process the physical structure of sludge is first collapsed and the biopolymers of sludge are then solubilised and hydrolysed into monomer molecules i e amino acids monosaccharides and long chain fatty acids at the solid liquid interface of sludge finally these monomers are further fermented into vfas it is noteworthy that a series of substantial changes must occur in the structural stability and the interfacial property of sludge during this process the former is usually related to its physical structure and the latter is related to the solid liquid interfacial thermodynamics of sludge therefore we hypothesised that pi pretreatment can dismantle the complex structure of sludge and cause substantial changes in the physical structure of sludge and in the solid liquid interfacial thermodynamics of sludge consequently the structural stability of biopolymers in sludge could be destroyed and the driving forces of interfacial enzymatic reactions increased finally resulting in increased vfa production during the acidogenic fermentation process the main objective of this study was to develop a novel strategy to improve vfa production from was by changing the physical structure and solid liquid interfacial thermodynamics of sludge via pi pretreatment accordingly the improvement of vfa production after pi pretreatment was confirmed and it was shown that pi pretreatment significantly increased organic solubilisation and hydrolysis in sludge the changes in the physical structure and in the solid liquid interfacial thermodynamics of sludge with and without pi pretreatment were investigated during the acidogenic fermentation process finally the underlying relationships between the fractal dimension and between interfacial free energy and vfa production were revealed to the best of our knowledge this might be the first attempt to explore the effect of pi pretreatment on acidogenic fermentation of was from the perspective of sludge structure and interfacial thermodynamics 2 materials and methods 2 1 characteristics and isoelectric point measurement of sludge was collected from a municipal wastewater treatment plant of shanghai in china the inoculum for the acidogenic fermentation test was obtained from a 30 day mesophilic semi continuous anaerobic sludge digester at the lab scale the basic characteristics of the different sludge samples are summarised in table s1 supplementary materials sm the isoelectric point pi of the sludge was determined by measuring its zeta potential ζ wang et al 2012 xu et al 2018a and the ζ values of the raw sludge at various ph values are shown in figure s1 sm detailed information on the pi measurement is given in text s1 sm 2 2 pi pretreatment process three hundred ml of the total was transferred into a 500 ml beaker and the ph was controlled at 3 8 pi 3 8 in this study with the addition of 4 m hcl the resulting mixture was then stirred 250 rpm at 25 c for 5 h as a control sample 300 ml of was without ph adjustment was transferred into a 500 ml beaker and subject to the same treatment after agitation the pretreated sludge was transferred into centrifugation tubes and centrifuged at 10 000g for 20 min to separate the solids from the solution the solid residues were collected and then resuspended in the original volume 300 ml using deionised water and stored at 4 c until used the resuspended sludge that had been subjected to acid pretreatment was named experimental group sludge eg and the non acid pretreated sample was named control group sludge cg the basic characteristics of the sludge samples eg and cg are summarised in table s1 sm all of the samples eg and cg used in subsequent tests were prepared according to the process described above 2 3 acidogenic fermentation process of sludge the 12 day acidogenic fermentation tests of the sludge samples eg and cg were conducted with an air bath shaker 120 rpm at 37 c and the ratio of inoculum to substrate was set to 1 2 calculated using vs sixty bottles with a working volume of 250 ml were prepared for each sludge sample 44 3 g of eg 57 5 g of cg and 13 1 g of inoculum and each sludge sample has two parallel groups 13 1 g of inoculum was pre treated at 102 c for 30 min to kill methanogens oh et al 2003 and then added to each bottle after cooling to room temperature all of the bottles were controlled at an 80 ml using deionised water bottles with 13 1 g of inoculum and 66 9 g of deionised water were used as blank tests before starting the tests the ph values of each sample were neutralised to approximately 7 0 then all bottles were capped and sealed after flushing with nitrogen gas for 30 s on the 0th 1st 2nd 3rd 4th 5th 6th 8th 10th and 12th days two bottles for each sample eg cg and blank were removed from the air bath shaker respectively and the main parameters such as soluble total organic carbon stoc vfa molecular weight mw distribution in solutions soluble protein and soluble polysaccharide contents were analysed by subtracting the influence of the inoculum in addition the ζ values of eg and cg sludge samples from fermentation process were also measured and shown in figure s2 sm the average values and standard deviations were calculated from three measurements 2 4 structural characterisation of sludge and extracellular polymeric substance the physical structure of the sludge was characterised by its fractal dimension df its spatial configuration of extracellular polymeric substances eps and the spatial morphology of its extracellular proteins the df and average particle size d 4 3 of sludge samples was determined by small angle light scattering using a laser particle size analyser mastersizer 2000e malvern panalytical uk according to guan et al 1998 and detailed information on the measurement and calculation is given in text s2 sm the spatial configuration of eps was characterised by laser light scattering measurement using a dls sls spectrometer bi 200sm brookhaven usa equipped with a solid state laser λ0 532 nm wang et al 2012 xu et al 2018b and detailed procedures for the eps extraction laser light scattering measurement and calculation are described in text s3 sm in addition the spatial morphology of extracellular proteins in sludge was in situ analysed by confocal laser scanning microscopy leica tcs sp5 ii germany xu et al 2020b wagner et al 2009 the resulting images are shown in figure s3 sm and the detailed procedures for the measurement are described in text s4 sm 2 5 interfacial thermodynamic characteristics of sludge the changes in the solid liquid interfacial thermodynamics of sludge samples during the fermentation process were estimated via contact angle measurement jc2000d powereach shanghai china liu et al 2007 2008 specifically 5 ml of sludge evenly pumped and passed through 0 45 μm acetate cellulose membrane filters which were then placed on a 1 agar plate for 4 h to reach a solid liquid interface equilibrium before measurement the membranes with sludge were mounted on glass slides and air dried for 10 min and the contact angles were directly measured via the sessile drop technique with a drop of the liquid s water 1 bromonaphthalene and formamide the main surface tension parameters of these liquids are summarised in table s2 sm the average contact angle values and standard deviations were all obtained from at least 10 independent measurements and are summarised in table s3 sm it is well known that the total surface tension γi for a surface i is composed of an apolar lifshitz van der waals lw surface tension γ i l w and a polar lewis acid base ab surface tension γ i l w van oss c j 2006 liu et al 2008 therefore the total surface tension of sludge particles and liquid can be expressed as eq 1 and eq 2 respectively 1 γ s γ s l w γ s a b 2 γ l γ l l w γ l a b the surface tension of sludge is calculated by eq 3 3 1 cos θ γ l 2 γ s l w γ l l w 1 2 γ s γ l 1 2 γ s γ l 1 2 where θ is the contact angle between the sludge surface and the drop liquid and γ s γ l and γ s γ l are the electron acceptor and electron donor parameters respectively the γl γ l l w γ l and γ l values of the water 1 bromonaphthalene and formamide can be found in table s2 sm based on the eqs 1 3 the total interfacial tensions γsl between the sludge surface and water can be calculated with eqs 4 6 van oss c j 2006 and the interfacial free energy ife δ g s l i f e the lw interaction energy δ g s l l w and the ab interaction energy δ g s l a b between the sludge particles and water can be calculated from eq 7 eq 8 and eq 9 respectively van oss 2006 liu et al 2007 in addition the effective hamaker constant asls between the sludge particles and water was also calculated with eq 10 and shown in figure s4 sm and the electrostatic el interaction energy δ g s l s e l between sludge particles at the minimum equilibrium distance can also be calculated by eq 11 according to liu et al 2007 4 γ s l γ s l l w γ s l a b 5 γ s l l w γ s l w γ l l w 2 6 γ s l a b 2 γ

1951 as the standard and the polysaccharide concentration was determined via the anthrone method with glucose as the standard dreywood 1946 the mw distribution of the soluble organic matter and vfa concentrations in the eg and cg during the fermentation process were determined via high performance size exclusion chromatography agilent 1100 series usa and via gas chromatography shimadzu gc 1020 plus japan respectively 3 results and discussion 3 1 volatile fatty acid production and compositions from sludge variations in the vfa production and compositions over time from the cg and eg sludge samples are shown in fig 1 as shown in fig 1 a and b during the 12 day acidogenic fermentation process the vfa production from both cg and eg first increased over time 4 days but then decreased over time this consequence is consistent with the findings of huang et al 2015 who also found a decrease in vfa production after 4 days of fermentation one explanation for this phenomenon is that the methanogen activity is recovered and the vfa is consumed by the methanogen over time during the fermentation process zhao et al 2018 fig 1 a shows that the maximal vfa production from the cg was 208 2 5 3 mg cod g vs which was achieved on the 4th day and is similar to the reported results jiang et al 2009 thus indicating that the acidogenic fermentation process in this study was normal as seen from fig 1 b the maximal vfa production from the eg 523 1 6 5 mg cod g vs also appeared on the 4th day and was more than twice that from the cg thus indicating that the pi pretreatment efficiently enhanced vfa production from was it should be emphasised that the cg s vfa production increased from 33 2 2 4 mg cod g vs to 112 7 3 2 mg cod g vs from day 0 to day 1 with an initial vfa production rate of 239 5 whilst over the same time period the eg s vfa production increased from 49 9 3 8 mg cod g vs to 225 1 4 6 mg cod g vs with an initial vfa production rate of 351 1 which was significantly higher than that of the cg this result indicates that the vfa production rate was also increased with the effect of pi pretreatment clearly the sludge with pi pretreatment showed a great vfa production and a rapid rate during the fermentation process which indicates that pi pretreatment not only improves vfa production but also promotes more efficient vfa production consistent with previous reports pang et al 2020 he et al 2016 li et al 2015 acetate and propionate were the main components of vfa in both the cg and eg in the first 4 days of fermentation other individual vfa such as iso valerate iso butyrate n butyrate and n valerate were also observed fig 1 a and b acetate propionate iso valerate iso butyrate n butyrate and n valerate were present in higher concentrations in the eg than in the cg for example on the 4th day pi pretreatment increased the concentrations of acetate propionate iso valerate iso butyrate n butyrate and n valerate by 205 9 82 7 96 7 284 4 167 3 and 237 9 respectively which indicates that pi pretreatment significantly increases the production of the individual vfa an interesting phenomenon is that in the first 5 days the vfa profiles of the eg and cg were similar except for a slight variation in n valerate concentration specifically on the 4th and 5th days n valerate was found only in low concentrations 6 0 mg cod g vs in the cg but was present throughout the fermentation process in the eg maximum concentration 18 6 1 2 mg cod g vs on the 4th day likely because n valerate is primarily formed via the stickland reaction of proline and arginine liu et al 2012 batstone et al 2003 as these two amino acids easily form complexes with multivalent metals they usually exist as metal complexes in the cg rendering fermentation into n valerate difficult he et al 2015 however with the effect of pi pre treatment multivalent metals can be removed from these proline metal and arginine metal complexes thus the free proline and arginine in the eg ferment into n valerate in high concentrations another noteworthy phenomenon is that from the 6th day to the 12th day vfa compositions were more abundant in the eg than in the cg likely because pi pretreatment releases amino acids i e proline arginine lysine valine and leucine from the amino acid metal complexes in the sludge these free amino acids readily ferment into various components of vfa via the stickland reaction batstone et al 2003 resulting in relatively high concentrations of iso valerate iso butyrate n butyrate and n valerate in the eg these components of vfa are not easy to be fully transformed within a short period of time 3 2 sludge organic solubilisation and hydrolysis usually sludge organic solubilisation and hydrolysis can be characterised by changes in the concentrations of soluble organics and in mw distributions respectively xu et al 2017a it is clear that the solubilisation and hydrolysis reactions of sludge organic matter usually occur simultaneously throughout the acidogenic fermentation process khanal 2008 classical thermodynamics holds that these reactions will always spontaneously change from a non equilibrium state to an equilibrium state during the fermentation process resulting in a gradual decrease in the changes of soluble organic concentrations and mw distributions over time in contrast if changes in the soluble organic concentrations and mw distributions could fluctuate greatly in a particular system the corresponding solubilisation reaction and hydrolysis reaction would not reach a state of equilibrium in the system which suggests that such a system could have great potential for increasing the extent of solubilisation and hydrolysis of sludge fig 2 illustrates the changes in the stoc concentrations soluble protein concentrations and soluble polysaccharide concentrations from cg and eg sludge samples during the 12 day acidogenic fermentation process fig 3 shows the changes in the main mw distributions of soluble organic substances over time as shown in fig 2 a analogous to the changes in vfa production over time the stoc concentrations from both cg and eg also first increased 4 days and then decreased 5 to 12 days during the fermentation process which indicates that over the first 4 days the catabolic transformation rate of soluble organic matter i e the transformation of soluble organic matter into biogas and biomass was lower than its solubilisation rate and over the next 5 to 12 days the converse was true an interesting phenomenon was that although the stoc concentration from the eg showed a decreasing trend from the 4th day to the 12th day it increased intermittently in the process of decreasing for example it increased from the 5th day to the 6th day and from the 8th day to the 10th day fig 2 a this differs greatly from the trend of the cg in which the stoc concentration from the cg decreased at all times from the 4th day to the 12th day possibly because the solid liquid interface of the eg sludge was altered by the pi pretreatment which not only enhanced the initial organic solubilisation of sludge but also improved the subsequent organic solubilisation throughout the fermentation process however for the untreated cg sludge the organic solubilisation reaction on the solid liquid interface of the sludge soon reached equilibrium and no obvious increase in organic solubilisation can be seen during the fermentation process fig 2 a shows that the stoc concentration from the eg was always higher than that from the cg specifically the maximum value for the stoc concentration from the eg was 1564 5 36 0 mg l on the 4th day which was more three times than that of the gc 505 0 20 3 mg l which indicates that the organic solubilisation of sludge is significantly improved during the fermentation process due to pi pretreatment these results in turn could be used to support the results of vfa production moreover as can be seen from fig 2 b and c although the overall trend is similar to changes in the stoc concentrations from both the cg and the eg some specific changes in the soluble protein and polysaccharide concentrations have their own characteristics during the fermentation process for example the changes in the soluble protein concentrations over time from the cg are consistent with the changes in the stoc concentration in the cg but the changes in the soluble protein concentrations in the eg differed slightly from those of the stoc in the eg with a wide fluctuation platform period 5 to 12 days which suggests that the effects of pi pretreatment are accompanied by more intense decomposition and solid liquid transformation reactions of sludge protein during the fermentation process these results also indicate that the effects of pi pretreatment on the transformation of sludge protein are more significant presumably due to proteins being amphoteric biological macromolecules whose structures and functional groups play a decisive role in the properties of the solid liquid interface bitton 2002 van loosdrecht et al 1990 neu 1996 as shown in fig 2 c the soluble polysaccharide concentrations in the cg and eg have less time to reach the maximum value 2 days than the stoc concentration which indicates that the soluble polysaccharide is more easily decomposed and transformed than other organic matter i e protein which is also supported by the studies of miron et al 2000 and yang et al 2015 who found that carbohydrates were easier to hydrolyse and ferment than proteins in addition fig 2 b and c show that the soluble protein concentrations and soluble polysaccharide concentrations from the eg were both invariably higher than those in the cg throughout the fermentation process which indicates that the pi pretreatment significantly enhanced the solubilisation of protein and polysaccharide in sludge we were interested to note that the maximal soluble protein concentration 582 9 16 0 mg l from the eg was more than twice that from the cg however the maximum soluble polysaccharide concentration 115 5 4 5 mg l from the eg was less than twice that from the cg which indicates that pi pretreatment enhances the solubilisation of proteins more than polysaccharides during the fermentation process this may be attributable to the removal of a certain amount of multivalent metals that can bind carboxyl moieties of proteins from the sludge during pi pretreatment table s1 sm and the fact that the sludge s protein stability was weakened without the metals novak et al 2003 xu et al 2018a 2017a thereby resulting in a high solubilisation of protein fig 3 shows that the average proportion of high mw 2000 kda soluble organic substances extracted from the cg during the 12 day acidogenic fermentation process exceeded 3 3 whilst that from the eg accounted for less than 1 8 which indicates that pi pretreatment is conductive to depolymerising biopolymers of sludge during the fermentation process in particular the high mw 2000 kda soluble organic substances from the cg accounted for 4 2 which was more than twice that from the eg 1 6 on day 0 fig 3 this indicates that without the effects of the fermentation process the biopolymers of sludge can also be significantly depolymerised via pi pretreatment moreover the proportion of low mw 1 kda soluble organic substances obtained from the eg was always greater than that obtained from the cg throughout the fermentation process for example the maximal proportion of low mw 1 kda soluble organic substances obtained from the eg accounted for 68 3 which was about twice that of the cg which demonstrates that the extent of the hydrolysis of soluble organic substances can be significantly enhanced by pi pretreatment in addition as shown in fig 3 within 1 day from day 0 to day 1 the proportion of low mw 1 kda soluble organic substances from the eg increased from 15 3 to 45 8 with an initial increasing rate of 199 3 which was more than five times that obtained from the cg with an initial increasing rate of 39 4 these results indicate that pi pretreatment can significantly improve the initial rate of hydrolysis in sludge organic matter another interesting phenomenon about the changes in the low mw 1 kda proportion is that although the overall trend from the cg and eg was similar fig 3 that is the proportion of low mw 1 kda soluble organic substances from both cg and eg first increased day 0 to day 4 and then decreased from day 5 to day 12 during the fermentation process the degree of variation of low mw 1 kda proportion with time from eg was greater than that from the cg for example during the 5 to 12 day fermentation process the proportion of low mw 1 kda soluble organic substances obtained from the cg decreased all the time whilst that from the eg intermittently increased with increases seen from the 5th day to the 6th day and from the 8th day to the 10th day respectively which indicates that within 5 to 12 days the hydrolysis reaction in the eg was in a non equilibrium state thus suggesting that pi pretreatment could promote the hydrolysis reaction potential of sludge presumably by enhancing the disintegration of the sludge s physical structure and the improvement of the sludge s solid liquid interfacial thermodynamics according to the above mentioned discussions figs 1 3 we hypothesised that pi pretreatment can collapse the physical structure of sludge and improve its solid liquid interfacial thermodynamic properties consequently more sludge organic matter is transformed from a solid state into a liquid state and from biopolymers to vfas with an accompanying high degree of organic solubilisation hydrolysis and acidification reactions resulting in high acidogenic fermentation efficiency 3 3 physical structures of sludge and the corresponding epss to reveal the manner in which the pi pretreatment enhanced the sludge s organic solubilisation hydrolysis and acidification by changing its physical structure the changes in the fractal dimension df of sludge and the spatial configuration of the eps in the sludge during the fermentation process were explored the df values of cg and eg sludge samples during the 12 day acidogenic fermentation process are shown in fig 4 the main parameters of spatial configuration of eps from the cg and the eg are shown in table s4 sm and fig 5 illustrates the changes in the ρ rg rh values of eps from the cg and the eg during the fermentation process the df of sludge has been reported to characterise its physical structure li 1989 xu et al 2020a b a high df value usually means that sludge flocs have a compact structure with small pores in the sludge interior which suggests low molecular mobility in the sludge conversely the lower the df value the looser the physical structure of the sludge and the greater its organic molecular mobility li 1989 xu et al 2020a b as shown in fig 4 the df values of sludge samples from both the cg and the eg during the fermentation process all changed from 2 26 to 2 33 consistent with the findings of wu et al 2002 who proposed that the df values of irregular particles with a rough surface usually ranged from 2 to 3 the initial df value of sludge from the cg was higher than that from the eg indicating that the initial physical structure of the sludge from the cg was more compact than that from eg figure s3 sm and that pi pretreatment can disintegrate the sludge s physical structure one interesting phenomenon visible in fig 4 is that the df value of the sludge from the eg was always lower than that from the cg throughout the fermentation process which indicates that the pi pretreatment made the physical structure of sludge from the eg looser than that from the cg throughout the fermentation process suggesting that the sludge from the eg has greater organic molecular mobility than that from the cg previous studies found that high organic molecular mobility usually resulted in a high degree of sludge organic solubilisation and hydrolysis xu et al 2017a b it is thus reasonable to believe that pi pretreatment can improve the sludge s organic solubilisation and hydrolysis by disintegrating the sludge s physical structure fig 4 shows that the df values of eg and cg sludge samples first decreased and then increased during the fermentation process thus indicating that the sludge s physical structure changes from compact to loose and then from loose to compact again during the fermentation process moreover it should be noted that the fluctuation in the df value of sludge from the eg was more obvious than that from the cg during the fermentation process which indicates that a more drastic change occurred in the eg sludge s physical structure this may be due to the fact that the pi pretreatment collapsed the sludge s initial physical structure facilitating a high degree of the subsequent sludge organic solubilisation and hydrolysis reactions in turn the intense transformation reactions of the sludge organic matter could reconstruct the sludge s physical structure periodically throughout the fermentation process resulting in substantial changes in its physical structure it is clear that eps can bridge bacterial cells to create a three dimensional matrix in sludge and it is widely acknowledged as the backbone of sludge bitton 2002 xu et al 2017a thus the spatial configuration of eps can be responsible for the sludge s structural stability the rg and rh values of a biopolymer which are related to the shape properties of a biopolymer are typically used to ascertain the spatial configuration of the eps teraoka 2002 xu et al 2018b b notably the ρ rg rh value is a very important parameter that is directly related to the biopolymer s chain architecture and conformation based on the ρ value of the biopolymer the spatial shape of the eps can be identified as a homogeneous non draining sphere ρ 0 78 microgels ρ 0 50 a random coil 1 00 ρ 2 00 and a rigid rod ρ 2 00 xu et al 2018b wang et al 2013 kazakov et al 2002 as shown in fig 5 one obvious difference in the ρ values of eps between the cg and the eg can be found in the first 8 days which indicates that the eps from the cg and the eg have different spatial shapes the ρ value of eps from the cg on day 0 was 0 79 0 06 which is close to 0 78 which suggests that the shape of the initial eps from the cg is that of a dense globule however the ρ value of eps from the eg was 1 42 0 05 on day 0 which is between 1 00 and 2 00 which indicates that the shape of the initial eps from the eg was that of a random coil it has been reported that the ρ value for completely extended chains is approximately 1 50 xu et al 2018b wang et al 2013 here the ρ value is 1 42 0 05 so it is reasonable that the initial eps from the eg on day 0 had nearly completely extended chains in addition the ρ values of eps from the eg on the 2nd 4th and 8th days were all greater than 0 78 whilst those from the cg on the 2nd 4th and 8th days were all less than 0 5 which suggests that the molecular chains of eps from the eg have higher ductility than that from the cg in the first 8 days these results indicate that the pi pretreatment can significantly promote the spatial extension of biopolymer chains in sludge which is conductive to the biodegradation of biopolymers based on previous studies in which a random coil shaped biopolymer is more easily biodegraded than a dense globule shaped biopolymer xu et al 2018b moreover it is noteworthy that the ρ values of the eps from the eg and the cg were decreased during the fermentation process for the eg the ρ values of the eps decreased from 1 42 0 05 to 0 36 0 03 indicating that the spatial shape of the eps changed from a random coil shape in the first 4 days to a dense globule shape on the 8th day and then to microgels on the 12th day for the cg the ρ values of eps decreased from 0 79 0 06 to 0 21 0 04 indicating that the spatial shape of eps changed from a dense globule shape on the 0th day to microgels from the 2nd day to the 12th day it is thus concluded that the biopolymers from the eg have a higher degree of spatial extension than the cg throughout the fermentation process indicating that the biopolymer from the eg is more easily biodegraded which suggests that a greater number of depolymerisation reactions i e hydrolysis of biopolymers occurred in the eg which is consistent with the extent of hydrolysis of sludge organic matter in the eg fig 3 one logical explanation for these results is that the effects of pi pretreatment allow the removal of multivalent metals that bridge biopolymers to form a dense globule shape table s1 sm meaning that the interfacial forces that act in aqueous media to maintain the dense globule shape of eps are perturbed the structural stability of the eps is destroyed resulting in random coil shaped eps however during the fermentation process the extended chains of biopolymers are biodegraded and the interfacial forces that maintain the biopolymer s random coil shape are again changed thus the spatial shape of the eps change again from a random coil shape back to a dense globule shape or even to microgels 3 4 solid liquid interfacial thermodynamics of sludge to further understand the driving forces of the pi pretreatment that lead to the change in the physical structure of the sludge and eps the effects of pi pretreatment on the solid liquid interfacial thermodynamics i e non covalent interaction energy of sludge were explored it is clear that the main non covalent interactions between biological and non biological macromolecules surfaces and particles can be identified as lifshitz van der waals lw interactions lewis acid base ab interactions el interactions and brownian movement br interactions van oss 2006 because the br interaction energy is often one or two orders of magnitude less than those associated with ab or lw interaction energies it is commonly neglected grasso et al 2002 from the perspective of material structure sludge can be considered to be composed of biological and non biological macromolecules surfaces and particles xu et al 2020a therefore the main non covalent interaction energies of sludge comprise lw interaction energy δ g s l l w ab interaction energy δ g s l a b and el interaction energy δ g s l s e l which is consistent with the extended derjaguin landau verwey overbeek dlvo theory grasso et al 2002 meinders et al 1995 the lw interaction caused by interatomic or intermolecular attraction between neutral atoms or molecules is usually used to characterize a general attractive interaction between two molecules and particles based on the electron donor and electron acceptor interactions the ab interaction which is polar is closely related to hydrogen bonding interactions and structural effects i e hydrophobic interaction and hydration pressure in addition the el interaction originates from molecules or particles with the same sign of charge in a polar liquid which is strongly dependant on the ionic strength near the molecule s or particle s surface in the liquid the changes in the interfacial lw ab and el interaction tensions of sludge samples from eg and cg throughout the fermentation process are shown in figures s5 s6 and s7 respectively sm and the changes in the ife of eg and cg sludge samples throughout the fermentation process are shown in figure s8 sm fig 6 depicts the statistical analyses of the changes in the δ g s l l w δ g s l a b and δ g s l s e l values of eg and cg sludge samples throughout the fermentation process via boxplots fig 6 shows that the fluctuation of changes in the δ g s l l w δ g s l a b and δ g s l s e l values of sludge samples from the eg throughout the fermentation process were higher than those from the cg respectively indicating that the solid liquid interfacial interactions of the sludge from the eg are more intense than those from the cg during the fermentation process it thus can be proposed that pi pretreatment can promote the solid liquid interfacial reactions of sludge during the fermentation process which was confirmed by the results of organic solubilisation hydrolysis and acidification in figs 1 3 obviously as shown in fig 6 of the three main interfacial interaction energies the δ g s l a b of sludge has the largest absolute value and exhibits the largest variation in both the eg and the cg during the fermentation process followed by the δ g s l l w and any one of them δ g s l a b and δ g s l l w is far higher than the δ g s l s e l which indicates that the ab interaction i e hydrogen bonding hydrophobic interaction and hydration pressure and the lw interaction i e intermolecular attraction interaction are the dominant interfacial interactions of sludge during the fermentation process usually a positive δ g s l a b value indicates a hydrophilic solid liquid interface and a negative δ g s l a b value indicates a hydrophobic solid liquid interface van oss 2006 fig 6 shows that most δ g s l a b values of the eg sludge were negative and the median δ g s l a b value was approximately 9 45 mj m2 during the fermentation process whilst nearly all δ g s l a b values of sludge from cg during the fermentation process were positive indicating that throughout the fermentation process the hydrophilicity and hydrophobicity of the sludge surface from the eg was altered and was usually hydrophobic however the sludge from the cg was hydrophilic throughout the whole fermentation process these findings also can be used to explain the phenomenon in which a high degree of sludge organic solubilisation and hydrolysis reactions were obtained during the fermentation process figs 2 and 3 because it has been reported that the hydrophilicity and hydrophobicity of sludge are determined primarily by the surface functional groups of sludge organic matter liu et al 2008 and that these surface functional groups are also potential binding sites for enzymes robert 2000 islam et al 2017 xu et al 2017b whereby the changes in hydrophilicity and hydrophobicity will inevitably lead to changes in the interfacial enzymatic reactions of sludge organic matter which is supported by previous studies vogler 1998 van loosdrecht et al 1990 tanford 1978 moreover although no obvious difference was seen in the average δ g s l l w value between eg and cg the degree of variation in the δ g s l l w values of eg was higher than that of cg during the fermentation process fig 6 which indicates that the pi pretreatment can increase changes in the attractive interactions of the sludge surface which also suggests that the pi pretreatment can change the intermolecular attraction interactions of sludge organic molecules this result is also supported by the higher values of the effective hamaker constant asls in the eg than in the cg figure s4 sm because the higher the asls value the greater the intermolecular attraction van oss 2006 liu et al 2007 in fact the intermolecular attraction interaction is a very important driving force for enzyme molecules to contact substrate and form enzyme substrate binary complex which is widely acknowledged as the first step in an enzymatic reactions robert 2000 therefore it can be concluded that the pi pretreatment significantly changed the solid liquid interfacial thermodynamics of sludge increased the degree of variation in the sludge s hydrophilicity hydrophobicity and enhanced the driving forces of enzymatic reactions on the sludge surface in addition an interesting phenomenon in the inserted graph in fig 6 shows that the degree of variation in the δ g s l s e l values of sludge from eg was significantly greater than that in sludge from cg during the fermentation process and that the average δ g s l s e l value of the eg was approximately 4 02 0 21 mj m2 which was greater than that of the cg 3 72 0 15 mj m2 indicating that the pi pretreatment enhanced changes in the sludge surface charges at the minimum distance between sludge particles during the fermentation process this change directly influenced the spatial position of the surface functional groups of sludge which is conducive to exposing more binding sites for the enzymatic reaction xu et al 2017b islam et al 2017 one logical explanation for this proposition is that pi pretreatment released more negatively charged free functional groups from sludge surface by removing the multivalent metals table s1 sm xu et al 2018a which resulted in the structural collapse of the sludge figs 4 and 5 and an increase in the sludge surface charge figure s2 sm meanwhile with the removal of multivalent metals table s1 sm the intrinsic ionic equilibrium in sludge was substantially perturbed so the ionic strength near the sludge surface changed more easily as the fermentation time increases resulting in a significant change in the el interactions between sludge surfaces at the minimum distance fig 6 and figure s7 sm and in the spatial position of the surface functional groups of sludge during the fermentation process fig 5 and table s4 sm moreover the multivalent metal binding functional groups such as phosphoryl carboxyl sulfhydryl and hydroxyl have usually been treated as the binding sites for enzymes robert 2000 wang et al 2000 xu et al 2017b islam et al 2017 it is therefore proposed that the pi pretreatment can also enhance the interfacial reactions by increasing the extent of variation in the el interaction energies of the sludge surface at the minimum distance 3 5 relationships between df and ife versus vfa production in the discussion above we revealed how pi pretreatment can enhance vfa production by disintegrating the physical structure and increasing the degree of variation in the solid liquid interfacial noncovalent interaction energies of sludge to investigate the underlying quantitative relationships between the sludge s physical structure solid liquid interfacial thermodynamics and acidogenic fermentation the correlations between the df data fig 4 and the ife data fig 6 and figure s8 sm versus vfa production data fig 1 of sludge samples from both the eg and the cg during the fermentation process were further analysed fig 7 illustrates the correlation between the df values and vfa production and the corresponding main parameters of the linear relationship are summarised in table s5 sm fig 8 shows the correlation between the ife values and vfa production and the corresponding main parameters of the linear relationship are summarised in table s6 sm as shown in fig 7 as the df values increase the vfa production shows a decreasing trend indicating a negative correlation between the df values and vfa production r 2 0 77 p 0 001 which suggests that the looser the physical structure of the sludge the more favourable the vfa production this is reasonable the sludge s loose physical structure usually comprises a random coil shape of eps with extended chains figs 4 and 5 and table s4 sm and this spatial structure is conductive to the mobility of the enzyme molecules the contact between the enzyme molecules and the substrate and the formation of an enzyme substrate binary complex robert 2000 xu et al 2017a b thereby results in a high degree of solubilisation fig 2 hydrolysis fig 3 and acidification fig 1 during the fermentation process fig 8 shows that as the ife values change from 28 9 2 8 mj m2 to 30 2 2 5 mj m2 the vfa production shows a decreasing trend thus indicating that the vfa production decreased as the sludge surface changed from hydrophobic to hydrophilic which suggests a possible correlation between the hydrophilicity hydrophobicity of the sludge surface and the vfa production from the sludge as shown in fig 8 an obvious negative correlation between the ife value and vfa production was found by correlation analysis r2 0 87 p 0 001 thus indicating that to some extent the hydrophobic surface of sludge is more conducive to the production of vfa during the fermentation process than the hydrophilic surface two logical explanations could be made for this finding 1 a relatively less dense water region with an open hydrogen bonded network exists near the sludge s hydrophobic surface whilst the hydrophilic surface usually has a relatively denser water region with an overlapped hydrogen bonded network vogler 1998 djikaev and ruckenstein 2011 and thereby the resistance of enzyme molecules contacting the hydrophobic surface of sludge is low and it is easier for an enzyme substrate binary complex to form resulting in a high enzymatic activity on the sludge s hydrophobic surface during the fermentation process 2 a large hydrophobic interaction attributable to attractive structural forces can usually be found on a hydrophobic surface for this surface the electron donor and electron acceptor values are both greater than that of water δ g s l a b 0 van oss 2006 grasso et al 2002 and sludge is no exception the hydrophobic surface of sludge with a negative δ g s l a b value has more attractive structural forces i e hydrogen bonding forces and hydrophobic interactions between the sludge s organic molecules fig 6 figures s4 and s6 sm which will drive enzyme molecules to contact the substrate and form enzyme substrate binary complex chandler 2005 resulting in a very productive fermentation reaction however the hydrophilic surface of sludge with a positive δ g s l a b value has more repulsive structural forces i e hydration pressure that will hinder the contact of enzyme molecules with the substrate and the formation of enzyme substrate binary complexes resulting in poor acidogenic fermentation these explanations are also be supported by studies vogler 1998 van loosdrecht et al 1990 van oss 2006 hlady and buijs 1996 that have concluded that protein i e enzymes adsorption usually occurs efficiently on a hydrophobic surface but inefficiently on a hydrophilic surface 4 conclusions on the basis of the phenomenon in which pi pretreatment significantly improved vfa production it was hypothesised that the breakdown of complex structure of sludge can be triggered by pi pretreatment causing a substantial change in the sludge s interfacial thermodynamics and this destroys the structural stability of biopolymers in sludge and increases the driving forces of interfacial enzymatic reactions resulting in a high vfa production in the fermentation process and proven in this paper the main conclusions of this study are as follows 1 the pi pretreatment significantly enhanced the generation efficiency of vfa as demonstrated by increases of 151 2 in maximal vfa production and 46 6 in the initial vfa production rate 2 the pi pretreatment significantly enhanced the organic solubilisation and hydrolysis of sludge for example the maximum concentrations of stoc soluble protein and soluble polysaccharide increased by 209 8 148 9 and 84 5 respectively the maximal proportion of low mw 1 kda soluble organic substances increased by 92 4 and the average proportion of high mw 2000 kda soluble organic substances decreased by 88 4 3 the pi pretreatment can structurally destabilise sludge loosen the sludge s physical structure and promote spatial extension of the biopolymer molecular chains in sludge which is conductive to the depolymerisation and biodegradability of biopolymers in sludge during the fermentation process 4 the pi pretreatment can improve the interfacial thermodynamics of sludge increase the degree of variation in the interfacial non covalent interaction energies of sludge and enhance the driving forces for enzyme molecules to contact with the substrate and form an enzyme substrate binary complex during the fermentation process thereby resulting in enhancement of the interfacial enzymatic reactions 5 a close internal relationship exists between the sludge s physical structure and its solid liquid interfacial thermodynamics versus its acidogenic fermentation to some extent its loose physical structure and hydrophobic surface are conductive to the generation of vfa during the fermentation process these findings do not necessarily challenge the traditional pretreatment methods for the enhancement of acidogenic fermentation of was however the possibility of improving the fermentation of sludge by manipulating the pi of sludge to trigger the breakdown of sludge structure and an increase of the driving forces of interfacial enzymatic reactions should be considered furthermore since the anaerobic digestion of was is heavily dependant on the complex nature of sludge the insights from sludge structure and interfacial thermodynamics proposed in this paper might also be used to enhance

17595,the poor biodegradability of waste activated sludge was is widely regarded as one of the main bottlenecks in the fermentation of sludge and is attributed mainly to the complex nature of sludge in this study the physical structure and interfacial thermodynamics of sludge which reflect its complex nature were explored to reveal the effects of isoelectric point pi pretreatment on enhancing the production of volatile fatty acids vfa it was observed that the maximum vfa production and the initial vfa production rate increased by 151 2 and 46 6 respectively after pi pretreatment which indicates that pi pretreatment significantly improved the generation efficiency of vfa the experimental results of 12 day acidogenic fermentation assays following pi pretreatment show that the maximum concentrations of soluble total organic carbon soluble protein and soluble polysaccharide increased by 209 8 148 9 and 84 5 respectively and the maximal proportion of low molecular weight 1 kda soluble organic substances increased by 92 4 thus confirming that pi pretreatment can promote organic solubilisation and hydrolysis in sludge the analyses of changes in the fractal dimension df the spatial configuration of extracellular polymeric substances and the interfacial non covalent interaction energy of sludge during the fermentation process reveal that pi pretreatment can loosen the physical structure promote the spatial extension of biopolymer molecular chains and increase the driving forces of solid liquid interfacial enzymatic reactions it is thus hypothesised that these changes could be responsible for the high degree of organic solubilisation hydrolysis and acidification of was which is further confirmed by correlation analyses of the df and interfacial free energy versus vfa production these findings are expected to provide a possible means to improve the biodegradability of sludge via its pi to trigger dismantling of the sludge structure and increase the driving forces of interfacial enzymatic reactions graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords energy anaerobic digestion sewage sludge sludge structure interfacial tension biodegradability 1 introduction the activated sludge process is amongst the world s most widely used biological technologies for wastewater treatment large amounts of waste activated sludge was are inevitably produced in wastewater treatment plants fang et al 2020 xu et al 2020a by the end of 2019 sludge production calculated with an 80 moisture content in china exceeded 50 0 million tons year and it is estimated to exceed 65 0 million tons year between 2020 and 2025 more importantly was contains large amounts of perishable organic pollutants that can cause extensive environmental pollution if left untreated fermentation of was for production of volatile fatty acids vfa has attracted increasing interest and has become a promising technology in sludge stabilisation and resource recovery fang et al 2020 alloul et al 2018 the produced vfa is a high value product that can be used as a raw substrate for the production of biodegradable plastic for the generation of bioenergy and as a preferred carbon source for biological nutrient removal microbes wang et al 2018 lee et al 2014 however the production of vfa from was is usually limited by a slow hydrolysis rate and poor biodegradation due to the poor understanding of functional anaerobic microorganisms and the complex nature of sludge various strategies have been considered to overcome these problems and improve vfa production some studies have focused on the operating conditions of acidogenic fermentation reactors i e temperature ph hydraulic retention time headspace pressure organic loading rate and co fermentation and sought to enhance vfa production by promoting the activities of functional anaerobic microorganisms and enzymes for instance many studies have indicated that vfa production can be improved by 20 to 200 by increasing the fermentation temperature which is attributed mainly to increases in the activities of enzymes fang et al 2020 yuan et al 2016 2011 because alkaline conditions can inhibit methanogenesis and enhance organic solubilisation azman et al 2015 concluded that the optimal ph for the maximum accumulation of vfa lies between 8 and 11 in addition ersahin et al 2016 proposed that a long hydraulic retention time results in a long contact time between the organic matter and the acetogens resulting in high fermentative efficiency which was further proven by jankowska et al 2015 yan et al 2014 reported that reducing the headspace pressure can create a sustainable structure in which the h2 and co2 could be used by homo acetogenic bacteria and thus lead to the accumulation of vfas yuan et al 2019 reviewed current studies of the effect of the organic loading rate on vfa production and found that although a high organic load is usually used to improve acid production the organic loading rate cannot exceed the threshold appropriate value or it will deteriorate the balance of functional microorganisms and reduce vfa production huang et al 2016 found that hydrolysis and biodegradation can be improved by co fermentation mainly due to the optimisation of microbial metabolism although it is important to understand and regulate the functional microorganisms in an acidogenic fermentation system it is also crucial to dismantle the complex structure of sludge for example with the same operating conditions in the fermentation reactor the vfa production from other organic solid wastes such as food waste kitchen waste and vegetable waste is far greater than that from was lee et al 2014 because of the complex structure of sludge it is widely acknowledged that hydrolysis of sludge is the rate limiting step during the fermentation process gonzalez et al 2018 xu et al 2020a sanders 2001 therefore some other studies have examined various pretreatment methods to enhance the organic solubilisation and hydrolysis of sludge liu et al 2009 gonzalez et al 2018 ariunbaatar et al 2014 based on the published literatures the pretreatment methods used before acidogenic fermentation of sludge can usually be classified as physical pretreatments ultrasonic thermal microwave etc neumann et al 2017 yu et al 2010 chemical pretreatments free nitrous acid alkali surfactant ozone etc lu et al 2020 wang et al 2013 braguglia et al 2012 xiao et al 2015 huang et al 2015 biological pretreatments enzymes fang et al 2020 yang et al 2010 and combined pretreatments thermo acid thermo alkaline surfactant enzyme microwave alkaline etc fang et al 2020 ruffino et al 2015 xu et al 2014 although different levels of these pretreatment methods have been reported to effectively improve vfa production they are usually tailored to certain conditions and are therefore difficult to compare for example thermal pretreatment has been reported to effectively improve vfa production but this improvement is mainly due to the enhancement of sludge organic solubilisation gonzalez et al 2018 xue et al 2015 dai et al 2017 enzyme pretreatments can also effectively promote the vfa production which has been attributed to the enhancement of sludge organic hydrolysis fang et al 2020 in fact the organic solubilisation hydrolysis and even biodegradability of sludge are usually determined by the sludge s complex structure but which key factors for maintaining this complex structure are eliminated by pretreatment unfortunately the traditional pretreatment methods have ignored this question in our previous study we proposed that as organic binding metals are the cornerstone of the structural stability of sludge xu et al 2017a the complex structure of sludge could be dismantled by removing organic binding metals via isoelectric point pi pretreatment which is a novel strategy that allows most organic matter in the sludge to be retained while removing organic binding metals via solid liquid separation we also found that anaerobic digestion of sludge was significantly enhanced after pi pretreatment xu et al 2018a which suggests that pi pretreatment could be an effective method for dismantling the complex structure of sludge and thereby improving its biodegradability in general in the acidogenic fermentation process the physical structure of sludge is first collapsed and the biopolymers of sludge are then solubilised and hydrolysed into monomer molecules i e amino acids monosaccharides and long chain fatty acids at the solid liquid interface of sludge finally these monomers are further fermented into vfas it is noteworthy that a series of substantial changes must occur in the structural stability and the interfacial property of sludge during this process the former is usually related to its physical structure and the latter is related to the solid liquid interfacial thermodynamics of sludge therefore we hypothesised that pi pretreatment can dismantle the complex structure of sludge and cause substantial changes in the physical structure of sludge and in the solid liquid interfacial thermodynamics of sludge consequently the structural stability of biopolymers in sludge could be destroyed and the driving forces of interfacial enzymatic reactions increased finally resulting in increased vfa production during the acidogenic fermentation process the main objective of this study was to develop a novel strategy to improve vfa production from was by changing the physical structure and solid liquid interfacial thermodynamics of sludge via pi pretreatment accordingly the improvement of vfa production after pi pretreatment was confirmed and it was shown that pi pretreatment significantly increased organic solubilisation and hydrolysis in sludge the changes in the physical structure and in the solid liquid interfacial thermodynamics of sludge with and without pi pretreatment were investigated during the acidogenic fermentation process finally the underlying relationships between the fractal dimension and between interfacial free energy and vfa production were revealed to the best of our knowledge this might be the first attempt to explore the effect of pi pretreatment on acidogenic fermentation of was from the perspective of sludge structure and interfacial thermodynamics 2 materials and methods 2 1 characteristics and isoelectric point measurement of sludge was collected from a municipal wastewater treatment plant of shanghai in china the inoculum for the acidogenic fermentation test was obtained from a 30 day mesophilic semi continuous anaerobic sludge digester at the lab scale the basic characteristics of the different sludge samples are summarised in table s1 supplementary materials sm the isoelectric point pi of the sludge was determined by measuring its zeta potential ζ wang et al 2012 xu et al 2018a and the ζ values of the raw sludge at various ph values are shown in figure s1 sm detailed information on the pi measurement is given in text s1 sm 2 2 pi pretreatment process three hundred ml of the total was transferred into a 500 ml beaker and the ph was controlled at 3 8 pi 3 8 in this study with the addition of 4 m hcl the resulting mixture was then stirred 250 rpm at 25 c for 5 h as a control sample 300 ml of was without ph adjustment was transferred into a 500 ml beaker and subject to the same treatment after agitation the pretreated sludge was transferred into centrifugation tubes and centrifuged at 10 000g for 20 min to separate the solids from the solution the solid residues were collected and then resuspended in the original volume 300 ml using deionised water and stored at 4 c until used the resuspended sludge that had been subjected to acid pretreatment was named experimental group sludge eg and the non acid pretreated sample was named control group sludge cg the basic characteristics of the sludge samples eg and cg are summarised in table s1 sm all of the samples eg and cg used in subsequent tests were prepared according to the process described above 2 3 acidogenic fermentation process of sludge the 12 day acidogenic fermentation tests of the sludge samples eg and cg were conducted with an air bath shaker 120 rpm at 37 c and the ratio of inoculum to substrate was set to 1 2 calculated using vs sixty bottles with a working volume of 250 ml were prepared for each sludge sample 44 3 g of eg 57 5 g of cg and 13 1 g of inoculum and each sludge sample has two parallel groups 13 1 g of inoculum was pre treated at 102 c for 30 min to kill methanogens oh et al 2003 and then added to each bottle after cooling to room temperature all of the bottles were controlled at an 80 ml using deionised water bottles with 13 1 g of inoculum and 66 9 g of deionised water were used as blank tests before starting the tests the ph values of each sample were neutralised to approximately 7 0 then all bottles were capped and sealed after flushing with nitrogen gas for 30 s on the 0th 1st 2nd 3rd 4th 5th 6th 8th 10th and 12th days two bottles for each sample eg cg and blank were removed from the air bath shaker respectively and the main parameters such as soluble total organic carbon stoc vfa molecular weight mw distribution in solutions soluble protein and soluble polysaccharide contents were analysed by subtracting the influence of the inoculum in addition the ζ values of eg and cg sludge samples from fermentation process were also measured and shown in figure s2 sm the average values and standard deviations were calculated from three measurements 2 4 structural characterisation of sludge and extracellular polymeric substance the physical structure of the sludge was characterised by its fractal dimension df its spatial configuration of extracellular polymeric substances eps and the spatial morphology of its extracellular proteins the df and average particle size d 4 3 of sludge samples was determined by small angle light scattering using a laser particle size analyser mastersizer 2000e malvern panalytical uk according to guan et al 1998 and detailed information on the measurement and calculation is given in text s2 sm the spatial configuration of eps was characterised by laser light scattering measurement using a dls sls spectrometer bi 200sm brookhaven usa equipped with a solid state laser λ0 532 nm wang et al 2012 xu et al 2018b and detailed procedures for the eps extraction laser light scattering measurement and calculation are described in text s3 sm in addition the spatial morphology of extracellular proteins in sludge was in situ analysed by confocal laser scanning microscopy leica tcs sp5 ii germany xu et al 2020b wagner et al 2009 the resulting images are shown in figure s3 sm and the detailed procedures for the measurement are described in text s4 sm 2 5 interfacial thermodynamic characteristics of sludge the changes in the solid liquid interfacial thermodynamics of sludge samples during the fermentation process were estimated via contact angle measurement jc2000d powereach shanghai china liu et al 2007 2008 specifically 5 ml of sludge evenly pumped and passed through 0 45 μm acetate cellulose membrane filters which were then placed on a 1 agar plate for 4 h to reach a solid liquid interface equilibrium before measurement the membranes with sludge were mounted on glass slides and air dried for 10 min and the contact angles were directly measured via the sessile drop technique with a drop of the liquid s water 1 bromonaphthalene and formamide the main surface tension parameters of these liquids are summarised in table s2 sm the average contact angle values and standard deviations were all obtained from at least 10 independent measurements and are summarised in table s3 sm it is well known that the total surface tension γi for a surface i is composed of an apolar lifshitz van der waals lw surface tension γ i l w and a polar lewis acid base ab surface tension γ i l w van oss c j 2006 liu et al 2008 therefore the total surface tension of sludge particles and liquid can be expressed as eq 1 and eq 2 respectively 1 γ s γ s l w γ s a b 2 γ l γ l l w γ l a b the surface tension of sludge is calculated by eq 3 3 1 cos θ γ l 2 γ s l w γ l l w 1 2 γ s γ l 1 2 γ s γ l 1 2 where θ is the contact angle between the sludge surface and the drop liquid and γ s γ l and γ s γ l are the electron acceptor and electron donor parameters respectively the γl γ l l w γ l and γ l values of the water 1 bromonaphthalene and formamide can be found in table s2 sm based on the eqs 1 3 the total interfacial tensions γsl between the sludge surface and water can be calculated with eqs 4 6 van oss c j 2006 and the interfacial free energy ife δ g s l i f e the lw interaction energy δ g s l l w and the ab interaction energy δ g s l a b between the sludge particles and water can be calculated from eq 7 eq 8 and eq 9 respectively van oss 2006 liu et al 2007 in addition the effective hamaker constant asls between the sludge particles and water was also calculated with eq 10 and shown in figure s4 sm and the electrostatic el interaction energy δ g s l s e l between sludge particles at the minimum equilibrium distance can also be calculated by eq 11 according to liu et al 2007 4 γ s l γ s l l w γ s l a b 5 γ s l l w γ s l w γ l l w 2 6 γ s l a b 2 γ

1951 as the standard and the polysaccharide concentration was determined via the anthrone method with glucose as the standard dreywood 1946 the mw distribution of the soluble organic matter and vfa concentrations in the eg and cg during the fermentation process were determined via high performance size exclusion chromatography agilent 1100 series usa and via gas chromatography shimadzu gc 1020 plus japan respectively 3 results and discussion 3 1 volatile fatty acid production and compositions from sludge variations in the vfa production and compositions over time from the cg and eg sludge samples are shown in fig 1 as shown in fig 1 a and b during the 12 day acidogenic fermentation process the vfa production from both cg and eg first increased over time 4 days but then decreased over time this consequence is consistent with the findings of huang et al 2015 who also found a decrease in vfa production after 4 days of fermentation one explanation for this phenomenon is that the methanogen activity is recovered and the vfa is consumed by the methanogen over time during the fermentation process zhao et al 2018 fig 1 a shows that the maximal vfa production from the cg was 208 2 5 3 mg cod g vs which was achieved on the 4th day and is similar to the reported results jiang et al 2009 thus indicating that the acidogenic fermentation process in this study was normal as seen from fig 1 b the maximal vfa production from the eg 523 1 6 5 mg cod g vs also appeared on the 4th day and was more than twice that from the cg thus indicating that the pi pretreatment efficiently enhanced vfa production from was it should be emphasised that the cg s vfa production increased from 33 2 2 4 mg cod g vs to 112 7 3 2 mg cod g vs from day 0 to day 1 with an initial vfa production rate of 239 5 whilst over the same time period the eg s vfa production increased from 49 9 3 8 mg cod g vs to 225 1 4 6 mg cod g vs with an initial vfa production rate of 351 1 which was significantly higher than that of the cg this result indicates that the vfa production rate was also increased with the effect of pi pretreatment clearly the sludge with pi pretreatment showed a great vfa production and a rapid rate during the fermentation process which indicates that pi pretreatment not only improves vfa production but also promotes more efficient vfa production consistent with previous reports pang et al 2020 he et al 2016 li et al 2015 acetate and propionate were the main components of vfa in both the cg and eg in the first 4 days of fermentation other individual vfa such as iso valerate iso butyrate n butyrate and n valerate were also observed fig 1 a and b acetate propionate iso valerate iso butyrate n butyrate and n valerate were present in higher concentrations in the eg than in the cg for example on the 4th day pi pretreatment increased the concentrations of acetate propionate iso valerate iso butyrate n butyrate and n valerate by 205 9 82 7 96 7 284 4 167 3 and 237 9 respectively which indicates that pi pretreatment significantly increases the production of the individual vfa an interesting phenomenon is that in the first 5 days the vfa profiles of the eg and cg were similar except for a slight variation in n valerate concentration specifically on the 4th and 5th days n valerate was found only in low concentrations 6 0 mg cod g vs in the cg but was present throughout the fermentation process in the eg maximum concentration 18 6 1 2 mg cod g vs on the 4th day likely because n valerate is primarily formed via the stickland reaction of proline and arginine liu et al 2012 batstone et al 2003 as these two amino acids easily form complexes with multivalent metals they usually exist as metal complexes in the cg rendering fermentation into n valerate difficult he et al 2015 however with the effect of pi pre treatment multivalent metals can be removed from these proline metal and arginine metal complexes thus the free proline and arginine in the eg ferment into n valerate in high concentrations another noteworthy phenomenon is that from the 6th day to the 12th day vfa compositions were more abundant in the eg than in the cg likely because pi pretreatment releases amino acids i e proline arginine lysine valine and leucine from the amino acid metal complexes in the sludge these free amino acids readily ferment into various components of vfa via the stickland reaction batstone et al 2003 resulting in relatively high concentrations of iso valerate iso butyrate n butyrate and n valerate in the eg these components of vfa are not easy to be fully transformed within a short period of time 3 2 sludge organic solubilisation and hydrolysis usually sludge organic solubilisation and hydrolysis can be characterised by changes in the concentrations of soluble organics and in mw distributions respectively xu et al 2017a it is clear that the solubilisation and hydrolysis reactions of sludge organic matter usually occur simultaneously throughout the acidogenic fermentation process khanal 2008 classical thermodynamics holds that these reactions will always spontaneously change from a non equilibrium state to an equilibrium state during the fermentation process resulting in a gradual decrease in the changes of soluble organic concentrations and mw distributions over time in contrast if changes in the soluble organic concentrations and mw distributions could fluctuate greatly in a particular system the corresponding solubilisation reaction and hydrolysis reaction would not reach a state of equilibrium in the system which suggests that such a system could have great potential for increasing the extent of solubilisation and hydrolysis of sludge fig 2 illustrates the changes in the stoc concentrations soluble protein concentrations and soluble polysaccharide concentrations from cg and eg sludge samples during the 12 day acidogenic fermentation process fig 3 shows the changes in the main mw distributions of soluble organic substances over time as shown in fig 2 a analogous to the changes in vfa production over time the stoc concentrations from both cg and eg also first increased 4 days and then decreased 5 to 12 days during the fermentation process which indicates that over the first 4 days the catabolic transformation rate of soluble organic matter i e the transformation of soluble organic matter into biogas and biomass was lower than its solubilisation rate and over the next 5 to 12 days the converse was true an interesting phenomenon was that although the stoc concentration from the eg showed a decreasing trend from the 4th day to the 12th day it increased intermittently in the process of decreasing for example it increased from the 5th day to the 6th day and from the 8th day to the 10th day fig 2 a this differs greatly from the trend of the cg in which the stoc concentration from the cg decreased at all times from the 4th day to the 12th day possibly because the solid liquid interface of the eg sludge was altered by the pi pretreatment which not only enhanced the initial organic solubilisation of sludge but also improved the subsequent organic solubilisation throughout the fermentation process however for the untreated cg sludge the organic solubilisation reaction on the solid liquid interface of the sludge soon reached equilibrium and no obvious increase in organic solubilisation can be seen during the fermentation process fig 2 a shows that the stoc concentration from the eg was always higher than that from the cg specifically the maximum value for the stoc concentration from the eg was 1564 5 36 0 mg l on the 4th day which was more three times than that of the gc 505 0 20 3 mg l which indicates that the organic solubilisation of sludge is significantly improved during the fermentation process due to pi pretreatment these results in turn could be used to support the results of vfa production moreover as can be seen from fig 2 b and c although the overall trend is similar to changes in the stoc concentrations from both the cg and the eg some specific changes in the soluble protein and polysaccharide concentrations have their own characteristics during the fermentation process for example the changes in the soluble protein concentrations over time from the cg are consistent with the changes in the stoc concentration in the cg but the changes in the soluble protein concentrations in the eg differed slightly from those of the stoc in the eg with a wide fluctuation platform period 5 to 12 days which suggests that the effects of pi pretreatment are accompanied by more intense decomposition and solid liquid transformation reactions of sludge protein during the fermentation process these results also indicate that the effects of pi pretreatment on the transformation of sludge protein are more significant presumably due to proteins being amphoteric biological macromolecules whose structures and functional groups play a decisive role in the properties of the solid liquid interface bitton 2002 van loosdrecht et al 1990 neu 1996 as shown in fig 2 c the soluble polysaccharide concentrations in the cg and eg have less time to reach the maximum value 2 days than the stoc concentration which indicates that the soluble polysaccharide is more easily decomposed and transformed than other organic matter i e protein which is also supported by the studies of miron et al 2000 and yang et al 2015 who found that carbohydrates were easier to hydrolyse and ferment than proteins in addition fig 2 b and c show that the soluble protein concentrations and soluble polysaccharide concentrations from the eg were both invariably higher than those in the cg throughout the fermentation process which indicates that the pi pretreatment significantly enhanced the solubilisation of protein and polysaccharide in sludge we were interested to note that the maximal soluble protein concentration 582 9 16 0 mg l from the eg was more than twice that from the cg however the maximum soluble polysaccharide concentration 115 5 4 5 mg l from the eg was less than twice that from the cg which indicates that pi pretreatment enhances the solubilisation of proteins more than polysaccharides during the fermentation process this may be attributable to the removal of a certain amount of multivalent metals that can bind carboxyl moieties of proteins from the sludge during pi pretreatment table s1 sm and the fact that the sludge s protein stability was weakened without the metals novak et al 2003 xu et al 2018a 2017a thereby resulting in a high solubilisation of protein fig 3 shows that the average proportion of high mw 2000 kda soluble organic substances extracted from the cg during the 12 day acidogenic fermentation process exceeded 3 3 whilst that from the eg accounted for less than 1 8 which indicates that pi pretreatment is conductive to depolymerising biopolymers of sludge during the fermentation process in particular the high mw 2000 kda soluble organic substances from the cg accounted for 4 2 which was more than twice that from the eg 1 6 on day 0 fig 3 this indicates that without the effects of the fermentation process the biopolymers of sludge can also be significantly depolymerised via pi pretreatment moreover the proportion of low mw 1 kda soluble organic substances obtained from the eg was always greater than that obtained from the cg throughout the fermentation process for example the maximal proportion of low mw 1 kda soluble organic substances obtained from the eg accounted for 68 3 which was about twice that of the cg which demonstrates that the extent of the hydrolysis of soluble organic substances can be significantly enhanced by pi pretreatment in addition as shown in fig 3 within 1 day from day 0 to day 1 the proportion of low mw 1 kda soluble organic substances from the eg increased from 15 3 to 45 8 with an initial increasing rate of 199 3 which was more than five times that obtained from the cg with an initial increasing rate of 39 4 these results indicate that pi pretreatment can significantly improve the initial rate of hydrolysis in sludge organic matter another interesting phenomenon about the changes in the low mw 1 kda proportion is that although the overall trend from the cg and eg was similar fig 3 that is the proportion of low mw 1 kda soluble organic substances from both cg and eg first increased day 0 to day 4 and then decreased from day 5 to day 12 during the fermentation process the degree of variation of low mw 1 kda proportion with time from eg was greater than that from the cg for example during the 5 to 12 day fermentation process the proportion of low mw 1 kda soluble organic substances obtained from the cg decreased all the time whilst that from the eg intermittently increased with increases seen from the 5th day to the 6th day and from the 8th day to the 10th day respectively which indicates that within 5 to 12 days the hydrolysis reaction in the eg was in a non equilibrium state thus suggesting that pi pretreatment could promote the hydrolysis reaction potential of sludge presumably by enhancing the disintegration of the sludge s physical structure and the improvement of the sludge s solid liquid interfacial thermodynamics according to the above mentioned discussions figs 1 3 we hypothesised that pi pretreatment can collapse the physical structure of sludge and improve its solid liquid interfacial thermodynamic properties consequently more sludge organic matter is transformed from a solid state into a liquid state and from biopolymers to vfas with an accompanying high degree of organic solubilisation hydrolysis and acidification reactions resulting in high acidogenic fermentation efficiency 3 3 physical structures of sludge and the corresponding epss to reveal the manner in which the pi pretreatment enhanced the sludge s organic solubilisation hydrolysis and acidification by changing its physical structure the changes in the fractal dimension df of sludge and the spatial configuration of the eps in the sludge during the fermentation process were explored the df values of cg and eg sludge samples during the 12 day acidogenic fermentation process are shown in fig 4 the main parameters of spatial configuration of eps from the cg and the eg are shown in table s4 sm and fig 5 illustrates the changes in the ρ rg rh values of eps from the cg and the eg during the fermentation process the df of sludge has been reported to characterise its physical structure li 1989 xu et al 2020a b a high df value usually means that sludge flocs have a compact structure with small pores in the sludge interior which suggests low molecular mobility in the sludge conversely the lower the df value the looser the physical structure of the sludge and the greater its organic molecular mobility li 1989 xu et al 2020a b as shown in fig 4 the df values of sludge samples from both the cg and the eg during the fermentation process all changed from 2 26 to 2 33 consistent with the findings of wu et al 2002 who proposed that the df values of irregular particles with a rough surface usually ranged from 2 to 3 the initial df value of sludge from the cg was higher than that from the eg indicating that the initial physical structure of the sludge from the cg was more compact than that from eg figure s3 sm and that pi pretreatment can disintegrate the sludge s physical structure one interesting phenomenon visible in fig 4 is that the df value of the sludge from the eg was always lower than that from the cg throughout the fermentation process which indicates that the pi pretreatment made the physical structure of sludge from the eg looser than that from the cg throughout the fermentation process suggesting that the sludge from the eg has greater organic molecular mobility than that from the cg previous studies found that high organic molecular mobility usually resulted in a high degree of sludge organic solubilisation and hydrolysis xu et al 2017a b it is thus reasonable to believe that pi pretreatment can improve the sludge s organic solubilisation and hydrolysis by disintegrating the sludge s physical structure fig 4 shows that the df values of eg and cg sludge samples first decreased and then increased during the fermentation process thus indicating that the sludge s physical structure changes from compact to loose and then from loose to compact again during the fermentation process moreover it should be noted that the fluctuation in the df value of sludge from the eg was more obvious than that from the cg during the fermentation process which indicates that a more drastic change occurred in the eg sludge s physical structure this may be due to the fact that the pi pretreatment collapsed the sludge s initial physical structure facilitating a high degree of the subsequent sludge organic solubilisation and hydrolysis reactions in turn the intense transformation reactions of the sludge organic matter could reconstruct the sludge s physical structure periodically throughout the fermentation process resulting in substantial changes in its physical structure it is clear that eps can bridge bacterial cells to create a three dimensional matrix in sludge and it is widely acknowledged as the backbone of sludge bitton 2002 xu et al 2017a thus the spatial configuration of eps can be responsible for the sludge s structural stability the rg and rh values of a biopolymer which are related to the shape properties of a biopolymer are typically used to ascertain the spatial configuration of the eps teraoka 2002 xu et al 2018b b notably the ρ rg rh value is a very important parameter that is directly related to the biopolymer s chain architecture and conformation based on the ρ value of the biopolymer the spatial shape of the eps can be identified as a homogeneous non draining sphere ρ 0 78 microgels ρ 0 50 a random coil 1 00 ρ 2 00 and a rigid rod ρ 2 00 xu et al 2018b wang et al 2013 kazakov et al 2002 as shown in fig 5 one obvious difference in the ρ values of eps between the cg and the eg can be found in the first 8 days which indicates that the eps from the cg and the eg have different spatial shapes the ρ value of eps from the cg on day 0 was 0 79 0 06 which is close to 0 78 which suggests that the shape of the initial eps from the cg is that of a dense globule however the ρ value of eps from the eg was 1 42 0 05 on day 0 which is between 1 00 and 2 00 which indicates that the shape of the initial eps from the eg was that of a random coil it has been reported that the ρ value for completely extended chains is approximately 1 50 xu et al 2018b wang et al 2013 here the ρ value is 1 42 0 05 so it is reasonable that the initial eps from the eg on day 0 had nearly completely extended chains in addition the ρ values of eps from the eg on the 2nd 4th and 8th days were all greater than 0 78 whilst those from the cg on the 2nd 4th and 8th days were all less than 0 5 which suggests that the molecular chains of eps from the eg have higher ductility than that from the cg in the first 8 days these results indicate that the pi pretreatment can significantly promote the spatial extension of biopolymer chains in sludge which is conductive to the biodegradation of biopolymers based on previous studies in which a random coil shaped biopolymer is more easily biodegraded than a dense globule shaped biopolymer xu et al 2018b moreover it is noteworthy that the ρ values of the eps from the eg and the cg were decreased during the fermentation process for the eg the ρ values of the eps decreased from 1 42 0 05 to 0 36 0 03 indicating that the spatial shape of the eps changed from a random coil shape in the first 4 days to a dense globule shape on the 8th day and then to microgels on the 12th day for the cg the ρ values of eps decreased from 0 79 0 06 to 0 21 0 04 indicating that the spatial shape of eps changed from a dense globule shape on the 0th day to microgels from the 2nd day to the 12th day it is thus concluded that the biopolymers from the eg have a higher degree of spatial extension than the cg throughout the fermentation process indicating that the biopolymer from the eg is more easily biodegraded which suggests that a greater number of depolymerisation reactions i e hydrolysis of biopolymers occurred in the eg which is consistent with the extent of hydrolysis of sludge organic matter in the eg fig 3 one logical explanation for these results is that the effects of pi pretreatment allow the removal of multivalent metals that bridge biopolymers to form a dense globule shape table s1 sm meaning that the interfacial forces that act in aqueous media to maintain the dense globule shape of eps are perturbed the structural stability of the eps is destroyed resulting in random coil shaped eps however during the fermentation process the extended chains of biopolymers are biodegraded and the interfacial forces that maintain the biopolymer s random coil shape are again changed thus the spatial shape of the eps change again from a random coil shape back to a dense globule shape or even to microgels 3 4 solid liquid interfacial thermodynamics of sludge to further understand the driving forces of the pi pretreatment that lead to the change in the physical structure of the sludge and eps the effects of pi pretreatment on the solid liquid interfacial thermodynamics i e non covalent interaction energy of sludge were explored it is clear that the main non covalent interactions between biological and non biological macromolecules surfaces and particles can be identified as lifshitz van der waals lw interactions lewis acid base ab interactions el interactions and brownian movement br interactions van oss 2006 because the br interaction energy is often one or two orders of magnitude less than those associated with ab or lw interaction energies it is commonly neglected grasso et al 2002 from the perspective of material structure sludge can be considered to be composed of biological and non biological macromolecules surfaces and particles xu et al 2020a therefore the main non covalent interaction energies of sludge comprise lw interaction energy δ g s l l w ab interaction energy δ g s l a b and el interaction energy δ g s l s e l which is consistent with the extended derjaguin landau verwey overbeek dlvo theory grasso et al 2002 meinders et al 1995 the lw interaction caused by interatomic or intermolecular attraction between neutral atoms or molecules is usually used to characterize a general attractive interaction between two molecules and particles based on the electron donor and electron acceptor interactions the ab interaction which is polar is closely related to hydrogen bonding interactions and structural effects i e hydrophobic interaction and hydration pressure in addition the el interaction originates from molecules or particles with the same sign of charge in a polar liquid which is strongly dependant on the ionic strength near the molecule s or particle s surface in the liquid the changes in the interfacial lw ab and el interaction tensions of sludge samples from eg and cg throughout the fermentation process are shown in figures s5 s6 and s7 respectively sm and the changes in the ife of eg and cg sludge samples throughout the fermentation process are shown in figure s8 sm fig 6 depicts the statistical analyses of the changes in the δ g s l l w δ g s l a b and δ g s l s e l values of eg and cg sludge samples throughout the fermentation process via boxplots fig 6 shows that the fluctuation of changes in the δ g s l l w δ g s l a b and δ g s l s e l values of sludge samples from the eg throughout the fermentation process were higher than those from the cg respectively indicating that the solid liquid interfacial interactions of the sludge from the eg are more intense than those from the cg during the fermentation process it thus can be proposed that pi pretreatment can promote the solid liquid interfacial reactions of sludge during the fermentation process which was confirmed by the results of organic solubilisation hydrolysis and acidification in figs 1 3 obviously as shown in fig 6 of the three main interfacial interaction energies the δ g s l a b of sludge has the largest absolute value and exhibits the largest variation in both the eg and the cg during the fermentation process followed by the δ g s l l w and any one of them δ g s l a b and δ g s l l w is far higher than the δ g s l s e l which indicates that the ab interaction i e hydrogen bonding hydrophobic interaction and hydration pressure and the lw interaction i e intermolecular attraction interaction are the dominant interfacial interactions of sludge during the fermentation process usually a positive δ g s l a b value indicates a hydrophilic solid liquid interface and a negative δ g s l a b value indicates a hydrophobic solid liquid interface van oss 2006 fig 6 shows that most δ g s l a b values of the eg sludge were negative and the median δ g s l a b value was approximately 9 45 mj m2 during the fermentation process whilst nearly all δ g s l a b values of sludge from cg during the fermentation process were positive indicating that throughout the fermentation process the hydrophilicity and hydrophobicity of the sludge surface from the eg was altered and was usually hydrophobic however the sludge from the cg was hydrophilic throughout the whole fermentation process these findings also can be used to explain the phenomenon in which a high degree of sludge organic solubilisation and hydrolysis reactions were obtained during the fermentation process figs 2 and 3 because it has been reported that the hydrophilicity and hydrophobicity of sludge are determined primarily by the surface functional groups of sludge organic matter liu et al 2008 and that these surface functional groups are also potential binding sites for enzymes robert 2000 islam et al 2017 xu et al 2017b whereby the changes in hydrophilicity and hydrophobicity will inevitably lead to changes in the interfacial enzymatic reactions of sludge organic matter which is supported by previous studies vogler 1998 van loosdrecht et al 1990 tanford 1978 moreover although no obvious difference was seen in the average δ g s l l w value between eg and cg the degree of variation in the δ g s l l w values of eg was higher than that of cg during the fermentation process fig 6 which indicates that the pi pretreatment can increase changes in the attractive interactions of the sludge surface which also suggests that the pi pretreatment can change the intermolecular attraction interactions of sludge organic molecules this result is also supported by the higher values of the effective hamaker constant asls in the eg than in the cg figure s4 sm because the higher the asls value the greater the intermolecular attraction van oss 2006 liu et al 2007 in fact the intermolecular attraction interaction is a very important driving force for enzyme molecules to contact substrate and form enzyme substrate binary complex which is widely acknowledged as the first step in an enzymatic reactions robert 2000 therefore it can be concluded that the pi pretreatment significantly changed the solid liquid interfacial thermodynamics of sludge increased the degree of variation in the sludge s hydrophilicity hydrophobicity and enhanced the driving forces of enzymatic reactions on the sludge surface in addition an interesting phenomenon in the inserted graph in fig 6 shows that the degree of variation in the δ g s l s e l values of sludge from eg was significantly greater than that in sludge from cg during the fermentation process and that the average δ g s l s e l value of the eg was approximately 4 02 0 21 mj m2 which was greater than that of the cg 3 72 0 15 mj m2 indicating that the pi pretreatment enhanced changes in the sludge surface charges at the minimum distance between sludge particles during the fermentation process this change directly influenced the spatial position of the surface functional groups of sludge which is conducive to exposing more binding sites for the enzymatic reaction xu et al 2017b islam et al 2017 one logical explanation for this proposition is that pi pretreatment released more negatively charged free functional groups from sludge surface by removing the multivalent metals table s1 sm xu et al 2018a which resulted in the structural collapse of the sludge figs 4 and 5 and an increase in the sludge surface charge figure s2 sm meanwhile with the removal of multivalent metals table s1 sm the intrinsic ionic equilibrium in sludge was substantially perturbed so the ionic strength near the sludge surface changed more easily as the fermentation time increases resulting in a significant change in the el interactions between sludge surfaces at the minimum distance fig 6 and figure s7 sm and in the spatial position of the surface functional groups of sludge during the fermentation process fig 5 and table s4 sm moreover the multivalent metal binding functional groups such as phosphoryl carboxyl sulfhydryl and hydroxyl have usually been treated as the binding sites for enzymes robert 2000 wang et al 2000 xu et al 2017b islam et al 2017 it is therefore proposed that the pi pretreatment can also enhance the interfacial reactions by increasing the extent of variation in the el interaction energies of the sludge surface at the minimum distance 3 5 relationships between df and ife versus vfa production in the discussion above we revealed how pi pretreatment can enhance vfa production by disintegrating the physical structure and increasing the degree of variation in the solid liquid interfacial noncovalent interaction energies of sludge to investigate the underlying quantitative relationships between the sludge s physical structure solid liquid interfacial thermodynamics and acidogenic fermentation the correlations between the df data fig 4 and the ife data fig 6 and figure s8 sm versus vfa production data fig 1 of sludge samples from both the eg and the cg during the fermentation process were further analysed fig 7 illustrates the correlation between the df values and vfa production and the corresponding main parameters of the linear relationship are summarised in table s5 sm fig 8 shows the correlation between the ife values and vfa production and the corresponding main parameters of the linear relationship are summarised in table s6 sm as shown in fig 7 as the df values increase the vfa production shows a decreasing trend indicating a negative correlation between the df values and vfa production r 2 0 77 p 0 001 which suggests that the looser the physical structure of the sludge the more favourable the vfa production this is reasonable the sludge s loose physical structure usually comprises a random coil shape of eps with extended chains figs 4 and 5 and table s4 sm and this spatial structure is conductive to the mobility of the enzyme molecules the contact between the enzyme molecules and the substrate and the formation of an enzyme substrate binary complex robert 2000 xu et al 2017a b thereby results in a high degree of solubilisation fig 2 hydrolysis fig 3 and acidification fig 1 during the fermentation process fig 8 shows that as the ife values change from 28 9 2 8 mj m2 to 30 2 2 5 mj m2 the vfa production shows a decreasing trend thus indicating that the vfa production decreased as the sludge surface changed from hydrophobic to hydrophilic which suggests a possible correlation between the hydrophilicity hydrophobicity of the sludge surface and the vfa production from the sludge as shown in fig 8 an obvious negative correlation between the ife value and vfa production was found by correlation analysis r2 0 87 p 0 001 thus indicating that to some extent the hydrophobic surface of sludge is more conducive to the production of vfa during the fermentation process than the hydrophilic surface two logical explanations could be made for this finding 1 a relatively less dense water region with an open hydrogen bonded network exists near the sludge s hydrophobic surface whilst the hydrophilic surface usually has a relatively denser water region with an overlapped hydrogen bonded network vogler 1998 djikaev and ruckenstein 2011 and thereby the resistance of enzyme molecules contacting the hydrophobic surface of sludge is low and it is easier for an enzyme substrate binary complex to form resulting in a high enzymatic activity on the sludge s hydrophobic surface during the fermentation process 2 a large hydrophobic interaction attributable to attractive structural forces can usually be found on a hydrophobic surface for this surface the electron donor and electron acceptor values are both greater than that of water δ g s l a b 0 van oss 2006 grasso et al 2002 and sludge is no exception the hydrophobic surface of sludge with a negative δ g s l a b value has more attractive structural forces i e hydrogen bonding forces and hydrophobic interactions between the sludge s organic molecules fig 6 figures s4 and s6 sm which will drive enzyme molecules to contact the substrate and form enzyme substrate binary complex chandler 2005 resulting in a very productive fermentation reaction however the hydrophilic surface of sludge with a positive δ g s l a b value has more repulsive structural forces i e hydration pressure that will hinder the contact of enzyme molecules with the substrate and the formation of enzyme substrate binary complexes resulting in poor acidogenic fermentation these explanations are also be supported by studies vogler 1998 van loosdrecht et al 1990 van oss 2006 hlady and buijs 1996 that have concluded that protein i e enzymes adsorption usually occurs efficiently on a hydrophobic surface but inefficiently on a hydrophilic surface 4 conclusions on the basis of the phenomenon in which pi pretreatment significantly improved vfa production it was hypothesised that the breakdown of complex structure of sludge can be triggered by pi pretreatment causing a substantial change in the sludge s interfacial thermodynamics and this destroys the structural stability of biopolymers in sludge and increases the driving forces of interfacial enzymatic reactions resulting in a high vfa production in the fermentation process and proven in this paper the main conclusions of this study are as follows 1 the pi pretreatment significantly enhanced the generation efficiency of vfa as demonstrated by increases of 151 2 in maximal vfa production and 46 6 in the initial vfa production rate 2 the pi pretreatment significantly enhanced the organic solubilisation and hydrolysis of sludge for example the maximum concentrations of stoc soluble protein and soluble polysaccharide increased by 209 8 148 9 and 84 5 respectively the maximal proportion of low mw 1 kda soluble organic substances increased by 92 4 and the average proportion of high mw 2000 kda soluble organic substances decreased by 88 4 3 the pi pretreatment can structurally destabilise sludge loosen the sludge s physical structure and promote spatial extension of the biopolymer molecular chains in sludge which is conductive to the depolymerisation and biodegradability of biopolymers in sludge during the fermentation process 4 the pi pretreatment can improve the interfacial thermodynamics of sludge increase the degree of variation in the interfacial non covalent interaction energies of sludge and enhance the driving forces for enzyme molecules to contact with the substrate and form an enzyme substrate binary complex during the fermentation process thereby resulting in enhancement of the interfacial enzymatic reactions 5 a close internal relationship exists between the sludge s physical structure and its solid liquid interfacial thermodynamics versus its acidogenic fermentation to some extent its loose physical structure and hydrophobic surface are conductive to the generation of vfa during the fermentation process these findings do not necessarily challenge the traditional pretreatment methods for the enhancement of acidogenic fermentation of was however the possibility of improving the fermentation of sludge by manipulating the pi of sludge to trigger the breakdown of sludge structure and an increase of the driving forces of interfacial enzymatic reactions should be considered furthermore since the anaerobic digestion of was is heavily dependant on the complex nature of sludge the insights from sludge structure and interfacial thermodynamics proposed in this paper might also be used to enhance

the chemicals are semivolatile and most of them are strong hydrophobic organic compounds hocs leading to accumulation in biota with detectable levels in human blood adipose tissue and even breast milk kannan et al 2005 luckenbach and epel 2005 reiner et al 2007 several studies have confirmed that sms have potential toxic effects including carcinogenicity mutagenicity and genotoxicity dodson et al 2012 schreurs et al 2005 seinen et al 1999 musk xylene a representative of nitro musks has been included in the candidate list of substances of very high concern svhc by the european chemicals agency echa an efficient and reliable method for monitoring sms concentrations in the environment is of great significance to understand their occurrence fate and potential health risks to humans conventional measurements for sms in surface waters are conducted via snap sampling followed by pretreatments such as headspace solid phase microextraction hs spme dispersive micro solid phase extraction d μ spe and ultrasound assisted dispersive liquid liquid microextraction ua dllme chung et al 2013 ramos et al 2019 tseng and tsai 2019 however snap sampling is not suitable for continuous monitoring of concentration fluctuations due to high economic cost and low sampling efficiency as an alternative passive sampling ps has unique advantages such as the improvement of analysis sensitivity by efficient preconcentration the integration of sample sampling and cleanup in one and providing the time weight averaged twa concentration of analytes additional advantage of ps for semivolatile compounds is in situ capturing analytes in fields thus avoiding the loss during the transfer and storage of water samples semipermeable membrane device spmd is a typical ps and available for collecting sms in waters via internal triolein gatermann et al 2002 helm et al 2012 however the correction of sampling rates rs is highly dependent on hydrological conditions resulting in a measurement error of rs between the laboratory and the field in addition the composition of the chemicals accumulated by the sampler is usually different from the chemical mixtures in water due to various uptake rates diffusive gradients in thin films dgt is an efficient ps technique based on fick s first law of diffusion davison and zhang 1994 dgt possesses outstanding resistance toward hydrological variations by increasing the diffusion path length diffusion phase thickness of analytes and has been widely used in the measurement of inorganic ions such as heavy metals and inorganic nutrients for nearly 30 years davison and zhang 1994 davison and zhang 2012 in 2012 chen et al first expanded the application of dgt to organic compounds by establishing a dgt method for antibiotics and verifying the performance in the field trial chen et al 2012 chen et al 2013 at present more than 140 organic compounds have been confirmed to be accessible for dgt sampling guibal et al 2019 however most of the analytes are highly hydrophilic compounds for example antibiotics drugs and herbicides challis et al 2016 challis et al 2018 chen et al 2017 chen et al 2018 ren et al 2018 zheng et al 2015 recently hydrophobic and moderately hydrophobic compounds such as perfluoroalkyl substances pfass and organophosphorus flame retardants opfrs in waters have been successfully measured using dgt guan et al 2018 wang et al 2019 zhang et al 2019 these results preliminarily support the feasibility of dgt in the monitoring of hocs however there are still some ambiguities and challenges regarding dgt sampling characteristics and precautions for hocs compared with polar organic compounds hocs seem to have more retention on filter membranes in dgt devices which results in long lag phases to establish stable diffusive gradient in initial deployment wang et al 2019 accordingly it is very essential to examine the sampling characteristics of dgt for monitoring different type of hocs the purpose of this study is to verify whether semivolatile hydrophobic sms can be measured using dgt and to further expand dgt application in the determination of organic pollutants in aquatic environment here dgt devices with xad 2 binding gels were prepared to evaluate the feasibility for monitoring of nine sms including six polycyclic musks and three nitro musks possible adsorption of sms to filter membranes binding rates and elution efficiencies of the binding gel and diffusion coefficients through the diffusion phase were studied the performance of the dgt devices in different environmental conditions such as varying ph ion strength is deployment time and dissolved organic matter dom levels were also tested finally the dgt devices was deployed in the effluent of municipal wwtps to validate its reliability for in situ monitoring of sms 2 experimental section 2 1 chemicals and reagents all solvents used were of hplc grade and were purchased from sigma aldrich shanghai

dpmi hhcb ahtn ma and mk with higher solubility were selected as target analytes for deployment experiments in the laboratory humic acid fulvic acid 90 was purchased from alladdin shanghai china 2 2 gel preparation a standard dgt device consists of a 0 5 mm binding gel a 0 8 mm diffusion gel and a 0 14 mm filter membrane fixed with an abs based plastic dgt molding dgt research ltd uk here xad 2 resin gel was selected as the binding gel due to the excellent performance of xad 2 resin for sms extraction in water samples peck and hornbuckle 2004 the resin was washed three times with methanol and pure water to remove any impurities and to enhance its hydrophilicity prior to use to prepare the binding gel 2 g wet weight xad 2 resin was added into 10 ml of 1 5 agarose solution and then heated to boiling the hot mixture was quickly injected into a preheated glass model with a ptfe spacer of 0 5 mm thickness agarose diffusive gel of different thickness 0 4 0 8 1 2 1 6 mm was prepared using the same procedures without the resin after cooling to room temperature the glass model was opened and the gel was cut into 2 5 cm diameter discs and stored in 0 01 m nacl solution at 4 c figure s1 five filter membrane types including poly ether sulfone pes hydrophilic poly tetrafluoroethylene ptfe nylon nl poly vinylidene fluoride pvfe and mixed cellulose mce were purchased from jinteng corp tianjing china all the membranes were 2 5 cm in diameter 0 14 mm in thickness and had a 0 45 μm pore size 2 3 adsorption of sms to the dgt components the five different membranes and agarose diffusive gel discs were immersed in 10 ml solutions 0 01 m nacl containing 50 μg l 1 dpmi ma hhcb ahtn and mk under horizontal shaking for 24 h dgt plastic molding was immersed in 200 ml solution containing 50 μg l 1 sms due to the larger size adsorption rates were determined by extracting sms from the retrieved dgt components using n hexane dichloromethane 3 1 v v a blank experiment without exposure was also conducted and showed no sms release from clean dgt components 2 4 elution efficiencies and uptake kinetics binding gel discs were immersed in 10 ml solutions containing 10 20 or 50 μg l 1 dpmi ma hhcb ahtn and mk with 0 01 m nacl as a background matrix after 24 h of shaking the gel discs were transferred into 5 ml of n hexane dichloromethane 3 1 v v solution shaken for 12 h and then placed into an ultrasonic bath for 10 min the elution procedure was conducted twice and 50 ng of the surrogate standards were added into the combined eluent then the eluent was concentrated and solvent changed into 1 ml n hexane for gc ms analysis to determine the uptake kinetics for sms the binding gel discs were soaked in a 10 ml solution of 50 μg l 1 dpmi ma hhcb ahtn and mk for different lengths of time 1 min to 24 h and the binding mass of analytes was calculated by determining the extracted mass 2 5 diffusion coefficient measurements diffusion coefficients were measured using dgt method with two types of dgt devices a standard dgt device equipped with an xad 2 binding gel an agarose diffusive gel and a nl filter membrane b dgt device without an outer filter membrane in which the nl membrane was fitted to the innermost layer of the device briefly 20 l solutions 0 01 m nacl were spiked with 5 μg l 1 of nine sms and equilibrated for 12 h prior to deployment the assembled dgt devices were deployed in the solutions which were well stirred for 12 h the dgt devices were taken at 2 h intervals to elute the binding gels and at the same time 10 ml of the deployed solutions were collected for liquid liquid extraction lle to assess possible concentration changes of sms the diffusion coefficients of sms without or with nl membrane d or dnl were calculated based on the slope of the linear plot of the accumulated mass of each sm on binding gel versus time according to eq 1 1 d slope δ g ca a is the area of the exposed window of the standard dgt device c is the average concentration of sms in the deployed solution determined by lle and δg is the diffusive gel thicknesses the nl membrane thickness is included in δg for calculating dnl eq 2 was used to determine the diffusion coefficients of the sms at different temperatures challis et al 2016 2 log d t 1 37023 t 25 8 36 10 4 t 25 2 109 t log d 25 273 t 298 2 6 dgt performance under different conditions standard dgt devices were deployed in 2 l solutions spiked with dpmi ma hhcb ahtn and mk for 12 h to assess the effects of ph ionic strength is and dissolved organic matter dom on dgt performance the solutions were pre equilibrated for 12 h and stirred well during deployment a 2 l of 10 μg l 1 sm solutions containing 0 01 m nacl with ph values ranging from 4 30 to 8 92 b 2 l of 10 μg l 1 sm solutions with a ph of 6 2 containing a series of nacl concentrations ranging from 0 0001 to 0 5 m c 2 l of 10 μg l 1 sm solutions 0 01 m nacl ph 6 2 with humic acid concentrations ranging from 0 to 20 mg l 1 to test dgt uptake performance in long term deployment standard dgt devices were deployed in 2 l solutions 0 01 m nacl ph 6 2 containing 5 μg l 1 of dpmi ma hhcb ahtn and mk the spiked solutions were refreshed every 12 h and covered with a plastic wrap to reduce volatilization of the sms in the solution dgt devices were retrieved at different times from 6 h to 7 d the effect of the diffusive layer thickness was evaluated using the dgt devices equipped with agarose gels with 0 4 0 8 1 2 and 1 6 mm thicknesses in 2 l of 10 μg l 1 sm solutions containing 0 01 m nacl for 12 h the deployed solutions mentioned above were extracted via lle to check for possible changes of the sm concentrations in the solutions during dgt deployment 2 7 field trial in wwtps to verify the performance of dgt under field conditions multiple standard dgt devices were deployed in two wwtps lingshui ls 121 32 8 11 e 38 51 51 17 n and sanjian sj 121 13 58 07 e 38 55 35 75 n located on the east and west coasts of dalian china the treatment techniques in the ls and sj are the traditional activated sludge process and a2 o having wastewater capacities of 80 000 and 60 000 m3 d 1 and serving 200 000 and 50 000 people respectively the dgt devices were fixed on a special shelf made of plexiglass to keep the exposure windows outward and deployed at 0 45 m under the water surface in the ls effluent for 3 to 14 d water samples in the effluent and influent were also collected daily for solid phase extraction spe followed by gc ms analysis details are provided in si the water quality parameters were obtained from the data uploaded with the automatic monitoring system in the treatment plant and water temperature was measured by an automatic continuous temperature recorder th4xw china the dgt deployment in sj effluent was carried out for 7 d using the same method 2 8 instrumental analysis all samples were analyzed using a shimadzu gc ms qp2020 in sim mode with electron ionization ei and the parameters are given in table s2 the details of the analysis procedure are provided in the si 3 results and discussion 3 1 adsorption of sms to dgt material the adsorption of analytes by dgt material especially the filter membrane should be minimized to avoid the potential influence on the formation of the diffusion gradients along the diffusion phase davison and zhang 2012 herein possible adsorption of hydrophobic sms on five different filter membranes mce pvdf ptfe pes and nl agarose diffusive gel and dgt moldings were tested fig 1 shows there was maximum adsorption of the sms on ptfe membrane 21 73 and the retentions on mce pvdf and pes membranes were slightly decreased but still considerable 21 47 the sms were minimally absorbed on nl membrane 7 the result is different from the previous result reported wang et al 2019 in which there was the smaller adsorptions for hydrophobic organophosphate esters on ptfe than pes and polypropylene ghp membranes in this study nl membrane was finally selected for standard dgt devices the average adsorption rates for the sms onto agarose diffusive gel and dgt moldings were below 10 except for 13 8 for mk onto dgt moldings showing the availability of the dgt subassemblies for measuring sms 3 2 elution efficiency reliable elution efficiency can ensure accurate quantitation in dgt measurements to date methanol has been used extensively to elute organic pollutants from various dgt binding gels however zhang et al demonstrated that available efficiencies for nitro chlorobenzene compounds ncbs with moderate n octanol water partitioning coefficients log kow 2 17 could not be provided by polar methanol zhang et al 2019 herein low polar n hexane dichloromethane 3 1 v v solution commonly used in the extraction of hydrophobic sms from environmental samples was applied to elute the sms from xad 2 gel bester 2009 elution conditions were also optimized by comparing the efficiencies under different elution ways 5 ml for twice or 10 ml for once for horizontal shaking 12 h or ultrasonic extraction 30 min results show that horizontal shaking twice with 5 ml eluent achieved the best elution efficiency but the efficiency still did not reach 80 for ahtn and hhcb figure s2 the final elution procedure of shaking in 5 ml eluent for 12 h followed by ultrasonication for 10 min conducted twice was determined and it provided excellent efficiencies of 92 108 for all the sms in the tested concentration range 10 50 μg l 1 figure s3 3 3 uptake kinetics of sms onto binding gels the results of uptake kinetics shown in figure s4 demonstrated that the binding mass of dpmi ma hhcb ahtn mk on xad 2 gel rapidly increased with exposure time in the initial stage with an average binding rate of 0 576 0 515 0 418 0 420 and 0 635 ng cm 2s 1 within 30 min while the fluxes of sms transported through the filter membrane and agarose diffusive gel were only 0 041 0 140 ng cm 2s 1 by assuming a solution concentration of 50 μg l 1 which is much higher than the concentration of sms in real environmental waters bester 2009 this result indicates that sms diffused from the external solution could rapidly bind on xad 2 gel to ensure that the interface concentration between the binding gel and diffusive gel was zero during deployment this is also a prerequisite for the quantification by the dgt equation 3 4 diffusion coefficient measurements the dgt method was used here to determine the diffusion coefficients of sms in the diffusion phase because of the low water solubility and semivolatility of the analytes several studies have shown that analytes that initially transfer onto dgt devices were first trapped by the filter membrane prior to reaching saturation resulting in the occurrence of lag phase before linear uptake challis et al 2016 estoppey et al 2019 this phenomenon is more prominent in hocs sampling vermeirssen et al 2012 wang et al 2019 although nl membrane with least adsorption was chosen the effect of the filter membrane on the lag phase of sms was still examined via continuous dgt deployment for 12 h using the dgt devices with or without the nl membrane during the deployment period the sms concentrations in the solution were measured by lle and showed less than 10 of changes p 0 05 as shown in fig 2 the mass of the sms accumulated on the dgt devices without nl membrane showed a good linear relationship with time r2 0 990 0 998 from 2 h to 12 h table s3 the diffusion coefficients of sms through the agarose gel d were 3 37 4 60 10 6cm2 s 1 calculated from equation 1 table s4 however with the standard dgt devices containing a nl filter membrane a lag phase time of 75 173 min was observed based on the intercepts of the time axis for each sm fig 2 suggesting that the retention of sms on the membrane substantially extend the time needed to establish a diffusion controlled steady state within the diffusive phase wang et al 2019 the diffusion coefficients of sms through the nl membrane and agarose gel dnl were therefore calculated by excluding the initial two hour data and the resulting dnl were 1 48 4 41 10 6cm2 s 1 r2 0 996 0 999 compared with d the decrease in dnl dnl d 0 44 0 98 demonstrated that nl membrane reduced the diffusion rates of sms through the diffusion phase even after the lag phase generally the dgt devices without a filter membrane provided higher sampling rates for sms with negligible lag phases however considering the necessity of the filter membrane in dgt devices for monitoring of heavily polluted waters a standard dgt device is preferred and the more realistic diffusion coefficients of dnl is recommended for dgt quantification in the present study previous studies have demonstrated that the diffusion rates of compounds in agarose gel are related to their hydrophobic characteristic log kow chen et al 2013 wang et al 2019 the relationships between the d or dnl with log kow of sms were further investigated d of both nitro musks and polycyclic musks had a significant negative p 0 05 linear correlation with log kow fig 3a which is consistent with the results for opfrs zou et al 2018 however although a significant negative correlation p 0 05 between dnl and log kow of polycyclic musks was observed it was not applicable to dnl of the three nitro musks fig 3b with the presence of nl membrane in the dgt devices the log kow influence on the diffusion coefficients of sms became more significant especially for polycyclic musks with a higher log kow 4 49 table s1 and the diffusion resistance in the membrane was obviously increased with increase in log kow of polycyclic musks 3 5 effects of ph is and dom on uptake performance solution ph is and dom are essential aquatic parameters affecting dgt performance in water samples figure s5 illustrates the variation in the cdgt csoln ratio with ph values ranging from 4 30 to 8 92 no obvious influence on the dgt performance was observed based on the ratios of 0 93 1 07 which were within an acceptable value range of 0 90 1 10 previous studies have also demonstrated that xad 18 and xda 1 dgt are independent of ph for measuring pfass guan et al 2018 illicit drugs guo et al 2017 and endocrine disrupting chemicals edcs xie et al 2018 in addition the lack of dissociable acid base functional groups in the structure of sms also reduced the ph effect on dgt sampling to some extent the dgt measurement of five sms was also not affected in the solution containing 0 0001 0 5 m nacl with the average cdgt csoln ratios ranging from 0 91 to 1 06 figure s5 this is consistent with the pfas measurement results using xad dgt guan et al 2018 and the ncb measurements using hlb dgt zhang et al 2019 there was no significant decrease in cdgt csoln ratios even is of the solution increasing up to 0 5 m indicating that the present dgt is suitable for sampling in high salt waters the influence of dom on dgt performance is presented in figure s6 when the dom concentrations in the solution varied within 0 20 mg l 1 the cdgt csoln ratio values mainly fell into the range of 0 90 1 10 except for slight decreases in the cdgt csoln ratios 0 87 0 89 for dpmi and ma with dom concentration exceeding 10 mg l 1 the likely reason is the slower diffusion rates in solutions with a high level of dom due to the combination between ha and sms or competitive adsorption of ha on the binding gel balch and gueguen 2015 boehm and duering 2010 a similar decline in the ratios with a dom concentration above 12 mg l 1 has also been observed in the measurement of psychiatric pharmaceuticals fang et al 2019 generally moderate dom has negligible influence on the dgt performance due to sufficient binding capacity provided by xad 2 gel 3 6 effects of diffusive gel thickness and deployment time theoretically when the deployed solution was at the same concentration and well stirred the mass on the binding gel should linearly increase with the reciprocal of diffusive layer thickness δg according to dgt equation for sms the accumulated mass on the binding gel linearly increased with the reciprocal of δg for 0 94 1 74 mm figure s7 with an r2 value ranging from 0 991 0 999 p 0 05 the mass increase also fitted well the trend of the theoretical lines suggesting accurate measurement with the gel thicknesses however the mass accumulated by a dgt device with a 0 54 mm diffusive layer was slightly less than the theoretical values for dpmi ma hhcb and mk while ahtn with a smaller dnl still kept a linear response versus the reciprocal of the thickness figure s7 the most possible reason is that the thinner diffusion layer increases the amount of the analytes diffused onto the surface of the binding gel resulting in a slight accumulation of sms on the diffusion gel and binding gel interface thus a 0 94 mm diffusive layer 0 8 mm diffusive gel and 0 14 mm nl membrane was used for the dgt devices in field trial the dependence of sms mass accumulated on binding gel on deployment time was investigated to determine effective sampling time i e maximum linear uptake period for dgt devices as shown in figure s8 the accumulated mass of sms was linearly increased with time for 7 d r2 0 990 0 998 and fitted well with the theoretical lines the robustness for long time deployment was also consistent with that previously observed for edcs sampling with xda 1 dgt for 15 d and for pfass measurement with xad 18 dgt for 132 h guan et al 2018 xie et al 2018 3 7 dgt blanks and method quantitation limits the blank concentration of dgt devices instrument limits of detection and quantification lods and loqs for gc ms and dgt method detection limits mdls are listed in table s5 the dgt devices were deployed in a blank solution for 7 d no detection of sms in eluent of the binding gel suggested that laboratory contamination was effectively avoided by thoroughly cleaning xad 2 resin deployment containers and careful operations the mdls of dgt for 7 d of deployment ranged from 0 02 0 09 ng l 1 which is two orders of magnitude lower than the loqs 1 5 μg l 1 showing significant sensitivity improvements the present method was capable of measuring sms in most of surface waters at concentrations up to μg l 1 in effluent from wwtps homem et al 2015 1 0 4 7 ng l 1 in lake waters peck and hornbuckle 2004 and 0 05 2 5 ng l 1 in sea water gatermann et al 1995 3 8 field trial in wwtps dgt devices were installed at two municipal wwtps ls and sj for monitoring sms to examine the performance in a field trial the temperature ph and chemical oxygen demand cod of the sampling site in ls effluent during 14 d sampling period were 18 8 0 57 c 6 78 0 11 and 11 12 1 44 mg l 1 respectively figure s9 and table s6 the uptake mass of sms by dgt devices with deployment time in the ls effluent are shown in fig 4 all the detected sms were linearly accumulated by dgt for at least 5 d while some sms e g hhcb and dpmi were linearly accumulated within 7 or 10 d the plateauing and downswing of spots may be due to fouling of the filter membranes figure s10 preventing the continuous transfer of sms to the binding gel chen et al 2013 uher et al 2012 therefore the data within the effective sampling time i e the linear uptake period was used to calculate dgt concentrations cdgt of sms as shown in fig 5 seven sms dpmi adbi atii ahmi hhcb ahtn and mk were detected in ls effluent using dgt approach the concentrations of sms ranged from 0 45 to 696 ng l 1 comparable with those reported for the effluent in municipal wwtps such as 77 10525 ng l 1 in the usa chase et al 2012 6 7 954 5 in china lv et al 2010a and 82 259 ng l 1 in spain posada ureta et al 2012 polycyclic musks accounted for 98 9 of all detected sms in the effluent of which hhcb was identified as a predominant musk with the highest proportion of 94 2 these results are in agreement with previous studies reporting that hhcb has the highest detection frequency and concentration level in sewage godayol et al 2015 homem et al 2015 by contrast only one nitro musk mk with a low concentration of 7 87 ng l 1 was detected in ls effluent previous studies have also demonstrated that nitro musks especially mx and mk are still present in sewage worldwide although many countries have restricted their production and use on a large scale chase et al 2012 lv et al 2010b vallecillos et al 2014 compared with results by dgt the daily concentrations of sms in ls effluent determined by continuous grab sampling for 14 d are shown in figure s11 detailed data shown in table s7 in general the concentrations of sms obtained using both methods were in the same order of magnitude and both methods showed a similar occurrence pattern for each sm fig 5 dgt and grab samplings also had a good agreement in the total amount of sms in ls effluent and the sum concentrations of seven detected sms are 738 ng l 1 and 616 ng l 1 table s7 respectively however the concentration of each sm obtained from grab sampling fluctuated significantly during the 14 day sampling period with 41 5 89 6 relative standard deviations except for adbi and atii the concentrations of sms determined by grab sampling scattered around the twa concentrations determined by dgt basically the twa concentration by dgt could reflect the concentration trend of sms in ls effluent during the sampling period while the results by daily garb sampling reflected the diurnal changes of sms the complementary methods would provide comprehensive understanding for the concentration trend and variation of sms during the sampling period due to seriously biofouling no obvious increasing trend in the accumulated mass of sms was observed with time when dgt devices were deployed in ls influent and thus the concentration of sms in the influent was only provided by grab sampling table s8 the same seven sm compounds were detected in ls influent via grab sampling with concentrations of 0 66 1393 ng l 1 the averaged removal efficiencies of sms during the treatment process were 46 2 17 4 and 53 1 8 6 based on the concentrations of sms in effluent obtained by dgt and grab sampling these values were lower than those of 60 90 reported in previous investigations homem et al 2015 the reason may be because the lower operating temperature in winter decreased the elimination of sms by influencing their dissociation constant on sludge which is a primary tendency of removed sms in wwtps homem et al 2015 lv et al 2010a in sj effluent similar sms excluding atii with concentrations ranging from 1 53 to 276 3 ng l 1 table s9 were detected by dgt in the 7 d deployment with no obvious biofouling on dgt devices the sum concentrations of sms in sj effluent σsms 344 ng l 1 was approximately a factor of two lower than in ls effluent this is because sj and ls provide wastewater treatment services for rural and urban populations respectively the use of personal care products containing sm compounds is greatly influenced by the lifestyle of the population served in addition different operating parameters and removal rates in wwtps may affect the emissions of sms from wwtps homem et al 2015 4 conclusion we demonstrated an in situ measurement method based on dgt using a xad 2 gel for semivolatile hydrophobic sms in urban wastewaters the sampling rates of sms via standard dgt devices containing the nl membrane were 1 3 4 04 ml d 1 cm 2 comparable with those 0 56 7 85 ml d 1 cm 2 for hydrophilic organic pollutants for example antibiotics and pharmaceuticals field deployment in wwtps showed that the results obtained with dgt are consistent with those obtained using traditional grab sampling seven sms were detected in the effluents of several local wwtps and hhcb was identified as a predominant musk a dgt sampling time in excess of 3 d is recommended to avoid a lag phase from the retention of sms on the filter membrane and to provide adequate detection sensitivity our study provides an efficient tool for in situ monitoring of sms in complicate waters and expands dgt applications in the measurement of organic pollutants in aquatic environment supporting information detailed

17596,synthetic musks sms are used extensively in household and personal care products and have acted significant concerns due to their environmental impacts and potential health effects here we present a passive sampling approach based on diffusive gradients in thin films dgt for in situ measurement of sms in urban wastewaters xad 2 binding gel which has a rapid binding rate and high elution efficiency was used in dgt device for the accumulation of six polycyclic musks and three nitro musks the diffusion coefficients d and dnl of the sms through agarose gel without and with a nylon filter membrane were 3 37 4 49 and 1 48 4 41 10 6cm2 s 1 the filter membrane caused an 3 h lag phase and slowed the diffusion rates of the sms through the diffusive phase solution ph 4 30 8 92 ionic strength 0 0001 0 5 m and dissolved organic matter 0 20 mg l 1 showed no obvious influence on uptake of the sms in dgt the measured average sm concentrations in the effluent of wastewater treatment plants ranged from 0 45 696 ng l for dgt deployment without obvious membrane biofouling and they were comparable to the concentrations determined by grab sampling these results confirmed that the present method is reliable and convenient for in situ measurement of semivolatile hydrophobic sms in complicated waters and is an available tool to investigate the environmental behaviors of sms in the

the chemicals are semivolatile and most of them are strong hydrophobic organic compounds hocs leading to accumulation in biota with detectable levels in human blood adipose tissue and even breast milk kannan et al 2005 luckenbach and epel 2005 reiner et al 2007 several studies have confirmed that sms have potential toxic effects including carcinogenicity mutagenicity and genotoxicity dodson et al 2012 schreurs et al 2005 seinen et al 1999 musk xylene a representative of nitro musks has been included in the candidate list of substances of very high concern svhc by the european chemicals agency echa an efficient and reliable method for monitoring sms concentrations in the environment is of great significance to understand their occurrence fate and potential health risks to humans conventional measurements for sms in surface waters are conducted via snap sampling followed by pretreatments such as headspace solid phase microextraction hs spme dispersive micro solid phase extraction d μ spe and ultrasound assisted dispersive liquid liquid microextraction ua dllme chung et al 2013 ramos et al 2019 tseng and tsai 2019 however snap sampling is not suitable for continuous monitoring of concentration fluctuations due to high economic cost and low sampling efficiency as an alternative passive sampling ps has unique advantages such as the improvement of analysis sensitivity by efficient preconcentration the integration of sample sampling and cleanup in one and providing the time weight averaged twa concentration of analytes additional advantage of ps for semivolatile compounds is in situ capturing analytes in fields thus avoiding the loss during the transfer and storage of water samples semipermeable membrane device spmd is a typical ps and available for collecting sms in waters via internal triolein gatermann et al 2002 helm et al 2012 however the correction of sampling rates rs is highly dependent on hydrological conditions resulting in a measurement error of rs between the laboratory and the field in addition the composition of the chemicals accumulated by the sampler is usually different from the chemical mixtures in water due to various uptake rates diffusive gradients in thin films dgt is an efficient ps technique based on fick s first law of diffusion davison and zhang 1994 dgt possesses outstanding resistance toward hydrological variations by increasing the diffusion path length diffusion phase thickness of analytes and has been widely used in the measurement of inorganic ions such as heavy metals and inorganic nutrients for nearly 30 years davison and zhang 1994 davison and zhang 2012 in 2012 chen et al first expanded the application of dgt to organic compounds by establishing a dgt method for antibiotics and verifying the performance in the field trial chen et al 2012 chen et al 2013 at present more than 140 organic compounds have been confirmed to be accessible for dgt sampling guibal et al 2019 however most of the analytes are highly hydrophilic compounds for example antibiotics drugs and herbicides challis et al 2016 challis et al 2018 chen et al 2017 chen et al 2018 ren et al 2018 zheng et al 2015 recently hydrophobic and moderately hydrophobic compounds such as perfluoroalkyl substances pfass and organophosphorus flame retardants opfrs in waters have been successfully measured using dgt guan et al 2018 wang et al 2019 zhang et al 2019 these results preliminarily support the feasibility of dgt in the monitoring of hocs however there are still some ambiguities and challenges regarding dgt sampling characteristics and precautions for hocs compared with polar organic compounds hocs seem to have more retention on filter membranes in dgt devices which results in long lag phases to establish stable diffusive gradient in initial deployment wang et al 2019 accordingly it is very essential to examine the sampling characteristics of dgt for monitoring different type of hocs the purpose of this study is to verify whether semivolatile hydrophobic sms can be measured using dgt and to further expand dgt application in the determination of organic pollutants in aquatic environment here dgt devices with xad 2 binding gels were prepared to evaluate the feasibility for monitoring of nine sms including six polycyclic musks and three nitro musks possible adsorption of sms to filter membranes binding rates and elution efficiencies of the binding gel and diffusion coefficients through the diffusion phase were studied the performance of the dgt devices in different environmental conditions such as varying ph ion strength is deployment time and dissolved organic matter dom levels were also tested finally the dgt devices was deployed in the effluent of municipal wwtps to validate its reliability for in situ monitoring of sms 2 experimental section 2 1 chemicals and reagents all solvents used were of hplc grade and were purchased from sigma aldrich shanghai china galaxolide hhcb and musk ambrette ma were obtained from dr ehrenstorfer germany phantolide ahmi cashmeran dpmi celestolide adbi traesolide atii and musk xylene mx were obtained from toronto research chemicals canada tonalide ahtn and musk ketone mk were obtained from dalian meilun biotechnology corp china the detailed physicochemical properties of all the target sms are provided in table s1 stock solutions of sms at 100 μg l 1 were prepared in methanol or n hexane and stored at 20 c in brown amber bottles the surrogate standards d3 ahtn and d15 mx were obtained from dr ehrenstorfer dpmi hhcb ahtn ma and mk with higher solubility were selected as target analytes for deployment experiments in the laboratory humic acid fulvic acid 90 was purchased from alladdin shanghai china 2 2 gel preparation a standard dgt device consists of a 0 5 mm binding gel a 0 8 mm diffusion gel and a 0 14 mm filter membrane fixed with an abs based plastic dgt molding dgt research ltd uk here xad 2 resin gel was selected as the binding gel due to the excellent performance of xad 2 resin for sms extraction in water samples peck and hornbuckle 2004 the resin was washed three times with methanol and pure water to remove any impurities and to enhance its hydrophilicity prior to use to prepare the binding gel 2 g wet weight xad 2 resin was added into 10 ml of 1 5 agarose solution and then heated to boiling the hot mixture was quickly injected into a preheated glass model with a ptfe spacer of 0 5 mm thickness agarose diffusive gel of different thickness 0 4 0 8 1 2 1 6 mm was prepared using the same procedures without the resin after cooling to room temperature the glass model was opened and the gel was cut into 2 5 cm diameter discs and stored in 0 01 m nacl solution at 4 c figure s1 five filter membrane types including poly ether sulfone pes hydrophilic poly tetrafluoroethylene ptfe nylon nl poly vinylidene fluoride pvfe and mixed cellulose mce were purchased from jinteng corp tianjing china all the membranes were 2 5 cm in diameter 0 14 mm in thickness and had a 0 45 μm pore size 2 3 adsorption of sms to the dgt components the five different membranes and agarose diffusive gel discs were immersed in 10 ml solutions 0 01 m nacl containing 50 μg l 1 dpmi ma hhcb ahtn and mk under horizontal shaking for 24 h dgt plastic molding was immersed in 200 ml solution containing 50 μg l 1 sms due to the larger size adsorption rates were determined by extracting sms from the retrieved dgt components using n hexane dichloromethane 3 1 v v a blank experiment without exposure was also conducted and showed no sms release from clean dgt components 2 4 elution efficiencies and uptake kinetics binding gel discs were immersed in 10 ml solutions containing 10 20 or 50 μg l 1 dpmi ma hhcb ahtn and mk with 0 01 m nacl as a background matrix after 24 h of shaking the gel discs were transferred into 5 ml of n hexane dichloromethane 3 1 v v solution shaken for 12 h and then placed into an ultrasonic bath for 10 min the elution procedure was conducted twice and 50 ng of the surrogate standards were added into the combined eluent then the eluent was concentrated and solvent changed into 1 ml n hexane for gc ms analysis to determine the uptake kinetics for sms the binding gel discs were soaked in a 10 ml solution of 50 μg l 1 dpmi ma hhcb ahtn and mk for different lengths of time 1 min to 24 h and the binding mass of analytes was calculated by determining the extracted mass 2 5 diffusion coefficient measurements diffusion coefficients were measured using dgt method with two types of dgt devices a standard dgt device equipped with an xad 2 binding gel an agarose diffusive gel and a nl filter membrane b dgt device without an outer filter membrane in which the nl membrane was fitted to the innermost layer of the device briefly 20 l solutions 0 01 m nacl were spiked with 5 μg l 1 of nine sms and equilibrated for 12 h prior to deployment the assembled dgt devices were deployed in the solutions which were well stirred for 12 h the dgt devices were taken at 2 h intervals to elute the binding gels and at the same time 10 ml of the deployed solutions were collected for liquid liquid extraction lle to assess possible concentration changes of sms the diffusion coefficients of sms without or with nl membrane d or dnl were calculated based on the slope of the linear plot of the accumulated mass of each sm on binding gel versus time according to eq 1 1 d slope δ g ca a is the area of the exposed window of the standard dgt device c is the average concentration of sms in the deployed solution determined by lle and δg is the diffusive gel thicknesses the nl membrane thickness is included in δg for calculating dnl eq 2 was used to determine the diffusion coefficients of the sms at different temperatures challis et al 2016 2 log d t 1 37023 t 25 8 36 10 4 t 25 2 109 t log d 25 273 t 298 2 6 dgt performance under different conditions standard dgt devices were deployed in 2 l solutions spiked with dpmi ma hhcb ahtn and mk for 12 h to assess the effects of ph ionic strength is and dissolved organic matter dom on dgt performance the solutions were pre equilibrated for 12 h and stirred well during deployment a 2 l of 10 μg l 1 sm solutions containing 0 01 m nacl with ph values ranging from 4 30 to 8 92 b 2 l of 10 μg l 1 sm solutions with a ph of 6 2 containing a series of nacl concentrations ranging from 0 0001 to 0 5 m c 2 l of 10 μg l 1 sm solutions 0 01 m nacl ph 6 2 with humic acid concentrations ranging from 0 to 20 mg l 1 to test dgt uptake performance in long term deployment standard dgt devices were deployed in 2 l solutions 0 01 m nacl ph 6 2 containing 5 μg l 1 of dpmi ma hhcb ahtn and mk the spiked solutions were refreshed every 12 h and covered with a plastic wrap to reduce volatilization of the sms in the solution dgt devices were retrieved at different times from 6 h to 7 d the effect of the diffusive layer thickness was evaluated using the dgt devices equipped with agarose gels with 0 4 0 8 1 2 and 1 6 mm thicknesses in 2 l of 10 μg l 1 sm solutions containing 0 01 m nacl for 12 h the deployed solutions mentioned above were extracted via lle to check for possible changes of the sm concentrations in the solutions during dgt deployment 2 7 field trial in wwtps to verify the performance of dgt under field conditions multiple standard dgt devices were deployed in two wwtps lingshui ls 121 32 8 11 e 38 51 51 17 n and sanjian sj 121 13 58 07 e 38 55 35 75 n located on the east and west coasts of dalian china the treatment techniques in the ls and sj are the traditional activated sludge process and a2 o having wastewater capacities of 80 000 and 60 000 m3 d 1 and serving 200 000 and 50 000 people respectively the dgt devices were fixed on a special shelf made of plexiglass to keep the exposure windows outward and deployed at 0 45 m under the water surface in the ls effluent for 3 to 14 d water samples in the effluent and influent were also collected daily for solid phase extraction spe followed by gc ms analysis details are provided in si the water quality parameters were obtained from the data uploaded with the automatic monitoring system in the treatment plant and water temperature was measured by an automatic continuous temperature recorder th4xw china the dgt deployment in sj effluent was carried out for 7 d using the same method 2 8 instrumental analysis all samples were analyzed using a shimadzu gc ms qp2020 in sim mode with electron ionization ei and the parameters are given in table s2 the details of the analysis procedure are provided in the si 3 results and discussion 3 1 adsorption of sms to dgt material the adsorption of analytes by dgt material especially the filter membrane should be minimized to avoid the potential influence on the formation of the diffusion gradients along the diffusion phase davison and zhang 2012 herein possible adsorption of hydrophobic sms on five different filter membranes mce pvdf ptfe pes and nl agarose diffusive gel and dgt moldings were tested fig 1 shows there was maximum adsorption of the sms on ptfe membrane 21 73 and the retentions on mce pvdf and pes membranes were slightly decreased but still considerable 21 47 the sms were minimally absorbed on nl membrane 7 the result is different from the previous result reported wang et al 2019 in which there was the smaller adsorptions for hydrophobic organophosphate esters on ptfe than pes and polypropylene ghp membranes in this study nl membrane was finally selected for standard dgt devices the average adsorption rates for the sms onto agarose diffusive gel and dgt moldings were below 10 except for 13 8 for mk onto dgt moldings showing the availability of the dgt subassemblies for measuring sms 3 2 elution efficiency reliable elution efficiency can ensure accurate quantitation in dgt measurements to date methanol has been used extensively to elute organic pollutants from various dgt binding gels however zhang et al demonstrated that available efficiencies for nitro chlorobenzene compounds ncbs with moderate n octanol water partitioning coefficients log kow 2 17 could not be provided by polar methanol zhang et al 2019 herein low polar n hexane dichloromethane 3 1 v v solution commonly used in the extraction of hydrophobic sms from environmental samples was applied to elute the sms from xad 2 gel bester 2009 elution conditions were also optimized by comparing the efficiencies under different elution ways 5 ml for twice or 10 ml for once for horizontal shaking 12 h or ultrasonic extraction 30 min results show that horizontal shaking twice with 5 ml eluent achieved the best elution efficiency but the efficiency still did not reach 80 for ahtn and hhcb figure s2 the final elution procedure of shaking in 5 ml eluent for 12 h followed by ultrasonication for 10 min conducted twice was determined and it provided excellent efficiencies of 92 108 for all the sms in the tested concentration range 10 50 μg l 1 figure s3 3 3 uptake kinetics of sms onto binding gels the results of uptake kinetics shown in figure s4 demonstrated that the binding mass of dpmi ma hhcb ahtn mk on xad 2 gel rapidly increased with exposure time in the initial stage with an average binding rate of 0 576 0 515 0 418 0 420 and 0 635 ng cm 2s 1 within 30 min while the fluxes of sms transported through the filter membrane and agarose diffusive gel were only 0 041 0 140 ng cm 2s 1 by assuming a solution concentration of 50 μg l 1 which is much higher than the concentration of sms in real environmental waters bester 2009 this result indicates that sms diffused from the external solution could rapidly bind on xad 2 gel to ensure that the interface concentration between the binding gel and diffusive gel was zero during deployment this is also a prerequisite for the quantification by the dgt equation 3 4 diffusion coefficient measurements the dgt method was used here to determine the diffusion coefficients of sms in the diffusion phase because of the low water solubility and semivolatility of the analytes several studies have shown that analytes that initially transfer onto dgt devices were first trapped by the filter membrane prior to reaching saturation resulting in the occurrence of lag phase before linear uptake challis et al 2016 estoppey et al 2019 this phenomenon is more prominent in hocs sampling vermeirssen et al 2012 wang et al 2019 although nl membrane with least adsorption was chosen the effect of the filter membrane on the lag phase of sms was still examined via continuous dgt deployment for 12 h using the dgt devices with or without the nl membrane during the deployment period the sms concentrations in the solution were measured by lle and showed less than 10 of changes p 0 05 as shown in fig 2 the mass of the sms accumulated on the dgt devices without nl membrane showed a good linear relationship with time r2 0 990 0 998 from 2 h to 12 h table s3 the diffusion coefficients of sms through the agarose gel d were 3 37 4 60 10 6cm2 s 1 calculated from equation 1 table s4 however with the standard dgt devices containing a nl filter membrane a lag phase time of 75 173 min was observed based on the intercepts of the time axis for each sm fig 2 suggesting that the retention of sms on the membrane substantially extend the time needed to establish a diffusion controlled steady state within the diffusive phase wang et al 2019 the diffusion coefficients of sms through the nl membrane and agarose gel dnl were therefore calculated by excluding the initial two hour data and the resulting dnl were 1 48 4 41 10 6cm2 s 1 r2 0 996 0 999 compared with d the decrease in dnl dnl d 0 44 0 98 demonstrated that nl membrane reduced the diffusion rates of sms through the diffusion phase even after the lag phase generally the dgt devices without a filter membrane provided higher sampling rates for sms with negligible lag phases however considering the necessity of the filter membrane in dgt devices for monitoring of heavily polluted waters a standard dgt device is preferred and the more realistic diffusion coefficients of dnl is recommended for dgt quantification in the present study previous studies have demonstrated that the diffusion rates of compounds in agarose gel are related to their hydrophobic characteristic log kow chen et al 2013 wang et al 2019 the relationships between the d or dnl with log kow of sms were further investigated d of both nitro musks and polycyclic musks had a significant negative p 0 05 linear correlation with log kow fig 3a which is consistent with the results for opfrs zou et al 2018 however although a significant negative correlation p 0 05 between dnl and log kow of polycyclic musks was observed it was not applicable to dnl of the three nitro musks fig 3b with the presence of nl membrane in the dgt devices the log kow influence on the diffusion coefficients of sms became more significant especially for polycyclic musks with a higher log kow 4 49 table s1 and the diffusion resistance in the membrane was obviously increased with increase in log kow of polycyclic musks 3 5 effects of ph is and dom on uptake performance solution ph is and dom are essential aquatic parameters affecting dgt performance in water samples figure s5 illustrates the variation in the cdgt csoln ratio with ph values ranging from 4 30 to 8 92 no obvious influence on the dgt performance was observed based on the ratios of 0 93 1 07 which were within an acceptable value range of 0 90 1 10 previous studies have also demonstrated that xad 18 and xda 1 dgt are independent of ph for measuring pfass guan et al 2018 illicit drugs guo et al 2017 and endocrine disrupting chemicals edcs xie et al 2018 in addition the lack of dissociable acid base functional groups in the structure of sms also reduced the ph effect on dgt sampling to some extent the dgt measurement of five sms was also not affected in the solution containing 0 0001 0 5 m nacl with the average cdgt csoln ratios ranging from 0 91 to 1 06 figure s5 this is consistent with the pfas measurement results using xad dgt guan et al 2018 and the ncb measurements using hlb dgt zhang et al 2019 there was no significant decrease in cdgt csoln ratios even is of the solution increasing up to 0 5 m indicating that the present dgt is suitable for sampling in high salt waters the influence of dom on dgt performance is presented in figure s6 when the dom concentrations in the solution varied within 0 20 mg l 1 the cdgt csoln ratio values mainly fell into the range of 0 90 1 10 except for slight decreases in the cdgt csoln ratios 0 87 0 89 for dpmi and ma with dom concentration exceeding 10 mg l 1 the likely reason is the slower diffusion rates in solutions with a high level of dom due to the combination between ha and sms or competitive adsorption of ha on the binding gel balch and gueguen 2015 boehm and duering 2010 a similar decline in the ratios with a dom concentration above 12 mg l 1 has also been observed in the measurement of psychiatric pharmaceuticals fang et al 2019 generally moderate dom has negligible influence on the dgt performance due to sufficient binding capacity provided by xad 2 gel 3 6 effects of diffusive gel thickness and deployment time theoretically when the deployed solution was at the same concentration and well stirred the mass on the binding gel should linearly increase with the reciprocal of diffusive layer thickness δg according to dgt equation for sms the accumulated mass on the binding gel linearly increased with the reciprocal of δg for 0 94 1 74 mm figure s7 with an r2 value ranging from 0 991 0 999 p 0 05 the mass increase also fitted well the trend of the theoretical lines suggesting accurate measurement with the gel thicknesses however the mass accumulated by a dgt device with a 0 54 mm diffusive layer was slightly less than the theoretical values for dpmi ma hhcb and mk while ahtn with a smaller dnl still kept a linear response versus the reciprocal of the thickness figure s7 the most possible reason is that the thinner diffusion layer increases the amount of the analytes diffused onto the surface of the binding gel resulting in a slight accumulation of sms on the diffusion gel and binding gel interface thus a 0 94 mm diffusive layer 0 8 mm diffusive gel and 0 14 mm nl membrane was used for the dgt devices in field trial the dependence of sms mass accumulated on binding gel on deployment time was investigated to determine effective sampling time i e maximum linear uptake period for dgt devices as shown in figure s8 the accumulated mass of sms was linearly increased with time for 7 d r2 0 990 0 998 and fitted well with the theoretical lines the robustness for long time deployment was also consistent with that previously observed for edcs sampling with xda 1 dgt for 15 d and for pfass measurement with xad 18 dgt for 132 h guan et al 2018 xie et al 2018 3 7 dgt blanks and method quantitation limits the blank concentration of dgt devices instrument limits of detection and quantification lods and loqs for gc ms and dgt method detection limits mdls are listed in table s5 the dgt devices were deployed in a blank solution for 7 d no detection of sms in eluent of the binding gel suggested that laboratory contamination was effectively avoided by thoroughly cleaning xad 2 resin deployment containers and careful operations the mdls of dgt for 7 d of deployment ranged from 0 02 0 09 ng l 1 which is two orders of magnitude lower than the loqs 1 5 μg l 1 showing significant sensitivity improvements the present method was capable of measuring sms in most of surface waters at concentrations up to μg l 1 in effluent from wwtps homem et al 2015 1 0 4 7 ng l 1 in lake waters peck and hornbuckle 2004 and 0 05 2 5 ng l 1 in sea water gatermann et al 1995 3 8 field trial in wwtps dgt devices were installed at two municipal wwtps ls and sj for monitoring sms to examine the performance in a field trial the temperature ph and chemical oxygen demand cod of the sampling site in ls effluent during 14 d sampling period were 18 8 0 57 c 6 78 0 11 and 11 12 1 44 mg l 1 respectively figure s9 and table s6 the uptake mass of sms by dgt devices with deployment time in the ls effluent are shown in fig 4 all the detected sms were linearly accumulated by dgt for at least 5 d while some sms e g hhcb and dpmi were linearly accumulated within 7 or 10 d the plateauing and downswing of spots may be due to fouling of the filter membranes figure s10 preventing the continuous transfer of sms to the binding gel chen et al 2013 uher et al 2012 therefore the data within the effective sampling time i e the linear uptake period was used to calculate dgt concentrations cdgt of sms as shown in fig 5 seven sms dpmi adbi atii ahmi hhcb ahtn and mk were detected in ls effluent using dgt approach the concentrations of sms ranged from 0 45 to 696 ng l 1 comparable with those reported for the effluent in municipal wwtps such as 77 10525 ng l 1 in the usa chase et al 2012 6 7 954 5 in china lv et al 2010a and 82 259 ng l 1 in spain posada ureta et al 2012 polycyclic musks accounted for 98 9 of all detected sms in the effluent of which hhcb was identified as a predominant musk with the highest proportion of 94 2 these results are in agreement with previous studies reporting that hhcb has the highest detection frequency and concentration level in sewage godayol et al 2015 homem et al 2015 by contrast only one nitro musk mk with a low concentration of 7 87 ng l 1 was detected in ls effluent previous studies have also demonstrated that nitro musks especially mx and mk are still present in sewage worldwide although many countries have restricted their production and use on a large scale chase et al 2012 lv et al 2010b vallecillos et al 2014 compared with results by dgt the daily concentrations of sms in ls effluent determined by continuous grab sampling for 14 d are shown in figure s11 detailed data shown in table s7 in general the concentrations of sms obtained using both methods were in the same order of magnitude and both methods showed a similar occurrence pattern for each sm fig 5 dgt and grab samplings also had a good agreement in the total amount of sms in ls effluent and the sum concentrations of seven detected sms are 738 ng l 1 and 616 ng l 1 table s7 respectively however the concentration of each sm obtained from grab sampling fluctuated significantly during the 14 day sampling period with 41 5 89 6 relative standard deviations except for adbi and atii the concentrations of sms determined by grab sampling scattered around the twa concentrations determined by dgt basically the twa concentration by dgt could reflect the concentration trend of sms in ls effluent during the sampling period while the results by daily garb sampling reflected the diurnal changes of sms the complementary methods would provide comprehensive understanding for the concentration trend and variation of sms during the sampling period due to seriously biofouling no obvious increasing trend in the accumulated mass of sms was observed with time when dgt devices were deployed in ls influent and thus the concentration of sms in the influent was only provided by grab sampling table s8 the same seven sm compounds were detected in ls influent via grab sampling with concentrations of 0 66 1393 ng l 1 the averaged removal efficiencies of sms during the treatment process were 46 2 17 4 and 53 1 8 6 based on the concentrations of sms in effluent obtained by dgt and grab sampling these values were lower than those of 60 90 reported in previous investigations homem et al 2015 the reason may be because the lower operating temperature in winter decreased the elimination of sms by influencing their dissociation constant on sludge which is a primary tendency of removed sms in wwtps homem et al 2015 lv et al 2010a in sj effluent similar sms excluding atii with concentrations ranging from 1 53 to 276 3 ng l 1 table s9 were detected by dgt in the 7 d deployment with no obvious biofouling on dgt devices the sum concentrations of sms in sj effluent σsms 344 ng l 1 was approximately a factor of two lower than in ls effluent this is because sj and ls provide wastewater treatment services for rural and urban populations respectively the use of personal care products containing sm compounds is greatly influenced by the lifestyle of the population served in addition different operating parameters and removal rates in wwtps may affect the emissions of sms from wwtps homem et al 2015 4 conclusion we demonstrated an in situ measurement method based on dgt using a xad 2 gel for semivolatile hydrophobic sms in urban wastewaters the sampling rates of sms via standard dgt devices containing the nl membrane were 1 3 4 04 ml d 1 cm 2 comparable with those 0 56 7 85 ml d 1 cm 2 for hydrophilic organic pollutants for example antibiotics and pharmaceuticals field deployment in wwtps showed that the results obtained with dgt are consistent with those obtained using traditional grab sampling seven sms were detected in the effluents of several local wwtps and hhcb was identified as a predominant musk a dgt sampling time in excess of 3 d is recommended to avoid a lag phase from the retention of sms on the filter membrane and to provide adequate detection sensitivity our study provides an efficient tool for in situ monitoring of sms in complicate waters and expands dgt applications in the measurement of organic pollutants in aquatic environment supporting information detailed

17597,drinking water suppliers around the world are required by regulations to sample and test water quality in their distribution systems with the intention of generating information that can be used to protect human health requirements for where samples must be collected can vary and guidance on how to select locations to meet these requirements is limited there is a need to better define and evaluate the meaning of representative in the context of selecting locations for collecting grab samples while considering the regulatory context and resources available to suppliers we develop sampling programs for monitoring disinfectant residual concentrations and compare the results and efficacy of these programs using synthetic water quality data for two example distribution systems results showed that achieving accurate estimates of worst quality conditions in a network was more likely than achieving accurate estimates of systemwide conditions and that using constant locations makes it difficult to accurately represent systemwide conditions results also showed that timing of sample collection is likely important depending on factors such as consumer demand patterns and that it is inappropriate to make conclusions about systemwide conditions when few samples are taken over an evaluation period this research has implications for developing recommendations that water suppliers and regulators can use to design and evaluate effective sampling programs graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords sampling programs water quality monitoring water quality regulations drinking water 1 introduction water suppliers are required to monitor water quality in their distribution systems to do so suppliers must develop a water quality monitoring program wqmp the purpose of which is to provide information about whether the water that suppliers are providing is safe for consumption and alert them of potential risks to human health rahman et al 2011 world health organization 2011 key aspects of an effective wqmp include clearly establishing the objectives of the monitoring program and then setting the locations of sample collection timing of sample collection and numbers of samples collected to meet those objectives ellis 1989 khalil and ouarda 2009 sanders 1983 water suppliers use the data collected from wqmps to demonstrate compliance with regulations and to make decisions on system operations whether these objectives can be met depend on the design and constraints of the plan in the words of ellis 1989 today s program design becomes tomorrow s program interpretation however while there are often stated objectives of many regulatory monitoring activities guidance on designing plans and in particular the locations for collecting grab samples that can meet those objectives is more limited narasimhan et al 2004 us epa 2007 requirements for selecting locations for sample collection vary throughout the world drinking water quality regulations like the united states environmental protection agency s usepa revised total coliform rule tcr often specify that sampling locations should be chosen to be representative of water quality throughout a distribution system us epa 2015 but guidance specifying what makes a sampling location representative is limited in what appears to be a fundamentally different approach the world health organization recommends that sampling location selection consider places with increased likelihood of contamination world health organization 2011 according to the european drinking water directive samples should be equally distributed in both time and location european union 1998 considering the variation in guidance on sampling location selection there is a need to better define and test what representative means in the context of sampling program location selection as it pertains to guidance for grab samples collected and tested for compliance purposes drinking water contains physical biological and chemical constituents that can be important to monitor to evaluate potential risks to human health immediate risks to human health may be posed by pathogens commonly evaluated by detection of indicator organisms like e coli while these indicators are often not correlated with human health in drinking water they and measures such as heterotrophic plate counts can be used to indicate whether a treatment process or distribution system may be compromised edberg et al 2000 francisque et al 2009 pepper et al 2015 however monitoring of bacteriological indicators in drinking water presents challenges because of low coliform occurrence in well functioning distribution systems besner et al 2002 free chlorine concentration i e free chlorine residual fcr can be used as a proxy of bacteriological quality in cases where it is added as a secondary disinfectant national research council 1980 additionally the us surface water treatment rule swtr requires residual disinfectant concentration to be measured at the same time as total coliform samples and states that residual disinfectant concentration should not be undetectable in more than 5 of samples in a month national primary drinking water regulations 2006 this makes fcr an important water quality parameter to monitor previous studies evaluating whether sampling strategies could detect or represent bacteriological or disinfectant residual in a distribution system have focused on how to select locations water quality modeling methods and event detection a randomized stratified sampling method employed by speight et al 2004 identified distance from a treatment plant with proportionate location allocation as the most effective method of representing fcr throughout the system further work employing similar methods demonstrated that fixed location continuous monitors may not be effective for monitoring systemwide disinfectant residual conditions speight 2009 grayman et al 2008 proposed using a monte carlo simulation approach to generate synthetic water quality futures under which sampling programs could be evaluated other studies have explored whether sampling strategies including locations timing and numbers for grab samples or continuous monitoring with sensors could be designed to detect contamination events for example a case study using simulated contamination events found that standard monitoring programs through grab sampling have a low probability of detecting even severe fecal contamination by e coli in drinking water mains e g 5 chance of detection for a 16 h intrusion of raw sewage into a distribution main van lieverloo et al 2007 similarly an evaluation of alternative sampling options i e three times per month daily and continuous for total coliforms found that the possibility of event detection varied based on event characteristics e g duration and magnitude and monitoring option used the tcr based sampling program could not detect any tested events grayman et al 2007 other work has focused on placement of continuous sensors for detecting contamination and fcr helbling and vanbriesen 2008 ostfeld et al 2008 however we identified three gaps in the literature on selecting sampling locations in distribution systems first previous studies have developed strategies that rely on calibrated hydraulic models and copious system information however many systems lack such tools and information hart and murray 2010 second many of these studies have selected from ideal or optimized locations ostfeld et al 2008 location selection methods speight 2009 speight et al 2004 and timings grayman et al 2007 ostfeld et al 2008 however these may not be feasible in practice in reality many utilities have sampling programs where they only sample at certain times of day and from some locations narasimhan et al 2004 speight et al 2004 third there has been limited research conducted on the impacts of routine regulatory monitoring methods on sampling program outcomes and implications the objective of this research is to quantitatively assess how differences in sampling program designs based on the likely practices of real world utilities affect the information they offer to water utilities and regulators 2 methods we designed sampling programs that consist of four main parts the locations where samples are taken location selection method timing of sample collection and number of samples taken in a given week fig 1 to evaluate the sampling programs we used epanet 2 0 an open source hydraulic and water quality modeling software rossman 2000 using water quality models for two piped water distribution networks bwsn battle of the water sensor networks and mwsc midwestern small city this study focuses on systems that effectively have one disinfectant dosing location as approximately 69 of united states utilities surveyed indicated not using disinfectant booster stations in their systems awwa disinfection committee 2018 we evaluated efficacy of the sampling programs by their ability to accurately reflect modeled system water quality conditions on weekly and daily timescales we also investigated the effects of operational changes and fixed constant sampling location selection on sampling program results finally we compared results for the two modeled networks 2 1 sampling program design the definition of sampling programs that are representative of a network is often left up to interpretation due to ambiguity in guidelines and requirements us epa 2007 we define location cases as either representative of 1 the whole system or 2 worst quality table 1 based on suggestions for possible ways to account for temporal and spatial variability in water quality ellis 1989 these potential location cases are not exhaustive but they demonstrate a range of definitions of representative the location cases used here are generally designed to reflect sample location selection methods of utilities who have not or do not have the ability to use computer based optimization techniques or rely on use of a hydraulic model to aid in sample location selection locations for sampling is a key aspect of sampling programs each network to be tested was converted into arcgis format esri 2016 pipe lengths were verified in arcgis i e arcgis vector length had to match epanet pipe length parameter input before carrying out node selection all fig 2 a all nodes meaning all potential points for water quality sample collection e g consumer taps hydrants or storage tanks typified by a junction or tank object in epanet in the network are possible sampling locations this location case represents a simple random selection of locations a method used to remove bias from selection procedure and generate a representative sample gravetter and forzano 2012 geogrid geographically distributed locations fig 2b a grid of 10 000 ft by 10 000 ft cells was laid over the network using arcgis one node was randomly selected from a grid cell up to the number of grid cells corresponding to the number of samples to be collected e g if 38 samples are required 38 grid cells are randomly selected with one node randomly selected from within each cell this location case represents a scenario where a utility lacks a hydraulic model and has limited information about water quality but wants to attempt coverage of different areas in their distribution system balstrata balanced allocation stratification fig 2c concentric rings spaced one mile apart from each other a distance based stratum were centered around the distribution system s sources of water using arcgis and an approximately equal number of sampling locations was chosen from within each ring which represents a stratum this location case represents a scenario where a utility wants to determine water quality characteristics in different areas of their system far20 furthest 20 of points from the source fig 2d the shortest length from the system s disinfectant sources to each node in the network was determined using arcgis the 20 furthest sampling nodes were then set as potential sampling nodes this location case represents a scenario where a utility expects to find the worst quality water at the points of their system furthest from its treatment facility due to increased water age li et al 2019 mercer 2011 below50 locations below target for at least 50 of simulation fig 2e potential sampling nodes were determined using water quality model results to identify nodes with 0 2 mg l fcr for at least 50 of all time steps employing this method is only possible for utilities with an available water quality model or detailed data from an extensive grab sampling campaign designed to identify such areas this location case represents a scenario where a utility prioritizes sampling at locations for which consistent poor water quality is expected deadends extremities dead ends fig 2f potential sampling nodes were determined by identifying the locations of pipes with an isolated endpoint using arcgis this allowed for identification of network dead ends which are typical points of stagnation and therefore poor water quality barbeau et al 2005 galvin 2011 location selection methods the evaluated sampling programs selected varying locations meaning that sampling locations were chosen from a pool of potential locations each time that program was used we also evaluated selecting constant locations meaning that sampling locations were chosen from a more restricted pool of sampling locations timing of sample collection three timing scenarios were used 24 h any hour of the day 7am 12pm and 6am 4pm the two restricted timing scenarios were based on sample collection times that coincide with working hours of water system operators sampling programs were evaluated on two time scales weekly i e the entire simulation and daily i e each day of the simulation these were used because they are horizons over which a distribution system operator may be interested in reviewing water quality sampling results and altering operational decisions number of samples collected sample frequency the usepa s tcr requires public water suppliers to take a minimum number of total coliform samples each month as determined by the population served by the system us epa 2015 we used the table from the tcr to determine this minimum number of monthly samples based on the population served for each we then divided by 4 weeks to determine the number of samples that would need to be taken in a typical week for compliance purposes i e 150 samples month 4 equates to 38 weekly samples for a network serving a population 250 000 and 20 samples month 4 equates to 5 weekly samples for a network serving a population of 20 000 we also evaluated alternate sampling frequencies e g increasing the number of samples beyond the minimum requirement 1 5x for bwsn and 2x for mwsc daily sampling frequencies were calculated by having an approximately equal number of samples per day based on the weekly sampling frequency 2 2 distribution systems and hydraulic models two epanet water quality models were used to model fcr i e disinfectant residual concentration and we evaluated the sampling programs using the water quality output of each epanet model application of sampling program designs to water quality model outputs and statistical analysis of sampling program results were carried out in r r core team 2017 simulations were used to generate 1000 possible outcomes for each sampling program with parallel processing using the snow package with a set seed of 23 results were evaluated on weekly and daily timescales 2 2 1 system 1 bwsn the first epanet model was based on network 2 from the battle of the water sensor networks bwsn ostfeld et al 2008 with some adjustments to enable the spatially based network location selections in this study briefly corrections were made to pipe length using arcgis to match the physically mapped network the total head of reservoirs in the system was adjusted to allow the hydraulic model to execute given the pipe length changes a water source a well was removed and demands were assigned to nodes to reflect potential points for sample extraction the bwsn network has 12 525 nodes potential sampling locations representing a network serving approximately 250 000 people fig 3 there are two reservoirs two tanks and four pumping stations that serve the system the tanks use a completely mixed modeling technique meaning that the model assumes instantaneous and complete mixing in the tanks there are simple control statements that affect the operation of the pumps and valves surrounding each of the tanks we set the average fcr leaving each of the two reservoirs as 1 mg l fcr to approximate a single source of disinfectant to the entire system with a first order bulk water decay coefficient of 0 384 day and a first order wall decay coefficient correlation of 24 4 the simulation has 168 1 hour reporting time steps 1 week hydraulic time steps were 1 hour and water quality time steps were 6 min two sampling frequencies were evaluated 38 samples the estimated minimum number of tcr required samples per week and 56 samples scaling up the number of required samples per week by a factor of 1 5 2 2 2 system 2 mwsc the same processes were applied to a hydraulic model of a different distribution system for a small city in the midwestern us designed to serve approximately 20 000 customers mwsc fig 3 wong et al 2017 there are four tanks completely mixed model four pumping stations and one reservoir source in the system for more information on this system see wong et al 2017 the same chlorine decay parameters and chlorine dosing pattern were used for this water quality model average fcr leaving the source was set to 1 mg l with a first order bulk water decay coefficient of 0 384 day and a first order wall decay coefficient correlation of 24 4 the simulation has 168 1 hour reporting time steps 1 week hydraulic and water quality time steps were both 5 min two sampling frequencies were evaluated 5 samples the estimated minimum number of tcr required samples per week and 10 samples doubling the number of required samples per week 2 3 system evaluations 2 3 1 measures of efficacy as previously stated the swtr requires residual disinfectant concentration to be measured at the same time as total coliform samples and that no more than 5 of samples in a month can have undetectable residual concentration national primary drinking water regulations 2006 for these analyses we use fcr as the water quality parameter of interest as a proxy for microbial water quality a target concentration of 0 2 mg l fcr was used because this is a common recommendation for the minimum disinfectant residual at the point of water delivery lantagne 2008 we define the metric to describe the extent of low fcr throughout the distribution system as the percentage of samples less than target plt concentration for each location case the pltactual is the true percentage of sample locations with fcr less than the target concentration across all nodes to be considered for a given location case across all timesteps i e 168 weekly 24 daily in the evaluation period based on water quality simulation results eq 1 the pltactual value changes depending on the location case tested sample plt values were calculated for each sampling program developed using simulations described above 1 p l t a c t u a l n o d e s w i

where distributions of sampling program results were compared to avoid violating the statistical assumptions required for parametric tests parametric tests the t test were used where sampling program results were compared to point values i e pltactual non parametric statistics were applied in cases where distributions of sampling program results were being compared to avoid violating the statistical assumptions required for parametric tests the wilcoxon rank sum test was used to test for statistical difference between distributions of sampling program results using different numbers of samples the kruskal wallis test was used to test for statistical differences in the sampling program results between timing scenarios for both the weekly and daily time scales parametric tests were used where sampling program results were being compared to point values i e pltactual the t test was used to determine if sample plt results of simulations were statistically different from pltactual values for each sampling program for both the weekly and daily time scales 2 3 2 operational changes chlorine dosing outage the sensitivity of the model to changes in chlorine dosing was evaluated for the bwsn system only we simulated a hypothetical extreme malfunction in chlorine dosing equipment at a treatment plant by setting the chlorine dose at both reservoirs to 0 mg l for four hours starting at 12pm on the third day of the simulation fig 4 2 3 3 constant sampling locations state primacy agencies can require that utilities have fixed constant sampling locations for compliance purposes the tcr requires that if a sample measures positive for tc the supplier must take repeat samples at the original location and nearby upstream and downstream locations this necessitates that suppliers have a regular ability to access these sites us epa 2007 a 1985 survey found that 82 1 of 1796 surveyed water utilities used at least some fixed locations for their bacterial sampling programs narasimhan et al 2004 this practice may have increased since these data were collected as the tcr has shifted water suppliers towards having less varying sampling locations water suppliers may also use constant locations to generate time series for water quality parameters we investigated the effects of restricted sample location selection constant locations versus varying locations on the ability of sampling programs to represent true system conditions we achieved this for the location cases in table 1 for the bwsn network by testing 1 38 possible sampling locations with a locked method e g sample at site a on monday every week 2 38 possible sampling locations with an unlocked method e g sample at site a at least once a week 3 76 possible sampling locations as double double the required number of weekly samples and 4 114 possible sampling locations as triple using the mwsc network the locked locations was tested for each location case in table 1 and the unlocked locations was tested on the all location case fewer analyses were carried out for the mwsc network because few samples were taken n 5 statistical differences between sample plt results and pltactual values for each sampling program at weekly time scales were evaluated with t tests differences between constant location and varying location sampling program results were evaluated with wilcoxon rank sum tests and the effects of timing scenarios for constant location sampling programs were investigated with kruskal wallis tests 2 4 comparing the bwsn and mwsc networks to summarize the differences in results for the varying location sampling programs we compared statistical difference from pltactual values at 95 confidence for 1 bwsn tcr the bwsn network with the tcr number of required samples n 38 2 mwsc tcr the mwsc network with the tcr number of required samples n 5 and 3 mwsc comp the mwsc network with varying numbers of samples to account for expected differences in sampling error between the networks to minimize the effects of different sample numbers and margins of error between the networks the number of samples required for the bwsn and mwsc networks to have approximately equal margins of error were calculated the base condition was 38 samples for the bwsn network the corresponding number of samples for the mwsc network nmwsc was calculated eq 2 table 2 z is the z score for the desired confidence level p is the pltactual value for the location case being considered and nbwsn is the tcr required number of samples for the bwsn network i e 38 the pltactual value for each location case was used because it represents the best possible estimate of the true proportion of samples less than the target concentration for sampling programs using that location case if the calculated nmwsc value exceeded 5 of the population of possible sampling locations then the finite population correction fpc was applied eq 2 multiplied by eq 3 2 z p b w s n 1 p b w s n n b w s n z p m w s c 1 p m w s c n m w s c 3 f p c n n m w s c n 1 n 960 3 results and discussion 3 1 bwsn network 3 1 1 effects of the number of samples on sampling program results the results produced by the varying location sampling programs applied to the bwsn model with 38 samples and 56 samples were not statistically different at the 95 confidence level p 0 05 wilcoxon rank sum except for below50 programs table s1 for below50 programs the wilcoxon rank sum test may have performed improperly due to right truncated distributions and tied ranks a 2 sample rank sum permutation test was performed to address the right truncated distributions and showed no statistical differences for any sampling program tested table s2 we can then conclude that the number of samples taken did not affect conclusions about distributions of sampling program results for most location cases when a relatively low number of samples were taken from the population of possible sampling locations we focus the remainder of the analysis using 38 samples only which corresponds to the tcr recommended number as a caveat this conclusion may not hold if higher numbers of samples were to be collected e g 500 from a statistical perspective smaller sample sizes always result in higher margins of error 3 1 2 weekly and daily timescale evaluations distributions of weekly plt results were compared to pltactual values for each varying location sampling program fig 5 out of the whole system location cases the all location case programs performed best with only the 24 h program yielding statistically different results compared to systemwide pltactual p 0 036 t test it is expected that the all location case i e simple random sampling would perform the best gravetter and forzano 2012 for geogrid and balstrata programs we see poorer performance in representing systemwide pltactual fig 5 potentially because it becomes more likely to select a sampling location with typically lower fcr since some grid cells or strata contain more system extremities or dead ends which typically have lower fcr we can draw this conclusion based on the similarity of the distributions for results of these programs geogrid and balstrata compared to worst quality programs far20 and deadends fig s1 among the worst quality programs far20 and deadends performed the best with no sampling programs producing statistically different results from the corresponding worst quality pltactuals p 0 05 t test overall the worst quality programs provided better representations of true worst quality plt conditions in the network likely due to a lower average standard deviation in fcr values at potential sampling locations for those location cases using different timing scenarios had little impact on observed statistical differences between sampling program results with no observed statistical differences between timing scenarios for most programs p 0 05 kruskal wallis except for balstrata and below50 fig 5 for the bwsn network the timing for sample collection appeared to have little impact on whether the results of the sampling program represented true plt in the network likely related to its large spatial size which muted effects of timing despite variations in demand fig s2a daily plt values for each program were compared to daily pltactual values fig 6 like the weekly timescale results the majority of daily plt estimates were able to accurately represent daily systemwide pltactual values except in geogrid and balstrata programs expected given the observed results on the weekly timescale the timing scenarios led to statistically different program results p 0 05 kruskal wallis for a given day and location case for 5 of the 42 daily results table s3 this reinforces the conclusion from the weekly timescale evaluation for this network that the timing of sample collection does not significantly impact whether the sampling program results will represent true plt conditions in this network again likely related to network size 3 1 3 operational changes chlorine dosing outage when modeling an interruption to chlorination the geogrid balstrata and below50 program results were statistically different from pltactual on the weekly timescale p 0 001 t test fig s3 the 6am 4pm timing scenario led to the most program results that were not statistically different p 0 05 t test out of the three timing scenarios generally more programs were statistically different p 0 05 t test when chlorination was interrupted as compared to the base bwsn water quality model it is expected that an accurate estimate of conditions in the network would be difficult to attain due to the increased variation in fcr concentrations throughout the network over the simulated week for all groups of location cases evaluated with the chlorination interruption the timing scenarios led to statistically different program results p 0 05 kruskal wallis except for deadends programs daily results showed statistical differences between timing scenarios for all geogrid balstrata and far20 programs on day 3 p 0 05 kruskal wallis table s4 daily plt values for each program were compared to daily pltactual values with results showing that all geogrid and balstrata program results as well as the majority of below50 program results were statistically different from daily systemwide pltactual values p 0 001 and p 0 05 respectively t test fig 7 every location case tested had at least one program with a timing scenario that led to statistically different results from daily pltactual p 0 05 t test on the day the outage was modeled day 3 which demonstrates that being able to accurately capture plt conditions in the network can be difficult when a significant operational change takes place 3 1 4 constant sampling location sampling programs tests for statistical difference from pltactual values showed that most constant location programs had statistically different results p 0 05 t test only 3 out of 72 6 location cases x 3 timing scenarios x 4 constant location methods programs yielded results that were not statistically different from pltactual values at 95 confidence all of which used the triple pool constant location method far20 7am 12pm and 24 h all 7am 12pm these results demonstrate that choosing fixed sampling locations will largely prevent attaining results that represent true plt conditions in the network notably constant sampling locations are used by many water suppliers however these findings demonstrate that suppliers looking to quantify the extent of low fcr in their system may obtain inaccurate estimates with constant locations additional tests showed that most 63 72 constant location sampling programs were statistically different p 0 05 wilcoxon rank sum from corresponding varying location sampling programs table s5 results of tests for differences between timing scenarios were largely dissimilar varying location results mostly showed no significant difference between timing scenarios while most constant location programs did 20 24 with p 0 05 kruskal wallis table s6 all locked programs yielded statistically different results p 0 05 kruskal wallis between timing scenarios this demonstrates that timing for grab sampling programs using constant locations may be more important than those using varying locations since the window of time during which samples are collected appears to have a more pronounced effect on the results of sampling programs that use constant locations it is possible that the temporal variability of the sampling locations selected as constant locations is high and that would make them better suited as locations for installation of continuous monitoring of low fcr speight 2009 it is important to consider this possibility as more utilities incorporate online monitors 45 of utilities surveyed in the united states 2017 reported using online monitors at some place in their distribution system awwa disinfection committee 2018 3 2 mwsc network 3 2 1 effects of the number of samples on sampling program results the varying location programs with 5 samples and 10 samples were not statistically different at a 95 confidence level p 0 05 wilcoxon rank sum except for below50 programs and the dead ends 24 h program table s7 this result is similar to that of the bwsn network and again allows us to conclude that the number of samples taken did not affect our conclusions for most location cases for relatively low numbers of samples table s7 therefore the presented analysis uses 5 samples only 3 2 2 weekly and daily timescale evaluations distributions of plt results on the weekly timescale were compared to pltactual values for each varying location sampling program fig 8 out of the representative of whole system location cases the all location case programs performed the best with only the 7am 12pm program results statistically different p 0 044 t test from systemwide pltactual geogrid and balstrata programs were unable to represent systemwide pltactual for similar reasons as in the bwsn network i e higher likelihood of selecting a location with lower fcr since most geogrid cells and the outermost balstrata ring contain system extremities fig s4 of the worst quality location cases the deadends programs were able to produce statistically similar results to pltactual p 0 05 t test notably there was slightly worse performance for the mwsc worst quality programs than the bwsn worst quality programs potentially due to its fewer required samples 5 vs 38 and or differences in network layout and water quality patterns only those programs using far20 and below50 location cases had statistically different results between timing scenarios p 0 05 kruskal wallis daily plt values for each program were compared to daily pltactual values fig s5 unsurprisingly with only one sample taken per day it was not possible to accurately represent daily pltactual values for any program tested p 0 001 t tests for all doubling the number of samples to 10 did not improve estimates fig s6 for the mwsc network the daily timescale proved ineffectual for evaluating system conditions relating to low fcr we can conclude that when few daily samples are taken it may be inappropriate to draw systemwide conclusions on any given day a similar conclusion was made by taylor et al 2018 who determined that most water suppliers in their collected dataset did not sample frequently enough to ensure microbial water quality met an example regulatory limit 3 2 3 constant sampling location sampling programs each locked and unlocked program for the all location case was statistically different from the corresponding pltactual p 0 001 t tests for the other programs using different location cases the locked method constant location program results did not improve table s8 likely due to the limited number of samples only the below50 6am 4pm program yielded a statistically similar result at 95 confidence p 0 254 t test for deadends programs the t test could not be applied timing of sample collection affected results for all programs using the same location case p 0 05 kruskal wallis except for the geogrid locked programs these results demonstrate the limitations of using constant location when few samples are taken unless a system has gone through great effort to characterize water quality throughout their system and has a validated water quality model to inform their sampling program it is likely inappropriate to use constant locations and expect accurate information this is supported by a study on the trade offs between continuous and grab samples which showed that using continuous monitoring i e constant location samples instead of grab i e varying location samples caused a significant decrease in sampling program performance speight 2009 even when experts make decisions about location selection their decisions can improve when tools such as hydraulic models are used previous research has found that engineering judgment and intuition alone are often inadequate for sensor placement ostfeld et al 2008 trachtman 2006 it is also worth considering that judgment may be skewed to support convenience 35 5 of surveyed utilities who specified used fixed locations considered convenience as a factor for location selection narasimhan et al 2004 3 3 comparing the bwsn and mwsc networks 3 3 1 comparing tcr minimum required numbers of samples bwsn tcr mwsc tcr using the tcr required number of samples appropriate to each network i e 38 for bwsn bwsn tcr and 5 for mwsc mwsc tcr table 3 the deadends programs were able to accurately represent worst quality plt values for both network layouts p 0 05 t test while the geogrid and balstrata programs failed to accurately represent plt values for both networks p 0 001 for all programs t test it is likely that poor results for balstrata programs are due to not weighting each stratum when calculating plt the mwsc network had more sampling programs that resulted in statistically significant differences p 0 05 t test than the bwsn network for both networks the locked method yielded sampling program results that were statistically different p 0 05 t test from pltactual for all programs except the below50 6am 4pm program this is potentially worrisome as many utilities carry out their sampling programs in such a fashion narasimhan et al 2004 3 3 2 comparing networks accounting for sampling error bwsn tcr mwsc comp when comparing the bwsn network with the tcr required number of samples mwsc tcr and the mwsc network with varying numbers of samples to give a comparable sampling error to the bwsn network mwsc comp table 3 again deadends programs were most able to accurately represent worst quality plt values for both network layouts only 1 of 6 programs with p 0 05 t test the geogrid programs failed to approximate pltactual for both networks p 0 001 for all 6 programs t test the mwsc comp had more sampling programs that resulted in significant difference p 0 05 t test from pltactual than the bwsn network the statistical difference from pltactual values in the mwsc comp programs predominantly occurred when restricted timing scenarios were used therefore we may conclude that the timing of sample collection is more important for the mwsc network likely attributed to network layout and hydraulic conditions one aspect of these hydraulic conditions is system demand patterns the water demand multipliers for each network are different bwsn uses a 96 h pattern with sharper peaks mwsc uses a 24 h pattern with lower relative peaks which implies differing hydraulic conditions fig s2 in addition to differing demand conditions another indicator that the system operations and hydraulic conditions of the networks impact water quality results can be seen by evaluating the epanet average reaction rates for each system where the percentage of water quality reactions attributed to tanks are 1 15 for the bwsn network and a much higher 24 42 for the mwsc network the system demands and operation of tanks and pumping stations undoubtedly affects water quality conditions since flow rates affect water age which in turn affects fcr conditions which means that utilities considering applying the location selection methods used in this study should also consider how their system s hydraulics can impact the results they may get if a restricted timing scheme is used 3 4 limitations and future work this study applies sampling program designs to simulated water quality models for two distribution systems simulated data do not necessarily accurately represent real water quality conditions as chlorine decay can be affected by different demand within a system decay due to pipe materials and age temperature etc al jasser 2007 fisher et al 2012 hallam et al 2002 mercer 2011 simulated data did however allow us to evaluate 198 different sampling program designs between the two networks and various conditions applied which can help inform future work including field sampling it would be useful to link the water quality simulation tools used here with field sampling data to represent real world water quality conditions in distribution systems although results would still only reflect that distribution system direct cooperation with a utility in future studies would allow for an evaluation of how well a real world sampling program used by a water utility compares to the other methods location selection studied here second since only two systems were evaluated these results reflect only these hydraulic and water quality conditions every full scale distribution system will have different hydraulic and water quality conditions however the current study was designed to compare results from these two and establish a method of assessing sampling program efficacy also the simulations carried out do not account for seasonality in water demand patterns and temperature dependent reaction kinetics evaluating these would be useful future work the current study effectively focused on one source systems in terms of entry of disinfectant into the distribution system most of the location cases tested in this study could be applied to systems with multiple sources of disinfectant e g chlorine booster stations the one exception to this would be the far20 case which would require further consideration into what the furthest 20 of locations from the sources encompasses e g for a two source system far20 could be defined as the 20 of locations furthest from either of the two sources the statistical evaluations carried out also still apply however it is likely that in a system with multiple sources of disinfectant that pltactual values may be lower compared to a one source system depending on the system configuration another consideration that would lead to systems with different disinfectant conditions could be a system with a source that has fcr and a source where chlorine is not dosed although not as frequently encountered systems that use different types of disinfectants within a single system such as free chlorine at one source and chloramines at another would also lead to different observations in sampling program results particularly at locations where waters with the different disinfectant residual types mix with each other we evaluated the number of samples that a water supplier may collect in a week based on current regulatory minimums this number may be too low to determine proper estimates of distributions speight et al 2004 taylor et al 2018 however our study focused on reflecting the reality of the current regulations and limitations on resources such as lack of access to hydraulic models hart and murray 2010 the main metric we use in this study plt is just one of several possible methods of quantifying the extent of low disinfectant residuals in a distribution system and reflects only one possible monitoring program objective other metrics such as the percent of samples with no detected residual or values based on a percentile or confidence of failure could be of more interest ellis 1989 iso 2008 our use of plt is related to the swtr requirement to take residual samples at the same time and place as total coliform samples and assumptions about what points in time that suppliers assess their data also we assumed that sample collection was distributed evenly throughout the month although this may not be the case finally we evaluated a limited selection of location scenarios future work could evaluate scenarios such as pressure zones or critical customers we only considered fcr in this study some water suppliers may need to monitor other disinfectants like chloramines or may not maintain a disinfectant residual however disinfectant residual and particularly fcr is still widely used in the us and the methods developed could be applied to other parameters representing microbiological water quality in the future including cell counts from flow cytometry counts or atp prest et al 2016 notably appropriate locations for sampling programs would vary depending on the water quality parameter of interest for example there are differing requirements for sample locations for the usepa lead and copper rule versus the tcr high risk of contamination versus representative of water quality throughout the distribution system appropriate locations vary depending on the water quality parameter of interest also leads to the possibility of employing other sampling methods such as continuous monitoring or composite sampling however composite sampling could not be applied to fcr since it decays over time ellis 1989 4 conclusions this study investigates how fcr monitoring results vary using different sampling program designs for two distribution systems overall there is no one size fits all approach that can be applied to distribution system water quality sampling programs development but the following points should be considered when designing routine monitoring programs sample locations the objective of a sampling program should impact the selected sample locations here our main objective was determining the extent of low fcr in a system for representing the whole system geographically distributed and balanced allocation stratification selection methods led to results that did not accurately represent network fcr conditions while these programs give some geographical representation of the system they may not give an accurate representation of systemwide water quality results showed that achieving accurate estimates of worst quality conditions in a network was more likely than achieving accurate estimates of systemwide conditions timing for sample collection the results demonstrated that the timing of sample collection is likely important while timing may not matter for some networks it can depend on consumer demand patterns operational changes such as alterations to disinfectant dosing also impact the importance of timing operators should be aware of how these factors may impact sampling program results the evaluation period e g weekly vs daily should also be considered particularly when faced with operational changes or changing demand patterns number of samples the number of samples taken for a sampling program can have stronger impacts on decisions made from sampling program results in some systems e g mwsc but not for others e g bwsn it is inappropriate to make conclusions about systemwide conditions when very few samples are taken over an evaluation period e g daily this suggests that the tcr required numbers of samples for total coliform may not be appropriate to use when evaluating other water quality parameters such as fcr constant sampling locations using constant fixed sampling location selection can make it difficult to accurately represent water quality conditions across the entire network many public water suppliers use constant sampling location selection for their sampling programs which makes it important for operators to give more consideration to the implications of how sampling program results are analyzed if results are evaluated in aggregate on weekly or daily timescales as opposed to individually there can be implications

17597,drinking water suppliers around the world are required by regulations to sample and test water quality in their distribution systems with the intention of generating information that can be used to protect human health requirements for where samples must be collected can vary and guidance on how to select locations to meet these requirements is limited there is a need to better define and evaluate the meaning of representative in the context of selecting locations for collecting grab samples while considering the regulatory context and resources available to suppliers we develop sampling programs for monitoring disinfectant residual concentrations and compare the results and efficacy of these programs using synthetic water quality data for two example distribution systems results showed that achieving accurate estimates of worst quality conditions in a network was more likely than achieving accurate estimates of systemwide conditions and that using constant locations makes it difficult to accurately represent systemwide conditions results also showed that timing of sample collection is likely important depending on factors such as consumer demand patterns and that it is inappropriate to make conclusions about systemwide conditions when few samples are taken over an evaluation period this research has implications for developing recommendations that water suppliers and regulators can use to design and evaluate effective sampling programs graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords sampling programs water quality monitoring water quality regulations drinking water 1 introduction water suppliers are required to monitor water quality in their distribution systems to do so suppliers must develop a water quality monitoring program wqmp the purpose of which is to provide information about whether the water that suppliers are providing is safe for consumption and alert them of potential risks to human health rahman et al 2011 world health organization 2011 key aspects of an effective wqmp include clearly establishing the objectives of the monitoring program and then setting the locations of sample collection timing of sample collection and numbers of samples collected to meet those objectives ellis 1989 khalil and ouarda 2009 sanders 1983 water suppliers use the data collected from wqmps to demonstrate compliance with regulations and to make decisions on system operations whether these objectives can be met depend on the design and constraints of the plan in the words of ellis 1989 today s program design becomes tomorrow s program interpretation however while there are often stated objectives of many regulatory monitoring activities guidance on designing plans and in particular the locations for collecting grab samples that can meet those objectives is more limited narasimhan et al 2004 us epa 2007 requirements for selecting locations for sample collection vary throughout the world drinking water quality regulations like the united states environmental protection agency s usepa revised total coliform rule tcr often specify that sampling locations should be chosen to be representative of water quality throughout a distribution system us epa 2015 but guidance specifying what makes a sampling location representative is limited in what appears to be a fundamentally different approach the world health organization recommends that sampling location selection consider places with increased likelihood of contamination world health organization 2011 according to the european drinking water directive samples should be equally distributed in both time and location european union 1998 considering the variation in guidance on sampling location selection there is a need to better define and test what representative means in the context of sampling program location selection as it pertains to guidance for grab samples collected and tested for compliance purposes drinking water contains physical biological and chemical constituents that can be important to monitor to evaluate potential risks to human health immediate risks to human health may be posed by pathogens commonly evaluated by detection of indicator organisms like e coli while these indicators are often not correlated with human health in drinking water they and measures such as heterotrophic plate counts can be used to indicate whether a treatment process or distribution system may be compromised edberg et al 2000 francisque et al 2009 pepper et al 2015 however monitoring of bacteriological indicators in drinking water presents challenges because of low coliform occurrence in well functioning distribution systems besner et al 2002 free chlorine concentration i e free chlorine residual fcr can be used as a proxy of bacteriological quality in cases where it is added as a secondary disinfectant national research council 1980 additionally the us surface water treatment rule swtr requires residual disinfectant concentration to be measured at the same time as total coliform samples and states that residual disinfectant concentration should not be undetectable in more than 5 of samples in a month national primary drinking water regulations 2006 this makes fcr an important water quality parameter to monitor previous studies evaluating whether sampling strategies could detect or represent bacteriological or disinfectant residual in a distribution system have focused on how to select locations water quality modeling methods and event detection a randomized stratified sampling method employed by speight et al 2004 identified distance from a treatment plant with proportionate location allocation as the most effective method of representing fcr throughout the system further work employing similar methods demonstrated that fixed location continuous monitors may not be effective for monitoring systemwide disinfectant residual conditions speight 2009 grayman et al 2008 proposed using a monte carlo simulation approach to generate synthetic water quality futures under which sampling programs could be evaluated other studies have explored whether sampling strategies including locations timing and numbers for grab samples or continuous monitoring with sensors could be designed to detect contamination events for example a case study using simulated contamination events found that standard monitoring programs through grab sampling have a low probability of detecting even severe fecal contamination by e coli in drinking water mains e g 5 chance of detection for a 16 h intrusion of raw sewage into a distribution main van lieverloo et al 2007 similarly an evaluation of alternative sampling options i e three times per month daily and continuous for total coliforms found that the possibility of event detection varied based on event characteristics e g duration and magnitude and monitoring option used the tcr based sampling program could not detect any tested events grayman et al 2007 other work has focused on placement of continuous sensors for detecting contamination and fcr helbling and vanbriesen 2008 ostfeld et al 2008 however we identified three gaps in the literature on selecting sampling locations in distribution systems first previous studies have developed strategies that rely on calibrated hydraulic models and copious system information however many systems lack such tools and information hart and murray 2010 second many of these studies have selected from ideal or optimized locations ostfeld et al 2008 location selection methods speight 2009 speight et al 2004 and timings grayman et al 2007 ostfeld et al 2008 however these may not be feasible in practice in reality many utilities have sampling programs where they only sample at certain times of day and from some locations narasimhan et al 2004 speight et al 2004 third there has been limited research conducted on the impacts of routine regulatory monitoring methods on sampling program outcomes and implications the objective of this research is to quantitatively assess how differences in sampling program designs based on the likely practices of real world utilities affect the information they offer to water utilities and regulators 2 methods we designed sampling programs that consist of four main parts the locations where samples are taken location selection method timing of sample collection and number of samples taken in a given week fig 1 to evaluate the sampling programs we used epanet 2 0 an open source hydraulic and water quality modeling software rossman 2000 using water quality models for two piped water distribution networks bwsn battle of the water sensor networks and mwsc midwestern small city this study focuses on systems that effectively have one disinfectant dosing location as approximately 69 of united states utilities surveyed indicated not using disinfectant booster stations in their systems awwa disinfection committee 2018 we evaluated efficacy of the sampling programs by their ability to accurately reflect modeled system water quality conditions on weekly and daily timescales we also investigated the effects of operational changes and fixed constant sampling location selection on sampling program results finally we compared results for the two modeled networks 2 1 sampling program design the definition of sampling programs that are representative of a network is often left up to interpretation due to ambiguity in guidelines and requirements us epa 2007 we define location cases as either representative of 1 the whole system or 2 worst quality table 1 based on suggestions for possible ways to account for temporal and spatial variability in water quality ellis 1989 these potential location cases are not exhaustive but they demonstrate a range of definitions of representative the location cases used here are generally designed to reflect sample location selection methods of utilities who have not or do not have the ability to use computer based optimization techniques or rely on use of a hydraulic model to aid in sample location selection locations for sampling is a key aspect of sampling programs each network to be tested was converted into arcgis format esri 2016 pipe lengths were verified in arcgis i e arcgis vector length had to match epanet pipe length parameter input before carrying out node selection all fig 2 a all nodes meaning all potential points for water quality sample collection e g consumer taps hydrants or storage tanks typified by a junction or tank object in epanet in the network are possible sampling locations this location case represents a simple random selection of locations a method used to remove bias from selection procedure and generate a representative sample gravetter and forzano 2012 geogrid geographically distributed locations fig 2b a grid of 10 000 ft by 10 000 ft cells was laid over the network using arcgis one node was randomly selected from a grid cell up to the number of grid cells corresponding to the number of samples to be collected e g if 38 samples are required 38 grid cells are randomly selected with one node randomly selected from within each cell this location case represents a scenario where a utility lacks a hydraulic model and has limited information about water quality but wants to attempt coverage of different areas in their distribution system balstrata balanced allocation stratification fig 2c concentric rings spaced one mile apart from each other a distance based stratum were centered around the distribution system s sources of water using arcgis and an approximately equal number of sampling locations was chosen from within each ring which represents a stratum this location case represents a scenario where a utility wants to determine water quality characteristics in different areas of their system far20 furthest 20 of points from the source fig 2d the shortest length from the system s disinfectant sources to each node in the network was determined using arcgis the 20 furthest sampling nodes were then set as potential sampling nodes this location case represents a scenario where a utility expects to find the worst quality water at the points of their system furthest from its treatment facility due to increased water age li et al 2019 mercer 2011 below50 locations below target for at least 50 of simulation fig 2e potential sampling nodes were determined using water quality model results to identify nodes with 0 2 mg l fcr for at least 50 of all time steps employing this method is only possible for utilities with an available water quality model or detailed data from an extensive grab sampling campaign designed to identify such areas this location case represents a scenario where a utility prioritizes sampling at locations for which consistent poor water quality is expected deadends extremities dead ends fig 2f potential sampling nodes were determined by identifying the locations of pipes with an isolated endpoint using arcgis this allowed for identification of network dead ends which are typical points of stagnation and therefore poor water quality barbeau et al 2005 galvin 2011 location selection methods the evaluated sampling programs selected varying locations meaning that sampling locations were chosen from a pool of potential locations each time that program was used we also evaluated selecting constant locations meaning that sampling locations were chosen from a more restricted pool of sampling locations timing of sample collection three timing scenarios were used 24 h any hour of the day 7am 12pm and 6am 4pm the two restricted timing scenarios were based on sample collection times that coincide with working hours of water system operators sampling programs were evaluated on two time scales weekly i e the entire simulation and daily i e each day of the simulation these were used because they are horizons over which a distribution system operator may be interested in reviewing water quality sampling results and altering operational decisions number of samples collected sample frequency the usepa s tcr requires public water suppliers to take a minimum number of total coliform samples each month as determined by the population served by the system us epa 2015 we used the table from the tcr to determine this minimum number of monthly samples based on the population served for each we then divided by 4 weeks to determine the number of samples that would need to be taken in a typical week for compliance purposes i e 150 samples month 4 equates to 38 weekly samples for a network serving a population 250 000 and 20 samples month 4 equates to 5 weekly samples for a network serving a population of 20 000 we also evaluated alternate sampling frequencies e g increasing the number of samples beyond the minimum requirement 1 5x for bwsn and 2x for mwsc daily sampling frequencies were calculated by having an approximately equal number of samples per day based on the weekly sampling frequency 2 2 distribution systems and hydraulic models two epanet water quality models were used to model fcr i e disinfectant residual concentration and we evaluated the sampling programs using the water quality output of each epanet model application of sampling program designs to water quality model outputs and statistical analysis of sampling program results were carried out in r r core team 2017 simulations were used to generate 1000 possible outcomes for each sampling program with parallel processing using the snow package with a set seed of 23 results were evaluated on weekly and daily timescales 2 2 1 system 1 bwsn the first epanet model was based on network 2 from the battle of the water sensor networks bwsn ostfeld et al 2008 with some adjustments to enable the spatially based network location selections in this study briefly corrections were made to pipe length using arcgis to match the physically mapped network the total head of reservoirs in the system was adjusted to allow the hydraulic model to execute given the pipe length changes a water source a well was removed and demands were assigned to nodes to reflect potential points for sample extraction the bwsn network has 12 525 nodes potential sampling locations representing a network serving approximately 250 000 people fig 3 there are two reservoirs two tanks and four pumping stations that serve the system the tanks use a completely mixed modeling technique meaning that the model assumes instantaneous and complete mixing in the tanks there are simple control statements that affect the operation of the pumps and valves surrounding each of the tanks we set the average fcr leaving each of the two reservoirs as 1 mg l fcr to approximate a single source of disinfectant to the entire system with a first order bulk water decay coefficient of 0 384 day and a first order wall decay coefficient correlation of 24 4 the simulation has 168 1 hour reporting time steps 1 week hydraulic time steps were 1 hour and water quality time steps were 6 min two sampling frequencies were evaluated 38 samples the estimated minimum number of tcr required samples per week and 56 samples scaling up the number of required samples per week by a factor of 1 5 2 2 2 system 2 mwsc the same processes were applied to a hydraulic model of a different distribution system for a small city in the midwestern us designed to serve approximately 20 000 customers mwsc fig 3 wong et al 2017 there are four tanks completely mixed model four pumping stations and one reservoir source in the system for more information on this system see wong et al 2017 the same chlorine decay parameters and chlorine dosing pattern were used for this water quality model average fcr leaving the source was set to 1 mg l with a first order bulk water decay coefficient of 0 384 day and a first order wall decay coefficient correlation of 24 4 the simulation has 168 1 hour reporting time steps 1 week hydraulic and water quality time steps were both 5 min two sampling frequencies were evaluated 5 samples the estimated minimum number of tcr required samples per week and 10 samples doubling the number of required samples per week 2 3 system evaluations 2 3 1 measures of efficacy as previously stated the swtr requires residual disinfectant concentration to be measured at the same time as total coliform samples and that no more than 5 of samples in a month can have undetectable residual concentration national primary drinking water regulations 2006 for these analyses we use fcr as the water quality parameter of interest as a proxy for microbial water quality a target concentration of 0 2 mg l fcr was used because this is a common recommendation for the minimum disinfectant residual at the point of water delivery lantagne 2008 we define the metric to describe the extent of low fcr throughout the distribution system as the percentage of samples less than target plt concentration for each location case the pltactual is the true percentage of sample locations with fcr less than the target concentration across all nodes to be considered for a given location case across all timesteps i e 168 weekly 24 daily in the evaluation period based on water quality simulation results eq 1 the pltactual value changes depending on the location case tested sample plt values were calculated for each sampling program developed using simulations described above 1 p l t a c t u a l n o d e s w i

where distributions of sampling program results were compared to avoid violating the statistical assumptions required for parametric tests parametric tests the t test were used where sampling program results were compared to point values i e pltactual non parametric statistics were applied in cases where distributions of sampling program results were being compared to avoid violating the statistical assumptions required for parametric tests the wilcoxon rank sum test was used to test for statistical difference between distributions of sampling program results using different numbers of samples the kruskal wallis test was used to test for statistical differences in the sampling program results between timing scenarios for both the weekly and daily time scales parametric tests were used where sampling program results were being compared to point values i e pltactual the t test was used to determine if sample plt results of simulations were statistically different from pltactual values for each sampling program for both the weekly and daily time scales 2 3 2 operational changes chlorine dosing outage the sensitivity of the model to changes in chlorine dosing was evaluated for the bwsn system only we simulated a hypothetical extreme malfunction in chlorine dosing equipment at a treatment plant by setting the chlorine dose at both reservoirs to 0 mg l for four hours starting at 12pm on the third day of the simulation fig 4 2 3 3 constant sampling locations state primacy agencies can require that utilities have fixed constant sampling locations for compliance purposes the tcr requires that if a sample measures positive for tc the supplier must take repeat samples at the original location and nearby upstream and downstream locations this necessitates that suppliers have a regular ability to access these sites us epa 2007 a 1985 survey found that 82 1 of 1796 surveyed water utilities used at least some fixed locations for their bacterial sampling programs narasimhan et al 2004 this practice may have increased since these data were collected as the tcr has shifted water suppliers towards having less varying sampling locations water suppliers may also use constant locations to generate time series for water quality parameters we investigated the effects of restricted sample location selection constant locations versus varying locations on the ability of sampling programs to represent true system conditions we achieved this for the location cases in table 1 for the bwsn network by testing 1 38 possible sampling locations with a locked method e g sample at site a on monday every week 2 38 possible sampling locations with an unlocked method e g sample at site a at least once a week 3 76 possible sampling locations as double double the required number of weekly samples and 4 114 possible sampling locations as triple using the mwsc network the locked locations was tested for each location case in table 1 and the unlocked locations was tested on the all location case fewer analyses were carried out for the mwsc network because few samples were taken n 5 statistical differences between sample plt results and pltactual values for each sampling program at weekly time scales were evaluated with t tests differences between constant location and varying location sampling program results were evaluated with wilcoxon rank sum tests and the effects of timing scenarios for constant location sampling programs were investigated with kruskal wallis tests 2 4 comparing the bwsn and mwsc networks to summarize the differences in results for the varying location sampling programs we compared statistical difference from pltactual values at 95 confidence for 1 bwsn tcr the bwsn network with the tcr number of required samples n 38 2 mwsc tcr the mwsc network with the tcr number of required samples n 5 and 3 mwsc comp the mwsc network with varying numbers of samples to account for expected differences in sampling error between the networks to minimize the effects of different sample numbers and margins of error between the networks the number of samples required for the bwsn and mwsc networks to have approximately equal margins of error were calculated the base condition was 38 samples for the bwsn network the corresponding number of samples for the mwsc network nmwsc was calculated eq 2 table 2 z is the z score for the desired confidence level p is the pltactual value for the location case being considered and nbwsn is the tcr required number of samples for the bwsn network i e 38 the pltactual value for each location case was used because it represents the best possible estimate of the true proportion of samples less than the target concentration for sampling programs using that location case if the calculated nmwsc value exceeded 5 of the population of possible sampling locations then the finite population correction fpc was applied eq 2 multiplied by eq 3 2 z p b w s n 1 p b w s n n b w s n z p m w s c 1 p m w s c n m w s c 3 f p c n n m w s c n 1 n 960 3 results and discussion 3 1 bwsn network 3 1 1 effects of the number of samples on sampling program results the results produced by the varying location sampling programs applied to the bwsn model with 38 samples and 56 samples were not statistically different at the 95 confidence level p 0 05 wilcoxon rank sum except for below50 programs table s1 for below50 programs the wilcoxon rank sum test may have performed improperly due to right truncated distributions and tied ranks a 2 sample rank sum permutation test was performed to address the right truncated distributions and showed no statistical differences for any sampling program tested table s2 we can then conclude that the number of samples taken did not affect conclusions about distributions of sampling program results for most location cases when a relatively low number of samples were taken from the population of possible sampling locations we focus the remainder of the analysis using 38 samples only which corresponds to the tcr recommended number as a caveat this conclusion may not hold if higher numbers of samples were to be collected e g 500 from a statistical perspective smaller sample sizes always result in higher margins of error 3 1 2 weekly and daily timescale evaluations distributions of weekly plt results were compared to pltactual values for each varying location sampling program fig 5 out of the whole system location cases the all location case programs performed best with only the 24 h program yielding statistically different results compared to systemwide pltactual p 0 036 t test it is expected that the all location case i e simple random sampling would perform the best gravetter and forzano 2012 for geogrid and balstrata programs we see poorer performance in representing systemwide pltactual fig 5 potentially because it becomes more likely to select a sampling location with typically lower fcr since some grid cells or strata contain more system extremities or dead ends which typically have lower fcr we can draw this conclusion based on the similarity of the distributions for results of these programs geogrid and balstrata compared to worst quality programs far20 and deadends fig s1 among the worst quality programs far20 and deadends performed the best with no sampling programs producing statistically different results from the corresponding worst quality pltactuals p 0 05 t test overall the worst quality programs provided better representations of true worst quality plt conditions in the network likely due to a lower average standard deviation in fcr values at potential sampling locations for those location cases using different timing scenarios had little impact on observed statistical differences between sampling program results with no observed statistical differences between timing scenarios for most programs p 0 05 kruskal wallis except for balstrata and below50 fig 5 for the bwsn network the timing for sample collection appeared to have little impact on whether the results of the sampling program represented true plt in the network likely related to its large spatial size which muted effects of timing despite variations in demand fig s2a daily plt values for each program were compared to daily pltactual values fig 6 like the weekly timescale results the majority of daily plt estimates were able to accurately represent daily systemwide pltactual values except in geogrid and balstrata programs expected given the observed results on the weekly timescale the timing scenarios led to statistically different program results p 0 05 kruskal wallis for a given day and location case for 5 of the 42 daily results table s3 this reinforces the conclusion from the weekly timescale evaluation for this network that the timing of sample collection does not significantly impact whether the sampling program results will represent true plt conditions in this network again likely related to network size 3 1 3 operational changes chlorine dosing outage when modeling an interruption to chlorination the geogrid balstrata and below50 program results were statistically different from pltactual on the weekly timescale p 0 001 t test fig s3 the 6am 4pm timing scenario led to the most program results that were not statistically different p 0 05 t test out of the three timing scenarios generally more programs were statistically different p 0 05 t test when chlorination was interrupted as compared to the base bwsn water quality model it is expected that an accurate estimate of conditions in the network would be difficult to attain due to the increased variation in fcr concentrations throughout the network over the simulated week for all groups of location cases evaluated with the chlorination interruption the timing scenarios led to statistically different program results p 0 05 kruskal wallis except for deadends programs daily results showed statistical differences between timing scenarios for all geogrid balstrata and far20 programs on day 3 p 0 05 kruskal wallis table s4 daily plt values for each program were compared to daily pltactual values with results showing that all geogrid and balstrata program results as well as the majority of below50 program results were statistically different from daily systemwide pltactual values p 0 001 and p 0 05 respectively t test fig 7 every location case tested had at least one program with a timing scenario that led to statistically different results from daily pltactual p 0 05 t test on the day the outage was modeled day 3 which demonstrates that being able to accurately capture plt conditions in the network can be difficult when a significant operational change takes place 3 1 4 constant sampling location sampling programs tests for statistical difference from pltactual values showed that most constant location programs had statistically different results p 0 05 t test only 3 out of 72 6 location cases x 3 timing scenarios x 4 constant location methods programs yielded results that were not statistically different from pltactual values at 95 confidence all of which used the triple pool constant location method far20 7am 12pm and 24 h all 7am 12pm these results demonstrate that choosing fixed sampling locations will largely prevent attaining results that represent true plt conditions in the network notably constant sampling locations are used by many water suppliers however these findings demonstrate that suppliers looking to quantify the extent of low fcr in their system may obtain inaccurate estimates with constant locations additional tests showed that most 63 72 constant location sampling programs were statistically different p 0 05 wilcoxon rank sum from corresponding varying location sampling programs table s5 results of tests for differences between timing scenarios were largely dissimilar varying location results mostly showed no significant difference between timing scenarios while most constant location programs did 20 24 with p 0 05 kruskal wallis table s6 all locked programs yielded statistically different results p 0 05 kruskal wallis between timing scenarios this demonstrates that timing for grab sampling programs using constant locations may be more important than those using varying locations since the window of time during which samples are collected appears to have a more pronounced effect on the results of sampling programs that use constant locations it is possible that the temporal variability of the sampling locations selected as constant locations is high and that would make them better suited as locations for installation of continuous monitoring of low fcr speight 2009 it is important to consider this possibility as more utilities incorporate online monitors 45 of utilities surveyed in the united states 2017 reported using online monitors at some place in their distribution system awwa disinfection committee 2018 3 2 mwsc network 3 2 1 effects of the number of samples on sampling program results the varying location programs with 5 samples and 10 samples were not statistically different at a 95 confidence level p 0 05 wilcoxon rank sum except for below50 programs and the dead ends 24 h program table s7 this result is similar to that of the bwsn network and again allows us to conclude that the number of samples taken did not affect our conclusions for most location cases for relatively low numbers of samples table s7 therefore the presented analysis uses 5 samples only 3 2 2 weekly and daily timescale evaluations distributions of plt results on the weekly timescale were compared to pltactual values for each varying location sampling program fig 8 out of the representative of whole system location cases the all location case programs performed the best with only the 7am 12pm program results statistically different p 0 044 t test from systemwide pltactual geogrid and balstrata programs were unable to represent systemwide pltactual for similar reasons as in the bwsn network i e higher likelihood of selecting a location with lower fcr since most geogrid cells and the outermost balstrata ring contain system extremities fig s4 of the worst quality location cases the deadends programs were able to produce statistically similar results to pltactual p 0 05 t test notably there was slightly worse performance for the mwsc worst quality programs than the bwsn worst quality programs potentially due to its fewer required samples 5 vs 38 and or differences in network layout and water quality patterns only those programs using far20 and below50 location cases had statistically different results between timing scenarios p 0 05 kruskal wallis daily plt values for each program were compared to daily pltactual values fig s5 unsurprisingly with only one sample taken per day it was not possible to accurately represent daily pltactual values for any program tested p 0 001 t tests for all doubling the number of samples to 10 did not improve estimates fig s6 for the mwsc network the daily timescale proved ineffectual for evaluating system conditions relating to low fcr we can conclude that when few daily samples are taken it may be inappropriate to draw systemwide conclusions on any given day a similar conclusion was made by taylor et al 2018 who determined that most water suppliers in their collected dataset did not sample frequently enough to ensure microbial water quality met an example regulatory limit 3 2 3 constant sampling location sampling programs each locked and unlocked program for the all location case was statistically different from the corresponding pltactual p 0 001 t tests for the other programs using different location cases the locked method constant location program results did not improve table s8 likely due to the limited number of samples only the below50 6am 4pm program yielded a statistically similar result at 95 confidence p 0 254 t test for deadends programs the t test could not be applied timing of sample collection affected results for all programs using the same location case p 0 05 kruskal wallis except for the geogrid locked programs these results demonstrate the limitations of using constant location when few samples are taken unless a system has gone through great effort to characterize water quality throughout their system and has a validated water quality model to inform their sampling program it is likely inappropriate to use constant locations and expect accurate information this is supported by a study on the trade offs between continuous and grab samples which showed that using continuous monitoring i e constant location samples instead of grab i e varying location samples caused a significant decrease in sampling program performance speight 2009 even when experts make decisions about location selection their decisions can improve when tools such as hydraulic models are used previous research has found that engineering judgment and intuition alone are often inadequate for sensor placement ostfeld et al 2008 trachtman 2006 it is also worth considering that judgment may be skewed to support convenience 35 5 of surveyed utilities who specified used fixed locations considered convenience as a factor for location selection narasimhan et al 2004 3 3 comparing the bwsn and mwsc networks 3 3 1 comparing tcr minimum required numbers of samples bwsn tcr mwsc tcr using the tcr required number of samples appropriate to each network i e 38 for bwsn bwsn tcr and 5 for mwsc mwsc tcr table 3 the deadends programs were able to accurately represent worst quality plt values for both network layouts p 0 05 t test while the geogrid and balstrata programs failed to accurately represent plt values for both networks p 0 001 for all programs t test it is likely that poor results for balstrata programs are due to not weighting each stratum when calculating plt the mwsc network had more sampling programs that resulted in statistically significant differences p 0 05 t test than the bwsn network for both networks the locked method yielded sampling program results that were statistically different p 0 05 t test from pltactual for all programs except the below50 6am 4pm program this is potentially worrisome as many utilities carry out their sampling programs in such a fashion narasimhan et al 2004 3 3 2 comparing networks accounting for sampling error bwsn tcr mwsc comp when comparing the bwsn network with the tcr required number of samples mwsc tcr and the mwsc network with varying numbers of samples to give a comparable sampling error to the bwsn network mwsc comp table 3 again deadends programs were most able to accurately represent worst quality plt values for both network layouts only 1 of 6 programs with p 0 05 t test the geogrid programs failed to approximate pltactual for both networks p 0 001 for all 6 programs t test the mwsc comp had more sampling programs that resulted in significant difference p 0 05 t test from pltactual than the bwsn network the statistical difference from pltactual values in the mwsc comp programs predominantly occurred when restricted timing scenarios were used therefore we may conclude that the timing of sample collection is more important for the mwsc network likely attributed to network layout and hydraulic conditions one aspect of these hydraulic conditions is system demand patterns the water demand multipliers for each network are different bwsn uses a 96 h pattern with sharper peaks mwsc uses a 24 h pattern with lower relative peaks which implies differing hydraulic conditions fig s2 in addition to differing demand conditions another indicator that the system operations and hydraulic conditions of the networks impact water quality results can be seen by evaluating the epanet average reaction rates for each system where the percentage of water quality reactions attributed to tanks are 1 15 for the bwsn network and a much higher 24 42 for the mwsc network the system demands and operation of tanks and pumping stations undoubtedly affects water quality conditions since flow rates affect water age which in turn affects fcr conditions which means that utilities considering applying the location selection methods used in this study should also consider how their system s hydraulics can impact the results they may get if a restricted timing scheme is used 3 4 limitations and future work this study applies sampling program designs to simulated water quality models for two distribution systems simulated data do not necessarily accurately represent real water quality conditions as chlorine decay can be affected by different demand within a system decay due to pipe materials and age temperature etc al jasser 2007 fisher et al 2012 hallam et al 2002 mercer 2011 simulated data did however allow us to evaluate 198 different sampling program designs between the two networks and various conditions applied which can help inform future work including field sampling it would be useful to link the water quality simulation tools used here with field sampling data to represent real world water quality conditions in distribution systems although results would still only reflect that distribution system direct cooperation with a utility in future studies would allow for an evaluation of how well a real world sampling program used by a water utility compares to the other methods location selection studied here second since only two systems were evaluated these results reflect only these hydraulic and water quality conditions every full scale distribution system will have different hydraulic and water quality conditions however the current study was designed to compare results from these two and establish a method of assessing sampling program efficacy also the simulations carried out do not account for seasonality in water demand patterns and temperature dependent reaction kinetics evaluating these would be useful future work the current study effectively focused on one source systems in terms of entry of disinfectant into the distribution system most of the location cases tested in this study could be applied to systems with multiple sources of disinfectant e g chlorine booster stations the one exception to this would be the far20 case which would require further consideration into what the furthest 20 of locations from the sources encompasses e g for a two source system far20 could be defined as the 20 of locations furthest from either of the two sources the statistical evaluations carried out also still apply however it is likely that in a system with multiple sources of disinfectant that pltactual values may be lower compared to a one source system depending on the system configuration another consideration that would lead to systems with different disinfectant conditions could be a system with a source that has fcr and a source where chlorine is not dosed although not as frequently encountered systems that use different types of disinfectants within a single system such as free chlorine at one source and chloramines at another would also lead to different observations in sampling program results particularly at locations where waters with the different disinfectant residual types mix with each other we evaluated the number of samples that a water supplier may collect in a week based on current regulatory minimums this number may be too low to determine proper estimates of distributions speight et al 2004 taylor et al 2018 however our study focused on reflecting the reality of the current regulations and limitations on resources such as lack of access to hydraulic models hart and murray 2010 the main metric we use in this study plt is just one of several possible methods of quantifying the extent of low disinfectant residuals in a distribution system and reflects only one possible monitoring program objective other metrics such as the percent of samples with no detected residual or values based on a percentile or confidence of failure could be of more interest ellis 1989 iso 2008 our use of plt is related to the swtr requirement to take residual samples at the same time and place as total coliform samples and assumptions about what points in time that suppliers assess their data also we assumed that sample collection was distributed evenly throughout the month although this may not be the case finally we evaluated a limited selection of location scenarios future work could evaluate scenarios such as pressure zones or critical customers we only considered fcr in this study some water suppliers may need to monitor other disinfectants like chloramines or may not maintain a disinfectant residual however disinfectant residual and particularly fcr is still widely used in the us and the methods developed could be applied to other parameters representing microbiological water quality in the future including cell counts from flow cytometry counts or atp prest et al 2016 notably appropriate locations for sampling programs would vary depending on the water quality parameter of interest for example there are differing requirements for sample locations for the usepa lead and copper rule versus the tcr high risk of contamination versus representative of water quality throughout the distribution system appropriate locations vary depending on the water quality parameter of interest also leads to the possibility of employing other sampling methods such as continuous monitoring or composite sampling however composite sampling could not be applied to fcr since it decays over time ellis 1989 4 conclusions this study investigates how fcr monitoring results vary using different sampling program designs for two distribution systems overall there is no one size fits all approach that can be applied to distribution system water quality sampling programs development but the following points should be considered when designing routine monitoring programs sample locations the objective of a sampling program should impact the selected sample locations here our main objective was determining the extent of low fcr in a system for representing the whole system geographically distributed and balanced allocation stratification selection methods led to results that did not accurately represent network fcr conditions while these programs give some geographical representation of the system they may not give an accurate representation of systemwide water quality results showed that achieving accurate estimates of worst quality conditions in a network was more likely than achieving accurate estimates of systemwide conditions timing for sample collection the results demonstrated that the timing of sample collection is likely important while timing may not matter for some networks it can depend on consumer demand patterns operational changes such as alterations to disinfectant dosing also impact the importance of timing operators should be aware of how these factors may impact sampling program results the evaluation period e g weekly vs daily should also be considered particularly when faced with operational changes or changing demand patterns number of samples the number of samples taken for a sampling program can have stronger impacts on decisions made from sampling program results in some systems e g mwsc but not for others e g bwsn it is inappropriate to make conclusions about systemwide conditions when very few samples are taken over an evaluation period e g daily this suggests that the tcr required numbers of samples for total coliform may not be appropriate to use when evaluating other water quality parameters such as fcr constant sampling locations using constant fixed sampling location selection can make it difficult to accurately represent water quality conditions across the entire network many public water suppliers use constant sampling location selection for their sampling programs which makes it important for operators to give more consideration to the implications of how sampling program results are analyzed if results are evaluated in aggregate on weekly or daily timescales as opposed to individually there can be implications

17598,historical accumulation of phosphorus p in lake sediment often contributes to and sustains eutrophic conditions in lakes even when external sources of p are reduced the most cost effective and commonly used method to restore the balance between p and p binding metals in the sediment is aluminum al treatment the binding efficiency of al however has varied greatly among treatments conducted over the past five decades resulting in substantial differences in the amount of p bound per unit al we analyzed sediment from seven previously al treated swedish lakes to investigate factors controlling binding efficiency in contrast to earlier work lake morphology was negatively correlated to binding efficiency meaning that binding efficiency was higher in lakes with steeply sloping bathymetry than in lakes with more gradually sloping bottoms this was likely due to al generally being added directly into the sediment and not to the water column higher binding efficiencies were detected when al was applied directly into the sediment whereas the lowest binding efficiency was detected where al was instead added to the water column al dose mobile sediment p and lake morphology together explained 87 of the variation in binding efficiency among lakes where al was added directly into the sediment this led to the development of a model able to predict the optimal al dose to maximize binding efficiency based on mobile sediment p mass and lake morphology the predictive model can be used to evaluate cost effectiveness and potential outcomes when planning al treatment using direct sediment application to restore water quality in eutrophic lakes graphical abstract image 1 keywords lake restoration aluminium treatment sediment injection phosphorus internal loading 1 introduction historical accumulation of phosphorus p in lake sediment generally originates from external sources in the surrounding catchment including industrial and municipal wastewater leaching from agricultural soils and runoff from urban areas controlling external p sources has been the primary long term management strategy for overcoming lake eutrophication conley et al 2009 however focusing exclusively on external sources is often insufficient even if external inputs of p are reduced the historical legacy p accumulated in lake sediment can contribute to elevated surface water nutrient concentrations for decades or longer sas 1990 different forms of sediment p have different internal loading potential internal in lake release of legacy p is driven mainly by the mobile sediment p pmob forms including porewater easily exchangeable p and iron manganese bound p paraskova et al 2013 pilgrim et al 2007 organic p can also contribute to the pmob pool after mineralization of organic matter schütz et al 2017 there are numerous methods for managing internal p loading in lakes cooke et al 2005 with the most common and cost effective method being addition of metals salts such as aluminum al to improve sediment p binding capacity huser et al 2016c binding of p by al occurs naturally in soil and sediment and al is commonly used in tertiary wastewater and drinking water treatment to reduce p concentrations and precipitate particulate matter since the 1960s addition of al salts has been used as a restoration tool in hundreds of eutrophic lakes around the world huser et al 2016b treatment longevity however has varied greatly huser et al 2016b analyzed data from 114 al treated lakes and showed that the main factors affecting treatment longevity included al dose lake morphology and the watershed to lake area ratio with al dose explaining the largest amount of variation although not examined due to lack of data huser et al 2016b suggested that analysis of the al dose versus pmob content might have improved the model developed for predicting treatment longevity the efficiency with which al binds p likely contributes to treatment longevity given that one of the main goals of an al treatment there are others mostly precipitation of water column p is to inactivate legacy pmob al binding efficiency has varied by an order of magnitude in previous european and north american lake restoration projects ranging from 2 1 1 to 21 1 al al bound p molar basis huser et al 2011 huser 2012 jensen et al 2015 lewandowski et al 2003 reitzel et al 2005 rydin et al 2000 rydin and welch 1999 schütz et al 2017 greater doses of al have generally resulted in less efficient p binding i e higher ratios of al added to al bound p al pal huser 2012 furthermore the mass of available pmob prior to treatment is highly correlated to binding efficiency with low amounts of pmob relative to al dose resulting in less efficient al binding james 2011 morphology is also important as lakes with steep sediment bed slopes have been shown to have higher al pal ratios less efficient binding whereas gradual bed slope lakes have had lower al pal ratios more efficient binding huser 2012 huser 2012 suggested that this difference was related to natural movement of the mineral aluminum hydroxide al oh 3 floc from erosion zones of lakes to accumulation bottoms and that the difference in transport rate and accumulation of al oh 3 floc in deeper areas depended on lake morphology this process was detected in lake harriet us as well where al added to the littoral erosion zone was translocated to the deeper accumulation areas of the lake within 6 months huser 2017 steepness of the sediment bed slope in lakes can be quantified using the osgood index which is mean depth m divided by the square root of the lake surface area km2 cooke et al 1993 suggested that lakes with gradual sediment bed slope osgood index 6 would have more successful responses to al treatment than lakes with steeper bed slopes osgood index 6 given all other conditions being equal because the newly formed amorphous al minerals start to crystalize following al treatment the potential for p binding decreases with time due to decreased mineral surface area berkowitz et al 2006 thus the longer it takes for al to bind p the lower the binding efficiency de vicente et al 2008b if al is added far in excess of pmob or excess al accumulates in deeper areas of the lake it will take longer to saturate al binding sites resulting in lower binding efficiency other factors may also affect binding efficiency sediment mixing by benthic feeding fish may decrease the time needed for contact between al and p and improve binding efficiency huser et al 2016a however bioturbation by benthic invertebrates can have a limited overall effect on al treatment effectiveness nogaro et al 2016 sorption competition between al and other inorganic compounds that can complex with al e g silicates de vicente et al 2008a fluoride sulfate roberson and hem 1967 can reduce p binding efficiency organic matter in general bloom 1981 de vicente et al 2008a lind and hem 1975 and labile organic matter in particular e g phytoplankton exudates and microbial transformed detritus also compete with p for al binding sites du et al 2019 however most forms of labile organic matter break down quickly and available al mineral binding sites should sorb the p released reitzel et al 2007 this study was performed to improve predictions of p binding efficiency in al treated eutrophic lakes twenty two sediment cores were collected from sediment transport and accumulation zones in seven al treated swedish lakes five of the seven lakes were treated with methods where al was directly added into lake sediment instead of added to the water where amorphous al oh 3 floc then precipitates and settles on to the sediment surface theoretically direct sediment al application should improve sediment binding efficiency as it distributes the newly formed al mineral where pmob is within the sediment profile lake morphology and sediment and water chemistry were analyzed to identify factors related to binding efficiency al pal ratios and a predictive model was developed that can be used to maximize p binding efficiency 2 materials and methods 2 1 study sites all study lakes are situated in southeastern sweden within 30 km of stockholm city fig 1 lake size and mean depth varied ranging from 6 to 272 ha and 2 8 7 m respectively table 1 all lakes were eutrophic and ph ranged from 8 0 to 8

differed between lakes as well table 3 pac pre hydrolyzed alcl3 was applied in liquid l form whereas alum was applied in solid s form in lötsjön alum was added directly to the water where it sank into the sediment whereas it was spread on the ice and allowed to dissolve during thaw in långsjön b cores were collected from multiple depths transport and accumulation bottoms in all lakes accumulation bottoms were defined as the deepest part of the lake where surrounding sediment transport was directed transport bottoms represent the remaining parts of the lake table 2 2 2 sediment sampling a willner gravity corer was used to collect intact sediment cores generally the uppermost 30 cm from the lakes after collection each core was sliced in the field at 1 cm intervals at sediment depths from 1 to 10 cm and 2 cm intervals thereafter all samples were stored no longer than 4 weeks in sealed containers in the dark at 4 c before analysis in order to include spatial variability within each lake and cover areas where different al doses were applied samples were collected at different locations and different water column depths table 2 representing both transport and accumulation bottoms håkanson and jansson 1983 2 3 laboratory analysis sequential extraction was used to characterize p fractions using a method originally developed by psenner et al 1988 and modified by hupfer et al 1995 the quantified fractions were porewater easily exchangeable iron fe manganese mn bound al bound organic and calcium ca bound p analysis of soluble reactive p srp in the extracts was performed using the molybdate blue method murphy and riley 1962 sediment al was extracted using acid ammonium oxalate according to the protocol of jan et al 2013 and references therein al concentrations were determined with inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectrometry icp aes at a wavelength of 396 15 nm sediment density was estimated following loss on ignition at 550 c for 2 h and water content was determined after 24 h storage at 20 c followed by freeze drying håkanson and jansson 1983 2 4 calculations and statistical analysis background concentrations of al and pal calculated using sediment layers unaffected by al treatment were subtracted from al and pal concentrations in the treated layer to determine the total mass of al and pal resulting from treatment the al pal molar ratio was calculated as the sum of excess al i e above background divided by the mass of pal formed in the sediment due to treatment the amount of labile organic p plab org was determined by subtracting background concentrations deeper in the sediment where only recalcitrant forms of organic p are assumed to remain from the total organic p fraction pre treatment pmob defined as the sum of porewater easily exchangeable p and fe bound p was estimated by summing the pal formed from pmob after treatment and the remaining pmob in the sediment profile above and within the treatment layers the lake morphology bed slope parameter was determined according to the osgood index zm a 0 5 where zm is the mean water depth m and a is lake surface area km2 osgood 1988 jmp statistical software sas

further evaluated in the discussion section 3 al dose 1 1 al pal 8 2 pmob 6 6 osgood index 159 4 discussion 4 1 comparison to previous studies ratios of al pal in this study 4 7 17 5 were in the range of what has previously been reported huser et al 2011 huser 2012 2017 jensen et al 2015 lewandowski et al 2003 reitzel et al 2005 rydin et al 2000 rydin and welch 1999 schütz et al 2017 the variation of al pal ratios between lakes in this study was similar to those reported by huser 2012 in six al treated lakes in minneapolis us whereas it was contradictory to the generally consistent ratios mean of 10 7 range from 9 8 to 11 5 reported by rydin et al 2000 in six lakes in washington us 4 2 effect of al applied and pmob content on binding efficiency lewandowski et al 2003 found consistent low al pal ratios of 2 1 and 2 2 in lake sussersee germany where low doses of al were added annually over 16 years huser 2017 also reported a similarly low ratio 2 1 after a low dose treatment 11 g m 2 in lake harriet us low dose treatments can generate higher binding efficiency lower al pal ratio due to the increased chance of al encountering p before crystallization affects binding efficiency de vicente et al 2008b a similar situation is apparent among the study lakes herein lötsjön was treated with multiple low doses multiple applications over 9 years 36 g m 2 in total this resulted in al pal ratios as low as 4 7 which was the lowest ratio i e best binding efficiency detected in this study in addition to the low dose applied lötsjön also had the highest amount of pmob available before treatment 20 6 g m 2 table 3 this would also theoretically increase binding efficiency due to the low amount of al sorbent relative to the amount of pmob sorbate i e le chateliers principle in contrast malmsjön received a relatively higher al dose 60 g m 2 single application with a lower amount of pre treatment sediment pmob mean 3 5 g m 2 table 1 table 3 resulting in one of the highest ratios in the study mean 14 3 bagarsjön also had high al pal ratios and received a similar dose to malmsjön 50 g m 2 single application but pmob availability was greater mean 5 3 g m 2 compared to malmsjön table 2 table 3 this would theoretically result in a higher binding efficiency lower al pal ratio but this was not the case although patterns in binding efficiency to some extent can be explained by the relative amount of al added to available pmob other factors also affect binding efficiency e g lake morphology and al application technique 4 3 effects of lake morphology and treatment method on binding efficiency after al application horizontal movement of the al oh 3 floc towards deeper accumulation zones can occur as a consequence of the relatively low density of the amorphous mineral similar to that of organic rich low density sediment egemose et al 2010 huser 2012 huser 2012 demonstrated this in a study of six minneapolis us lakes receiving water application of liquid alum where steep bed slope lakes had lower binding efficiency compared to gradual bed slope lakes however the results from this study showed the opposite with a negative correlation between al pal and osgood index where steep bed slope lakes osgood index 6 generally had lower al pal i e greater binding efficiency the main difference between the al treatments reported by huser 2012 and those reported here was the al application method i e sediment al injection or solid alum application was used in a majority of the studied lakes these application methods can result in al being distributed in the vertical sediment profile generally the uppermost 10 cm instead of precipitating in the water column water treatment and settling to the sediment surface where time is needed for natural incorporation of the al mineral into surficial sediment fig 5 although not previously studied application of alum sediment pellets likely works in the same manner in lakes with low density surficial sediment as demonstrated in this study for instance lötsjön had low surficial mean 0 10 cm sediment density 1 03 g cm 3 whereas alum pellets have a nearly threefold higher density 2 7 g cm 3 sediment injection and solid alum pellet application can distribute the al oh 3 floc deeper in the sediment compared to water application which would reduce horizontal transport at the sediment surface sediment treatment should increase the chance for al to encounter pmob as al is distributed within the sediment matrix where pmob is available and binding can occur before further crystallization and reduction in mineral surface area occurs additionally the al oh 3 floc can then follow sediment as it is naturally translocated to deeper areas of the lake increasing the chance for al to encounter pmob at new locations of the sediment huser 2017 the transport rate of natural sediment is generally higher in lakes with steep bed slope håkanson and jansson 1983 accelerating the possibility of al encountering pmob in the sediment before crystallization reduces the surface area of the amorphous al mineral and decreases potential binding sites berkowitz et al 2005 de vicente et al 2008b 4 4 other factors affecting binding efficiency of al in lakes although the mlr model explained 87 of the variation in binding efficiency of al in sediment treated lakes other factors may also affect binding between al and p for example du et al 2019 showed that dissolved labile organic matter competition for al binding sites may be a factor controlling al pal however this was not analyzed in our study instead we analyzed labile organic p in sediment expressed as the non recalcitrant fraction of org p which had no significant effect on the model sediment resuspension and mixing caused by benthic feeding fish e g common carp breukelaar et al 1994 driver et al 2005 huser et al 2016a b might also affect binding efficiency via increased chance for contact between al and p huser et al 2016a however nogaro et al 2016 showed that bioturbation caused by benthic invertebrates had limited effect on treatment efficiency 4 5 maximizing binding efficiency implications for treatment effectiveness equation 3 can be used to calculate the required al dose to optimize binding efficiency depending on sediment pmob mass and lake morphology the conceptual graph fig 4 demonstrates how to estimate an al dose with a fixed ratio of al pal at 10 a range of pmob from 0 to 20 g m 2 and an osgood index of 3 6 and 9 for example a gradual bed slope osgood index 3 where sediment translocation is relatively low and a pmob mass of 10 g m 2 cannot attain an al pal ratio of 10 at an al dose higher than 46 g m 2 however in a system where the bed slope is steeper osgood 9 natural sediment movement can increase the chance of al encountering pmob during natural translocation of sediment which allows for a dose of up to 81 g m 2 while still being able to attain an al pal ratio of 10 by considering the findings in this study when planning al treatment it is possible to increase cost efficiency and treatment effectiveness by optimizing al dose according to the model eq 3 it should be noted that these relationships only apply to lakes where al is either injected into the sediment or when pellets are used that can sink through low density surficial sediment often found in eutrophic lakes 4 6 other considerations the study results were strongly influenced by the type of al addition method used this is the main reason why our results generally contradict those in previous studies where water column al applications were used i e huser 2012 the opposing results are due to differences in al binding efficiency when different methods are used thus the model presented here eq 3 should only be used to evaluate cases where al is applied directly to the sediment another factor that should be considered is that buffered or pre hydrolized polyaluminum chloride pac was used in all lakes except lötsjön and långsjön 2b table 2 while the dataset reported herein was too small to draw any conclusions between types of al salt used it is possible that pre hydrolized forms of al result in lower binding efficiency as hypothesized by schütz et al 2017 hydrolysis reactions occur when al is applied to water or sediment porewater and several monomeric al species form before the solid phase al oh 3 mineral forms and precipitates buffered pac compounds on the other hand come pre hydrolized with oh and thus the hydrolysis that occurs with al is partially complete direct alpo4 formation which has a theoretical 1 1 binding of al to p is thus limited when using pac forms although this type of binding between al and p is only dominant at high phosphate concentrations jenkins et al 1971 it may occur when sediment porewater phosphate concentrations are much higher relative to those found in the water column in eutrophic lakes enell and lövgren 1988 5 conclusions the results of this study indicate that p binding efficiency following al treatment is regulated by al added relative to the amount of legacy p in sediment i e pmob and lake morphology osgood index the main underlying mechanism is connected to the potential for al binding of pmob in sediment before crystallization of the amorphous al mineral occurs and surface area binding sites decrease elevated al doses relative to sediment pmob will generally reduce binding efficiency whereas sediment injection of al into the sediment or solid alum application can improve binding efficiency especially in lakes with steep sediment bed slopes with sediment treatment al is distributed vertically in the sediment at the moment of treatment this along with natural movement of the sediment increases binding

17598,historical accumulation of phosphorus p in lake sediment often contributes to and sustains eutrophic conditions in lakes even when external sources of p are reduced the most cost effective and commonly used method to restore the balance between p and p binding metals in the sediment is aluminum al treatment the binding efficiency of al however has varied greatly among treatments conducted over the past five decades resulting in substantial differences in the amount of p bound per unit al we analyzed sediment from seven previously al treated swedish lakes to investigate factors controlling binding efficiency in contrast to earlier work lake morphology was negatively correlated to binding efficiency meaning that binding efficiency was higher in lakes with steeply sloping bathymetry than in lakes with more gradually sloping bottoms this was likely due to al generally being added directly into the sediment and not to the water column higher binding efficiencies were detected when al was applied directly into the sediment whereas the lowest binding efficiency was detected where al was instead added to the water column al dose mobile sediment p and lake morphology together explained 87 of the variation in binding efficiency among lakes where al was added directly into the sediment this led to the development of a model able to predict the optimal al dose to maximize binding efficiency based on mobile sediment p mass and lake morphology the predictive model can be used to evaluate cost effectiveness and potential outcomes when planning al treatment using direct sediment application to restore water quality in eutrophic lakes graphical abstract image 1 keywords lake restoration aluminium treatment sediment injection phosphorus internal loading 1 introduction historical accumulation of phosphorus p in lake sediment generally originates from external sources in the surrounding catchment including industrial and municipal wastewater leaching from agricultural soils and runoff from urban areas controlling external p sources has been the primary long term management strategy for overcoming lake eutrophication conley et al 2009 however focusing exclusively on external sources is often insufficient even if external inputs of p are reduced the historical legacy p accumulated in lake sediment can contribute to elevated surface water nutrient concentrations for decades or longer sas 1990 different forms of sediment p have different internal loading potential internal in lake release of legacy p is driven mainly by the mobile sediment p pmob forms including porewater easily exchangeable p and iron manganese bound p paraskova et al 2013 pilgrim et al 2007 organic p can also contribute to the pmob pool after mineralization of organic matter schütz et al 2017 there are numerous methods for managing internal p loading in lakes cooke et al 2005 with the most common and cost effective method being addition of metals salts such as aluminum al to improve sediment p binding capacity huser et al 2016c binding of p by al occurs naturally in soil and sediment and al is commonly used in tertiary wastewater and drinking water treatment to reduce p concentrations and precipitate particulate matter since the 1960s addition of al salts has been used as a restoration tool in hundreds of eutrophic lakes around the world huser et al 2016b treatment longevity however has varied greatly huser et al 2016b analyzed data from 114 al treated lakes and showed that the main factors affecting treatment longevity included al dose lake morphology and the watershed to lake area ratio with al dose explaining the largest amount of variation although not examined due to lack of data huser et al 2016b suggested that analysis of the al dose versus pmob content might have improved the model developed for predicting treatment longevity the efficiency with which al binds p likely contributes to treatment longevity given that one of the main goals of an al treatment there are others mostly precipitation of water column p is to inactivate legacy pmob al binding efficiency has varied by an order of magnitude in previous european and north american lake restoration projects ranging from 2 1 1 to 21 1 al al bound p molar basis huser et al 2011 huser 2012 jensen et al 2015 lewandowski et al 2003 reitzel et al 2005 rydin et al 2000 rydin and welch 1999 schütz et al 2017 greater doses of al have generally resulted in less efficient p binding i e higher ratios of al added to al bound p al pal huser 2012 furthermore the mass of available pmob prior to treatment is highly correlated to binding efficiency with low amounts of pmob relative to al dose resulting in less efficient al binding james 2011 morphology is also important as lakes with steep sediment bed slopes have been shown to have higher al pal ratios less efficient binding whereas gradual bed slope lakes have had lower al pal ratios more efficient binding huser 2012 huser 2012 suggested that this difference was related to natural movement of the mineral aluminum hydroxide al oh 3 floc from erosion zones of lakes to accumulation bottoms and that the difference in transport rate and accumulation of al oh 3 floc in deeper areas depended on lake morphology this process was detected in lake harriet us as well where al added to the littoral erosion zone was translocated to the deeper accumulation areas of the lake within 6 months huser 2017 steepness of the sediment bed slope in lakes can be quantified using the osgood index which is mean depth m divided by the square root of the lake surface area km2 cooke et al 1993 suggested that lakes with gradual sediment bed slope osgood index 6 would have more successful responses to al treatment than lakes with steeper bed slopes osgood index 6 given all other conditions being equal because the newly formed amorphous al minerals start to crystalize following al treatment the potential for p binding decreases with time due to decreased mineral surface area berkowitz et al 2006 thus the longer it takes for al to bind p the lower the binding efficiency de vicente et al 2008b if al is added far in excess of pmob or excess al accumulates in deeper areas of the lake it will take longer to saturate al binding sites resulting in lower binding efficiency other factors may also affect binding efficiency sediment mixing by benthic feeding fish may decrease the time needed for contact between al and p and improve binding efficiency huser et al 2016a however bioturbation by benthic invertebrates can have a limited overall effect on al treatment effectiveness nogaro et al 2016 sorption competition between al and other inorganic compounds that can complex with al e g silicates de vicente et al 2008a fluoride sulfate roberson and hem 1967 can reduce p binding efficiency organic matter in general bloom 1981 de vicente et al 2008a lind and hem 1975 and labile organic matter in particular e g phytoplankton exudates and microbial transformed detritus also compete with p for al binding sites du et al 2019 however most forms of labile organic matter break down quickly and available al mineral binding sites should sorb the p released reitzel et al 2007 this study was performed to improve predictions of p binding efficiency in al treated eutrophic lakes twenty two sediment cores were collected from sediment transport and accumulation zones in seven al treated swedish lakes five of the seven lakes were treated with methods where al was directly added into lake sediment instead of added to the water where amorphous al oh 3 floc then precipitates and settles on to the sediment surface theoretically direct sediment al application should improve sediment binding efficiency as it distributes the newly formed al mineral where pmob is within the sediment profile lake morphology and sediment and water chemistry were analyzed to identify factors related to binding efficiency al pal ratios and a predictive model was developed that can be used to maximize p binding efficiency 2 materials and methods 2 1 study sites all study lakes are situated in southeastern sweden within 30 km of stockholm city fig 1 lake size and mean depth varied ranging from 6 to 272 ha and 2 8 7 m respectively table 1 all lakes were eutrophic and ph ranged from 8 0 to 8

differed between lakes as well table 3 pac pre hydrolyzed alcl3 was applied in liquid l form whereas alum was applied in solid s form in lötsjön alum was added directly to the water where it sank into the sediment whereas it was spread on the ice and allowed to dissolve during thaw in långsjön b cores were collected from multiple depths transport and accumulation bottoms in all lakes accumulation bottoms were defined as the deepest part of the lake where surrounding sediment transport was directed transport bottoms represent the remaining parts of the lake table 2 2 2 sediment sampling a willner gravity corer was used to collect intact sediment cores generally the uppermost 30 cm from the lakes after collection each core was sliced in the field at 1 cm intervals at sediment depths from 1 to 10 cm and 2 cm intervals thereafter all samples were stored no longer than 4 weeks in sealed containers in the dark at 4 c before analysis in order to include spatial variability within each lake and cover areas where different al doses were applied samples were collected at different locations and different water column depths table 2 representing both transport and accumulation bottoms håkanson and jansson 1983 2 3 laboratory analysis sequential extraction was used to characterize p fractions using a method originally developed by psenner et al 1988 and modified by hupfer et al 1995 the quantified fractions were porewater easily exchangeable iron fe manganese mn bound al bound organic and calcium ca bound p analysis of soluble reactive p srp in the extracts was performed using the molybdate blue method murphy and riley 1962 sediment al was extracted using acid ammonium oxalate according to the protocol of jan et al 2013 and references therein al concentrations were determined with inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectrometry icp aes at a wavelength of 396 15 nm sediment density was estimated following loss on ignition at 550 c for 2 h and water content was determined after 24 h storage at 20 c followed by freeze drying håkanson and jansson 1983 2 4 calculations and statistical analysis background concentrations of al and pal calculated using sediment layers unaffected by al treatment were subtracted from al and pal concentrations in the treated layer to determine the total mass of al and pal resulting from treatment the al pal molar ratio was calculated as the sum of excess al i e above background divided by the mass of pal formed in the sediment due to treatment the amount of labile organic p plab org was determined by subtracting background concentrations deeper in the sediment where only recalcitrant forms of organic p are assumed to remain from the total organic p fraction pre treatment pmob defined as the sum of porewater easily exchangeable p and fe bound p was estimated by summing the pal formed from pmob after treatment and the remaining pmob in the sediment profile above and within the treatment layers the lake morphology bed slope parameter was determined according to the osgood index zm a 0 5 where zm is the mean water depth m and a is lake surface area km2 osgood 1988 jmp statistical software sas

further evaluated in the discussion section 3 al dose 1 1 al pal 8 2 pmob 6 6 osgood index 159 4 discussion 4 1 comparison to previous studies ratios of al pal in this study 4 7 17 5 were in the range of what has previously been reported huser et al 2011 huser 2012 2017 jensen et al 2015 lewandowski et al 2003 reitzel et al 2005 rydin et al 2000 rydin and welch 1999 schütz et al 2017 the variation of al pal ratios between lakes in this study was similar to those reported by huser 2012 in six al treated lakes in minneapolis us whereas it was contradictory to the generally consistent ratios mean of 10 7 range from 9 8 to 11 5 reported by rydin et al 2000 in six lakes in washington us 4 2 effect of al applied and pmob content on binding efficiency lewandowski et al 2003 found consistent low al pal ratios of 2 1 and 2 2 in lake sussersee germany where low doses of al were added annually over 16 years huser 2017 also reported a similarly low ratio 2 1 after a low dose treatment 11 g m 2 in lake harriet us low dose treatments can generate higher binding efficiency lower al pal ratio due to the increased chance of al encountering p before crystallization affects binding efficiency de vicente et al 2008b a similar situation is apparent among the study lakes herein lötsjön was treated with multiple low doses multiple applications over 9 years 36 g m 2 in total this resulted in al pal ratios as low as 4 7 which was the lowest ratio i e best binding efficiency detected in this study in addition to the low dose applied lötsjön also had the highest amount of pmob available before treatment 20 6 g m 2 table 3 this would also theoretically increase binding efficiency due to the low amount of al sorbent relative to the amount of pmob sorbate i e le chateliers principle in contrast malmsjön received a relatively higher al dose 60 g m 2 single application with a lower amount of pre treatment sediment pmob mean 3 5 g m 2 table 1 table 3 resulting in one of the highest ratios in the study mean 14 3 bagarsjön also had high al pal ratios and received a similar dose to malmsjön 50 g m 2 single application but pmob availability was greater mean 5 3 g m 2 compared to malmsjön table 2 table 3 this would theoretically result in a higher binding efficiency lower al pal ratio but this was not the case although patterns in binding efficiency to some extent can be explained by the relative amount of al added to available pmob other factors also affect binding efficiency e g lake morphology and al application technique 4 3 effects of lake morphology and treatment method on binding efficiency after al application horizontal movement of the al oh 3 floc towards deeper accumulation zones can occur as a consequence of the relatively low density of the amorphous mineral similar to that of organic rich low density sediment egemose et al 2010 huser 2012 huser 2012 demonstrated this in a study of six minneapolis us lakes receiving water application of liquid alum where steep bed slope lakes had lower binding efficiency compared to gradual bed slope lakes however the results from this study showed the opposite with a negative correlation between al pal and osgood index where steep bed slope lakes osgood index 6 generally had lower al pal i e greater binding efficiency the main difference between the al treatments reported by huser 2012 and those reported here was the al application method i e sediment al injection or solid alum application was used in a majority of the studied lakes these application methods can result in al being distributed in the vertical sediment profile generally the uppermost 10 cm instead of precipitating in the water column water treatment and settling to the sediment surface where time is needed for natural incorporation of the al mineral into surficial sediment fig 5 although not previously studied application of alum sediment pellets likely works in the same manner in lakes with low density surficial sediment as demonstrated in this study for instance lötsjön had low surficial mean 0 10 cm sediment density 1 03 g cm 3 whereas alum pellets have a nearly threefold higher density 2 7 g cm 3 sediment injection and solid alum pellet application can distribute the al oh 3 floc deeper in the sediment compared to water application which would reduce horizontal transport at the sediment surface sediment treatment should increase the chance for al to encounter pmob as al is distributed within the sediment matrix where pmob is available and binding can occur before further crystallization and reduction in mineral surface area occurs additionally the al oh 3 floc can then follow sediment as it is naturally translocated to deeper areas of the lake increasing the chance for al to encounter pmob at new locations of the sediment huser 2017 the transport rate of natural sediment is generally higher in lakes with steep bed slope håkanson and jansson 1983 accelerating the possibility of al encountering pmob in the sediment before crystallization reduces the surface area of the amorphous al mineral and decreases potential binding sites berkowitz et al 2005 de vicente et al 2008b 4 4 other factors affecting binding efficiency of al in lakes although the mlr model explained 87 of the variation in binding efficiency of al in sediment treated lakes other factors may also affect binding between al and p for example du et al 2019 showed that dissolved labile organic matter competition for al binding sites may be a factor controlling al pal however this was not analyzed in our study instead we analyzed labile organic p in sediment expressed as the non recalcitrant fraction of org p which had no significant effect on the model sediment resuspension and mixing caused by benthic feeding fish e g common carp breukelaar et al 1994 driver et al 2005 huser et al 2016a b might also affect binding efficiency via increased chance for contact between al and p huser et al 2016a however nogaro et al 2016 showed that bioturbation caused by benthic invertebrates had limited effect on treatment efficiency 4 5 maximizing binding efficiency implications for treatment effectiveness equation 3 can be used to calculate the required al dose to optimize binding efficiency depending on sediment pmob mass and lake morphology the conceptual graph fig 4 demonstrates how to estimate an al dose with a fixed ratio of al pal at 10 a range of pmob from 0 to 20 g m 2 and an osgood index of 3 6 and 9 for example a gradual bed slope osgood index 3 where sediment translocation is relatively low and a pmob mass of 10 g m 2 cannot attain an al pal ratio of 10 at an al dose higher than 46 g m 2 however in a system where the bed slope is steeper osgood 9 natural sediment movement can increase the chance of al encountering pmob during natural translocation of sediment which allows for a dose of up to 81 g m 2 while still being able to attain an al pal ratio of 10 by considering the findings in this study when planning al treatment it is possible to increase cost efficiency and treatment effectiveness by optimizing al dose according to the model eq 3 it should be noted that these relationships only apply to lakes where al is either injected into the sediment or when pellets are used that can sink through low density surficial sediment often found in eutrophic lakes 4 6 other considerations the study results were strongly influenced by the type of al addition method used this is the main reason why our results generally contradict those in previous studies where water column al applications were used i e huser 2012 the opposing results are due to differences in al binding efficiency when different methods are used thus the model presented here eq 3 should only be used to evaluate cases where al is applied directly to the sediment another factor that should be considered is that buffered or pre hydrolized polyaluminum chloride pac was used in all lakes except lötsjön and långsjön 2b table 2 while the dataset reported herein was too small to draw any conclusions between types of al salt used it is possible that pre hydrolized forms of al result in lower binding efficiency as hypothesized by schütz et al 2017 hydrolysis reactions occur when al is applied to water or sediment porewater and several monomeric al species form before the solid phase al oh 3 mineral forms and precipitates buffered pac compounds on the other hand come pre hydrolized with oh and thus the hydrolysis that occurs with al is partially complete direct alpo4 formation which has a theoretical 1 1 binding of al to p is thus limited when using pac forms although this type of binding between al and p is only dominant at high phosphate concentrations jenkins et al 1971 it may occur when sediment porewater phosphate concentrations are much higher relative to those found in the water column in eutrophic lakes enell and lövgren 1988 5 conclusions the results of this study indicate that p binding efficiency following al treatment is regulated by al added relative to the amount of legacy p in sediment i e pmob and lake morphology osgood index the main underlying mechanism is connected to the potential for al binding of pmob in sediment before crystallization of the amorphous al mineral occurs and surface area binding sites decrease elevated al doses relative to sediment pmob will generally reduce binding efficiency whereas sediment injection of al into the sediment or solid alum application can improve binding efficiency especially in lakes with steep sediment bed slopes with sediment treatment al is distributed vertically in the sediment at the moment of treatment this along with natural movement of the sediment increases binding efficiency by increasing the chance of al encountering pmob before crystallization causes a decrease in surface area of the mineral the model developed in this study can be used to predict the optimal al dose needed to achieve a specific binding efficiency thereby maximizing cost efficiency and effectiveness of sediment al treatment declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they

17599,chloramine is the disinfectant of choice for long drinking water distribution systems since it is more stable than chlorine therefore providing a longer lasting disinfectant residual and producing less disinfection byproducts however to deliver safe drinking water in remote areas redosing stations are used where mostly chlorine is added to the water to re establish a disinfectant residual in this study the use of a highly concentrated preformed monochloramine solution instead of chlorine for redosing in tanks or reservoirs along extensive distribution systems was investigated this will avoid unwanted reactions due to chlorine reactivity formation of disinfection byproducts and increase the disinfectant stability highly concentrated monochloramine solutions 15 mm 1 gcl2 l 1 are most stable at high ph 10 and low temperature it was found that the current kinetic model used for drinking water application was not accurate for highly concentrated monochloramine a simplified kinetic model was developed and successfully used to predict monochloramine stability in our conditions this will assist water utilities for application of preformed concentrated monochloramine allowing monochloramine redosing in long drinking water distribution systems hydrazine a compound of health concern might form at high monochloramine concentrations and high ph and needs to be carefully controlled graphical abstract image 1 1 introduction chloramination is a popular alternative disinfection practice to chlorination as it forms lower concentrations of regulated disinfection by products dbps and provides a more persistent disinfectant residual in drinking water treatment there are four different application techniques that can be utilised for chloramination pre chlorination post chlorination also known as pre ammoniation concurrent addition of chlorine and ammonia and the addition of preformed monochloramine kirmeyer 2004 most water utilities use pre chlorination to meet disinfection requirements i e specific ct value set by regulatory authorities and or to oxidise iodide to iodate usepa 1999 in such practices chlorine is applied first as the primary disinfectant to inactivate pathogenic microorganisms while the subsequently formed monochloramine acts as secondary disinfectant providing the required disinfectant residual in the distribution system during pre chlorination a portion of the chlorine is converted to chlorinated organic compounds including dbps another portion readily reacts with bromide to form bromine kumar and margerum 1987 in absence of natural organic matter nom bromamine and bromochloramine are formed following ammonia addition allard et al 2018a 2018b and an immediate loss of oxidant is observed due to the rapid degradation of monobromamine allard et al 2018a in the presence of nom br dbps which are a potential health concern are also formed allard et al 2018a langsa et al 2017 overall when pre chlorination is used a significant portion of the oxidant is quickly consumed preformed monochloramine refers to a concentrated solution of monochloramine that is produced in a process separate to the treatment train prior to its addition to the water there have been only a few investigations on the use of preformed monochloramine for chloramination beck et al 1986 mitch et al 2005 and very few water utilities currently use preformed monochloramine for chloramination for example in sjælsø denmark a concentrated solution of preformed monochloramine 20 mg l 1 has been used for post disinfection beck et al 1986 i e as a secondary disinfectant the use of preformed monochloramine could be advantageous since the formation of monochloramine can be controlled before the disinfection stage the formation of monochloramine which is then independent of the ph or the presence of natural ammonia in source waters is maximised and its overall stability improved allard et al 2018a beck et al 1986 preformed monochloramine has the advantage that it will avoid the formation of dbps from nom as observed during pre chlorination and it slowly reacts with bromide thus avoiding the rapid formation and degradation of monobromamine allard et al 2018a while preformed monochloramine might not be the primary choice for use at the end of a drinking water treatment train to comply with disinfection requirement ct it might offer a potential practical solution for redosing disinfectant into tanks and reservoirs in remote areas this will allow to re establish disinfectant residual avoid the formation of additional dbps and lower the impact of bromide on the oxidant stability allard et al 2018a however the preparation of a pure concentrated monochloramine solution is a prerequisite for the preformed monochloramine application chloramination combines chlorine and ammonia for disinfection resulting in the competitive formation of three species of chloramines monochloramine nh2cl dichloramine nhcl2 and or trichloramine ncl3 at ph values typically found in drinking water treatment plants ph 7 9 5 monochloramine is the dominant species formed with negligible amounts of dichloramine and trichloramine kirmeyer 2004 vikesland et al 2001 monochloramine is the preferred chloramine species for drinking water disinfection because of its biocidal properties and higher relative stability although monochloramine is more stable than chlorine it is inherently unstable in aqueous solution in absence of inorganic or organic substances the main factors affecting monochloramine stability are ph temperature and cl n molar ratio allard et al 2018a jafvert and valentine 1992 vikesland et al 2001 in pure water monochloramine reportedly decomposes through two major pathways auto decomposition and acid catalysed disproportionation vikesland et al 2001 in order to understand the loss of monochloramine in distribution systems degradation pathways for monochloramine in model and distribution system waters have been studied and modelled diyamandoglu 1994 developed a model for the aqueous chlorine ammonia system to explain the production of nitrate and chloride as products of chloramine decomposition this model is valid for low concentration 1 2 mm monochloramine systems with ph 7 0 9 6 valentine and coworkers jafvert and valentine 1992 valentine and jafvert 1988 valentine et al 1988 vikesland et al 2001 developed a comprehensive model describing chloramine decomposition at concentrations typically found in distribution systems this model was developed to describe the stability of chloramine at low concentrations 1 2 mm and over a wide ph range however these models have not been tested at the high monochloramine concentrations required for this application one of the issues arising from the use of a concentrated monochloramine solution is the formation of hydrazine hydrazine has been associated with carcinogenic and mutagenic effects through laboratory animal studies and is classified as a probable human carcinogen b2 with a 10 6 cancer risk level of 10 ng l 1 in drinking water najm 2006 hydrazine is known to be the product of the reaction between chloramine and free ammonia and its formation is favoured at high ph najm 2006 in this study the preparation of a concentrated monochloramine solution that is stable and can be industrially prepared for redosing in chloraminated distribution systems in remote locations was investigated factors affecting the stability of monochloramine e g ph temperature were considered and a simplified kinetic model that is able to predict the decomposition of concentrated monochloramine solution was developed finally the formation of hydrazine a probable human carcinogen that might be formed in a concentrated monochloramine solution was monitored 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals and reagents inorganic and organic chemicals and reagents were all of analytical ar grade purity 99 pure ultrapure water was produced using an ion exchange system ibis technology western australia australia followed by an elga purelab ultra system with a 0 2 μm filter elga high wycombe uk 2 2 analytical methods direct uv measurements were used to quantify nh2cl concentrations using a shimadzu uv pharmaspec 1700 spectrophotometer with a 1 cm path length cuvette the concentration of monochloramine was determined using εnh2cl 243 461 m 1cm 1 kumar et al 1986 the concentrations of nh2cl were also measured with the dpd colorimetric method with addition of ki apha 2005 the total oxidant concentration was followed by iodometric titration following the procedure described in standard methods 4500 cl b apha 2005 iodometric titration gives a concentration of the total oxidant

species as well as their degradation was used in this study this model was trialled with high concentrations relevant to redosing applications 15 20 mm and a simplified model was developed in this study modelling was performed using the kintecus software ianni 2008 3 results and discussion 3 1 experimental method for accurate determination of monochloramine in concentrated solutions the most common methods used for quantification of oxidants are the iodometric titration the dpd n n diethyl p phenylenediamine method apha 2005 and the direct uv measurement schreiber and mitch 2005 direct uv measurement was thought to be the most promising technique since it allows the direct measurement of both monochloramine and dichloramine by solving simultaneous equations using 2 different wavelengths for this range of concentrations see schreiber and mitch 2005 for more explanation the iodometric titration method provides total oxidant concentration the dpd colorimetric method has an advantage that it can also measure dichloramine however for this study a high dilution factor was required to maintain the monochloramine concentrations in the working range of the dpd method 0 01 2 mg l 1 0 1 30 μm and thus the concentration of dichloramine if present was expected to be below the detection limit for this method as shown in fig 1 the iodometric titration and the dpd colorimetric method provided similar results while the uv direct measurements were much higher several studies have reported the slow formation of an unidentified chloramine decomposition product which absorbs uv light at the same wavelength as monochloramine 243 nm in basic conditions cimetière 2009 leung and valentine 1994a b valentine et al 1986 the formation of this unknown product was verified by hplc with diode array detection fig s2 and text s1 for the monochloramine concentration range studied a lower dilution factor is needed with the iodometric method compared to the dpd colorimetric method thus introducing less experimental error therefore the iodometric titration was selected as the analytical method for the measurement of monochloramine in concentrated monochloramine solutions 3 2 effect of ph on the stability of concentrated monochloramine solutions the major factors affecting the formation and stability of monochloramine are ph cl n ratio and temperature allard et al 2018a jafvert and valentine 1992 ph was found to be the most sensitive variable affecting the formation and stability of monochloramine in a series of preliminary experiments see supporting information text s2 table s1 and figs s3 s4 therefore the stability of concentrated monochloramine solutions initial concentration 15 mm 1 gcl2 l 1 over an extended time period 168 h was investigated under varying ph conditions ph 6 2 7 5 8 3 9 9 5 10 with and without initial ph 11 8 ph control in this set of experiments the temperature t 22 c controlled room temperature and the cl n ratio molar ratio of 1 were kept constant as shown in fig 2 increasing the ph increased the stability of the monochloramine solution under ph controlled conditions the concentrated solution of monochloramine was found to be most stable at ph 10 with 9 4 mm of monochloramine left in solution after 168 h compared to 4 0 mm at ph 8 3 and none at ph 6 2 and 7 5 fig 2 other studies have also found that concentrated monochloramine 25 mm was stable in alkaline solution at ph 10 anbar and yagil 1962 audrieth and rowe 1955 without ph control at an initial monochloramine concentration of 15 mm 1 gcl2 l 1 monochloramine concentrations remain relatively high with only 8 and 16 degradation in 24 h and 48 h respectively and with a half life of approximately 170 h the relatively high stability of concentrated monochloramine solution with no ph control is due to its initial high ph of 11 8 and its relatively small ph decrease to 9 3 at the end of the experiment 168 h this indicates that concentrated preformed monochloramine solutions show potential for boosting oxidant residual especially if redosing is conducted soon after the preparation of the preformed monochloramine solution 3 3 kinetic modelling of the stability of concentrated monochloramine solution the stability of concentrated preformed monochloramine solution is critical for its field application therefore the ability to predict monochloramine concentration through the use of a kinetic model would be very useful during the preparation of concentrated preformed monochloramine solution and its application in drinking water distribution systems valentine and co workers valentine et al 1988 vikesland et al 2001 have developed a comprehensive kinetic model that describes the decay of monochloramine in solution initially low concentrations of monochloramine 1 5 mm were used to verify the accuracy of the valentine model at different phs and validate our experimental set up experimental data for the degradation of monochloramine at low initial concentration 1 5 mm uncertainty 0 005 mm for ph 6 2 8 3 and 10 compared to the predictions of valentine s model is shown in fig s5 the simulation of nh2cl decay by valentine s model fits well with the experimental data for ph 8 3 and 10 at these ph values the formation of dichloramine is insignificant fig s5 and therefore the iodometric measurement of chloramines reflects the concentration of monochloramine however for ph 6 2 significant formation of dichloramine is expected based on valentine s model fig s5 therefore the modelling of monochloramine concentration alone underestimates the experimental values which represent the concentrations of monochloramine and dichloramine although including both monochloramine and dichloramine did not greatly improve the accuracy of the model for short contact times the model was able to accurately predict the final observed concentration of monochloramine t 120 h since dichloramine became negligible fig s5 the suitability of valentine s model for prediction of chloramine decay in a more concentrated monochloramine solution 16 0 04 mm at different ph values ph 6 2 10 was then studied fig 3 there were significant differences between the monochloramine concentrations predicted by valentine s model and the experimental data valentine s model clearly overestimates the concentration of monochloramine remaining in the solution over time in the ph range 7 5 10 fig 3 in this case the discrepancy can t be explained by the formation of dichloramine as for ph 6 5 since the experimental data are lower than the model predictions overall fig 3 showed that the model cannot accurately predict monochloramine degradation at high initial monochloramine concentrations the experimental data obtained in this study showed that valentine s model is ineffective at predicting the stability of concentrated monochloramine solutions in the ph and concentration range that is required for application of preformed monochloramine redosing in drinking water distribution systems therefore a simplified model was developed for predicting monochloramine stability in concentrated solutions it has to be noted that this is an empirical model and there was no attempt to identify the degradation products of monochloramine since monochloramine was initially present at much higher concentrations than in the study of valentine and co workers valentine et al 1988 vikesland et al 2001 it was assumed that monochloramine autodecomposition was dominant over other chemical reactions involved in the model equation 1 1 nh2cl nh2cl products therefore the kinetics of the experimental data was examined according to the second order rate law in equation 2 2 d n h 2 c l d t k obs nh 2 cl 2 k h α nh 2 cl 2 plots of 1 nhcl2 1 nhcl2 0 as a function of the reaction time for ph 6 2 10 were found to be linear fig s6 indicating that the monochloramine decay was well modelled assuming a second order reaction the second order rate constants kobs were determined by the relationship slope 2 kobs and are presented in units of m 1 s 1 in table 1 for ph 7 5 10 since the rate of monochloramine disproportionation is highly ph dependent an apparent reaction order with respect to h α equation 2 was determined using equation 3 3 log kobs log k α log h the ph dependence on log kobs is plotted in fig s7 the slope obtained in fig s7 is equal to the apparent reaction order with respect to h α and intercept is equal to the logarithm of the overall rate constant k for the ph range studied the order with respect to h α was equal to 0 50 and the overall rate constant k for the autodecomposition of monochloramine over the ph range studied was 2 14 m 1 5s 1 a simplified model was developed based on equation 2 to simulate monochloramine decay the simulated monochloramine concentrations obtained for different ph values using the simplified model are presented in fig 3 together with the predictions from valentine s model the simplified model clearly provides an improved prediction of monochloramine stability at high concentration compared to valentine s model for all of the ph values studied the excellent fit of the model to the experimental data in the basic ph range 7 5 10 validates the accuracy of the simplified second order model for this ph range however at lower ph 6 2 the model showed a small deviation from the experimental data probably due to the presence of dichloramine therefore the simplified second order model developed in this study shows potential as a simple predictive tool for monochloramine stability at high concentration in the ph range 7 5 10 assisting the application of preformed concentrated monochloramine solutions for monochloramine redosing in drinking water distribution systems 3 4 effect of temperature on the stability of highly concentrated monochloramine solutions and formation of hydrazine the effect of temperature 0 22 30 40 and 50 c on the stability of highly concentrated monochloramine solution 150 mm was investigated it was not possible to control the ph of a 150 mm solution of monochloramine since the volume of solution needed to adjust the ph with the autotitrator was too high leading to a large dilution of the solution therefore it was not possible to simulate the data using the simplified second order model as shown in fig 4 increasing the temperature decreased the stability of the monochloramine concentration with more than 50 of the initial monochloramine decomposed in 1 h at 50 c this was expected since increasing temperature results in an increase in the hydrolysis rate of monochloramine and thus its decomposition vikesland et al 2001 an important consideration concerning the application of concentrated preformed monochloramine solutions is the potential formation of a potentially harmful by product hydrazine hydrazine is known to be a product of the reaction between chloramine and free ammonia and its formation is favoured at high ph najm 2006 yagil and anbar 1962 the conditions that lead to the most stable concentrated preformed monochloramine solution as determined in this study ph 10 correspond to conditions that favour the formation of hydrazine therefore the extent of hydrazine formation under these conditions was investigated a concentrated preformed monochloramine solution 150 mm no ph control was prepared and analysed for monochloramine and hydrazine over 24 h in the concentrated monochloramine solution the decay of monochloramine was not fitted using the simplified second order model since it was not possible to control the ph at this concentration hydrazine was measured up to 725 μg l 1 in the concentrated monochloramine solution fig 5 the trend in the concentrations of hydrazine indicated that the formation of hydrazine reached a maximum after 1 h followed by its decomposition its concentration was already below the detection limit lod 5 ng l 1 after 5 h this is consistent with previous findings showing that hydrazine is oxidised by chloramine cahn and powell 1954 and oxygen ellis et al 1960 based on these preliminary findings there should be little concern over the formation and occurrence of hydrazine in the preparation and application of concentrated preformed monochloramine solution however the formation of hydrazine in concentrated preformed monochloramine solution needs to be more thoroughly assessed 4 conclusions concentrated preformed monochloramine solutions 15 mm were found to be most stable at ph 10 the kinetic model of valentine and co workers was shown to be ineffective for predicting the stability of concentrated monochloramine solutions in the ph and concentration ranges that are required for redosing application in drinking water distribution systems a simplified kinetic model was developed in the current study the simplified model was found to provide a greatly improved prediction of monochloramine stability at high concentrations thus demonstrating potential as a simple predictive tool for monochloramine stability at ph and concentration ranges that are relevant to field applications highly concentrated preformed monochloramine solutions were found to have limited stability and hence need to be prepared immediately prior to use however despite these limitations the application of highly concentrated preformed monochloramine for rechloramination to maintain disinfectant residual in remote areas is feasible where for example a mobile unit can be dispatched to locations that require boosting of chloramine residual redosing with highly concentrated preformed monochloramine offers water utilities increased options for quickly re establishing disinfectant residuals when required however the formation of hydrazine needs to be carefully controlled moreover implications of the application of highly concentrated monochloramine solution on the formation of other regulated and unregulated dbps of toxicological interest need to be assessed for field applications nitrification is a known drinking water quality issue in chloraminated systems where ammonia oxidising bacteria feed on free ammonia when monochloramine has been fully consumed using highly concentrated monochloramine solution instead of boost chlorination for redosing of disinfectant in long distribution systems will increase the disinfectant residual lifetime and limit the occurrence of nitrification events however the sites where redosing is applied should be carefully located to ensure that the residual never had a chance to fully decline since free ammonia will be present in the water other options for field application of highly concentrated monochloramine solution that require more infrastructure also need to be considered for example during concurrent addition of chlorine and ammonia only a small fraction of the chlorine has time to react with inorganic or organic components in the water chlorine for example reacts three orders of magnitude faster with ammonia than with bromide allard et al 2018a therefore the chemistry of monochloramine will not be greatly impacted by bromide but mainly by highly reactive nom therefore to avoid this loss of disinfectant residual and to improve this application a small reverse osmosis unit treating only a small fraction of the water might be used in a side stream of the main pipe to remove the doc and a large fraction of the bromide concomitant addition of chlorine and ammonia to this reverse osmosis treated water would reduce the unwanted consumption of chlorine and form an almost pure monochloramine solution declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal

17599,chloramine is the disinfectant of choice for long drinking water distribution systems since it is more stable than chlorine therefore providing a longer lasting disinfectant residual and producing less disinfection byproducts however to deliver safe drinking water in remote areas redosing stations are used where mostly chlorine is added to the water to re establish a disinfectant residual in this study the use of a highly concentrated preformed monochloramine solution instead of chlorine for redosing in tanks or reservoirs along extensive distribution systems was investigated this will avoid unwanted reactions due to chlorine reactivity formation of disinfection byproducts and increase the disinfectant stability highly concentrated monochloramine solutions 15 mm 1 gcl2 l 1 are most stable at high ph 10 and low temperature it was found that the current kinetic model used for drinking water application was not accurate for highly concentrated monochloramine a simplified kinetic model was developed and successfully used to predict monochloramine stability in our conditions this will assist water utilities for application of preformed concentrated monochloramine allowing monochloramine redosing in long drinking water distribution systems hydrazine a compound of health concern might form at high monochloramine concentrations and high ph and needs to be carefully controlled graphical abstract image 1 1 introduction chloramination is a popular alternative disinfection practice to chlorination as it forms lower concentrations of regulated disinfection by products dbps and provides a more persistent disinfectant residual in drinking water treatment there are four different application techniques that can be utilised for chloramination pre chlorination post chlorination also known as pre ammoniation concurrent addition of chlorine and ammonia and the addition of preformed monochloramine kirmeyer 2004 most water utilities use pre chlorination to meet disinfection requirements i e specific ct value set by regulatory authorities and or to oxidise iodide to iodate usepa 1999 in such practices chlorine is applied first as the primary disinfectant to inactivate pathogenic microorganisms while the subsequently formed monochloramine acts as secondary disinfectant providing the required disinfectant residual in the distribution system during pre chlorination a portion of the chlorine is converted to chlorinated organic compounds including dbps another portion readily reacts with bromide to form bromine kumar and margerum 1987 in absence of natural organic matter nom bromamine and bromochloramine are formed following ammonia addition allard et al 2018a 2018b and an immediate loss of oxidant is observed due to the rapid degradation of monobromamine allard et al 2018a in the presence of nom br dbps which are a potential health concern are also formed allard et al 2018a langsa et al 2017 overall when pre chlorination is used a significant portion of the oxidant is quickly consumed preformed monochloramine refers to a concentrated solution of monochloramine that is produced in a process separate to the treatment train prior to its addition to the water there have been only a few investigations on the use of preformed monochloramine for chloramination beck et al 1986 mitch et al 2005 and very few water utilities currently use preformed monochloramine for chloramination for example in sjælsø denmark a concentrated solution of preformed monochloramine 20 mg l 1 has been used for post disinfection beck et al 1986 i e as a secondary disinfectant the use of preformed monochloramine could be advantageous since the formation of monochloramine can be controlled before the disinfection stage the formation of monochloramine which is then independent of the ph or the presence of natural ammonia in source waters is maximised and its overall stability improved allard et al 2018a beck et al 1986 preformed monochloramine has the advantage that it will avoid the formation of dbps from nom as observed during pre chlorination and it slowly reacts with bromide thus avoiding the rapid formation and degradation of monobromamine allard et al 2018a while preformed monochloramine might not be the primary choice for use at the end of a drinking water treatment train to comply with disinfection requirement ct it might offer a potential practical solution for redosing disinfectant into tanks and reservoirs in remote areas this will allow to re establish disinfectant residual avoid the formation of additional dbps and lower the impact of bromide on the oxidant stability allard et al 2018a however the preparation of a pure concentrated monochloramine solution is a prerequisite for the preformed monochloramine application chloramination combines chlorine and ammonia for disinfection resulting in the competitive formation of three species of chloramines monochloramine nh2cl dichloramine nhcl2 and or trichloramine ncl3 at ph values typically found in drinking water treatment plants ph 7 9 5 monochloramine is the dominant species formed with negligible amounts of dichloramine and trichloramine kirmeyer 2004 vikesland et al 2001 monochloramine is the preferred chloramine species for drinking water disinfection because of its biocidal properties and higher relative stability although monochloramine is more stable than chlorine it is inherently unstable in aqueous solution in absence of inorganic or organic substances the main factors affecting monochloramine stability are ph temperature and cl n molar ratio allard et al 2018a jafvert and valentine 1992 vikesland et al 2001 in pure water monochloramine reportedly decomposes through two major pathways auto decomposition and acid catalysed disproportionation vikesland et al 2001 in order to understand the loss of monochloramine in distribution systems degradation pathways for monochloramine in model and distribution system waters have been studied and modelled diyamandoglu 1994 developed a model for the aqueous chlorine ammonia system to explain the production of nitrate and chloride as products of chloramine decomposition this model is valid for low concentration 1 2 mm monochloramine systems with ph 7 0 9 6 valentine and coworkers jafvert and valentine 1992 valentine and jafvert 1988 valentine et al 1988 vikesland et al 2001 developed a comprehensive model describing chloramine decomposition at concentrations typically found in distribution systems this model was developed to describe the stability of chloramine at low concentrations 1 2 mm and over a wide ph range however these models have not been tested at the high monochloramine concentrations required for this application one of the issues arising from the use of a concentrated monochloramine solution is the formation of hydrazine hydrazine has been associated with carcinogenic and mutagenic effects through laboratory animal studies and is classified as a probable human carcinogen b2 with a 10 6 cancer risk level of 10 ng l 1 in drinking water najm 2006 hydrazine is known to be the product of the reaction between chloramine and free ammonia and its formation is favoured at high ph najm 2006 in this study the preparation of a concentrated monochloramine solution that is stable and can be industrially prepared for redosing in chloraminated distribution systems in remote locations was investigated factors affecting the stability of monochloramine e g ph temperature were considered and a simplified kinetic model that is able to predict the decomposition of concentrated monochloramine solution was developed finally the formation of hydrazine a probable human carcinogen that might be

data are lower than the model predictions overall fig 3 showed that the model cannot accurately predict monochloramine degradation at high initial monochloramine concentrations the experimental data obtained in this study showed that valentine s model is ineffective at predicting the stability of concentrated monochloramine solutions in the ph and concentration range that is required for application of preformed monochloramine redosing in drinking water distribution systems therefore a simplified model was developed for predicting monochloramine stability in concentrated solutions it has to be noted that this is an empirical model and there was no attempt to identify the degradation products of monochloramine since monochloramine was initially present at much higher concentrations than in the study of valentine and co workers valentine et al 1988 vikesland et al 2001 it was assumed that monochloramine autodecomposition was dominant over other chemical reactions involved in the model equation 1 1 nh2cl nh2cl products therefore the kinetics of the experimental data was examined according to the second order rate law in equation 2 2 d n h 2 c l d t k obs nh 2 cl 2 k h α nh 2 cl 2 plots of 1 nhcl2 1 nhcl2 0 as a function of the reaction time for ph 6 2 10 were found to be linear fig s6 indicating that the monochloramine decay was well modelled assuming a second order reaction the second order rate constants kobs were determined by the relationship slope 2 kobs and are presented in units of m 1 s 1 in table 1 for ph 7 5 10 since the rate of monochloramine disproportionation is highly ph dependent an apparent reaction order with respect to h α equation 2 was determined using equation 3 3 log kobs log k α log h the ph dependence on log kobs is plotted in fig s7 the slope obtained in fig s7 is equal to the apparent reaction order with respect to h α and intercept is equal to the logarithm of the overall rate constant k for the ph range studied the order with respect to h α was equal to 0 50 and the overall rate constant k for the autodecomposition of monochloramine over the ph range studied was 2 14 m 1 5s 1 a simplified model was developed based on equation 2 to simulate monochloramine decay the simulated monochloramine concentrations obtained for different ph values using the simplified model are presented in fig 3 together with the predictions from valentine s model the simplified model clearly provides an improved prediction of monochloramine stability at high concentration compared to valentine s model for all of the ph values studied the excellent fit of the model to the experimental data in the basic ph range 7 5 10 validates the accuracy of the simplified second order model for this ph range however at lower ph 6 2 the model showed a small deviation from the experimental data probably due to the presence of dichloramine therefore the simplified second order model developed in this study shows potential as a simple predictive tool for monochloramine stability at high concentration in the ph range 7 5 10 assisting the application of preformed concentrated monochloramine solutions for monochloramine redosing in drinking water distribution systems 3 4 effect of temperature on the stability of highly concentrated monochloramine solutions and formation of hydrazine the effect of temperature 0 22 30 40 and 50 c on the stability of highly concentrated monochloramine solution 150 mm was investigated it was not possible to control the ph of a 150 mm solution of monochloramine since the volume of solution needed to adjust the ph with the autotitrator was too high leading to a large dilution of the solution therefore it was not possible to simulate the data using the simplified second order model as shown in fig 4 increasing the temperature decreased the stability of the monochloramine concentration with more than 50 of the initial monochloramine decomposed in 1 h at 50 c this was expected since increasing temperature results in an increase in the hydrolysis rate of monochloramine and thus its decomposition vikesland et al 2001 an important consideration concerning the application of concentrated preformed monochloramine solutions is the potential formation of a potentially harmful by product hydrazine hydrazine is known to be a product of the reaction between chloramine and free ammonia and its formation is favoured at high ph najm 2006 yagil and anbar 1962 the conditions that lead to the most stable concentrated preformed monochloramine solution as determined in this study ph 10 correspond to conditions that favour the formation of hydrazine therefore the extent of hydrazine formation under these conditions was investigated a concentrated preformed monochloramine solution 150 mm no ph control was prepared and analysed for monochloramine and hydrazine over 24 h in the concentrated monochloramine solution the decay of monochloramine was not fitted using the simplified second order model since it was not possible to control the ph at this concentration hydrazine was measured up to 725 μg l 1 in the concentrated monochloramine solution fig 5 the trend in the concentrations of hydrazine indicated that the formation of hydrazine reached a maximum after 1 h followed by its decomposition its concentration was already below the detection limit lod 5 ng l 1 after 5 h this is consistent with previous findings showing that hydrazine is oxidised by chloramine cahn and powell 1954 and oxygen ellis et al 1960 based on these preliminary findings there should be little concern over the formation and occurrence of hydrazine in the preparation and application of concentrated preformed monochloramine solution however the formation of hydrazine in concentrated preformed monochloramine solution needs to be more thoroughly assessed 4 conclusions concentrated preformed monochloramine solutions 15 mm were found to be most stable at ph 10 the kinetic model of valentine and co workers was shown to be ineffective for predicting the stability of concentrated monochloramine solutions in the ph and concentration ranges that are required for redosing application in drinking water distribution systems a simplified kinetic model was developed in the current study the simplified model was found to provide a greatly improved prediction of monochloramine stability at high concentrations thus demonstrating potential as a simple predictive tool for monochloramine stability at ph and concentration ranges that are relevant to field applications highly concentrated preformed monochloramine solutions were found to have limited stability and hence need to be prepared immediately prior to use however despite these limitations the application of highly concentrated preformed monochloramine for rechloramination to maintain disinfectant residual in remote areas is feasible where for example a mobile unit can be dispatched to locations that require boosting of chloramine residual redosing with highly concentrated preformed monochloramine offers water utilities increased options for quickly re establishing disinfectant residuals when required however the formation of hydrazine needs to be carefully controlled moreover implications of the application of highly concentrated monochloramine solution on the formation of other regulated and unregulated dbps of toxicological interest need to be assessed for field applications nitrification is a known drinking water quality issue in chloraminated systems where ammonia oxidising bacteria feed on free ammonia when monochloramine has been fully consumed using highly concentrated monochloramine solution instead of boost chlorination for redosing of disinfectant in long distribution systems will increase the disinfectant residual lifetime and limit the occurrence of nitrification events however the sites where redosing is applied should be carefully located to ensure that the residual never had a chance to fully decline since free ammonia will be present in the water other options for field application of highly concentrated monochloramine solution that require more infrastructure also need to be considered for example during concurrent addition of chlorine and ammonia only a small fraction of the chlorine has time to react with inorganic or organic components in the water chlorine for example reacts three orders of magnitude faster with ammonia than with bromide allard et al 2018a therefore the chemistry of monochloramine will not be greatly impacted by bromide but mainly by highly reactive nom therefore to avoid this loss of disinfectant residual and to improve this application a small reverse osmosis unit treating only a small fraction of the water might be used in a side stream of the main pipe to remove the doc and a large fraction of the bromide concomitant addition of chlorine and ammonia to this reverse osmosis treated water would reduce the unwanted consumption of chlorine and form an almost pure monochloramine solution declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal
