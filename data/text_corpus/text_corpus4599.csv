22995,submarine pipelines are the most viable way for transporting offshore oil and gas worldwide however it is easy to cause the vertical buckling in the process of work under the high temperature and high pressure in this paper the energy method was used to analyze and derive the relationship between the temperature and the buckling height during the thermal vertical buckling of the third order mode of pipeline additionally the finite element method was utilized to model and simulate the pipeline on submarine pit and trench respectively from this investigation it is found that the maximum circumferential stress and strain in mid section of pipelines are larger than in left section on submarine pit on submarine trench the maximum circumferential stress in mid section is larger than in left section but the maximum circumferential strain in mid section is smaller than in left section the buckling height and length sharply increases with the increase of temperature or pressure whether on submarine pit or trench with the increase of temperature the stress of pipelines increases first and then decreases on pit but always enlarges on trench with the increase of pressure the stress of pipelines increases on trench and the stress of pipelines in left section increases but in the mid section decreases the length and depth of submarine pit and trench directly affect the shape of pipelines and size of the initial sunken imperfection the friction coefficient has little effect on the buckling length height and stress and the buckling deformation changes from third order mode to fifth order because the axial friction cannot balance the thermal axial force if the friction coefficient is too small the buckling height length and stress enlarges accompanied by the increase of diameter thick ratio of pipelines and reducing the diameter thick ratio in practice can effectively strengthen the ability of pipeline to resist buckling keywords submarine pipeline thermal stress vertical bucking sunken seabed surface laid numerical simulation 1 introduction submarine pipelines are the most viable way for transporting offshore oil and gas worldwide in virtue of the requirements of the production process submarine pipelines which are being used for transporting oil and gas need to be applied to high temperature and high pressure ht hp so the thermal loading and internal pressure of submarine pipe wall bring the massive subsidiary stress due to pipelines are constrained by sea floor relief and pipe soil friction it is not free to release this subsidiary stress with the length of pipelines increasing the subsidiary stress in pipelines accumulates continuously when the value of subsidiary stress exceeds the seabed friction on pipelines pipelines will buckle suddenly and the deformation of the subsidiary stress to be released which happen under the action of axial loading instability when vertical buckling of pipelines occurs pipelines will have large stress strain and plastic deformation and even further local buckling fatigue or propagation buckling albermani et al 2011a as pipelines carrying a large number of offshore oil and gas thermal vertical buckling and even yield failure will lead to oil and gas leakage which not only causes waste of resources but also poses a threat to the living environment of human beings and marine organisms therefore the study of the thermal vertical buckling process of submarine pipelines is of great significance for the laying safety evaluation and maintenance of submarine pipelines because of the limitation of the experiment conditions and size of the research object the field and laboratory tests of the thermal vertical buckling of submarine pipelines are few thus the main research methods are numerical simulation and theoretical research allan 1968 researched the sensitivity of the problem to initial imperfections and conducted one of the first analytical and experimental studies on vertical buckling of an axially compressed frictionless strip kerr 1978 presented a number of studies which were motivated by lateral buckling of railway tracks tvergaard and needleman 1981 accounted for localized thermal track buckling and the nonlinear force displacement relationship of the track foundation hobbs 1984 first used the research results that were made by kerr on the global buckling specifically of pipelines and proposed the most widely accepted formulations about four classic modes of pipelines later both the buckling responses of perfect straight pipelines and theoretical solutions for vertical and lateral buckling of pipelines to cover plenty of practical cases also further studied by liang hobbs and liang 1989 and ballet ballet and hobbs 1992 previous attempts to model the appropriate behavior were based on perfect or idealized pipelines in the practical engineering of manufacturing process and laying of submarine pipelines on seabed local bending deformations due to uneven seabed or man made factors which is known as the initial imperfections will lead to installation of submarine pipelines not be straight on seabed taylor and gan 1984 focused on two pivotal factors before any formal non linear predictive analyses and considered a set of analyses which incorporate deformation dependent axial friction resistance and structural initial imperfections and elucidated an inherent limitation existing in the previous mathematical model of global buckling mode taylor and gan 1986a in addition both lateral taylor and gan 1986b and vertical taylor and gan 1987 deflection modes were analyzed and an analytical solution accounting for lateral and vertical buckling of pipelines with initial imperfections were discussed for a mathematical model in analysis relating to pipelines taylor and tran 1993 considered the horizontal and straight idealized pipelines that were interrupted by an encounter with an isolated point or prop imperfections irregularity and carried out series of experiments under the critical loads to derive mathematical models that account for the different imperfections taylor and tran 1996 however these studies did not take into account the effects of residual stress on critical buckling loads caused by initial imperfections in submarine pipelines croll 1997 elucidated the effects of residual stress and initial imperfections used the simplified calculation model to research upheaval buckling of pipelines and carried out the critical load formulas villarraga et al 2004 used the nonlinear finite element method to analyze stresses and displacements of buried pipelines with initial imperfections including both thermal expansion of the pipeline and internal pressure white and cheuk 2008 elucidated a simple framework which allowed existing pipe soil interaction models to be extended to obtain this large deformation behavior of pipelines using a kinematic hardening model and limited experimental data was currently available karampour et al albermani et al 2011b conducted experimental tests which used aluminum and steel sample pipes with different diameter thick ratios to determine buckling initiation and buckling propagation pressures in hyperbaric chamber based on an isolated half wavelength model for lateral buckling numerical and analytical researches were established and a novel interpretation of localization was revealed and based on a long heavy elastic beam resting on a rigid frictional foundation for upheaval buckling a tabulated analytical solution was determined karampour et al 2013 experimental results for buckling propagation and pure bending of submarine pipelines were determined first that followed by buckling interaction results which highlighted the vulnerability of pipelines to buckling interaction particularly karampour and albermani 2014 peng et al 2013 designed two scaled pipeline models with different boundary conditions that were subjected to random wave forces in a large wave tank using waterproof accelerometers to study the pipeline structural response liu et al 2014a conducted the explicit and implicit dynamic algorithms to respectively simulate the global buckling of pipelines in both 2d and 3d models and established a new method to introduce initial imperfections of pipelines later a series of vertical and axial pullout experiments were carried out on model pipe segments buried in soft clay and thermal upheaval buckling of pipelines operating at different temperatures were studied liu et al 2015 duan et al zeng and duan 2014 modeled the lateral buckling pipelines by an axial compressive beam that is supported by laterally distributed nonlinear springs taking the soil berm effects in the horizontal plane and concluded preliminarily that the model was governed by a time independent equation based on the finite element and dimensional analysis a series of new mathematical models were established for the critical axial forces zeng et al 2014 afterwards the finite element method was used to research the upheaval buckling behaviors of eight groups of pipelines with different out of straightness and a universal and approximate formula was proposed to calculate the critical axial force zhang and duan 2015 zhu et al 2015 presented a strategy to investigate the localized thermal lateral buckling of pipelines whereupon the constitutive relations were derived for thermal stress and finite strain based on a hyper elastic constitutive model and researched the overall critical pipeline length above which localized buckling remains unchanged xu et al xu and lin 2016 combined the effects of the imperfection length of the out of straightness the pipeline bending stiffness and the vertical distributed force to derive a formula of the critical axial force and determined coefficients afterwards long distance free spanning pipelines on an uneven seabed were analyzed through the incorporation of finite element method and a dynamic contacting scheme was conducted to model variations of the contact situation between the seabed and the pipeline xu and lin 2017 mondal et al mondal and dhar 2017 used the finite element method to investigate the effects of different parameters on the global buckling of pipelines and derived a diagram for the size of the initial imperfections that resist buckling of pipelines under different temperatures and pressures zhang et al zhang et al 2018a 2018b zhang and xie 2018 studied the buckling failure of a buried pipeline subjected to ground explosions however according the above literature reviews no investigations have been reported for the buckling of pipelines on sunken seabed with initial topographic imperfections this study shows that the thermal upheaval buckling of submarine pipelines under the ht hp is the main failure mode the main objective is to provide a numerically prediction on pipe soil coupling for submarine pipelines on submarine pit or trench the distribution of the stresses strains and buckling deformation of the pipeline that is laid down on the seabed with different surface conditions namely pit and trench type have been estimated by the dynamic finite element solution considering the temperature and pressure load pipe diameter thickness ratio and seabed friction condition generally this study may provide some theoretical guidelines and suggestions to predict and reduce the risk of the pipeline buckling phenomenon in practice 2 theoretical analytical method under the action of ht hp the thermal vertical buckling of submarine pipelines can occur on the sunken seabed so the deformation and load distribution are shown in fig 1 y axis can be defined by the symmetrical axis of pipeline s deformation and x axis can be defined by the direction of pipeline based on the study of thermal lateral buckling of pipelines by liu liu et al 2014b the thermal vertical buckling of pipelines was described by the energy method the theoretical analytical method of thermal vertical buckling of submarine pipelines is studied in order to compare it with the results of numerical simulation and to verify the reliability and accuracy of the numerical simulation method of the abaqus explicit due to symmetrical only half of the pipeline was investigated in the research kerr 1978 the point a and a in fig 1 are the connection point between the buckling section and the non buckling section of the pipeline and the vertical displacement is assumed to be zero the point b and b are the connection point of the upward buckling and downward buckling of the pipeline assuming that its vertical displacement is also zero in addition f a is the axial friction produced by the outer surface of pipeline and the upper surface of seabed and q is submerged weight of pipeline per unit length aa is defined as the buckling section while the rest is defined as the non buckling section ab bb and ba are assumed the left section mid section and right section respectively due to the theory of work and energy the work done by the external loads is equal to the elastic strain energy which

the submarine pipeline is 8 7 km which has been laid in bohai and the pipeline length of 200 m is extracted in the analysis based on a preliminary study karampour et al 2013 xu and lin 2016 liu et al 2014b proposing that the length is adequate for the analysis of the vertical buckling because it can show a complete state of buckling and deformation moreover the seabed length is 200 m the seabed width is 8 m the seabed depth is 2 m the sunken depth of the seabed is 0 2 m and the sunken length of the seabed is 20 m the pipeline is installed on the seabed at the depth of 76 m below the water surface the material specification of the pipeline is api 5l x65 the stress strain curve of the pipeline is shown in fig 2 and the yield stress is 448 mpa zhang et al 2015 the pipeline parameters of the physical and material are shown in table 1 the initial temperature is 5 c and the product temperature is 90 c the internal pressure is 20 mpa acting on the inner wall of the pipeline the properties of the subsoil are shown in table 2 and the mohr coulomb model in abaqus is utilized to simulate the vertical buckling in addition the physical and material parameters of the subsoil are taken from the bohai sea and it is the mucky silty clay so the internal friction angle is 18 6 and the cohesive is 18 kpa liu et al 2014a 2015 the lateral friction coefficient is 0 5 and the axial friction coefficient is 0 5 3 2 explicit dynamic method given the fact that pipeline buckling itself is a dynamic case simply non linear static analysis is applicable not because the static method is difficult to converge and the dynamic characteristic of the pipeline buckling process cannot be obtained therefore this paper chooses dynamic method the abaqus includes the explicit dynamic method and the implicit dynamic method implicit time integral is used in the implicit dynamic method and the size of time step is calculated automatically by the algorithm a great deal of computing resources are invested in the moment of buckling and the stress state of the pipeline buckling can be obtained accurately however the calculation accuracy is reduced after entering the post buckling state relatively the calculation accuracy of the explicit dynamic method is related to the total calculation time and the same accuracy can be maintained in both the instantaneous and post buckling process of the pipeline buckling this means that the explicit dynamic method is more efficient than the implicit dynamic method in each incremental step liu et al 2014a in this paper the stress state of pipeline from buckling to post buckling is studied so it is necessary to maintain the same calculation precision therefore the explicit dynamic method has been used to simulate the buckling of submarine pipeline 3 3 finite element models according to dnv rp f110 2007 dnv rp f110 2007 there are two ways to simulate vertical buckling of submarine pipeline one is applying the trigging force another is setting the initial geometric imperfections in this paper the initial imperfections of seabed are conducted to research the thermal vertical buckling the thermal vertical buckling of the surface laid submarine pipeline on the sunken seabed is simulated by two analytical steps simulating the interaction between the pipeline and seabed with initial sunken imperfections under the action of gravity and to produce the free span is the first analytical step simulating the thermal vertical buckling of the free spanning submarine pipeline under the ht hp is the second analytical step in addition the temperature load is applied on the shell elements of the pipeline and the pressure load is applied on the inner wall of the pipeline considering the nonlinear large deformation of the pipeline the explicit incremental dynamic analysis is conducted by using the global stable incremental step in the numerical finite element model the contact element is utilized to simulate the interaction between pipeline and seabed and the contact type is dynamic and surface to surface contact in the selection of contact surfaces the main surface is the outer surface of the pipeline and the subordinate surface is the upper surface of the seabed the limited slip method is utilized to trace the relative deformation on the contact surfaces moreover the hard contact is applied to simulate the normal friction behavior of pipeline and seabed and the penalty function is applied to simulate the tangential friction behavior of pipeline and seabed due to only one part of the subsoil and the submarine pipeline are selected in the numerical simulation two ends of the pipeline are bound and restrained by the pipeline connected to it and the soil is constrained by the surrounding subsoil in this analysis the bottom of the subsoil and the ends of the pipeline are fixed the parameters in tables 1 and 2 are selected to establish the finite element models according to the sunken seabed there are many sunken areas which are pit or trench leading to a drop in the seabed and causing the pipeline to span so the initial sunken imperfections are directly introduced into the seabed models the sheathing on pipeline is not discussed in this paper the seabed is extended sufficiently along the transverse direction to avoid the effect of boundary condition the seabed model of submarine trench is shown in fig 3 a and the seabed model of submarine pit is shown in fig 3 b where l is the seabed length b is the seabed width h is the seabed depth h is the sunken depth of the seabed and l is the sunken length of the seabed on the submarine pit the pipeline contacts with the pit to suppress the downward buckling deformation of the pipeline however in the submarine trench there is no contact between the pipeline and the trench so the pipeline will have a downward buckling deformation the hexahedral elements c3d8r are selected for the seabed and the mohr coulomb model is used to account for the soil plasticity and is utilized for stress strain relationship in addition the submarine pipeline model uses the shell elements s4r and follows the simpson integral criterion in order to make the results more accurate the grids are refined in the contact regions and the main deformation regions as can be seen from table 3 the buckling displacement and maximum stress of the pipeline are most stable and suitable when the mesh number is 18400 for the pipeline in this paper 3 4 model verification the numerical results of the thermal vertical buckling of the submarine pipelines in this paper are compared with the different studies to verify the accuracy comparison of buckling displacement and temperature of idealized straight pipelines in the different studies is shown in fig 4 hobbs 1984 summarized the results of the lateral buckling mode calculations for an idealized pipeline and liu liu et al 2014b introduced the energy method to deduce the analytical solution of the lateral buckling mode of an idealized pipeline the shape of the curves in fig 4 presents the shape u and the lowest point of the curves is the safe temperature or lower limit for the temperature when the pipeline has no initial imperfections or small initial imperfections the buckling of the pipeline is equivalent to the branch point stability problem of the compression rod stability problem liu et al 2005 the relationships between the buckling displacement and the temperature of the pipeline accord with the variation law of the left section of the curves the buckling displacement in the pipeline decreases continuously with the increase of the temperature but the stress in the pipeline increases with it when the pipeline has large initial imperfections the buckling of the pipeline is equivalent to the problem of extreme point stability the relationships between the buckling displacement and the temperature of the pipeline conform to the law of variation of the right section of the curves a wide range of vertical buckling displacement and even failure occur in the pipeline with the increase of the temperature the numerical result of this paper presented in fig 4 agree with the initial declining part of the temperature versus buckling displacement curve presented by both hobbs and liu and the overall trend of the curves is the same the lowest point of the curves is the safe temperature which are almost the same the thermal vertical buckling do not occur when the product temperature of pipeline is below the safe temperature comparison of buckling displacement and temperature of imperfect pipelines in the different studies is shown in fig 5 taylor taylor and gan 1986a presented a set of analyses for an imperfect pipeline which incorporate initial imperfections and deformation dependent axial friction resistance the selection of the imperfect pipeline with initial imperfection of 0 007 is compared with the numerical results in this paper due to the models are built in different analytic ways the way of taylor is lateral buckling and this paper is vertical buckling consequently the temperature at which buckling occurs is almost the same but the final buckling height is different which is also related to the size of the initial imperfection introduced between the results obtained by the idealized straight pipeline in fig 4 or imperfect pipeline in fig 5 are different because the analytical solution is derived from the simplified hypotheses however the results obtained by the finite element method and the analytical method are comparable to those of the thermal vertical buckling displacement and temperature of pipeline due to these methods have consistent assumptions therefore the finite element method is reliable to simulate the thermal vertical buckling of submarine pipelines in this paper 4 simulation results 4 1 pipeline deformation the thermal vertical buckling of the surface laid submarine pipeline on the sunken seabed is simulated and the deformations of pipeline are presented in fig 6 and fig 7 the interaction between the submarine pipeline and seabed with initial sunken imperfections under the action of gravity and to produce the free span is shown in figs 6 d and fig 7 d which is the first analytical step in addition fig 6 e is the partial enlarged figure of fig 6 d laying on submarine pit and fig 7 e is the partial enlarged figure of fig 7 d laying on submarine trench respectively the thermal vertical buckling of the surface laid submarine pipeline under the ht hp are shown in figs 6 c and fig 7 c which is the second analytical step furthermore fig 6 a is the partial enlarged figure of fig 6 c buckling on submarine pit and the mises stress of pipeline at different temperatures is shown in fig 6 b in the same way fig 7 a is the partial enlarged figure of fig 7 c buckling on submarine trench and the mises stress of pipeline at different temperatures is shown in fig 7 b the variation trends of thermal vertical buckling are the same in the pit or in the trench and the third order mode will be formed finally 4 2 pipeline stress the stress state of the pipeline is the direct factor to determine whether the pipeline will yield or not the circumferential stress of buckling pipeline in mid section on submarine pit at different temperatures is shown in fig 8 with the increase of temperature the circumferential stress of the pipeline increases first and then decreases and the shape of the curve changes from the initial shape of circle at 5 c to the shape of 8 at 90 c it shows that the stress at the bottom and top regions of the pipeline in mid section increases sharply but the stress on the left and right side hardly changes the five cloud diagrams of stress also directly reflect the distribution and variation of the circumferential stress in the mid section of the pipeline obviously the top and bottom regions are yellow or red with greater stress while the left and right sides are blue or green with less stress in the same way the circumferential stress in left section at different temperatures is presented in fig 9 due to the buckling deformation of the pipeline is symmetrical and the left section is the same as the right section only the left section was discussed the circumferential stress increases with the increase of temperature and the shape of the curve gradually changes from the original shape of inverted 8 at 5 cto the shape of arrowhead at 90 c apparently the stress on the left and right side of the pipeline in left section hardly changes but the stress at the bottom and top regions increases sharply which is same in the cloud diagrams in addition the maximum circumferential stress in mid section on submarine pit is 390 mpa at 77 25 c at the top region of the pipeline and the maximum circumferential stress in left section on submarine pit is 303 mpa at 90 c at the lower left and lower right regions of the pipeline obviously the circumferential stress in mid section is larger than in left section the circumferential stress of buckling pipeline in mid section on submarine trench at different temperatures is shown in fig 10 with the increase of temperature the circumferential stress of the pipeline increases gradually and the shape of the curve changes from the initial shape of oval at 5 c to the shape of circle at 90 c it shows that the stress at the top region of the pipeline in mid section increases sharply but the stress on the bottom region changes little which is same in the cloud diagrams in the same way the circumferential stress in left section at different temperatures is presented in fig 11 the circumferential stress increases with the increase of temperature and the shape of the curve gradually changes from the original shape of inverted 8 at 5 cto the shape of heart at 90 c obviously the whole change of the pipeline stress in left section is more uniform in addition the maximum circumferential stress in mid section on submarine trench is 325 mpa at 90 c at the top region of the pipeline and the maximum circumferential stress in left section on submarine trench is 287 mpa at 90 c at the lower left and lower right regions of the pipeline apparently the circumferential stress in mid section is larger than in left section 4 3 pipeline strain the circumferential strain of buckling pipeline in mid section on submarine pit at different temperatures is shown in fig 12 with the increase of temperature the circumferential strain of the pipeline increases first and then decreases and the shape of the curve changes from the initial shape of circle at 5 c to the shape of oval at 90 c it shows that the strain at the bottom region of the pipeline in mid section increases sharply but the strain on the left and right sides changes little which is same in the cloud diagrams in the same way the circumferential strain in left section at different temperatures is presented in fig 13 the circumferential strain increases with the increase of temperature and the shape of the curve gradually changes from the original shape of inverted 8 at 5 cto the shape of arrowhead at 90 c obviously the whole change of the pipeline strain in left section is more uniform in addition the maximum circumferential strain in mid section on submarine pit is 0 00244 at 77 25 c at the bottom region of the pipeline and the maximum circumferential strain in left section on submarine pit is 0 00228 at 90 c at the top region of the pipeline apparently the circumferential strain in mid section is larger than in left section the circumferential strain of buckling pipeline in mid section on submarine trench at different temperatures is plotted in fig 14 with the increase of temperature the circumferential strain of the pipeline gradually increases and the shape of the curve changes from the initial shape of oval at 5 c to the shape of circle at 90 c it shows that the whole change of the pipeline strain in left section is more uniform which is same in the cloud diagrams in the same way the circumferential strain in left section at different temperatures is displayed in fig 15 the circumferential strain increases with the increase of temperature and the shape of the curve gradually changes from the original shape of inverted 8 at 5 cto the shape of heart at 90 c obviously the whole change of the pipeline strain in left section is more uniform in addition the maximum circumferential strain in mid section on submarine trench is 0 00192 at 77 25 c at the bottom region of the pipeline and the maximum circumferential strain in left section on submarine trench is 0 00203 at 90 c at the top region of the pipeline apparently the circumferential strain in mid section is smaller than in left section 5 results and discussions 5 1 pipeline temperature effect the buckling height of pipeline on submarine pit at different temperatures t is shown in fig 16 the buckling height and buckling length increases with the increase of t the buckling height and buckling length hardly changes before 22 c but increases sharply after 22 c afterwards the mid section of the pipeline gradually drops after 22 c and touches the bottom of the submarine pit at 60 25 c then the pipeline rises upward under the counteraction of the pit to the pipeline besides the left section and right section of the pipeline deform upward after 22 c and reach the maximum at 90 c which is 1 46 m the maximum of buckling length is 104 m at 90 c finally the thermal vertical buckling of the pipeline is deformed to the shape of the third order buckling mode moreover the mises stress of pipeline on submarine pit at different t is plotted in fig 17 the changes of stress are concentrated in the buckling section and the stress in the non buckling section is almost stable in the non buckling section the stress increases with the increase of t before 60 25 c then the stress decreases and becomes a constant value after 60 25 c in the buckling section an anomalous drop of the stress occurs in the mid section of the pipeline because of the interaction between the pipeline and submarine pit at 60 25 c finally the maximum of stress is 390 mpa at 77 25 c in the mid section of the pipeline the buckling height of pipeline on submarine trench at different t is presented in fig 18 the buckling height and buckling length increases with the increase of t the buckling length hardly changes before 77 25 c but increases dramatically after 77 25 c the maximum of buckling length is 37 6 m and the maximum of buckling height is 4 75 cm at 90 c finally the thermal vertical buckling of the pipeline is also deformed to the shape of the third order buckling mode due to the submarine trench the pipeline and the submarine trench are not in contact so abnormal stress don t happen moreover the mises stress of pipeline on submarine trench at different t is shown in fig 19 both the buckling and non buckling sections change with t the higher the temperature the greater the stress finally the maximum of stress is 322 mpa at 90 c in the mid section of the pipeline 5 2 pipeline pressure effect the buckling height of pipeline on submarine pit at different pressures is shown in fig 20 as the pressure increases the buckling height and buckling length equably increase the buckling height increases from the initial 1 19 m at 0 mpa to 1 53 m at 30 mpa moreover the buckling length increases from the initial 96 m 112 m which can be seen from the partial enlarged figure in fig 20 in addition the mises stress of pipeline on submarine pit at different pressures is presented in fig 21 regardless of the buckling section or the non buckling section the stress increases with the increase of the pressure but when it approaches the 100 m which is the mid section of the pipeline the stress shows an abnormal change and decreases with the increase of the pressure apparently when the pressure is less than 10 mpa the maximum stress occurs in the middle section of the pipeline and after 10 mpa the maximum stress shifts to both sides the maximum stress changes from 360 mpa to 284 mpa because the upward deformation of the left section of the pipeline is far greater than the mid section and suppresses the deformation of the mid section the stress in the middle section is released and reduced the buckling height of pipeline on submarine trench at different pressures is plotted in fig 22 the buckling height and buckling length increases with the increase of the pressure the variation of buckling length is reflected in fig 22 a and increases from the initial 32 m at 0 mpa to 40 m at 20 mpa the buckling height changes from 0 5 cm to 4 745 cm afterwards the mises stress of pipeline on submarine trench at different pressures is displayed in fig 23 the stress equably increases with the increase of the pressure the maximum stress changes from 230 mpa to 322 mpa in mid section of the pipeline 5 3 diameter thick ratio effect the buckling height of pipeline on submarine pit at different diameter thick ratios d t is presented in fig 24 the buckling height and buckling length equably enlarge accompanied by the increase of d t however when it approaches the 100 m which is the mid section of the pipeline the buckling height shows an abnormal decreases with the increase of d t because of the section size of the pipeline changes furthermore the buckling height increases from the initial 1 39 m when d t is 10 to 1 52 m when d t is 20 the buckling length increases from the initial 108 m to the 116 m which can be seen from the partial enlarged figure in fig 24 the mises stress of pipeline on submarine pit at different d t is plotted in fig 25 the stress gradually enlarges accompanied by the increase of d t both in the buckling section and the non buckling section obviously the maximum stress occurs in the mid section of the pipeline when d t is less than 13 and the maximum stress shifts to both sides when d t is more than 13 however the stress is very close to the left section or in the mid section the buckling height of pipeline on submarine trench at different d t is shown in fig 26 the buckling length does not change obviously but the buckling height increases with the increase of d t in fig 26 a the buckling height changes from the initial 4 707 cm when d t is 10 to 4 874 cm when d t is 20 and the buckling length is 38 m moreover the mises stress of pipeline on submarine trench at different d t is displayed in fig 27 the stress gradually enlarges accompanied by the increase of d t and the maximum stress changes from 317 mpa to 376 mpa 5 4 friction coefficient effect the axial friction hinders the thermal expansion of the pipeline in the axial direction and causes the vertical buckling problem as evaluated by hobbs 1981 the practical range of the friction coefficient is 0 3 0 7 however friction in reality is much more complex and impacted by many factors in this research the friction coefficient from 0 1 to 1 is discussed the buckling height of pipeline on submarine pit at different friction coefficients f is displayed in fig 28 the change of buckling length and buckling height is unconspicuous with the increase of f form fig 28 a and b the buckling length and height decreases with the increase of f due to the buckling deformation of pipeline is restrained by the increase of axial friction force moreover the maximum buckling height decreases from the initial 1 473 m when f is 0 1 to 1 441 m when f is 1 the mises stress of pipeline on submarine pit at different f is presented in fig 29 the change of stress is also not obvious with the increase of f form fig 29 a and b the stress decreases with the increase of f and the maximum stress decreases from the initial 272 41 mpa 271 39 mpa in addition the buckling height of pipeline on submarine trench at different f is shown in fig 30 when f is greater than 0 3 the buckling height and length does not change obviously but when f is less than 0 3 the buckling height and length increases sharply especially when f is 0 1 the buckling deformation changes from third order mode to fifth order because the axial friction cannot balance the thermal axial force of the pipeline the maximum buckling height changes from the initial 4 67 m when f is 0 1 to 6 m when f is 1 afterwards the mises stress of pipeline on submarine trench at different f is plotted in fig 31 form fig 31 a and b the maximum stress increases from the initial 331 2 mpa 320 4 mpa 5 5 submarine pit effect on the submarine pit the pipeline contacts with the pit to suppress the downward buckling deformation of the pipeline however in the submarine trench there is no contact between the pipeline and the trench so the pipeline will have a downward buckling deformation the buckling height of pipeline at different lengths of submarine pit is shown in fig 32 with the increase of the pit length the buckling height changes little and the buckling length gradually increases the maximum buckling height increases from the initial 1 424 m when the pit length is 16 m to 1 48 m when the pit length is 26 m and the maximum buckling length increases from 96 m to 116 m afterwards the buckling height of pipeline at different depths of submarine pit is plotted in fig 33 the stress obviously increases with the increase of the pit length when the pit length is less than 20 m the maximum stress appears in the left section of the pipeline while the maximum stress shifts in the mid section when the pit length grows up to 20 m the buckling height of pipeline at different depths of submarine pit is presented in fig 34 with the increase of the pit depth the buckling height decreases and the buckling length enlarges because with the increase of pit depth the buckling deformation of the pipeline can transfer downward the maximum buckling height decreases from 1 457 m to 1 182 m and the maximum buckling length increases from 108 m to 120 m the mises stress of pipeline at different depths of submarine pit is displayed in fig 35 with the increase of the pit depth the stress increases in the mid section and decreases in the left section the maximum stress increases from 266 mpa to 349 mpa 5 6 submarine trench effect as the depth of the submarine pit increases when the bottom of the pit and the pipeline are not in contact the shape of seabed is assumed to be trench the buckling height of pipeline at different lengths of submarine trench is shown in fig 36 as the increase of trench length the buckling height increases sharply but the buckling length does not change obviously the maximum buckling length increases from the initial 36 m when the trench length is 10 m to 46 m when the trench length is 10 4 m in the left section of the pipeline the maximum buckling height changes from 4 75 m to 28 91 m in the mid section the maximum buckling height increases from 1 77 m to 22 05 m the mises stress of pipeline at different lengths of submarine trench is presented in fig 37 with the increase of the length of the trench the stress decreases gradually in the non buckling section but the change of stress is much more intense in the buckling section the maximum stress increases from 322 mpa to 670 mpa when the trench length grows before 10 2 m the pipeline has already yielded in the thermal vertical buckling because the buckling section of the pipeline is not constrained by the seabed the pipeline is extremely vulnerable to damage on the trench 6 conclusions the energy method was used to analyze and derive the relationship between the temperature and the buckling height during the thermal vertical buckling of the third order mode of pipeline and the finite element method was utilized to model and simulate the pipeline on submarine pit and trench respectively on submarine pit the maximum circumferential stress and strain in mid section of pipelines are larger than in left section on submarine trench the maximum circumferential stress in mid section is larger than in left section but the maximum circumferential strain in mid section is smaller than in left section the temperature and pressure are the most important factors affecting the vertical buckling of pipelines the buckling height and length sharply increases with the increase of temperature or pressure whether on submarine pit or trench with the increase of temperature the stress of pipelines increases first and then decreases on pit but always enlarges on trench with the increase of pressure the stress of pipelines increases on trench and the stress of pipelines in left section increases but in the mid section decreases the length and depth of submarine pit and trench directly affect the shape of pipelines and size of the initial sunken imperfection the friction coefficient has little effect on the buckling length height and stress and the buckling deformation changes from third order mode to fifth order because the axial friction cannot balance the thermal axial force if the friction coefficient is too small the buckling height length and stress enlarges accompanied by the increase of diameter thick ratio of pipelines and reducing the diameter thick ratio in practice can effectively strengthen the ability of pipeline to resist buckling acknowledgment this work is supported by scientific research starting project of swpu no 2017qhz011 state key laboratory for strength and vibration of mechanical structures

22995,submarine pipelines are the most viable way for transporting offshore oil and gas worldwide however it is easy to cause the vertical buckling in the process of work under the high temperature and high pressure in this paper the energy method was used to analyze and derive the relationship between the temperature and the buckling height during the thermal vertical buckling of the third order mode of pipeline additionally the finite element method was utilized to model and simulate the pipeline on submarine pit and trench respectively from this investigation it is found that the maximum circumferential stress and strain in mid section of pipelines are larger than in left section on submarine pit on submarine trench the maximum circumferential stress in mid section is larger than in left section but the maximum circumferential strain in mid section is smaller than in left section the buckling height and length sharply increases with the increase of temperature or pressure whether on submarine pit or trench with the increase of temperature the stress of pipelines increases first and then decreases on pit but always enlarges on trench with the increase of pressure the stress of pipelines increases on trench and the stress of pipelines in left section increases but in the mid section decreases the length and depth of submarine pit and trench directly affect the shape of pipelines and size of the initial sunken imperfection the friction coefficient has little effect on the buckling length height and stress and the buckling deformation changes from third order mode to fifth order because the axial friction cannot balance the thermal axial force if the friction coefficient is too small the buckling height length and stress enlarges accompanied by the increase of diameter thick ratio of pipelines and reducing the diameter thick ratio in practice can effectively strengthen the ability of pipeline to resist buckling keywords submarine pipeline thermal stress vertical bucking sunken seabed surface laid numerical simulation 1 introduction submarine pipelines are the most viable way for transporting offshore oil and gas worldwide in virtue of the requirements of the production process submarine pipelines which are being used for transporting oil and gas need to be applied to high temperature and high pressure ht hp so the thermal loading and internal pressure of submarine pipe wall bring the massive subsidiary stress due to pipelines are constrained by sea floor relief and pipe soil friction it is not free to release this subsidiary stress with the length of pipelines increasing the subsidiary stress in pipelines accumulates continuously when the value of subsidiary stress exceeds the seabed friction on pipelines pipelines will buckle suddenly and the deformation of the subsidiary stress to be released which happen under the action of axial loading instability when vertical buckling of pipelines occurs pipelines will have large stress strain and plastic deformation and even further local buckling fatigue or propagation buckling albermani et al 2011a as pipelines carrying a large number of offshore oil and gas thermal vertical buckling and even yield failure will lead to oil and gas leakage which not only causes waste of resources but also poses a threat to the living environment of human beings and marine organisms therefore the study of the thermal vertical buckling process of submarine pipelines is of great significance for the laying safety evaluation and maintenance of submarine pipelines because of the limitation of the experiment conditions and size of the research object the field and laboratory tests of the thermal vertical buckling of submarine pipelines are few thus the main research methods are numerical simulation and theoretical research allan 1968 researched the sensitivity of the problem to initial imperfections and conducted one of the first analytical and experimental studies on vertical buckling of an axially compressed frictionless strip kerr 1978 presented a number of studies which were motivated by lateral buckling of railway tracks tvergaard and needleman 1981 accounted for localized thermal track buckling and the nonlinear force displacement relationship of the track foundation hobbs 1984 first used the research results that were made by kerr on the global buckling specifically of pipelines and proposed the most widely accepted formulations about four classic modes of pipelines later both the buckling responses of perfect straight pipelines and theoretical solutions for vertical and lateral buckling of pipelines to cover plenty of practical cases also further studied by liang hobbs and liang 1989 and ballet ballet and hobbs 1992 previous attempts to model the appropriate behavior were based on perfect or idealized pipelines in the practical engineering of manufacturing process and laying of submarine pipelines on seabed local bending deformations due to uneven seabed or man made factors which is known as the initial imperfections will lead to installation of submarine pipelines not be straight on seabed taylor and gan 1984 focused on two pivotal factors before any formal non linear predictive analyses and considered a set of analyses which incorporate deformation dependent axial friction resistance and structural initial imperfections and elucidated an inherent limitation existing in the previous mathematical model of global buckling mode taylor and gan 1986a in addition both lateral taylor and gan 1986b and vertical taylor and gan 1987 deflection modes were analyzed and an analytical solution accounting for lateral and vertical buckling of pipelines with initial imperfections were discussed for a mathematical model in analysis relating to pipelines taylor and tran 1993 considered the horizontal and straight idealized pipelines that were interrupted by an encounter with an isolated point or prop imperfections irregularity and carried out series of experiments under the critical loads to derive mathematical models that account for the different imperfections taylor and tran 1996 however these studies did not take into account the effects of residual stress on critical buckling loads caused by initial imperfections in submarine pipelines croll 1997 elucidated the effects of residual stress and initial imperfections used the simplified calculation model to research upheaval buckling of pipelines and carried out the critical load formulas villarraga et al 2004 used the nonlinear finite element method to analyze stresses and displacements of buried pipelines with initial imperfections including both thermal expansion of the pipeline and internal pressure white and cheuk 2008 elucidated a simple framework which allowed existing pipe soil interaction models to be extended to obtain this large deformation behavior of pipelines using a kinematic hardening model and limited experimental data was currently available karampour et al albermani et al 2011b conducted experimental tests which used aluminum and steel sample pipes with different diameter thick ratios to determine buckling initiation and buckling propagation pressures in hyperbaric chamber based on an isolated half wavelength model for lateral buckling numerical and analytical researches were established and a novel interpretation of localization was revealed and based on a long heavy elastic beam resting on a rigid frictional foundation for upheaval buckling a tabulated analytical solution was determined karampour et al 2013 experimental results for buckling propagation and pure bending of submarine pipelines were determined first that followed by buckling interaction results which highlighted the vulnerability of pipelines to buckling interaction particularly karampour and albermani 2014 peng et al 2013 designed two scaled pipeline models with different boundary conditions that were subjected to random wave forces in a large wave tank using waterproof accelerometers to study the pipeline structural response liu et al 2014a conducted the explicit and implicit dynamic algorithms to respectively simulate the global buckling of pipelines in both 2d and 3d models and established a new method to introduce initial imperfections of pipelines later a series of vertical and axial pullout experiments were carried out on model pipe segments buried in soft clay and thermal upheaval buckling of pipelines operating at different temperatures were studied liu et al 2015 duan et al zeng and duan 2014 modeled the lateral buckling pipelines by an axial compressive beam that is supported by laterally distributed nonlinear springs taking the soil berm effects in the horizontal plane and concluded preliminarily that the model was governed by a time independent equation based on the finite element and dimensional analysis a series of new mathematical models were established for the critical axial forces zeng et al 2014 afterwards the finite element method was used to research the upheaval buckling behaviors of eight groups of pipelines with different out of straightness and a universal and approximate formula was proposed to calculate the critical axial force zhang and duan 2015 zhu et al 2015 presented a strategy to investigate the localized thermal lateral buckling of pipelines whereupon the constitutive relations were derived for thermal stress and finite strain based on a hyper elastic constitutive model and researched the overall critical pipeline length above which localized buckling remains unchanged xu et al xu and lin 2016 combined the effects of the imperfection length of the out of straightness the pipeline bending stiffness and the vertical distributed force to derive a formula of the critical axial force and determined coefficients afterwards long distance free spanning pipelines on an uneven seabed were analyzed through the incorporation of finite element method and a dynamic contacting scheme was conducted to model variations of the contact situation between the seabed and the pipeline xu and lin 2017 mondal et al mondal and dhar 2017 used the finite element method to investigate the effects of different parameters on the global buckling of pipelines and derived a diagram for the size of the initial imperfections that resist buckling of pipelines under different temperatures and pressures zhang et al zhang et al 2018a 2018b zhang and xie 2018 studied the buckling failure of a buried pipeline subjected to ground explosions however according the above literature reviews no investigations have been reported for the buckling of pipelines on sunken seabed with initial topographic imperfections this study shows that the thermal upheaval buckling of submarine pipelines under the ht hp is the main failure mode the main objective is to provide a numerically prediction on pipe soil coupling for submarine pipelines on submarine pit or trench the distribution of the stresses strains and buckling deformation of the pipeline that is laid down on the seabed with different surface conditions namely pit and trench type have been estimated by the dynamic finite element solution considering the temperature and pressure load pipe diameter thickness ratio and seabed friction condition generally this study may provide some theoretical guidelines and suggestions to predict and reduce the risk of the pipeline buckling phenomenon in practice 2 theoretical analytical method under the action of ht hp the thermal vertical buckling of submarine pipelines can occur on the sunken seabed so the deformation and load distribution are shown in fig 1 y axis can be defined by the symmetrical axis of pipeline s deformation and x axis can be defined by the direction of pipeline based on the study of thermal lateral buckling of pipelines by liu liu et al 2014b the thermal vertical buckling of pipelines was described by the energy method the theoretical analytical method of thermal vertical buckling of submarine pipelines is studied in order to compare it with the results of numerical simulation and to verify the reliability and accuracy of the numerical simulation method of the abaqus explicit due to symmetrical only half of the pipeline was investigated in the research kerr 1978 the point a and a in fig 1 are the connection point between the buckling section and the non buckling section of the pipeline and the vertical displacement is assumed to be zero the point b and b are the connection point of the upward buckling and downward buckling of the pipeline assuming that its vertical displacement is also zero in addition f a is the axial friction produced by the outer surface of pipeline and the upper surface of seabed and q is submerged weight of pipeline per unit length aa is defined as the buckling section while the rest is defined as the non buckling section ab bb and ba are assumed the left section mid section and right section respectively due to the theory of work and energy the work done by the external loads is equal to the elastic strain energy which

the submarine pipeline is 8 7 km which has been laid in bohai and the pipeline length of 200 m is extracted in the analysis based on a preliminary study karampour et al 2013 xu and lin 2016 liu et al 2014b proposing that the length is adequate for the analysis of the vertical buckling because it can show a complete state of buckling and deformation moreover the seabed length is 200 m the seabed width is 8 m the seabed depth is 2 m the sunken depth of the seabed is 0 2 m and the sunken length of the seabed is 20 m the pipeline is installed on the seabed at the depth of 76 m below the water surface the material specification of the pipeline is api 5l x65 the stress strain curve of the pipeline is shown in fig 2 and the yield stress is 448 mpa zhang et al 2015 the pipeline parameters of the physical and material are shown in table 1 the initial temperature is 5 c and the product temperature is 90 c the internal pressure is 20 mpa acting on the inner wall of the pipeline the properties of the subsoil are shown in table 2 and the mohr coulomb model in abaqus is utilized to simulate the vertical buckling in addition the physical and material parameters of the subsoil are taken from the bohai sea and it is the mucky silty clay so the internal friction angle is 18 6 and the cohesive is 18 kpa liu et al 2014a 2015 the lateral friction coefficient is 0 5 and the axial friction coefficient is 0 5 3 2 explicit dynamic method given the fact that pipeline buckling itself is a dynamic case simply non linear static analysis is applicable not because the static method is difficult to converge and the dynamic characteristic of the pipeline buckling process cannot be obtained therefore this paper chooses dynamic method the abaqus includes the explicit dynamic method and the implicit dynamic method implicit time integral is used in the implicit dynamic method and the size of time step is calculated automatically by the algorithm a great deal of computing resources are invested in the moment of buckling and the stress state of the pipeline buckling can be obtained accurately however the calculation accuracy is reduced after entering the post buckling state relatively the calculation accuracy of the explicit dynamic method is related to the total calculation time and the same accuracy can be maintained in both the instantaneous and post buckling process of the pipeline buckling this means that the explicit dynamic method is more efficient than the implicit dynamic method in each incremental step liu et al 2014a in this paper the stress state of pipeline from buckling to post buckling is studied so it is necessary to maintain the same calculation precision therefore the explicit dynamic method has been used to simulate the buckling of submarine pipeline 3 3 finite element models according to dnv rp f110 2007 dnv rp f110 2007 there are two ways to simulate vertical buckling of submarine pipeline one is applying the trigging force another is setting the initial geometric imperfections in this paper the initial imperfections of seabed are conducted to research the thermal vertical buckling the thermal vertical buckling of the surface laid submarine pipeline on the sunken seabed is simulated by two analytical steps simulating the interaction between the pipeline and seabed with initial sunken imperfections under the action of gravity and to produce the free span is the first analytical step simulating the thermal vertical buckling of the free spanning submarine pipeline under the ht hp is the second analytical step in addition the temperature load is applied on the shell elements of the pipeline and the pressure load is applied on the inner wall of the pipeline considering the nonlinear large deformation of the pipeline the explicit incremental dynamic analysis is conducted by using the global stable incremental step in the numerical finite element model the contact element is utilized to simulate the interaction between pipeline and seabed and the contact type is dynamic and surface to surface contact in the selection of contact surfaces the main surface is the outer surface of the pipeline and the subordinate surface is the upper surface of the seabed the limited slip method is utilized to trace the relative deformation on the contact surfaces moreover the hard contact is applied to simulate the normal friction behavior of pipeline and seabed and the penalty function is applied to simulate the tangential friction behavior of pipeline and seabed due to only one part of the subsoil and the submarine pipeline are selected in the numerical simulation two ends of the pipeline are bound and restrained by the pipeline connected to it and the soil is constrained by the surrounding subsoil in this analysis the bottom of the subsoil and the ends of the pipeline are fixed the parameters in tables 1 and 2 are selected to establish the finite element models according to the sunken seabed there are many sunken areas which are pit or trench leading to a drop in the seabed and causing the pipeline to span so the initial sunken imperfections are directly introduced into the seabed models the sheathing on pipeline is not discussed in this paper the seabed is extended sufficiently along the transverse direction to avoid the effect of boundary condition the seabed model of submarine trench is shown in fig 3 a and the seabed model of submarine pit is shown in fig 3 b where l is the seabed length b is the seabed width h is the seabed depth h is the sunken depth of the seabed and l is the sunken length of the seabed on the submarine pit the pipeline contacts with the pit to suppress the downward buckling deformation of the pipeline however in the submarine trench there is no contact between the pipeline and the trench so the pipeline will have a downward buckling deformation the hexahedral elements c3d8r are selected for the seabed and the mohr coulomb model is used to account for the soil plasticity and is utilized for stress strain relationship in addition the submarine pipeline model uses the shell elements s4r and follows the simpson integral criterion in order to make the results more accurate the grids are refined in the contact regions and the main deformation regions as can be seen from table 3 the buckling displacement and maximum stress of the pipeline are most stable and suitable when the mesh number is 18400 for the pipeline in this paper 3 4 model verification the numerical results of the thermal vertical buckling of the submarine pipelines in this paper are compared with the different studies to verify the accuracy comparison of buckling displacement and temperature of idealized straight pipelines in the different studies is shown in fig 4 hobbs 1984 summarized the results of the lateral buckling mode calculations for an idealized pipeline and liu liu et al 2014b introduced the energy method to deduce the analytical solution of the lateral buckling mode of an idealized pipeline the shape of the curves in fig 4 presents the shape u and the lowest point of the curves is the safe temperature or lower limit for the temperature when the pipeline has no initial imperfections or small initial imperfections the buckling of the pipeline is equivalent to the branch point stability problem of the compression rod stability problem liu et al 2005 the relationships between the buckling displacement and the temperature of the pipeline accord with the variation law of the left section of the curves the buckling displacement in the pipeline decreases continuously with the increase of the temperature but the stress in the pipeline increases with it when the pipeline has large initial imperfections the buckling of the pipeline is equivalent to the problem of extreme point stability the relationships between the buckling displacement and the temperature of the pipeline conform to the law of variation of the right section of the curves a wide range of vertical buckling displacement and even failure occur in the pipeline with the increase of the temperature the numerical result of this paper presented in fig 4 agree with the initial declining part of the temperature versus buckling displacement curve presented by both hobbs and liu and the overall trend of the curves is the same the lowest point of the curves is the safe temperature which are almost the same the thermal vertical buckling do not occur when the product temperature of pipeline is below the safe temperature comparison of buckling displacement and temperature of imperfect pipelines in the different studies is shown in fig 5 taylor taylor and gan 1986a presented a set of analyses for an imperfect pipeline which incorporate initial imperfections and deformation dependent axial friction resistance the selection of the imperfect pipeline with initial imperfection of 0 007 is compared with the numerical results in this paper due to the models are built in different analytic ways the way of taylor is lateral buckling and this paper is vertical buckling consequently the temperature at which buckling occurs is almost the same but the final buckling height is different which is also related to the size of the initial imperfection introduced between the results obtained by the idealized straight pipeline in fig 4 or imperfect pipeline in fig 5 are different because the analytical solution is derived from the simplified hypotheses however the results obtained by the finite element method and the analytical method are comparable to those of the thermal vertical buckling displacement and temperature of pipeline due to these methods have consistent assumptions therefore the finite element method is reliable to simulate the thermal vertical buckling of submarine pipelines in this paper 4 simulation results 4 1 pipeline deformation the thermal vertical buckling of the surface laid submarine pipeline on the sunken seabed is simulated and the deformations of pipeline are presented in fig 6 and fig 7 the interaction between the submarine pipeline and seabed with initial sunken imperfections under the action of gravity and to produce the free span is shown in figs 6 d and fig 7 d which is the first analytical step in addition fig 6 e is the partial enlarged figure of fig 6 d laying on submarine pit and fig 7 e is the partial enlarged figure of fig 7 d laying on submarine trench respectively the thermal vertical buckling of the surface laid submarine pipeline under the ht hp are shown in figs 6 c and fig 7 c which is the second analytical step furthermore fig 6 a is the partial enlarged figure of fig 6 c buckling on submarine pit and the mises stress of pipeline at different temperatures is shown in fig 6 b in the same way fig 7 a is the partial enlarged figure of fig 7 c buckling on submarine trench and the mises stress of pipeline at different temperatures is shown in fig 7 b the variation trends of thermal vertical buckling are the same in the pit or in the trench and the third order mode will be formed finally 4 2 pipeline stress the stress state of the pipeline is the direct factor to determine whether the pipeline will yield or not the circumferential stress of buckling pipeline in mid section on submarine pit at different temperatures is shown in fig 8 with the increase of temperature the circumferential stress of the pipeline increases first and then decreases and the shape of the curve changes from the initial shape of circle at 5 c to the shape of 8 at 90 c it shows that the stress at the bottom and top regions of the pipeline in mid section increases sharply but the stress on the left and right side hardly changes the five cloud diagrams of stress also directly reflect the distribution and variation of the circumferential stress in the mid section of the pipeline obviously the top and bottom regions are yellow or red with greater stress while the left and right sides are blue or green with less stress in the same way the circumferential stress in left section at different temperatures is presented in fig 9 due to the buckling deformation of the pipeline is symmetrical and the left section is the same as the right section only the left section was discussed the circumferential stress increases with the increase of temperature and the shape of the curve gradually changes from the original shape of inverted 8 at 5 cto the shape of arrowhead at 90 c apparently the stress on the left and right side of the pipeline in left section hardly changes but the stress at the bottom and top regions increases sharply which is same in the cloud diagrams in addition the maximum circumferential stress in mid section on submarine pit is 390 mpa at 77 25 c at the top region of the pipeline and the maximum circumferential stress in left section on submarine pit is 303 mpa at 90 c at the lower left and lower right regions of the pipeline obviously the circumferential stress in mid section is larger than in left section the circumferential stress of buckling pipeline in mid section on submarine trench at different temperatures is shown in fig 10 with the increase of temperature the circumferential stress of the pipeline increases gradually and the shape of the curve changes from the initial shape of oval at 5 c to the shape of circle at 90 c it shows that the stress at the top region of the pipeline in mid section increases sharply but the stress on the bottom region changes little which is same in the cloud diagrams in the same way the circumferential stress in left section at different temperatures is presented in fig 11 the circumferential stress increases with the increase of temperature and the shape of the curve gradually changes from the original shape of inverted 8 at 5 cto the shape of heart at 90 c obviously the whole change of the pipeline stress in left section is more uniform in addition the maximum circumferential stress in mid section on submarine trench is 325 mpa at 90 c at the top region of the pipeline and the maximum circumferential stress in left section on submarine trench is 287 mpa at 90 c at the lower left and lower right regions of the pipeline apparently the circumferential stress in mid section is larger than in left section 4 3 pipeline strain the circumferential strain of buckling pipeline in mid section on submarine pit at different temperatures is shown in fig 12 with the increase of temperature the circumferential strain of the pipeline increases first and then decreases and the shape of the curve changes from the initial shape of circle at 5 c to the shape of oval at 90 c it shows that the strain at the bottom region of the pipeline in mid section increases sharply but the strain on the left and right sides changes little which is same in the cloud diagrams in the same way the circumferential strain in left section at different temperatures is presented in fig 13 the circumferential strain increases with the increase of temperature and the shape of the curve gradually changes from the original shape of inverted 8 at 5 cto the shape of arrowhead at 90 c obviously the whole change of the pipeline strain in left section is more uniform in addition the maximum circumferential strain in mid section on submarine pit is 0 00244 at 77 25 c at the bottom region of the pipeline and the maximum circumferential strain in left section on submarine pit is 0 00228 at 90 c at the top region of the pipeline apparently the circumferential strain in mid section is larger than in left section the circumferential strain of buckling pipeline in mid section on submarine trench at different temperatures is plotted in fig 14 with the increase of temperature the circumferential strain of the pipeline gradually increases and the shape of the curve changes from the initial shape of oval at 5 c to the shape of circle at 90 c it shows that the whole change of the pipeline strain in left section is more uniform which is same in the cloud diagrams in the same way the circumferential strain in left section at different temperatures is displayed in fig 15 the circumferential strain increases with the increase of temperature and the shape of the curve gradually changes from the original shape of inverted 8 at 5 cto the shape of heart at 90 c obviously the whole change of the pipeline strain in left section is more uniform in addition the maximum circumferential strain in mid section on submarine trench is 0 00192 at 77 25 c at the bottom region of the pipeline and the maximum circumferential strain in left section on submarine trench is 0 00203 at 90 c at the top region of the pipeline apparently the circumferential strain in mid section is smaller than in left section 5 results and discussions 5 1 pipeline temperature effect the buckling height of pipeline on submarine pit at different temperatures t is shown in fig 16 the buckling height and buckling length increases with the increase of t the buckling height and buckling length hardly changes before 22 c but increases sharply after 22 c afterwards the mid section of the pipeline gradually drops after 22 c and touches the bottom of the submarine pit at 60 25 c then the pipeline rises upward under the counteraction of the pit to the pipeline besides the left section and right section of the pipeline deform upward after 22 c and reach the maximum at 90 c which is 1 46 m the maximum of buckling length is 104 m at 90 c finally the thermal vertical buckling of the pipeline is deformed to the shape of the third order buckling mode moreover the mises stress of pipeline on submarine pit at different t is plotted in fig 17 the changes of stress are concentrated in the buckling section and the stress in the non buckling section is almost stable in the non buckling section the stress increases with the increase of t before 60 25 c then the stress decreases and becomes a constant value after 60 25 c in the buckling section an anomalous drop of the stress occurs in the mid section of the pipeline because of the interaction between the pipeline and submarine pit at 60 25 c finally the maximum of stress is 390 mpa at 77 25 c in the mid section of the pipeline the buckling height of pipeline on submarine trench at different t is presented in fig 18 the buckling height and buckling length increases with the increase of t the buckling length hardly changes before 77 25 c but increases dramatically after 77 25 c the maximum of buckling length is 37 6 m and the maximum of buckling height is 4 75 cm at 90 c finally the thermal vertical buckling of the pipeline is also deformed to the shape of the third order buckling mode due to the submarine trench the pipeline and the submarine trench are not in contact so abnormal stress don t happen moreover the mises stress of pipeline on submarine trench at different t is shown in fig 19 both the buckling and non buckling sections change with t the higher the temperature the greater the stress finally the maximum of stress is 322 mpa at 90 c in the mid section of the pipeline 5 2 pipeline pressure effect the buckling height of pipeline on submarine pit at different pressures is shown in fig 20 as the pressure increases the buckling height and buckling length equably increase the buckling height increases from the initial 1 19 m at 0 mpa to 1 53 m at 30 mpa moreover the buckling length increases from the initial 96 m 112 m which can be seen from the partial enlarged figure in fig 20 in addition the mises stress of pipeline on submarine pit at different pressures is presented in fig 21 regardless of the buckling section or the non buckling section the stress increases with the increase of the pressure but when it approaches the 100 m which is the mid section of the pipeline the stress shows an abnormal change and decreases with the increase of the pressure apparently when the pressure is less than 10 mpa the maximum stress occurs in the middle section of the pipeline and after 10 mpa the maximum stress shifts to both sides the maximum stress changes from 360 mpa to 284 mpa because the upward deformation of the left section of the pipeline is far greater than the mid section and suppresses the deformation of the mid section the stress in the middle section is released and reduced the buckling height of pipeline on submarine trench at different pressures is plotted in fig 22 the buckling height and buckling length increases with the increase of the pressure the variation of buckling length is reflected in fig 22 a and increases from the initial 32 m at 0 mpa to 40 m at 20 mpa the buckling height changes from 0 5 cm to 4 745 cm afterwards the mises stress of pipeline on submarine trench at different pressures is displayed in fig 23 the stress equably increases with the increase of the pressure the maximum stress changes from 230 mpa to 322 mpa in mid section of the pipeline 5 3 diameter thick ratio effect the buckling height of pipeline on submarine pit at different diameter thick ratios d t is presented in fig 24 the buckling height and buckling length equably enlarge accompanied by the increase of d t however when it approaches the 100 m which is the mid section of the pipeline the buckling height shows an abnormal decreases with the increase of d t because of the section size of the pipeline changes furthermore the buckling height increases from the initial 1 39 m when d t is 10 to 1 52 m when d t is 20 the buckling length increases from the initial 108 m to the 116 m which can be seen from the partial enlarged figure in fig 24 the mises stress of pipeline on submarine pit at different d t is plotted in fig 25 the stress gradually enlarges accompanied by the increase of d t both in the buckling section and the non buckling section obviously the maximum stress occurs in the mid section of the pipeline when d t is less than 13 and the maximum stress shifts to both sides when d t is more than 13 however the stress is very close to the left section or in the mid section the buckling height of pipeline on submarine trench at different d t is shown in fig 26 the buckling length does not change obviously but the buckling height increases with the increase of d t in fig 26 a the buckling height changes from the initial 4 707 cm when d t is 10 to 4 874 cm when d t is 20 and the buckling length is 38 m moreover the mises stress of pipeline on submarine trench at different d t is displayed in fig 27 the stress gradually enlarges accompanied by the increase of d t and the maximum stress changes from 317 mpa to 376 mpa 5 4 friction coefficient effect the axial friction hinders the thermal expansion of the pipeline in the axial direction and causes the vertical buckling problem as evaluated by hobbs 1981 the practical range of the friction coefficient is 0 3 0 7 however friction in reality is much more complex and impacted by many factors in this research the friction coefficient from 0 1 to 1 is discussed the buckling height of pipeline on submarine pit at different friction coefficients f is displayed in fig 28 the change of buckling length and buckling height is unconspicuous with the increase of f form fig 28 a and b the buckling length and height decreases with the increase of f due to the buckling deformation of pipeline is restrained by the increase of axial friction force moreover the maximum buckling height decreases from the initial 1 473 m when f is 0 1 to 1 441 m when f is 1 the mises stress of pipeline on submarine pit at different f is presented in fig 29 the change of stress is also not obvious with the increase of f form fig 29 a and b the stress decreases with the increase of f and the maximum stress decreases from the initial 272 41 mpa 271 39 mpa in addition the buckling height of pipeline on submarine trench at different f is shown in fig 30 when f is greater than 0 3 the buckling height and length does not change obviously but when f is less than 0 3 the buckling height and length increases sharply especially when f is 0 1 the buckling deformation changes from third order mode to fifth order because the axial friction cannot balance the thermal axial force of the pipeline the maximum buckling height changes from the initial 4 67 m when f is 0 1 to 6 m when f is 1 afterwards the mises stress of pipeline on submarine trench at different f is plotted in fig 31 form fig 31 a and b the maximum stress increases from the initial 331 2 mpa 320 4 mpa 5 5 submarine pit effect on the submarine pit the pipeline contacts with the pit to suppress the downward buckling deformation of the pipeline however in the submarine trench there is no contact between the pipeline and the trench so the pipeline will have a downward buckling deformation the buckling height of pipeline at different lengths of submarine pit is shown in fig 32 with the increase of the pit length the buckling height changes little and the buckling length gradually increases the maximum buckling height increases from the initial 1 424 m when the pit length is 16 m to 1 48 m when the pit length is 26 m and the maximum buckling length increases from 96 m to 116 m afterwards the buckling height of pipeline at different depths of submarine pit is plotted in fig 33 the stress obviously increases with the increase of the pit length when the pit length is less than 20 m the maximum stress appears in the left section of the pipeline while the maximum stress shifts in the mid section when the pit length grows up to 20 m the buckling height of pipeline at different depths of submarine pit is presented in fig 34 with the increase of the pit depth the buckling height decreases and the buckling length enlarges because with the increase of pit depth the buckling deformation of the pipeline can transfer downward the maximum buckling height decreases from 1 457 m to 1 182 m and the maximum buckling length increases from 108 m to 120 m the mises stress of pipeline at different depths of submarine pit is displayed in fig 35 with the increase of the pit depth the stress increases in the mid section and decreases in the left section the maximum stress increases from 266 mpa to 349 mpa 5 6 submarine trench effect as the depth of the submarine pit increases when the bottom of the pit and the pipeline are not in contact the shape of seabed is assumed to be trench the buckling height of pipeline at different lengths of submarine trench is shown in fig 36 as the increase of trench length the buckling height increases sharply but the buckling length does not change obviously the maximum buckling length increases from the initial 36 m when the trench length is 10 m to 46 m when the trench length is 10 4 m in the left section of the pipeline the maximum buckling height changes from 4 75 m to 28 91 m in the mid section the maximum buckling height increases from 1 77 m to 22 05 m the mises stress of pipeline at different lengths of submarine trench is presented in fig 37 with the increase of the length of the trench the stress decreases gradually in the non buckling section but the change of stress is much more intense in the buckling section the maximum stress increases from 322 mpa to 670 mpa when the trench length grows before 10 2 m the pipeline has already yielded in the thermal vertical buckling because the buckling section of the pipeline is not constrained by the seabed the pipeline is extremely vulnerable to damage on the trench 6 conclusions the energy method was used to analyze and derive the relationship between the temperature and the buckling height during the thermal vertical buckling of the third order mode of pipeline and the finite element method was utilized to model and simulate the pipeline on submarine pit and trench respectively on submarine pit the maximum circumferential stress and strain in mid section of pipelines are larger than in left section on submarine trench the maximum circumferential stress in mid section is larger than in left section but the maximum circumferential strain in mid section is smaller than in left section the temperature and pressure are the most important factors affecting the vertical buckling of pipelines the buckling height and length sharply increases with the increase of temperature or pressure whether on submarine pit or trench with the increase of temperature the stress of pipelines increases first and then decreases on pit but always enlarges on trench with the increase of pressure the stress of pipelines increases on trench and the stress of pipelines in left section increases but in the mid section decreases the length and depth of submarine pit and trench directly affect the shape of pipelines and size of the initial sunken imperfection the friction coefficient has little effect on the buckling length height and stress and the buckling deformation changes from third order mode to fifth order because the axial friction cannot balance the thermal axial force if the friction coefficient is too small the buckling height length and stress enlarges accompanied by the increase of diameter thick ratio of pipelines and reducing the diameter thick ratio in practice can effectively strengthen the ability of pipeline to resist buckling acknowledgment this work is supported by scientific research starting project of swpu no 2017qhz011 state key laboratory for strength and vibration of mechanical structures

22996,walkden et al 2001 showed that severe impact events could be generated at the inner face of a sloping top caisson breakwater as a consequence of violent wave overtopping the authors employed the pressure impulse theory proposed by cooker and peregrine 1995 to develop a method capable of predicting the magnitude and distribution of loadings at the wall it was finally recognized air trapped between the overtopping jet and the structure to have a primary role in transferring momentum to the free surface of the protected basin unfortunatey that pioneering study was carried out using only 3 individual waves with identical height and period accordingly no systematic analysis of this fascinating phenomenon could be provided this paper employs results of full scale cfd experiments to fill this gap the research outcomes consistent with the walkden et al 2001 findings suggest that the occurrence of impulsive loadings at the inner face of the breakwater is intimately correlated to the occurrence of impact pressures onto the outer wall due to breaking waves a physically based correction of the walkden et al theory has been proposed which allows to get reasonable estimates of the pressure impulse under both quasi standing and breaking waves keywords numerical modeling computational fluid dynamics sloping top breakwater wave force wave impact 1 introduction in 2001 walkden et al published the results of laboratory experiments carried out on a small scale model of a sloping top caisson breakwater using short test runs the authors generated 3 non breaking individual waves with a height of 0 17 m and a period of 1s the waves were shown to violently overtop the breakwater crest producing a remarkable impact onto the inner face of the breakwater walkden et al used the impulse approach concept originally introduced by cooker and peregrine 1995 to develop a theory which allowed the prediction of the pressure impulse distribution along the rear wall they also argued air to play a significant role in the phenomenon since the cushion trapped between the overtopping jet and the structure was able to transfer a certain amount of momentum to the free surface in the protected area the occurrence of impact loadings as a consequence of an overtopping event is of course of great interest to engineers because even if such loadings are likely irrelevant to the breakwater stability they can cause local breakage of either the caisson or the superstructure the need of an adequate degree of knowledge about this topic is nowadays further increased by the long term rise of the mean sea level which makes the overtopping events increasingly frequent yet surprisingly enough no research study has followed the walkden et al work accordingly a significant uncertainty exists on a number of items such as what is the mechanism by which wave overtopping can generate impact events what is the magnitude of loadings peak pressure maximum force etc in response to different wave parameters what is the degree of predictability of the phenomenon either in a deterministic or probabilistic sense what is the influence of the model scale on the walkden et al measurements what is the degree of reliability of the walkden et al theory this paper employs the full scale cfd experiments described in buccino et al 2019 to start filling those gaps after a qualitative description of the mechanisms that govern impacts occurrence section 2 a quantitative analysis is provided in the subsection 3 2 then predictability is studied in the frame of a probabilistic approach subsection 3 3 after analyzing the pressure distribution characteristics with a special focus on the role of air entrainment subsection 3 4 a comparison with the walkden et al theory is carried out in subsection 3 5 throughout the paper results of numerical experiments are compared to those of the walkden et al physical model tests 2 impact events induced by wave overtopping fig 1 compares different stages of an overtopping event as observed in the cfd flume test 2b and as presented in the fig 5 of the walkden et al 2001 paper the picture shows a good consistency although the breakwater crown geometries are slightly different from each other this because the structure used in the numerical tests was initially thought to model a sloping face wave energy converter vicinanza et al 2015 buccino et al 2016 superimposed to a conventional vertical face breakwater details of the interaction between overtopping jet and protected basin are displayed in fig 2 firstly a jet of water with a large momentum hits the harbor here inducing significant inertia forces fig 2a hence the water between the jet and the wall is pushed upwards giving rise to a fast up rush motion fig 2b at the same time a very steep wave front is generated in the neighborhood of the falling point of the jet fig 2c which collapses down fig 2d creating a secondary crest that moves towards the wall from the process just described two different impact events may arise one occurs because pressures at the wall counteract the huge inertia transferred to the water by the overtopping jet according to walkden et al 2001 we will refer to this event as plume impact the other is related to the secondary crest if it arrives at the wall when the water level is in phase of down rush fig 3 a then the water surface considerably steepens and a plunging like impact takes place fig 3b which we term secondary plunging impact otherwise if the crest approaches the wall during the up rush phase fig 4 the motion will solve in a simple vertical oscillation altogether characteristics of the secondary plungings do not differ a big deal from those widely studied in the past for conventional vertical face breakwaters for this reason the rest of this paper will be essentially dedicated to the plume impact notwithstanding as a starting point for future research works the table 1 reports the maximum and average values of the force exerted by secondary plungings onto the inner face of the breakwater it is seen wave forces can attain remarkable magnitudes overcoming 40 of the hydrostatic thrust 0 5ρgd2 the last column of table 1 finally displays the percentage of observed impacts which always exceeds 50 3 analysis of plume impact 3 1 loading characteristics macrocharacteristics of plume impacts as observed in the cfd experiments are generally similar to those described by walkden et al 2001 an example is shown in fig 5 where one of the events recorded during the test 1a is compared to the fig 7 of the walkden et al paper in the graph the time history of the horizontal force exerted on the breakwater including both front face and rear face pressures is standardized subtracting mean and dividing by standard deviation and plotted against the time to period ratio t tp despite the shape of the loading waves seems to be slightly different the phases in which the impacts occur are consistent to each other around 0 5 t and so is the magnitude of the standardized peaks the details of the numerical impact event are shown in fig 6 the peak of force fmax occurs 0 15s after the overtopping jet has touched the rear basin upper panel the distribution of pressure at the instant of fmax lower panel has a peak located well below the still water level unlike walkden et al though fmax takes place as pressures on the front face are negative i e when the water level at the outer wall is down rushing 3 2 quantitative analysis to give a quantitative description of the phenomenon under study four non dimensional engineering variables have been selected and namely fig 6 1 the force peak f 1 f f m a x ρ q m a x 2 g r c in which qmax is the maximum of the overtopping rate in a wave cycle rc is the crest freeboard and 2 g r c is the ballistic fall velocity in this way the plume impact intensity is directly related to the magnitude of the overtopping process 2 the rise time t given by the ratio between the rise time of fmax t r and the peak period 3 the force impulse if defined as 2 i f i f a i in which i f is the impulse of the plume impact fig 7 and a i is the average impulse per cycle of the wave force acting onto the breakwater s outer face a i is calculated as follows 3 a i 1 n w t s t f f o u t d t in which nw is the number of waves fout is the force acting on the outer wall and ts and tf are the starting and the final instants of the test respectively 4 the non dimensional maximum pressure at the peak of force p pmax ρghm0 table 2 reports the minimum and maximum values observed through the 11 tests here presented each quantity is seen to span over 1 or 2 orders of magnitude highlighting that plume impact is affected by a large variability like all the impact phenomena for example the force impulse i f can be either very small or of the same order as the impulse transferred by the waves to the outer face of the breakwater same holds for pressure regarding this variable it is also worth to mention that the maximum value measured in the cfd experiments p 1 46 is very close to that observed by walkden et al in their experiments i e 1 37 this suggests that plume impacts generate loadings far less intense than those exerted by violent plunging breakers on the front face of vertical breakwaters p 10 3 3 predictability the high variability observed suggests that characteristics of plume impacts can be predicted only in the frame of a probabilistic approach consistently each of the quantities introduced above has been modeled as a random variable x with a probability density function in the form 4 p d f f x θ where θ generically denotes a group of parameters related to the pdf moments mean variance etc in practice for each test all the non dimensional variables peak of force rise time impulse and maximum pressure have been measured wave by wave so obtaining a sample for the eq 4 thus predictability is studied here by 1 researching the most appropriate shape of the pdf 2 analyzing the relationships between θ or equivalently the pdf moments and the bulk descriptors of the incoming sea states such as wave steepness h m0 l 0p relative crest freeboard r c h m0 etc as for the mathematical form of the pdf the lognormal distribution resulted the most suited for all quantities e g fig 8 this agrees with many previous studies on impact loadings such as those by kirkgoz 1995 vicinanza 1997 calaberse et al 2000 and buccino et al 2015 as widely known the lognormal pdf depends on two parameters and namely the scale factor μ l and the shape factor σ l they can be easily related to the mean and variance of x using the formulae 5 e x exp μ l 1 2 σ l 2 6 v a r x exp 2 μ l σ l 2 exp 2 μ l σ l 2 in predicting e x and var x only f t and p are considered because the impulse can be can be easily estimated by multiplying force peak and rise time as shown in the figs 9 and 10 the mean of f and p can be predicted relatively well as function of the fictional wave steepness 7 s 0 p 2 π h m 0 g t p 2 and the crest parameter 8 r p r c h m 0 s o p 2 which has been originally introduced by owen 1980 as a predictor of the overtopping rate the following curves have been obtained 9 e f 104 94 r p 1 18 r 2 0 85 10 e p 0 88 s 0 p 0 4 r 2 0 77 whereas only a weak dependence of rise time on wave steepness has been found 11 e t 0 052 s 0 p 0 4 r 2 0 39 previous results particularly eqs 9 and 10 appears rather interesting especially if one takes into account that s op and r p have been found to rule the occurrence of impact events onto the outer face of the structure buccino et al 2019 basically the equations above suggest that the risk of violent plume impacts is significantly correlated to the risk of impact loadings onto the front face of the structure this because the high velocities associated with wave breaking augment the momentum of the overtopping flow which is finally converted into inertia forces in the protected area as far as variance is concerned no clear trends were observed an example is given in fig 11 where the standard deviation of p is plotted against s 0p it is likely this behavior to be the result of sampling effects related to the small number of waves included in each test it is clear that while few data might be enough to have a stable estimate of the first order moment of a distribution i e the mean this is not the case for the second order moment which is inherently more affected by the extreme values in a sample in lack of clear relationships the standard deviations obtained from each test have been averaged and reported in table 3 as a reference for future research works 3 4 pressure distribution characteristics so far the inclusion of air in the simulations has never produced a significant effect on test outcomings in the figures from 8 to 10 data of the experiments conducted with a biphase fluid lie in the same cloud as tests run without air similar results have been found in buccino et al 2019 with respect to the quasi static part of wave loadings oppositely a clear influence on the pressure distribution at the peak of plume impact has been detected fig 12 plots the position of the pressure barycenter from the still water level zg versus s 0p zg is averaged event by event within each test and made non dimensional by the still water depth d it is seen experiments with air to have a center of mass closer to the still water level on the other hand for the tests with a single fluid z g 0 5 d indicating an almost uniform distribution the difference above described is even more evident if the position of the maximum pressure zmax is considered in fig 13 data with air exhibit a maximum very close to the still water level whereas for the mono phase fluid the peak of pressure is located between 0 1 and 0 5 d moreover a clear trend with relative crest freeboard is observed as shown in the next section the above findings are well consistent with those of walkden et al in comparing their theoretical approach for pressure impulse to experimental measurements the authors noticed that neglecting of air contribution led to a theoretical distribution of loadings just more uniform and with the maximum located lower see fig 13 of the walkden et al paper 3 5 analysis of pressure impulse 3 5 1 general characteristics fig 14 shows some examples of pressure impulse distributions for tests 1a mono phase fluid left panel and 4a biphase fluid right panel on the ordinates the vertical distance from the sea bottom d z is made non dimensional by the water depth d on the abscissas the pressure impulse pimp is divided by its maximum value along the wall pimp max filled circles refer to the walkden et al measurements which as anticipated are seen to be well consistent with cfd simulations only if the effect of air is accounted i e test 4a this supports the argument that air significantly influences distribution of loadings 3 5 2 pressure impulse prediction walkden et al 2001 developed a very interesting theoretical model to predict the distribution of pressure impulse associated with a plume impact event the model starts from the impulse approach originally introduced by cooker and peregrine 1995 in which impact events are studied by retaining only pressure and inertia terms in the navier stokes equations this leads pressure impulse to be governed by the laplace equation 12 2 p i m p 0 walkden et al basically solved two boundary problems in the first fig 15 the overtopping jet is treated like a rectangular solid width a height b which falls at the ballistic velocity v 2 g r c the solution gives the pressure impulse at the base of the falling block pov which is then used as a boundary condition in the second differential problem fig 16 the latter furnishes the distribution of pimp at the wall walkden et al compared their method against three individual waves only they argued that for theoretical predictions to compare well with measurements the effect of the air pocket enclosed between the overtopping jet and the wall fig 16 had to be properly modeled in fact they assumed the air pocket to transfer to the water surface a pressure impulse equal to the 80 of pov obviously in this paper the effect of air pocket is accounted only for tests conducted with air in the other cases the pressure impulse beneath the falling jet has been set equal to zero some examples of the obtained results are pictured in fig 17 in spite the general trend of pimp is captured significant under predictions have been detected a more general view of the model performances can be obtained by examining the root mean square error re defined as 13 r e e e v e w a l l p m e a s p c a l c 2 in which the subscripts meas and calc stand for measured and calculated respectively ewall indicates averaging along the wall and eev indicates averaging through the events of a given test the fig 18 shows that with the exception of the test 3a the walkden et al approach provides good estimates when quasi standing waves take place in front of the structure on the other hand the quality of predictions reduces in presence of breaking or broken waves a simple explanation of this behavior is that when waves break high flow velocities develop and the overtopping current on the structure top possesses a remarkable kinetic height which is ignored by the method a way to simply include this effect in the first boundary problem is applying the complete bernoulli theorem 14 u 2 2 g r c v 2 2 g where v is the fall velocity and u is the speed of the overtopping current thus we have 15 v 2 g r c u 2 which clearly reduces to the walkden et al hypothesis as u 0 the following general formula has been chosen to model u 16 u f r g h 0 where h0 is the height of the overtopping current just before the inner edge of the breakwater top fig 19 at the instant of the plume impact the froude number f r is expected to be of the order of 1 for quasi standing tests since the overtopping process is there relatively slow and accordingly the current on the horizontal crest can be considered approximately in critical conditions on contrary in presence of breaking or broken waves it may considerably increase despite f r should vary in principle event by event a single value has been calculated for each test by minimizing re the fig 20 compares the values of the root mean square error with and without the correction of eq 15 the graph shows only small reductions of re for quasi standing waves suggesting that the kinetic height of the overtopping current is negligible for these cases consistently with the walkden et al findings on contrary for breaking waves the eq 15 produces significant improvements of the predictions as pictured in fig 21 for the events of fig 17 as shown in fig 22 the optimal froude number is well predictable in function of the crest parameter r p with a trend which is independent of the inclusion of air in the simulation a supplementary analysis has been carried out to assess the effect of varying the pressure impulse transferred by the air pocket in fig 23 the latter is expressed in terms of percentage of pov fig 16 whereas the froude number has been calculated using the exponential form of fig 22 it is seen the percentage associated to the minimum rmse equals 50 for test 4a 70 for test 3a and 80 for test 3b this range is physically reasonable and consistent with the expectations by walkden et al 2001 on the other hand the weight of the air pocket on the general performance of the predictive method appears uncertain as only in one case test 4a an appropriate selection of the percentage of pov leads to a significant reduction of re 3 6 a discussion on the role of air compressibility eight tests out the 11 here discussed have been carried out with a monophase fluid whereas in the remaining 3 cases air has been treated as incompressible from a fluid dynamic point of view the latter choice is justified by the fact that velocities associated with the overtopping process are o 2 g r c that is about 7 m s for the breakwater here employed under this situation a mach number larger than 0 3 is obtained for a sound speed less than approximately 23 m s according to the well known hsieh and plesset 1961 formula such a low value could be achieved for a volume fraction of air in water larger than 50 which is of course extremely high even in lack of direct measurements for the case of an overtopping jet it could be of interest to mention that during the analysis of field data on violent impacts at alderney breakwater bullock et al 2000 observed an aeration rate in the range 5 15 corresponding to sound speeds varying between 45 and 85 m s the results presented in the previous sections essentially confirm the walkden et al 2001 findings either about the occurrence itself of violent impact events at the rear wall or with respect to the role of the air pocket trapped between the inner face of the structure and the overtopping jet regarding the latter it is worth highlighting that its role in the plume impact basically consists in transferring a part of the pressure impulse to the water surface this is inherently different from the case of direct impacts occurring at the front face of the breakwaters where the air pocket is known to cushion the impact of part of the water mass producing an increase of the duration of the peak pressure diminishing at the same time its magnitude bullock et al 2001 it is also noteworthy that just this behavior poses significant problems in scaling results of laboratory experiments kortenhaus and oumeraci 1999 cuomo et al 2010 also considering the different survivability time of air bubbles between fresh and salt water peregrine 2003 in this study even if modeled as incompressible that is assuming an infinite natural oscillation frequency the air pocket has been found to transfer to the water surface an amount of loading perfectly consistent with the walkden et al findings this is generally in line with the conclusions of a recent research

termed plume impacts and consist of impact pressures exerted onto the inner face of the breakwaters due to the huge inertia transferred in the protected area by the overtopping jet despite extreme interest to engineers the plume impact has been almost ignored so far the only research is the pioneering work of walkden et al 2001 who highlighted the existence of such phenomenon based on 3

force peak force rise time and pressure peak have been given to serve as reference for future research works in this respect one of the most interesting outcomings is the correlation between large plume impacts and intense impact loadings on the front face of the caisson this experimental finding is physically explained by the fact that when waves break in front of the structure high flow velocities develop which increase the momentum of the overtopping jet this process has been incorporated in the theoretical prediction method proposed by walkden et al by including the kinetic height of the overtopping current in the boundary problem that permits estimating the pressure impulse at the wall the correction above mentioned proved to significantly increase the prediction power of the walkden et al method in case of breaking and broken waves whereas for standing waves only small improvements have been obtained finally the distribution of pressures resulted significantly affected by

22996,walkden et al 2001 showed that severe impact events could be generated at the inner face of a sloping top caisson breakwater as a consequence of violent wave overtopping the authors employed the pressure impulse theory proposed by cooker and peregrine 1995 to develop a method capable of predicting the magnitude and distribution of loadings at the wall it was finally recognized air trapped between the overtopping jet and the structure to have a primary role in transferring momentum to the free surface of the protected basin unfortunatey that pioneering study was carried out using only 3 individual waves with identical height and period accordingly no systematic analysis of this fascinating phenomenon could be provided this paper employs results of full scale cfd experiments to fill this gap the research outcomes consistent with the walkden et al 2001 findings suggest that the occurrence of impulsive loadings at the inner face of the breakwater is intimately correlated to the occurrence of impact pressures onto the outer wall due to breaking waves a physically based correction of the walkden et al theory has been proposed which allows to get reasonable estimates of the pressure impulse under both quasi standing and breaking waves keywords numerical modeling computational fluid dynamics sloping top breakwater wave force wave impact 1 introduction in 2001 walkden et al published the results of laboratory experiments carried out on a small scale model of a sloping top caisson breakwater using short test runs the authors generated 3 non breaking individual waves with a height of 0 17 m and a period of 1s the waves were shown to violently overtop the breakwater crest producing a remarkable impact onto the inner face of the breakwater walkden et al used the impulse approach concept originally introduced by cooker and peregrine 1995 to develop a theory which allowed the prediction of the pressure impulse distribution along the rear wall they also argued air to play a significant role in the phenomenon since the cushion trapped between the overtopping jet and the structure was able to transfer a certain amount of momentum to the free surface in the protected area the occurrence of impact loadings as a consequence of an overtopping event is of course of great interest to engineers because even if such loadings are likely irrelevant to the breakwater stability they can cause local breakage of either the caisson or the superstructure the need of an adequate degree of knowledge about this topic is nowadays further increased by the long term rise of the mean sea level which makes the overtopping events increasingly frequent yet surprisingly enough no research study has followed the walkden et al work accordingly a significant uncertainty exists on a number of items such as what is the mechanism by which wave overtopping can generate impact events what is the magnitude of loadings peak pressure maximum force etc in response to different wave parameters what is the degree of predictability of the phenomenon either in a deterministic or probabilistic sense what is the influence of the model scale on the walkden et al measurements what is the degree of reliability of the walkden et al theory this paper employs the full scale cfd experiments described in buccino et al 2019 to start filling those gaps after a qualitative description of the mechanisms that govern impacts occurrence section 2 a quantitative analysis is provided in the subsection 3 2 then predictability is studied in the frame of a probabilistic approach subsection 3 3 after analyzing the pressure distribution characteristics with a special focus on the role of air entrainment subsection 3 4 a comparison with the walkden et al theory is carried out in subsection 3 5 throughout the paper results of numerical experiments are compared to those of the walkden et al physical model tests 2 impact events induced by wave overtopping fig 1 compares different stages of an overtopping event as observed in the cfd flume test 2b and as presented in the fig 5 of the walkden et al 2001 paper the picture shows a good consistency although the breakwater crown geometries are slightly different from each other this because the structure used in the numerical tests was initially thought to model a sloping face wave energy converter vicinanza et al 2015 buccino et al 2016 superimposed to a conventional vertical face breakwater details of the interaction between overtopping jet and protected basin are displayed in fig 2 firstly a jet of water with a large momentum hits the harbor here inducing significant inertia forces fig 2a hence the water between the jet and the wall is pushed upwards giving rise to a fast up rush motion fig 2b at the same time a very steep wave front is generated in the neighborhood of the falling point of the jet fig 2c which collapses down fig 2d creating a secondary crest that moves towards the wall from the process just described two different impact events may arise one occurs because pressures at the wall counteract the huge inertia transferred to the water by the overtopping jet according to walkden et al 2001 we will refer to this event as plume impact the other is related to the secondary crest if it arrives at the wall when the water level is in phase of down rush fig 3 a then the water surface considerably steepens and a plunging like impact takes place fig 3b which we term secondary plunging impact otherwise if the crest approaches the wall during the up rush phase fig 4 the motion will solve in a simple vertical oscillation altogether characteristics of the secondary plungings do not differ a big deal from those widely studied in the past for conventional vertical face breakwaters for this reason the rest of this paper will be essentially dedicated to the plume impact notwithstanding as a starting point for future research works the table 1 reports the maximum and average values of the force exerted by secondary plungings onto the inner face of the breakwater it is seen wave forces can attain remarkable magnitudes overcoming 40 of the hydrostatic thrust 0 5ρgd2 the last column of table 1 finally displays the percentage of observed impacts which always exceeds 50 3 analysis of plume impact 3 1 loading characteristics macrocharacteristics of plume impacts as observed in the cfd experiments are generally similar to those described by walkden et al 2001 an example is shown in fig 5 where one of the events recorded during the test 1a is compared to the fig 7 of the walkden et al paper in the graph the time history of the horizontal force exerted on the breakwater including both front face and rear face pressures is standardized subtracting mean and dividing by standard deviation and plotted against the time to period ratio t tp despite the shape of the loading waves seems to be slightly different the phases in which the impacts occur are consistent to each other around 0 5 t and so is the magnitude of the standardized peaks the details of the numerical impact event are shown in fig 6 the peak of force fmax occurs 0 15s after the overtopping jet has touched the rear basin upper panel the distribution of pressure at the instant of fmax lower panel has a peak located well below the still water level unlike walkden et al though fmax takes place as pressures on the front face are negative i e when the water level at the outer wall is down rushing 3 2 quantitative analysis to give a quantitative description of the phenomenon under study four non dimensional engineering variables have been selected and namely fig 6 1 the force peak f 1 f f m a x ρ q m a x 2 g r c in which qmax is the maximum of the overtopping rate in a wave cycle rc is the crest freeboard and 2 g r c is the ballistic fall velocity in this way the plume impact intensity is directly related to the magnitude of the overtopping process 2 the rise time t given by the ratio between the rise time of fmax t r and the peak period 3 the force impulse if defined as 2 i f i f a i in which i f is the impulse of the plume impact fig 7 and a i is the average impulse per cycle of the wave force acting onto the breakwater s outer face a i is calculated as follows 3 a i 1 n w t s t f f o u t d t in which nw is the number of waves fout is the force acting on the outer wall and ts and tf are the starting and the final instants of the test respectively 4 the non dimensional maximum pressure at the peak of force p pmax ρghm0 table 2 reports the minimum and maximum values observed through the 11 tests here presented each quantity is seen to span over 1 or 2 orders of magnitude highlighting that plume impact is affected by a large variability like all the impact phenomena for example the force impulse i f can be either very small or of the same order as the impulse transferred by the waves to the outer face of the breakwater same holds for pressure regarding this variable it is also worth to mention that the maximum value measured in the cfd experiments p 1 46 is very close to that observed by walkden et al in their experiments i e 1 37 this suggests that plume impacts generate loadings far less intense than those exerted by violent plunging breakers on the front face of vertical breakwaters p 10 3 3 predictability the high variability observed suggests that characteristics of plume impacts can be predicted only in the frame of a probabilistic approach consistently each of the quantities introduced above has been modeled as a random variable x with a probability density function in the form 4 p d f f x θ where θ generically denotes a group of parameters related to the pdf moments mean variance etc in practice for each test all the non dimensional variables peak of force rise time impulse and maximum pressure have been measured wave by wave so obtaining a sample for the eq 4 thus predictability is studied here by 1 researching the most appropriate shape of the pdf 2 analyzing the relationships between θ or equivalently the pdf moments and the bulk descriptors of the incoming sea states such as wave steepness h m0 l 0p relative crest freeboard r c h m0 etc as for the mathematical form of the pdf the lognormal distribution resulted the most suited for all quantities e g fig 8 this agrees with many previous studies on impact loadings such as those by kirkgoz 1995 vicinanza 1997 calaberse et al 2000 and buccino et al 2015 as widely known the lognormal pdf depends on two parameters and namely the scale factor μ l and the shape factor σ l they can be easily related to the mean and variance of x using the formulae 5 e x exp μ l 1 2 σ l 2 6 v a r x exp 2 μ l σ l 2 exp 2 μ l σ l 2 in predicting e x and var x only f t and p are considered because the impulse can be can be easily estimated by multiplying force peak and rise time as shown in the figs 9 and 10 the mean of f and p can be predicted relatively well as function of the fictional wave steepness 7 s 0 p 2 π h m 0 g t p 2 and the crest parameter 8 r p r c h m 0 s o p 2 which has been originally introduced by owen 1980 as a predictor of the overtopping rate the following curves have been obtained 9 e f 104 94 r p 1 18 r 2 0 85 10 e p 0 88 s 0 p 0 4 r 2 0 77 whereas only a weak dependence of rise time on wave steepness has been found 11 e t 0 052 s 0 p 0 4 r 2 0 39 previous results particularly eqs 9 and 10 appears rather interesting especially if one takes into account that s op and r p have been found to rule the occurrence of impact events onto the outer face of the structure buccino et al 2019 basically the equations above suggest that the risk of violent plume impacts is significantly correlated to the risk of impact loadings onto the front face of the structure this because the high velocities associated with wave breaking augment the momentum of the overtopping flow which is finally converted into inertia forces in the protected area as far as variance is concerned no clear trends were observed an example is given in fig 11 where the standard deviation of p is plotted against s 0p it is likely this behavior to be the result of sampling effects related to the small number of waves included in each test it is clear that while few data might be enough to have a stable estimate of the first order moment of a distribution i e the mean this is not the case for the second order moment which is inherently more affected by the extreme values in a sample in lack of clear relationships the standard deviations obtained from each test have been averaged and reported in table 3 as a reference for future research works 3 4 pressure distribution characteristics so far the inclusion of air in the simulations has never produced a significant effect on test outcomings in the figures from 8 to 10 data of the experiments conducted with a biphase fluid lie in the same cloud as tests run without air similar results have been found in buccino et al 2019 with respect to the quasi static part of wave loadings oppositely a clear influence on the pressure distribution at the peak of plume impact has been detected fig 12 plots the position of the pressure barycenter from the still water level zg versus s 0p zg is averaged event by event within each test and made non dimensional by the still water depth d it is seen experiments with air to have a center of mass closer to the still water level on the other hand for the tests with a single fluid z g 0 5 d indicating an almost uniform distribution the difference above described is even more evident if the position of the maximum pressure zmax is considered in fig 13 data with air exhibit a maximum very close to the still water level whereas for the mono phase fluid the peak of pressure is located between 0 1 and 0 5 d moreover a clear trend with relative crest freeboard is observed as shown in the next section the above findings are well consistent with those of walkden et al in comparing their theoretical approach for pressure impulse to experimental measurements the authors noticed that neglecting of air contribution led to a theoretical distribution of loadings just more uniform and with the maximum located lower see fig 13 of the walkden et al paper 3 5 analysis of pressure impulse 3 5 1 general characteristics fig 14 shows some examples of pressure impulse distributions for tests 1a mono phase fluid left panel and 4a biphase fluid right panel on the ordinates the vertical distance from the sea bottom d z is made non dimensional by the water depth d on the abscissas the pressure impulse pimp is divided by its maximum value along the wall pimp max filled circles refer to the walkden et al measurements which as anticipated are seen to be well consistent with cfd simulations only if the effect of air is accounted i e test 4a this supports the argument that air significantly influences distribution of loadings 3 5 2 pressure impulse prediction walkden et al 2001 developed a very interesting theoretical model to predict the distribution of pressure impulse associated with a plume impact event the model starts from the impulse approach originally introduced by cooker and peregrine 1995 in which impact events are studied by retaining only pressure and inertia terms in the navier stokes equations this leads pressure impulse to be governed by the laplace equation 12 2 p i m p 0 walkden et al basically solved two boundary problems in the first fig 15 the overtopping jet is treated like a rectangular solid width a height b which falls at the ballistic velocity v 2 g r c the solution gives the pressure impulse at the base of the falling block pov which is then used as a boundary condition in the second differential problem fig 16 the latter furnishes the distribution of pimp at the wall walkden et al compared their method against three individual waves only they argued that for theoretical predictions to compare well with measurements the effect of the air pocket enclosed between the overtopping jet and the wall fig 16 had to be properly modeled in fact they assumed the air pocket to transfer to the water surface a pressure impulse equal to the 80 of pov obviously in this paper the effect of air pocket is accounted only for tests conducted with air in the other cases the pressure impulse beneath the falling jet has been set equal to zero some examples of the obtained results are pictured in fig 17 in spite the general trend of pimp is captured significant under predictions have been detected a more general view of the model performances can be obtained by examining the root mean square error re defined as 13 r e e e v e w a l l p m e a s p c a l c 2 in which the subscripts meas and calc stand for measured and calculated respectively ewall indicates averaging along the wall and eev indicates averaging through the events of a given test the fig 18 shows that with the exception of the test 3a the walkden et al approach provides good estimates when quasi standing waves take place in front of the structure on the other hand the quality of predictions reduces in presence of breaking or broken waves a simple explanation of this behavior is that when waves break high flow velocities develop and the overtopping current on the structure top possesses a remarkable kinetic height which is ignored by the method a way to simply include this effect in the first boundary problem is applying the complete bernoulli theorem 14 u 2 2 g r c v 2 2 g where v is the fall velocity and u is the speed of the overtopping current thus we have 15 v 2 g r c u 2 which clearly reduces to the walkden et al hypothesis as u 0 the following general formula has been chosen to model u 16 u f r g h 0 where h0 is the height of the overtopping current just before the inner edge of the breakwater top fig 19 at the instant of the plume impact the froude number f r is expected to be of the order of 1 for quasi standing tests since the overtopping process is there relatively slow and accordingly the current on the horizontal crest can be considered approximately in critical conditions on contrary in presence of breaking or broken waves it may considerably increase despite f r should vary in principle event by event a single value has been calculated for each test by minimizing re the fig 20 compares the values of the root mean square error with and without the correction of eq 15 the graph shows only small reductions of re for quasi standing waves suggesting that the kinetic height of the overtopping current is negligible for these cases consistently with the walkden et al findings on contrary for breaking waves the eq 15 produces significant improvements of the predictions as pictured in fig 21 for the events of fig 17 as shown in fig 22 the optimal froude number is well predictable in function of the crest parameter r p with a trend which is independent of the inclusion of air in the simulation a supplementary analysis has been carried out to assess the effect of varying the pressure impulse transferred by the air pocket in fig 23 the latter is expressed in terms of percentage of pov fig 16 whereas the froude number has been calculated using the exponential form of fig 22 it is seen the percentage associated to the minimum rmse equals 50 for test 4a 70 for test 3a and 80 for test 3b this range is physically reasonable and consistent with the expectations by walkden et al 2001 on the other hand the weight of the air pocket on the general performance of the predictive method appears uncertain as only in one case test 4a an appropriate selection of the percentage of pov leads to a significant reduction of re 3 6 a discussion on the role of air compressibility eight tests out the 11 here discussed have been carried out with a monophase fluid whereas in the remaining 3 cases air has been treated as incompressible from a fluid dynamic point of view the latter choice is justified by the fact that velocities associated with the overtopping process are o 2 g r c that is about 7 m s for the breakwater here employed under this situation a mach number larger than 0 3 is obtained for a sound speed less than approximately 23 m s according to the well known hsieh and plesset 1961 formula such a low value could be achieved for a volume fraction of air in water larger than 50 which is of course extremely high even in lack of direct measurements for the case of an overtopping jet it could be of interest to mention that during the analysis of field data on violent impacts at alderney breakwater bullock et al 2000 observed an aeration rate in the range 5 15 corresponding to sound speeds varying between 45 and 85 m s the results presented in the previous sections essentially confirm the walkden et al 2001 findings either about the occurrence itself of violent impact events at the rear wall or with respect to the role of the air pocket trapped between the inner face of the structure and the overtopping jet regarding the latter it is worth highlighting that its role in the plume impact basically consists in transferring a part of the pressure impulse to the water surface this is inherently different from the case of direct impacts occurring at the front face of the

22997,a series of experimental studies on flow induced vibration fiv of two identical elastically mounted circular cylinders in tandem arrangement were carried out in a low turbulence surface water channel the reynolds number was between 2 86 104 1 14 105 both upstream and downstream cylinders with diameter of 8 89 cm and mass ratio of 1 343 were allowed to oscillate in the transverse direction four spacing ratios t d 1 57 2 57 3 57 and 4 57 where t is the center to center spacing and d is the cylinder diameter were selected two virtual spring damping oscillators were used to conduct the tests and measure the position signals of two tandem circular cylinders undergoing fiv the vibrations and fluid forces of the cylinders were analyzed and discussed to illustrate the mechanisms of interaction between the two cylinders the experimental results indicate that the fiv characteristics of the upstream cylinder are similar to those of a single cylinder for t d 2 57 3 57 and 4 57 when the reduced velocity does not exceed 12 0 moreover the fiv response of the upstream cylinder in the two tandem cylinder system with t d 1 57 is significantly different from that of the isolated cylinder the vibration of and the fluid force on the downstream cylinder are obviously influenced by the upstream cylinder for the spacing range tested vortex induced vibration viv like response features are observed for the downstream cylinder keywords flow induced vibration tandem cylinders spacing ratio mass ratio galloping 1 introduction the problem of multiple circular cylindrical structures exposed to fluid flow is very common and complex in various engineering applications examples include electric power transmission lines heat exchanger tubes marine risers tethers of tension leg platform etc due to the industrial importance of this problem extensive research has been conducted and many excellent findings have been obtained in the past few decades more details can be found in several review papers by chen 1986 zdravkovich 1988 moretti 1993 sumner 2010 and bearman 2011 a two cylinder system is the most basic configuration of multiple cylinders as reported by zdravkovich 1987 the flow around two stationary cylinders in different arrangements could be classified into four regions i proximity interference where the free shear layers emanated from the upstream cylinder roll up after the downstream ii wake interference where the shear layers separate from the upstream cylinder and reattach on the downstream cylinder iii proximity and wake interference region where a combination of proximity and wake interference exists iv no interference where the wake of one cylinder does not have an obvious influence on the other the tandem configuration generally falls within the wake interference region sumner 2010 to better understand the flow characteristics and fluid dynamic forces in the case of two fixed tandem cylinders some numerical simulations and experiments have been conducted in recent years kitagawa and ohta 2008 tsutsui 2012 flow induced vibration fiv of two cylinders in tandem arrangement is a typical and complicated fluid structure interaction fsi phenomenon such as the vibrations of marine risers chimney stacks and bridge cables the vibration response of the two tandem cylinders is mainly affected by the spacing ratio t d where t is the center to center spacing and d is the cylinder diameter the mass damping parameter m ζ where m is the mass ratio and ζ is the structural damping ratio and the reynolds number re ud ν where u is the flow velocity and ν is the fluid kinematic viscosity when an elastic bluff body is placed in the wake developed from an upstream body it will dynamically respond with wake induced vibration wiv which describes the phenomenon responsible for these excitations and combines lock in of shedding frequency from vortex induced vibration viv and interference from the vortices shed from the upstream body wiv has also been referred to as interference galloping ruscheweyh 1983 wake induced galloping bokaian and geoola 1984 and wake displacement excitation zdravkovich 1988 several researchers have studied the wiv of two circular cylinders in tandem where the upstream cylinder is stationary and the downstream cylinder is allowed to oscillate hover and triantafyllou 2001 considered the flow past two cylinders in tandem arrangement with a spacing of 4 75d at re 3 05 104 they investigated the response of and fluid forces on the elastically mounted downstream cylinder in the direction transverse to the flow and found that viv and galloping like response occurred when the reduced velocity was in the range of 2 0 17 0 assi et al 2006 conducted an experimental study on the interference between two tandem cylinders with m ζ 0 013 the upstream cylinder was fixed while the downstream one was constrained to vibrate in the transverse direction they observed wiv for t d 2 0 5 6 and re 0 3 104 1 3

mounted rigid cylinder oscillating in the wake of a stationary upstream cylinder with t d 2 0 6 0 and re 0 1 104 1 0 104 only wiv were observed assi 2014 experimentally investigated the wiv of two tandem cylinders in a water channel for re 0 2 104 2 5 104 where the downstream cylinder was free to oscillate in the transverse and streamwise directions while the upstream cylinder was stationary the center to center spacing was fixed at 4 0d it was reported that the response characteristics of two degree of freedom oscillation of the downstream cylinder were similar to those of one degree of freedom in previous experiments by assi et al 2010 when both cylinders are allowed to oscillate the dynamic response and fluid behavior of the tandem cylinders are more complicated few researchers have employed the numerical methods to study the fiv of two elastically mounted cylinders in tandem at very low reynolds number where the wake flow remains two dimensional and laminar mittal and kumar 2004 papaioannou et al 2008 borazjani and sotiropoulos 2009 prasanth and mittal 2009 papaioannou et al 2008 numerically investigated the effect of spacing on the two degree of freedom oscillations of two tandem cylinders with m ζ 0 127 at re 160 three spacing ratio cases t d 2 5 3 5 and 5 0 were simulated in their study it was found that the response curve of the upstream cylinder became wider with decreasing spacing and the oscillation of the downstream cylinder was shifted toward higher values of the reduced velocity compared to the upstream cylinder for all examined spacing ratios borazjani and sotiropoulos 2009 conducted a numerical study on fiv of two identical elastically mounted tandem cylinders in the proximity wake interference region t d 1 5 at re 200 it was illustrated that the vibration amplitude of the downstream cylinder was smaller than that of the upstream one at low reduced velocities when the reduced velocity increased to a threshold value a large amplitude vibration phenomenon was observed for the downstream cylinder with amplitudes significantly larger than those of the upstream cylinder however there have been very few systematic experimental investigations to understand the fiv of two moving cylinders in tandem arrangement kim et al 2009 performed a series of laboratory tests on fiv characteristics of two tandem cylinders with m ζ 4 05 t

diverging in regime iii t d 1 6 3 0 both cylinders oscillated significantly with slightly different amplitude in regime iv t d 3 0 3 7 the two cylinders vibrated weakly due to the shear layers from the upstream cylinder reattaching steadily on the downstream cylinder in regime v t d 3 7 t d exceeded critical spacing resulting in much higher amplitude of oscillation for the downstream cylinder than for the upstream one huang and herfjord 2013 presented experimental results of two elastically supported circular cylinders m ζ 0 0031 0 0046 at various tandem positions t d 2 0 5 0 subject to steady flow in a flume the reynolds number was in the range of 1 12 104 5 52 104 it was observed that the upstream cylinder oscillated strongly in the transverse and streamwise directions and the influence of the downstream cylinder on the upstream cylinder s fiv response became insignificant for t d 3 0 most of the previous numerical investigations of two smooth tandem cylinders subject to fiv have focused on relatively low reynolds numbers less than 103 mittal and kumar 2004 papaioannou et al 2008 borazjani and sotiropoulos 2009 prasanth and mittal 2009 the reynolds number in the experimental work by kim et al 2009 is in the range of re 4375 7 42 104 on the fiv of two tandem cylinders with a high mass damping parameter m ζ 4 05 till now there is still limited research work on fiv of two elastically supported smooth cylinders with high reynolds number and low mass damping parameter in tandem arrangement at the mrelab systematic studies have been performed on two cylinders in tandem where the cylinders had turbulence stimulation in the form of sand strips inducing galloping after the synchronization range regarding the frequency response the classical definition of synchronization or lock in is perceived as the regime where the frequency of oscillation as well as the vortex formation frequency is close to the natural frequency of the structure in those studies spacing ratio spring stiffness and damping were used as parameters with the goal of converting hydrokinetic energy to mechanical in the two oscillators and subsequently to electrical energy those studies included experimental and cfd analyses ding et al 2013 2015 kim and bernitsas 2016 ma et al 2017 sun et al 2017 the objective of this paper is to conduct an experimental investigation on the dynamic response and fluid forces on two tandem cylinders with a relatively low mass damping parameter m ζ 0 0269 in a closed circuit water channel at subcritical reynolds numbers re 2 86 104 1 14 105 both cylinders are free to oscillate in the transverse direction only four spacing ratio values are tested t d 1 57 2 57 3 57 and 4 57 the rest of the paper is organized as follows section 2 describes the experimental set up section 3 presents and discusses the experimental results including amplitude and frequency response total fluid forces and the phase difference between displacement response and transverse force section 4 draws conclusions based on the experimental results 2 experimental set up a series of experimental tests were performed in the low turbulence surface water ltfsw channel see fig 1 the channel in the marine renewable energy laboratory mrelab at the university of michigan can recirculate about 38000 l of fresh water the test section with a length of 2 44 m and a width of 1 0 m is made of plexiglass in our tests the water depth was 1 17 m the water in the channel is driven by an induction motor driven propeller placed on the ground flow velocity is controlled on the ground floor by a control system modulating the propeller s motor frequency in hz allowing the motor frequency to be increased or decreased the incoming flow velocity in the current experiment was in the range of 0 32 m s 1 28 m s the corresponding reynolds number ranged from 2 86 104 to 1 14 105 the flow turbulence intensity was approximate 0 098 further details of the ltfsw channel can be found in kim et al 2013 sun et al 2015 2016 and ma et al 2016 there are only a few experimental investigations however with two tandem cylinders in which both cylinders are free to oscillate transversely to the flow in this paper as shown in fig 2 both cylinders in tandem arrangement are allowed to oscillate in the transverse direction the spacing between the two cylinder centers ranged from 1 57d to 4 57d with an interval of 1 0d the tandem configuration mainly was in the wake interference region as specified by zdravkovich 1987 more details can be found in fig 3 the effect of spacing ratio on the dynamic response and fluid forces on two tandem cylinders are investigated systematically in the experiment in addition the viv of a single cylinder is also studied for the same model parameters and test conditions for reference and comparison in this paper the response measurements of the circular cylinders undergoing vortex shedding were simulated by two virtual spring damping devices known as vck virtual spring damping system the first generation vck was built to replace the physical damper springs for experimental investigation of fiv of cylinders by lee and bernitsas 2011 all the position and torque information was processed through national instruments ni 7340 using analog signals the quality of signals is highly dependent on the power supply and the noise was clocked around 200 hz a large number of model tests can be conducted rapidly and easily by vck because the damping and spring stiffness are set by software rather than hardware this device had several key parts including a cylinder a belt pulley transmission a motor generator and a controller the most notable achievement of the vck system is that it does not include the hydrodynamic force in the closed control loop and thus does not bias the measured phenomenon recently sun et al 2016 developed the second generation of vck system which has several advantages compared to the first generation such as the second generation vck system was developed as a stand alone application via an embedded controller rather than using labview which added a significant lag that had to be compensated moreover digital signals were used instead of analog signals in the second generation of vck the sample time was reduced by three orders of magnitude thus eliminating the need to include dynamic terms with memory in the damping model to achieve no bias in fiv the two identical cylinders each with diameter d 8 89 cm and length l 0 89535 m were made of 6061 aluminum alloy the total mass of the cylinder m osc including cylinder structure mass 1 3 of the spring mass equivalent mass of transmission belts and pulleys and all oscillating parts including the vck system was 7 286 kg and the mass of the displaced fluid m d was 5 425 kg the mass ratio of the cylinder m which is defined as the total oscillating mass of the cylinder normalized by the mass of the displaced fluid was 1 343 in this paper the damping ratio of the vck system ζ was set to 0 02 the key parameters for the experimental setup are listed in table 1 the ratio of cylinder diameter to channel depth was about 7 6 the effect of blockage is insignificant west and apelt 1982 the two tandem cylinders were mounted nearly 0 60 m below the free surface of the flow it has been experimentally proved that the free surface and bottom boundary effects are not obvious raghavan et al 2009 chang et al 2011 the free end of a cylinder can cause strong spanwise flow which causes the 2 dimensional flow assumptions invalid sumner et al 2004 sumner et al 2004 reported in their study that the tip flow from the free ends can affect the whole wake downstream a cylinder with a small aspect ratio the utilization of end plates at the tips of the cylinders can reduce the 3 dimensional effects in our tests the end plates were not used because that the aspect ratio was 10 07 and the free ends of the cylinder were very close to the channel s walls no significant tip flow effects existed since the entire walls served as the end plates the cylinder used in the experimental study oscillates in the transverse direction and its motion is typically modeled as ding et al 2013 sun et al 2016 1 m o s c y c y k y f y where the over dot represents the derivative with respect to time y and f y are the response displacement and total fluid force in the transverse direction and c is the structural damping related to the damping ratio ζ by following equation sun et al 2016 2 c 2 ζ k m o s c the time series for the cylinder displacement and velocity are measured by the vck system the total fluid force can be reconstructed according to eq 1 and the total fluid force coefficient c y in the transverse direction is defined and calculated as follow sun et al 2016 3 c y 2 f y ρ u 2 d l the added mass coefficient and lift force coefficient of the two tandem cylinders are further analyzed in this paper a traditional approach assuming a

13 g 1 1 n y 2 g 2 1 n y y g 3 1 n f y y g 4 1 n y 2 g 5 1 n f y y moreover the reduced velocity in this paper is defined as 14 v r u f 0 d where f 0 is the natural frequency of the oscillator in still water the free decay tests of the two tandem cylinders were firstly carried out in the ltfsw channel to measure the value of their natural frequencies it was found that the two frequencies have a slight difference between each other measured values are in good agreement with the values calculated by 15 f 0 1 2 π k m o s c m a where k is the spring stiffness in the vck system here the theoretical natural frequency obtained by eq 15 was used to calculate the reduced velocity in 14 3 results and discussion the fiv features of two elastically supported cylinders in tandem arrangement at subcritical reynolds number including dynamic response fluid forces and interaction between the two cylinders are presented and discussed in this section 3 1 displacement amplitude and response frequency fig 4 shows the dimensionless maximum displacement amplitudes y max d versus the reduced velocity v r parametrically over the spacing ratio for both the upstream and downstream cylinders the maximum response amplitude was obtained by averaging the largest 10 of the response amplitude peaks in the displacement time history for comparison the response amplitude of the single cylinder with the same structural parameters and test conditions is plotted in fig 4 when the reduced velocity exceeds 12 0 the vortex shedding frequency deviates from the natural frequency of the single cylinder and the lock in or the synchronization ceases to exist no obvious vibration of the single cylinder occurs and thus the results for the single cylinder are not presented for v r 12 in addition previous numerical and experimental results from papaioannou et al 2008 prasanth and mittal 2009 and kim et al 2009 on fiv of two tandem cylinders are also presented in fig 4 the lock in and galloping ranges are marked in the figure with the different colored background herein the lock in is perceived as the regime where the frequency of oscillation as well as the vortex formation frequency are close to the natural frequency of the cylinder the vibration is self excited and self limited during lock in in contrast galloping is an instability phenomenon where the exciting force from the vortices is not the driving mechanism hence the vibration amplitude is self excited and theoretically keeps increasing until system failure for the upstream cylinder the peak value of amplitude is 1 41d at v r 6 95 when t d 1 57 moreover the fiv response region becomes narrower with increasing spacing ratio in our tests the response amplitude shows a trend similar to that of the single cylinder for t d 2 57 the latter however is up to 25 higher this phenomenon was also observed numerically by prasanth and mittal 2009 in their study on fiv of two tandem cylinders with re 100 and t d 5 5 as shown in fig 4 the response amplitude curve of the upstream cylinder with t d 1 57 is obviously different from those of other spacing ratios five regimes of two elastically mounted tandem cylinders excited by fiv were experimentally identified according to the spacing ratios by kim et al 2009 the case with t d 1 57 in this paper is in regime ii where two shear layers separate from the upstream cylinder and reattach to the surface of the downstream cylinder an unsteady lift on the upstream cylinder was caused and this interesting response was observed by kim et al 2009 in regime ii both cylinders vibrated strongly with the upstream cylinder experiencing a divergent vibration the same feature is also observed in our experiment this could be attributed to the effect of the strong wake interference between the two cylinders for the downstream cylinder the peak value of the amplitude is up to 1 71d and nearly the same with the cases of t d 1 57 2 57 and 3 57 a smaller amplitude is measured for t d 4 57 this trend was also observed by papaioannou et al 2008 where the response amplitude of the downstream cylinder was higher for the cases t d 2 5 and 3 5 than for the case t d 5 0 the wiv phenomena of the downstream cylinder of a tandem pair that is free to oscillate in the transverse direction have been widely investigated by many researchers it was found that the downstream cylinder exhibits large displacements at reduced velocities beyond the lock in region hover and triantafyllou 2001 assi et al 2010 as the downstream cylinder is moved farther away the effect of wiv is reduced until the response curve eventually resembles that of viv of an isolated cylinder assi et al 2010 in our tests the maximum response amplitude of the downstream cylinder in the t d 4 57 case is very close to that of the single cylinder however the lock in region width in terms of the reduced velocity v r of the downstream cylinder in the t d 4 57 case is obviously different from that of the single cylinder this is caused by the presence of the oscillating upstream cylinder further the maximum response amplitude of the downstream cylinder shifts to higher reduced velocity from v r 12 to v r 14 as the cylinder spacing varies the response curve of the downstream cylinder is different from that of the upstream cylinder for all spacing values it should be pointed out that there are several significant differences between the previous and the present results a the maximum response amplitudes of the upstream downstream cylinder are 1 41d 1 71d respectively which are much larger than the values of 0 54d 0 88d measured by papaioannou et al 2008 0 62d 1 08d by prasanth and mittal 2009 and 0 37d 0 26d by kim et al 2009 b the ranges of synchronization measured in the response amplitude curves are much wider in this study than in the three aforementioned studies khalak and williamson 1999 proved experimentally that the width of the synchronization range for cylinders excited in fiv increases with decreasing mass ratio in the trsl2 flow regime bernitsas et al 2009 and raghavan and bernitsas 2011 showed that the range of synchronization of the upper branch increases with increasing reynolds number in the trsl3 flow regime further the response amplitude increases with reynolds number within the upper branch and overtakes the lower branch showing a completely different viv response in the trsl3 flow regime compared to trsl2 in our tests the mass damping parameter m ζ 0 0269 is significantly smaller than 0 127 in the numerical investigation on fiv of two tandem cylinders by papaioannou et al 2008 and 4 05 in the wind tunnel experiments on the fiv of two cylinders in a tandem arrangement by kim et al 2009 the reynolds number in the experiment in this paper is in the range of 2 86 104 1 14 105 which is much larger than re 160 by papaioannou et al 2008 and re 100 by prasanth and mittal 2009 the differences between previous research work papaioannou et al 2008 prasanth and mittal 2009 kim et al 2009 and our experimental results can be attributed the influence of m ζ and re fig 5 gives the dimensionless transverse oscillation frequencies of two cylinders in tandem versus the reduced velocity the frequency spectra were obtained by the fast fourier transform fft of the displacement time history and the dominant frequency f y is defined as the frequency at the largest peak in a spectrum in the up and bottom parts of the figure two additional dash lines with orange color are drawn the diagonal dash line represents the strouhal frequency corresponding to the vortex shedding frequency for the stationary cylinder the horizontal dash lines represent the natural frequency for the case f y f 0 for comparison the numerical results from papaioannou et al 2008 and prasanth and mittal 2009 on the vibration of two tandem cylinders undergoing vortex shedding with low reynolds number are also presented in fig 5 in the lock in range the response frequency of the single cylinder is found to be identical to that of the upstream cylinder for t d 2 57 3 57 and 4 57 this behavior is in good agreement with the results by papaioannou et al 2008 and prasanth and mittal 2009 however when the two cylinders are very close to each other with t d 1 57 the two shear layers separating from the upstream cylinder reattach on the downstream cylinder kim et al 2009 and one of them bifurcates into two part of which rolls in the gap between the cylinders causing a dramatic change of the fluctuating lift and drag forces this is why the oscillation frequency of the upstream cylinder for t d 1 57 deviates compared to the other cases of the spacing ratio t d 2 57 3 57 and 4 57 in addition the dominant frequency of the downstream cylinder is lower than that of the single cylinder due to the wake shielding effect caused by the upstream cylinder and it does not change with varying spacing in the range 5 0 v r 12 0 when the reduced velocity increases past v r 12 0 the downstream cylinder with t d 1 57 has smaller response frequency than that with the other three spacing cases the two tandem cylinders have an equal frequency for t d 1 57 because for those test parameters the two cylinders oscillate in synchronization as a pair 3 2 fluid forces acting on two tandem cylinders hydrodynamic force coefficients which play a significant role in predicting fiv in the engineering field are worth studying larsen and halse 1997 chaplin et al 2005 the transverse force on an oscillatory cylinder can be decomposed into two parts one is in phase with the structural velocity and is referred to as lift the other is in phase with the structural acceleration and is referred to as the added mass force gopalkrishnan 1993 the hydrodynamic features of two oscillatory cylinders are more complicated than those of an isolated one due to the interaction between adjacent cylinders the fluid forces acting on two elastically mounted rigid cylinders in tandem arrangement will be thoroughly discussed in the following section the c y is the instantaneous fluid force coefficient here the c ymax represents the maximum amplitude of the total fluid force coefficient which was calculated by averaging the largest 10 c y in the time varying history fig 6 shows the c ymax of two cylinders in tandem versus the reduced velocity the plotted lines are the counterparts of those presented figs 4 and 5 previous numerical results of two smooth elastically mounted cylinders at different tandem spacings but for lower reynolds numbers are also plotted for comparison papaioannou et al 2008 prasanth and mittal 2009 the c ymax of the upstream cylinder shows good agreement with the single cylinder results for spacing greater than 2 57 cylinder diameter this observation corresponds to the results of the response amplitude presented in fig 4 the c ymax declines as the reduced velocity increases this trend was also observed in the research work by papaioannou et al 2008 and prasanth and mittal 2009 for the case with t d 1 57 much higher c ymax of the upstream cylinder is observed compared to the single cylinder case until the reduced velocity reaches 8 23 for the downstream cylinder the varying behavior of the c ymax is not similar to that of the single cylinder in addition the three cases with t d 2 57 3 57 and 4 57 share nearly the same trend the peak values of the c ymax increase with the decrease of spacing in our tests due to the difference in reynolds number of about three orders of magnitude the force on the downstream cylinder in the wake of the upstream cylinder is very different from previous results by papaioannou et al 2008 and prasanth and mittal 2009 for both upstream and downstream cylinders the peak value of c ymax appears at a much lower value of v r than the ones at which maximum displacements occur in the transverse direction in addition the peak values of c ymax gradually decrease to nearly zero as the reduced velocity increases from 8 23 to 20 4 fig 7 shows the phase differences φ between the total force on the cylinder and its transverse displacement and how it varies with the reduced velocity for the upstream and downstream cylinders for each spacing ratio tested the phase difference was obtained by using eq 10 the previous numerical results of two cylinders in tandem by papaioannou et al 2008 and prasanth and mittal 2009 as well as experimental results of the single cylinder are also plotted in fig 7 for the upstream cylinder it is observed that the total fluid force and transverse response are almost in phase until a jump from nearly 4 to 178 at v r 7 0 with t d 2 57 3 57 and 4 57 this feature is also observed in the experiment of the single cylinder subject to viv however for the small spacing case t d 1 57 the jump occurs at v r 9 0 and then a sudden drop from nearly 153 to 25 appears at v r 14 0 that is the transverse fluid force and displacement are in phase again while the reduced velocity increases to a large value and the response amplitude grows as shown in fig 4 the phase angle between the force and the response of the downstream cylinder with respect to the reduced velocity is not similar to those of the upstream cylinder the sudden increase of phase angle from nearly 25 to 145 is observed at v r 9 5 12 5 for the three larger spacing cases t d 2 57 3 57 and 4 57 this sudden phase increase occurs at higher reduced velocity v r 18 0 for t 1 57d for both the upstream and downstream cylinders different features between previous numerical results of phase lag by papaioannou et al 2008 and prasanth and mittal 2009 and experimental results in this paper are attributed to large differences in reynolds number and mass damping parameter it should be noted that the tests in this paper are in the trsl3 flow regime zdravkovich 1997 where fiv is very different bernitsas et al 2009 from trsl2 and lower reynolds numbers khalak and williamson 1996 fig 8 shows the added mass coefficients c a of two cylinders in tandem with respect to the reduced velocity the added mass coefficient of the upstream cylinder for spacing ratio t d 2 57 3 57 and 4 57 agrees well with the results of the single cylinder notably the downstream cylinder has much larger added mass coefficient compared to that of the upstream cylinder for three spacing ratios t d 2 57 3 57 and 4 57 the added mass coefficients of the two tandem cylinders decrease as the reduced velocity increases a small peak appears at v r 14 in other words the added mass coefficient decreases with the reduced velocity resulting in a natural frequency which increases with the reduced velocity see fig 5 however for small spacing ratio t d 1 57 the variation of added mass coefficients versus the reduced velocity is more complex with a very pronounced increase at v r 16 for both the upstream and downstream cylinders the added mass coefficients decline at v r 11 4 and a slow climb till v r 15 9 then a decrease occurs fig 9 presents the lift force coefficients c l of two tandem cylinders with respect to the reduced velocity note that the lift force coefficient is calculated by eq 11 in section 2 the upstream cylinder as well as the single cylinder share nearly similar variation trend of the lift force coefficient for all four spacing values in addition the lift force coefficient of the downstream cylinder changes sharply for t d 1 57 2 57 and 3 57 while reduced velocity is less than 7 0 the lift force coefficients for both the upstream and downstream cylinders diminish approximately to zero at largely reduced velocity in addition the lift force coefficients are clearly always followed by a declining trend suggests the self limiting mechanism of fiv 3 3 interaction between two tandem cylinders as shown in figs 4 6 the displacement amplitude response frequency and total fluid force coefficient of the upstream and downstream cylinders in tandem are significantly different for the two cylinders close to each other t d 1 57 compared to larger spacing in addition the experimental results show a similar trend as well as similar magnitude for the larger spacing ratio t d 3 57 and 4 57 next the interaction between upstream and downstream cylinders is investigated further in the previous sections the reduced velocity was calculated by using the free flow velocity of the water channel however the actual mean flow velocity to the downstream cylinder differs from the free flow velocity due to the wake shielding effect caused by the upstream cylinder it is suggested that certain fiv characteristics of the downstream cylinder are dependent upon the local reduced velocity huang and herfjord 2013 which is defined as 16 v r n u n f 0 d where u n is the local flow velocity it was not measured during the experiment in this work herein the wake velocity model proposed by schlichting 1968 which was modified by huse 1993 and applied by huang and herfjord 2013 is adopted 17 u n u u 0 18 u 0 u c d d t v t 19 t v 4 d c d where u 0 is the maximum wake velocity deficit at the wake centerline the c d is the drag coefficient which can be obtained from the relation between re and c d in blevins 1990 it should be pointed out that the original expression of eqs 17 19 was firstly developed for the mean turbulent wake flow behind a circular cylinder and this expression is valid only for the far wake schlichting 1968 hence for analyzing the near wake region a modification was developed by huse 1993 nevertheless for the purpose of comparison the displacement amplitudes response frequencies and total fluid force coefficients of the two tandem cylinders with respect to the local reduced velocity v rn as defined by eq 16 are re plotted in fig 10 it should be noted that the reduced velocity of the upstream cylinder is equal to its local reduced velocity the case of the single cylinder is also plotted in fig 10 it is observed that the displacement amplitude curve of the downstream cylinder shifts to lower local reduced velocity see fig 10a lock in occurs at much lower local reduced velocity as presented in fig 10b the total fluid force coefficient of the downstream cylinder was evaluated using the local wake velocity and is drawn in fig 10c it appears that the total fluid force coefficients of two tandem cylinders have a similar trend for v rn 6 0 for all four spacing values tested and for the single cylinder this strongly suggests that fiv of the downstream cylinder is strongly influenced by its own reduced velocity as well as that of the upstream cylinder the results in fig 10 at least provide obvious evidence on the importance of including both the influence of the upstream cylinder and the actual wake flow to the downstream cylinder as mentioned in the experiments on tandem cylinders reported by hover and triantafyllou 2001 assi et al 2006 2010 and korkischko and meneghini 2010 the upstream cylinder remains always fixed and the transverse response of the downstream cylinder was studied experimentally wiv is a fluid elastic mechanism able to excite into oscillatory motion a bluff body immersed in the wake generated from another body positioned upstream despite the fact that the typical response presents a build up of amplitude for higher reduced velocities and is similar to galloping the findings by new measurements and cfd simulations suggest that the fluid forces in the transverse direction on the downstream cylinder are due to vortex shedding and they are enhanced by vortices coming from the upstream cylinder hence wiv is different from galloping like vibrations assi et al 2006 fig 11 presents a comparison of the displacement amplitude of the downstream cylinder between present tests and previous experimental results from hover and triantafyllou 2001 assi et al 2010 and korkischko and meneghini 2010 several spacing ratios such as t d 4 75 in hover and triantafyllou 2001 t d 4 0 and 5 0 in assi et al 2010 and t d 2 0 3 0 4 0 5 0 in korkischko and meneghini 2010 were selected in previous experiments continuous increase in amplitude with reduced velocity is observed in fig 11 this indicates a wiv type of response for different spacing ratios in this paper the downstream cylinder of the present tests mainly shows the viv like response for all four spacing ratios tested there are significant differences in experimental results between previous research work hover and triantafyllou 2001 assi et al 2010 korkischko and meneghini 2010 and the results in this paper these are attributed to the following two basic differences between them a in our tests both cylinders are allowed to oscillate creating a time dependent offset and spacing between the cylinders b in the present tests the reynolds number is an order of magnitude higher than tests in the trsl2 flow regime resulting in a fully turbulent shear layer shorter formation length and stronger vorticity inducing the well known high lift in the trsl3 flow regime zdravkovich 1997 bernitsas et al 2009 bernitsas 2016 both of these factors affect the interaction between shear layers from the upstream body and the downstream body in a way that breaks the pattern of shear layers rolling up after the downstream cylinder creating the wiv driving mechanism fig 12 shows the dimensionless dominant frequency of the downstream cylinder in the two cylinder tandem configuration in order to compare with previous tests of the oscillation of the downstream cylinder in the wake of a stationary upstream cylinder some test data from assi et al 2010 with a spacing ratio of 4 0 and korkischko and meneghini 2010 with four spacing ratios t d 2 0 3 0 4 0 and 5 0 are also plotted in fig 12 it is worth noting that at higher reduced velocities the frequencies of transverse vibration for all three spacing ratios t d 3 0 4 0 and 5 0 in korkischko and meneghini 2010 gradually become nearly equal and stay above the natural frequency of the vibrating system in addition the dominant response frequency of the downstream cylinder with t d 2 0 is much larger than the other three spacing cases in their tests the response frequency in assi et al 2010 is close to the present experimental results for three spacing ratios t d 2 57 3 57 and 4 57 however a different trend in response frequency is observed in this paper in the case of the two cylinders in close proximity for t d 1 57 the response frequency gradually increases at 5 0 v r 10 8 the maximum response frequency achieved in the experiment is about 1 28 a decrease of response frequency with an increase in reduced velocity is shown at 11 4 v r 15 3 with a minimum value of response frequency of 1 06 at v r 15 9 then the frequency goes up again as the reduced velocity increases to better understand this phenomenon and provide a plausible explanation the following should be considered a at v r 15 9 where the minimum occurs in the frequency of oscillation see fig 12 a local maximum occurs in the added mass c a in fig 8b increase in c a causes a reduction in the natural frequency in water affecting similarly the frequency of oscillation while the denominator in f y f 0 is not affected b increased added mass indicates that the phase between force and acceleration reduces this is consistent with fig 7 showing phase φ between force and displacement shifting close to φ 180 c finally for t d 1 57 where f y f 0 deeps and the minimum occurs the two cylinders move in phase resulting in increased added mass 4 conclusions the fiv of two tandem cylinders with four spacing ratios t d 1 57 2 57 3 57 and 4 57 at subcritical reynolds numbers re 2 86 104 1 14 105 the low mass damping parameter m ζ 0 0269 m 1 343 ζ 0 02 was experimentally investigated in the low turbulence surface water ltfsw channel of the mrelab the reynolds number places the present tests in the trsl3 flow regime where high lift occurs due to the fully turbulent state of the shear layers based upon the presented experimental results and the corresponding discussion the following conclusions can be drawn 1 the maximum response amplitudes of the upstream and downstream cylinders in the experiment are 1 41d and 1 71d respectively these amplitudes are much larger than those in numerical studies papaioannou et al 2008 prasanth and mittal 2009 and experimental tests kim et al 2009 in addition the range of synchronization measured in the response amplitude curves is much wider in the experiment than in the aforementioned studies papaioannou et al 2008 prasanth and mittal 2009 kim et al 2009 2 the fiv characteristics of the upstream cylinder including displacement amplitude response frequency added mass coefficient and total fluid force coefficient for the higher spacing ratios tested t d 2 57 3 57 and 4 57 are similar with those of the single cylinder when the reduced velocity does not exceed 12 0 that means that for larger spacing ratios the upstream cylinder is insignificantly affected by the downstream cylinder for the cases with the smaller spacing ratio of 1 57 the upstream cylinder shows galloping like vibrations manifested as a divergent displacement amplitude this phenomenon is consistent with the experimental findings by kim et al 2009 on the features of fiv of two elastically supported cylinders in tandem in a closed circuit wind tunnel the downstream cylinder mainly shows the viv like response for all four spacing ratios tested 3 the vibration of and the fluid force on the downstream cylinder are strongly affected by the upstream cylinder in all four spacing ratios in the experiment moreover the fiv response of the downstream cylinder is obviously dependent upon the local reduced velocity which is calculated based upon an estimated mean wake velocity the experimental results indicate that the displacement amplitude curve of the downstream cylinder shifts to lower local reduced velocity and lock in occurs at much lower local reduced velocity the total fluid force coefficients of the two cylinders in a tandem arrangement for all four spacing values tested are similar to those of the single cylinder for local reduced velocity larger than 6 0 it is known that even for a single cylinder very close proximity to the bottom boundary or free surface affects vortex shedding and may even suppress viv raghavan et al 2009 chung 2016 the further experimental investigation should be conducted to understand fiv of two cylinders near a free surface or a bottom boundary such information would be very useful in harnessing hydrokinetic energy using fiv when cylinders operate in shallow waters as in rivers and streams moreover there are several important parameters t d re m ζ v r for understanding the fiv mechanism of two tandem cylinders it is very difficult to connect these parameters and investigate their interrelationships hence the effect of reynolds number on the synchronization range and amplitude of fiv for two tandem cylinders system has not been documented well in laboratory or field tests which

22997,a series of experimental studies on flow induced vibration fiv of two identical elastically mounted circular cylinders in tandem arrangement were carried out in a low turbulence surface water channel the reynolds number was between 2 86 104 1 14 105 both upstream and downstream cylinders with diameter of 8 89 cm and mass ratio of 1 343 were allowed to oscillate in the transverse direction four spacing ratios t d 1 57 2 57 3 57 and 4 57 where t is the center to center spacing and d is the cylinder diameter were selected two virtual spring damping oscillators were used to conduct the tests and measure the position signals of two tandem circular cylinders undergoing fiv the vibrations and fluid forces of the cylinders were analyzed and discussed to illustrate the mechanisms of interaction between the two cylinders the experimental results indicate that the fiv characteristics of the upstream cylinder are similar to those of a single cylinder for t d 2 57 3 57 and 4 57 when the reduced velocity does not exceed 12 0 moreover the fiv response of the upstream cylinder in the two tandem cylinder system with t d 1 57 is significantly different from that of the isolated cylinder the vibration of and the fluid force on the downstream cylinder are obviously influenced by the upstream cylinder for the spacing range tested vortex induced vibration viv like response features are observed for the downstream cylinder keywords flow induced vibration tandem cylinders spacing ratio mass ratio galloping 1 introduction the problem of multiple circular cylindrical structures exposed to fluid flow is very common and complex in various engineering applications examples include electric power transmission lines heat exchanger tubes marine risers tethers of tension leg platform etc due to the industrial importance of this problem extensive research has been conducted and many excellent findings have been obtained in the past few decades more details can be found in several review papers by chen 1986 zdravkovich 1988 moretti 1993 sumner 2010 and bearman 2011 a two cylinder system is the most basic configuration of multiple cylinders as reported by zdravkovich 1987 the flow around two stationary cylinders in different arrangements could be classified into four regions i proximity interference where the free shear layers emanated from the upstream cylinder roll up after the downstream ii wake interference where the shear layers separate from the upstream cylinder and reattach on the downstream cylinder iii proximity and wake interference region where a combination of proximity and wake interference exists iv no interference where the wake of one cylinder does not have an obvious influence on the other the tandem configuration generally falls within the wake interference region sumner 2010 to better understand the flow characteristics and fluid dynamic forces in the case of two fixed tandem cylinders some numerical simulations and experiments have been conducted in recent years kitagawa and ohta 2008 tsutsui 2012 flow induced vibration fiv of two cylinders in tandem arrangement is a typical and complicated fluid structure interaction fsi phenomenon such as the vibrations of marine risers chimney stacks and bridge cables the vibration response of the two tandem cylinders is mainly affected by the spacing ratio t d where t is the center to center spacing and d is the cylinder diameter the mass damping parameter m ζ where m is the mass ratio and ζ is the structural damping ratio and the reynolds number re ud ν where u is the flow velocity and ν is the fluid kinematic viscosity when an elastic bluff body is placed in the wake developed from an upstream body it will dynamically respond with wake induced vibration wiv which describes the phenomenon responsible for these excitations and combines lock in of shedding frequency from vortex induced vibration viv and interference from the vortices shed from the upstream body wiv has also been referred to as interference galloping ruscheweyh 1983 wake induced galloping bokaian and geoola 1984 and wake displacement excitation zdravkovich 1988 several researchers have studied the wiv of two circular cylinders in tandem where the upstream cylinder is stationary and the downstream cylinder is allowed to oscillate hover and triantafyllou 2001 considered the flow past two cylinders in tandem arrangement with a spacing of 4 75d at re 3 05 104 they investigated the response of and fluid forces on the elastically mounted downstream cylinder in the direction transverse to the flow and found that viv and galloping like response occurred when the reduced velocity was in the range of 2 0 17 0 assi et al 2006 conducted an experimental study on the interference between two tandem cylinders with m ζ 0 013 the upstream cylinder was fixed while the downstream one was constrained to vibrate in the transverse direction they observed wiv for t d 2 0 5 6 and re 0 3 104 1 3 104 korkischko and meneghini 2010 focused on the transverse fiv of two tandem cylinders with m ζ 0 0081 and presented an experimental study on the amplitude and frequency response of an elastically mounted rigid cylinder oscillating in the wake of a stationary upstream cylinder with t d 2 0 6 0 and re 0 1 104 1 0 104 only wiv were observed assi 2014 experimentally investigated the wiv of two tandem cylinders in a water channel for re 0 2 104 2 5 104 where the downstream cylinder was free to oscillate in the transverse and streamwise directions while the upstream cylinder was stationary the center to center spacing was fixed at 4 0d it was reported that the response characteristics of two degree of freedom oscillation of the downstream cylinder were similar to those of one degree of freedom in previous experiments by assi et al 2010 when both cylinders are allowed to oscillate the dynamic response and fluid behavior of the tandem cylinders are more complicated few researchers have employed the numerical methods to study the fiv of two elastically mounted cylinders in tandem at very low reynolds number where the wake flow remains two dimensional and laminar mittal and kumar 2004 papaioannou et al 2008 borazjani and sotiropoulos 2009 prasanth and mittal 2009 papaioannou et al 2008 numerically investigated the effect of spacing on the two degree of freedom oscillations of two tandem cylinders with m ζ 0 127 at re 160 three spacing ratio cases t d 2 5 3 5 and 5 0 were simulated in their study it was found that the response curve of the upstream cylinder became wider with decreasing spacing and the oscillation of the downstream cylinder was shifted toward higher values of the reduced velocity compared to the upstream cylinder for all examined spacing ratios borazjani and sotiropoulos 2009 conducted a numerical study on fiv of two identical elastically mounted tandem cylinders in the proximity wake interference region t d 1 5 at re 200 it was illustrated that the vibration amplitude of the downstream cylinder was smaller than that of the upstream one at low reduced velocities when the reduced velocity increased to a threshold value a large amplitude vibration phenomenon was observed for the downstream cylinder with amplitudes significantly larger than those of the upstream cylinder however there have been very few systematic experimental investigations to understand the fiv of two moving cylinders in tandem arrangement kim et al 2009 performed a series of laboratory tests on fiv characteristics of two tandem cylinders with m ζ 4 05 t d 1 1 4 2 and re 4375 7 42 104 in a closed circuit wind tunnel five response regimes were identified based on the spacing ratio in regime i t d 1 1 1 2 the two cylinders in tandem did not oscillate and the flow structure around them was the same as that around two fixed cylinders in the same configuration in regime ii t d 1 2 1 6 both cylinders oscillated vigorously with the upstream one diverging in regime iii t d 1 6 3 0 both cylinders oscillated significantly with slightly different amplitude in regime iv t d 3 0 3 7 the two cylinders vibrated weakly due to the shear layers from the upstream cylinder reattaching steadily on the downstream cylinder in regime v t d 3 7 t d exceeded critical spacing resulting in much higher amplitude of oscillation for the downstream cylinder than for the upstream one huang and herfjord 2013 presented experimental results of two elastically supported circular cylinders m ζ 0 0031 0 0046 at various tandem positions t d 2 0 5 0 subject to steady flow in a flume the reynolds number was in the range of 1 12 104 5 52 104 it was observed that the upstream cylinder oscillated strongly in the transverse and streamwise directions and the influence of the downstream cylinder on the upstream cylinder s fiv response became insignificant for t d 3 0 most of the previous numerical investigations of two smooth tandem cylinders subject to fiv have focused on relatively low reynolds numbers less than 103 mittal and kumar 2004 papaioannou et al 2008 borazjani and sotiropoulos 2009 prasanth and mittal 2009 the reynolds number in the experimental work by kim et al 2009 is in the range of re 4375 7 42 104 on the fiv of two tandem cylinders with a high mass damping parameter m ζ 4 05 till now there is still limited research work on fiv of two elastically supported smooth cylinders with high reynolds number and low mass damping parameter in tandem arrangement at the mrelab systematic studies have been performed on two cylinders in tandem where the cylinders had turbulence stimulation in the form of sand strips inducing galloping after the synchronization range regarding the frequency response the classical definition of synchronization or lock in is perceived as the regime where the frequency of oscillation as well as the vortex formation frequency is close to the natural frequency of the structure in those studies spacing ratio spring stiffness and damping were used as parameters with the goal of converting hydrokinetic energy to mechanical in the two oscillators and subsequently to electrical energy those studies included experimental and cfd analyses ding et al 2013 2015 kim and bernitsas 2016 ma et al 2017 sun et al 2017 the objective of this paper is to conduct an experimental investigation on the dynamic response and fluid forces on two tandem cylinders with a relatively low mass damping parameter m ζ 0 0269 in a closed circuit water channel at subcritical reynolds numbers re 2 86 104 1 14 105 both cylinders are free to oscillate in the transverse direction only four spacing ratio values are tested t d 1 57 2 57 3 57 and 4 57 the rest of the paper is organized as follows section 2 describes the experimental set up section 3 presents and discusses the experimental results including amplitude and frequency response total fluid forces and the phase difference between displacement response and transverse force section 4 draws conclusions based on the experimental results 2 experimental set up a series of experimental tests were performed in the low turbulence surface water ltfsw channel see fig 1 the channel in the marine renewable energy laboratory mrelab at the university of michigan can recirculate about 38000 l of fresh water the test section with a length of 2 44 m and a width of 1 0 m is made of plexiglass in our tests the water depth was 1 17 m the water in the channel is driven by an induction motor driven propeller placed on the ground flow velocity is controlled on the ground floor by a control system modulating the propeller s motor frequency in hz allowing the motor frequency to be increased or decreased the incoming flow velocity in the current experiment was in the range of 0 32 m s 1 28 m s the corresponding reynolds number ranged from 2 86 104 to 1 14 105 the flow turbulence intensity was approximate 0 098 further details of the ltfsw channel can be found in kim et al 2013 sun et al 2015 2016 and ma et al 2016 there are only a few experimental investigations however with two tandem cylinders in which both cylinders are free to oscillate transversely to the flow in this paper as shown in fig 2 both cylinders in tandem arrangement are allowed to oscillate in the transverse direction the spacing between the two cylinder centers ranged from 1 57d to 4 57d with an interval of 1 0d the tandem configuration mainly was in the wake interference region as specified by zdravkovich 1987 more details can be found in fig 3 the effect of spacing ratio on the dynamic response and fluid forces on two tandem cylinders are investigated systematically in the experiment in addition the viv of a single cylinder is also studied for the same model parameters and test conditions for reference and comparison in this paper the response measurements of the circular cylinders undergoing vortex shedding were simulated by two virtual spring damping devices known as vck virtual spring damping system the first generation vck was built to replace the physical damper springs for experimental investigation of fiv of cylinders by lee and bernitsas 2011 all the position and torque information was processed through national instruments ni 7340 using analog signals the quality of signals is highly dependent on the power supply and the noise was clocked around 200 hz a large number of model tests can be conducted rapidly and easily by vck because the damping and spring stiffness are set by software rather than hardware this device had several key parts including a cylinder a belt pulley transmission a motor generator and a controller the most notable achievement of the vck system is that it does not include the hydrodynamic force in the closed control loop and thus does not bias the measured phenomenon recently sun et al 2016 developed the second generation of vck system which has several advantages compared to the first generation such as the second generation vck system was developed as a stand alone application via an embedded controller rather than using labview which added a significant lag that had to be compensated moreover digital signals were used instead of analog signals in the second generation of vck the sample time was reduced by three orders of magnitude thus eliminating the need to include dynamic terms with memory in the damping model to achieve no bias in fiv the two identical cylinders each with diameter d 8 89 cm and length l 0 89535 m were made of 6061 aluminum alloy the total mass of the cylinder m osc including cylinder structure mass 1 3 of the spring mass equivalent mass of transmission belts and pulleys and all oscillating parts including the vck system was 7 286 kg and the mass of the displaced fluid m d was 5 425 kg the mass ratio of the cylinder m which is defined as the total oscillating mass of the cylinder normalized by the mass of the displaced fluid was 1 343 in this paper the damping ratio of the vck system ζ was set to 0 02 the key parameters for the experimental setup are listed in table 1 the ratio of cylinder diameter to channel depth was about 7 6 the effect of blockage is insignificant west and apelt 1982 the two tandem cylinders were mounted nearly 0 60 m below the free surface of the flow it has been experimentally proved that the free surface and bottom boundary effects are not obvious raghavan et al 2009 chang et al 2011 the free end of a cylinder can cause strong spanwise flow which causes the 2 dimensional flow assumptions invalid sumner et al 2004 sumner et al 2004 reported in their study that the tip flow from the free ends can affect the whole wake downstream a cylinder with a small aspect ratio the utilization of end plates at the tips of the cylinders can reduce the 3 dimensional effects in our tests the end plates were not used because that the aspect ratio was 10 07 and the free ends of the cylinder were very close to the channel s walls no significant tip flow effects existed since the entire walls served as the end plates the cylinder used in the experimental study oscillates in the transverse direction and its motion is typically modeled as ding et al 2013 sun et al 2016 1 m o s c y c y k y f y where the over dot represents the derivative with respect to time y and f y are the response displacement and total fluid force in the transverse direction and c is the structural damping related to the damping ratio ζ by following equation sun et al 2016 2 c 2 ζ k m o s c the time series for the cylinder displacement and velocity are measured by the vck system the total fluid force can be reconstructed according to eq 1 and the total fluid force coefficient c y in the transverse direction is defined and calculated as follow sun et al 2016 3 c y 2 f y ρ u 2 d l the added mass coefficient and lift force coefficient of the two tandem cylinders are further analyzed in this paper a traditional approach assuming a sinusoidal form for the response displacement and the transverse force is adopted bearman 1984 4 y y 0 sin 2 π f y t 5 f y f 0 sin 2 π f y t φ where y 0 is the displacement amplitude f 0 is the amplitude of the transverse force t is the time and φ is the phase difference between the force and the response the response velocity y and acceleration y can be calculated by differentiating eq 4 6

hydrodynamic force in song et al 2016 we have 8 f y c l ρ d l 2 2 y r m s u 2 y c a m a y where c l and c a are the lift force coefficient and added mass coefficient in the transverse direction

13 g 1 1 n y 2 g 2 1 n y y g 3 1 n f y y g 4 1 n y 2 g 5 1 n f y y moreover the reduced velocity in this paper is defined as 14 v r u f 0 d where f 0 is the natural frequency of the oscillator in still water the free decay tests of the two tandem cylinders were firstly carried out in the ltfsw channel to measure the value of their natural frequencies it was found that the two frequencies have a slight difference between each other measured values are in good agreement with the values calculated by 15 f 0 1 2 π k m o s c m a where k is the spring stiffness in the vck system here the theoretical natural frequency obtained by eq 15 was used to calculate the reduced velocity in 14 3 results and discussion the fiv features of two elastically supported cylinders in tandem arrangement at subcritical reynolds number including dynamic response fluid forces and interaction between the two cylinders are presented and discussed in this section 3 1 displacement amplitude and response frequency fig 4 shows the dimensionless maximum displacement amplitudes y max d versus the reduced velocity v r parametrically over the spacing ratio for both the upstream and downstream cylinders the maximum response amplitude was obtained by averaging the largest 10 of the response amplitude peaks in the displacement time history for comparison the response amplitude of the single cylinder with the same structural parameters and test conditions is plotted in fig 4 when the reduced velocity exceeds 12 0 the vortex shedding frequency deviates from the natural frequency of the single cylinder and the lock in or the synchronization ceases to exist no obvious vibration of the single cylinder occurs and thus the results for the single cylinder are not presented for v r 12 in addition previous numerical and experimental results from papaioannou et al 2008 prasanth and mittal 2009 and kim et al 2009 on fiv of two tandem cylinders are also presented in fig 4 the lock in and galloping ranges are marked in the figure with the different colored background herein the lock in is perceived as the regime where the frequency of oscillation as well as the vortex formation frequency are close to the natural frequency of the cylinder the vibration is self excited and self limited during lock in in contrast galloping is an instability phenomenon where the exciting force from the vortices is not the driving mechanism hence the vibration amplitude is self excited and theoretically keeps increasing until system failure for the upstream cylinder the peak value of amplitude is 1 41d at v r 6 95 when t d 1 57 moreover the fiv response region becomes narrower with increasing spacing ratio in our tests the response amplitude shows a trend similar to that of the single cylinder for t d 2 57 the latter however is up to 25 higher this phenomenon was also observed numerically by prasanth and mittal 2009 in their study on fiv of two tandem cylinders with re 100 and t d 5 5 as shown in fig 4 the response amplitude curve of the upstream cylinder with t d 1 57 is obviously different from those of other spacing ratios five regimes of two elastically mounted tandem cylinders excited by fiv were experimentally identified according to the spacing ratios by kim et al 2009 the case with t d 1 57 in this paper is in regime ii where two shear layers separate from the upstream cylinder and reattach to the surface of the downstream cylinder an unsteady lift on the upstream cylinder was caused and this interesting response was observed by kim et al 2009 in regime ii both cylinders vibrated strongly with the upstream cylinder experiencing a divergent vibration the same feature is also observed in our experiment this could be attributed to the effect of the strong wake interference between the two cylinders for the downstream cylinder the peak value of the amplitude is up to 1 71d and nearly the same with the cases of t d 1 57 2 57 and 3 57 a smaller amplitude is measured for t d 4 57 this trend was also observed by papaioannou et al 2008 where the response amplitude of the downstream cylinder was higher for the cases t d 2 5 and 3 5 than for the case t d 5 0 the wiv phenomena of the downstream cylinder of a tandem pair that is free to oscillate in the transverse direction have been widely investigated by many researchers it was found that the downstream cylinder exhibits large displacements at reduced velocities beyond the lock in region hover and triantafyllou 2001 assi et al 2010 as the downstream cylinder is moved farther away the effect of wiv is reduced until the response curve eventually resembles that of viv of an isolated cylinder assi et al 2010 in our tests the maximum response amplitude of the downstream cylinder in the t d 4 57 case is very close to that of the single cylinder however the lock in region width in terms of the reduced velocity v r of the downstream cylinder in the t d 4 57 case is obviously different from that of the single cylinder this is caused by the presence of the oscillating upstream cylinder further the maximum response amplitude of the downstream cylinder shifts to higher reduced velocity from v r 12 to v r 14 as the cylinder spacing varies the response curve of the downstream cylinder is different from that of the upstream cylinder for all spacing values it should be pointed out that there are several significant differences between the previous and the present results a the maximum response amplitudes of the upstream downstream cylinder are 1 41d 1 71d respectively which are much larger than the values of 0 54d 0 88d measured by papaioannou et al 2008 0 62d 1 08d by prasanth and mittal 2009 and 0 37d 0 26d by kim et al 2009 b the ranges of synchronization measured in the response amplitude curves are much wider in this study than in the three aforementioned studies khalak and williamson 1999 proved experimentally that the width of the synchronization range for cylinders excited in fiv increases with decreasing mass ratio in the trsl2 flow regime bernitsas et al 2009 and raghavan and bernitsas 2011 showed that the range of synchronization of the upper branch increases with increasing reynolds number in the trsl3 flow regime further the response amplitude increases with reynolds number within the upper branch and overtakes the lower branch showing a completely different viv response in the trsl3 flow regime compared to trsl2 in our tests the mass damping parameter m ζ 0 0269 is significantly smaller than 0 127 in the numerical investigation on fiv of two tandem cylinders by papaioannou et al 2008 and 4 05 in the wind tunnel experiments on the fiv of two cylinders in a tandem arrangement by kim et al 2009 the reynolds number in the experiment in this paper is in the range of 2 86 104 1 14 105 which is much larger than re 160 by papaioannou et al 2008 and re 100 by prasanth and mittal 2009 the differences between previous research work papaioannou et al 2008 prasanth and mittal 2009 kim et al 2009 and our experimental results can be attributed the influence of m ζ and re fig 5 gives the dimensionless transverse oscillation frequencies of two cylinders in tandem versus the reduced velocity the frequency spectra were obtained by the fast fourier transform fft of the displacement time history and the dominant frequency f y is defined as the frequency at the largest peak in a spectrum in the up and bottom parts of the figure two additional dash lines with orange color are drawn the diagonal dash line represents the strouhal frequency corresponding to the vortex shedding frequency for the stationary cylinder the horizontal dash lines represent the natural frequency for the case f y f 0 for comparison the numerical results from papaioannou et al 2008 and prasanth and mittal 2009 on the vibration of two tandem cylinders undergoing vortex shedding with low reynolds number are also presented in fig 5 in the lock in range the response frequency of the single cylinder is found to be identical to that of the upstream cylinder for t d 2 57 3 57 and 4 57 this behavior is in good agreement with the results by papaioannou et al 2008 and prasanth and mittal 2009 however when the two cylinders are very close to each other with t d 1 57 the two shear layers separating from the upstream cylinder reattach on the downstream cylinder kim et al 2009 and one of them bifurcates into two part of which rolls in the gap between the cylinders causing a dramatic change of the fluctuating lift and drag forces this is why the oscillation frequency of the upstream cylinder for t d 1 57 deviates compared to the other cases of the spacing ratio t d 2 57 3 57 and 4 57 in addition the dominant frequency of the downstream cylinder is lower than that of the single cylinder due to the wake shielding effect caused by the upstream cylinder and it does not change with varying spacing in the range 5 0 v r 12 0 when the reduced velocity increases past v r 12 0 the downstream cylinder with t d 1 57 has smaller response frequency than that with the other three spacing cases the two tandem cylinders have an equal frequency for t d 1 57 because for those test parameters the two cylinders oscillate in synchronization as a pair 3 2 fluid forces acting on two tandem cylinders hydrodynamic force coefficients which play a significant role in predicting fiv in the engineering field are worth studying larsen and halse 1997 chaplin et al 2005 the transverse force on an oscillatory cylinder can be decomposed into two parts one is in phase with the structural velocity and is referred to as lift the other is in phase with the structural acceleration and is referred to as the added mass force gopalkrishnan 1993 the hydrodynamic features of two oscillatory cylinders are more complicated than those of an isolated one due to the interaction between adjacent cylinders the fluid forces acting on two elastically mounted rigid cylinders in tandem arrangement will be thoroughly discussed in the following section the c y is the instantaneous fluid force coefficient here the c ymax represents the maximum amplitude of the total fluid force coefficient which was calculated by averaging the largest 10 c y in the time varying history fig 6 shows the c ymax of two cylinders in tandem versus the reduced velocity the plotted lines are the counterparts of those presented figs 4 and 5 previous numerical results of two smooth elastically mounted cylinders at different tandem spacings but for lower reynolds numbers are also plotted for comparison papaioannou et al 2008 prasanth and mittal 2009 the c ymax of the upstream cylinder shows good agreement with the single cylinder results for spacing greater than 2 57 cylinder diameter this observation corresponds to the results of the response amplitude presented in fig 4 the c ymax declines as the reduced velocity increases this trend was also observed in the research work by papaioannou et al 2008 and prasanth and mittal 2009 for the case with t d 1 57 much higher c ymax of the upstream cylinder is observed compared to the single cylinder case until the reduced velocity reaches 8 23 for the downstream cylinder the varying behavior of the c ymax is not similar to that of the single cylinder in addition the three cases with t d 2 57 3 57 and 4 57 share nearly the same trend the peak values of the c ymax increase with the decrease of spacing in our tests due to the difference in reynolds number of about three orders of magnitude the force on the downstream cylinder in the wake of the upstream cylinder is very different from previous results by papaioannou et al 2008 and prasanth and mittal 2009 for both upstream and downstream cylinders the peak value of c ymax appears at a much lower value of v r than the ones at which maximum displacements occur in the transverse direction in addition the peak values of c ymax gradually decrease to nearly zero as the reduced velocity increases from 8 23 to 20 4 fig 7 shows the phase differences φ between the total force on the cylinder and its transverse displacement and how it varies with the reduced velocity for the upstream and downstream cylinders for each spacing ratio tested the phase difference was obtained by using eq 10 the previous numerical results of two cylinders in tandem by papaioannou et al 2008 and prasanth and mittal 2009 as well as experimental results of the single cylinder are also plotted in fig 7 for the upstream cylinder it is observed that the total fluid force and transverse response are almost in phase until a jump from nearly 4 to 178 at v r 7 0 with t d 2 57 3 57 and 4 57 this feature is also observed in the experiment of the single cylinder subject to viv however for the small spacing case t d 1 57 the jump occurs at v r 9 0 and then a sudden drop from nearly 153 to 25 appears at v r 14 0 that is the transverse fluid force and displacement are in phase again while the reduced velocity increases to a large value and the response amplitude grows as shown in fig 4 the phase angle between the force and the response of the downstream cylinder with respect to the reduced velocity is not similar to those of the upstream cylinder the sudden increase of phase angle from nearly 25 to 145 is observed at v r 9 5 12 5 for the three larger spacing cases t d 2 57 3 57 and 4 57 this sudden phase increase occurs at higher reduced velocity v r 18 0 for t 1 57d for both the upstream and downstream cylinders different features between previous numerical results of phase lag by papaioannou et al 2008 and prasanth and mittal 2009 and experimental results in this paper are attributed to large differences in reynolds number and mass damping parameter it should be noted that the tests in this paper are in the trsl3 flow regime zdravkovich 1997 where fiv is very different bernitsas et al 2009 from trsl2 and lower reynolds numbers khalak and williamson 1996 fig 8 shows the added mass coefficients c a of two cylinders in tandem with respect to the reduced velocity the added mass coefficient of the upstream cylinder for spacing ratio t d 2 57 3 57 and 4 57 agrees well with the results of the single cylinder notably the downstream cylinder has much larger added mass coefficient compared to that of the upstream cylinder for three spacing ratios t d 2 57 3 57 and 4 57 the added mass coefficients of the two tandem cylinders decrease as the reduced velocity increases a small peak appears at v r 14 in other words the added mass coefficient decreases with the reduced velocity resulting in a natural frequency which increases with the reduced velocity see fig 5 however for small spacing ratio t d 1 57 the variation of added mass coefficients versus the reduced velocity is more complex with a very pronounced increase at v r 16 for both the upstream and downstream cylinders the added mass coefficients decline at v r 11 4 and a slow climb till v r 15 9 then a decrease occurs fig 9 presents the lift force coefficients c l of two tandem cylinders with respect to the reduced velocity note that the lift force coefficient is calculated by eq 11 in section 2 the upstream cylinder as well as the single cylinder share nearly similar variation trend of the lift force coefficient for all four spacing values in addition the lift force coefficient of the downstream cylinder changes sharply for t d 1 57 2 57 and 3 57 while reduced velocity is less than 7 0 the lift force coefficients for both the upstream and downstream cylinders diminish approximately to zero at largely reduced velocity in addition the lift force coefficients are clearly always followed by a declining trend suggests the self limiting mechanism of fiv 3 3 interaction between two tandem cylinders as shown in figs 4 6 the displacement amplitude response frequency and total fluid force coefficient of the upstream and downstream cylinders in tandem are significantly different for the two cylinders close to each other t d 1 57 compared to larger spacing in addition the experimental results show a similar trend as well as similar magnitude for the larger spacing ratio t d 3 57 and 4 57 next the interaction between upstream and downstream cylinders is investigated further in the previous sections the reduced velocity was calculated by using the free flow velocity of the water channel however the actual mean flow velocity to the downstream cylinder differs from the free flow velocity due to the wake shielding effect caused by the upstream cylinder it is suggested that certain fiv characteristics of the downstream cylinder are dependent upon the local reduced velocity huang and herfjord 2013 which is defined as 16 v r n u n f 0 d where u n is the local flow velocity it was not measured during the experiment in this work herein the wake velocity model proposed by schlichting 1968 which was modified by huse 1993 and applied by huang and herfjord 2013 is adopted 17 u n u u 0 18 u 0 u c d d t v t 19 t v 4 d c d where u 0 is the maximum wake velocity deficit at the wake centerline the c d is the drag coefficient which can be obtained from the relation between re and c d in blevins 1990 it should be pointed out that the original expression of eqs 17 19 was firstly developed for the mean turbulent wake flow behind a circular cylinder and this expression is valid only for the far wake schlichting 1968 hence for analyzing the near wake region a modification was developed by huse 1993 nevertheless for the purpose of comparison the displacement amplitudes response frequencies and total fluid force coefficients of the two tandem cylinders with respect to the local reduced velocity v rn as defined by eq 16 are re plotted in fig 10 it should be noted that the reduced velocity of the upstream cylinder is equal to its local reduced velocity the case of the single cylinder is also plotted in fig 10 it is observed that the displacement amplitude curve of the downstream cylinder shifts to lower local reduced velocity see fig 10a lock in occurs at much lower local reduced velocity as presented in fig 10b the total fluid force coefficient of the downstream cylinder was evaluated using the local wake velocity and is drawn in fig 10c it appears that the total fluid force coefficients of two tandem cylinders have a similar trend for v rn 6 0 for all four spacing values tested and for the single cylinder this strongly suggests that fiv of the downstream cylinder is strongly influenced by its own reduced velocity as well as that of the upstream cylinder the results in fig 10 at least provide obvious evidence on the importance of including both the influence of the upstream cylinder and the actual wake flow to the downstream cylinder as mentioned in the experiments on tandem cylinders reported by hover and triantafyllou 2001 assi et al 2006 2010 and korkischko and meneghini 2010 the upstream cylinder remains always fixed and the transverse response of the downstream cylinder was studied experimentally wiv is a fluid elastic mechanism able to excite into oscillatory motion a bluff body immersed in the wake generated from another body positioned upstream despite the fact that the typical response presents a build up of amplitude for higher reduced velocities and is similar to galloping the findings by new measurements and cfd simulations suggest that the fluid forces in the transverse direction on the downstream cylinder are due to vortex shedding and they are enhanced by vortices coming from the upstream cylinder hence wiv is different from galloping like vibrations assi et al 2006 fig 11 presents a comparison of the displacement amplitude of the downstream cylinder between present tests and previous experimental results from hover and triantafyllou 2001 assi et al 2010 and korkischko and meneghini 2010 several spacing ratios such as t d 4 75 in hover and triantafyllou 2001 t d 4 0 and 5 0 in assi et al 2010 and t d 2 0 3 0 4 0 5 0 in korkischko and meneghini 2010 were selected in previous experiments continuous increase in amplitude with reduced velocity is observed in fig 11 this indicates a wiv type of response for different spacing ratios in this paper the downstream cylinder of the present tests mainly shows the viv like response for all four spacing ratios tested there are significant differences in experimental results between previous research work hover and triantafyllou 2001 assi et al 2010 korkischko and meneghini 2010 and the results in this paper these are attributed to the following two basic differences between them a in our tests both cylinders are allowed to oscillate creating a time dependent offset and spacing between the cylinders b in the present tests the reynolds number is an order of magnitude higher than tests in the trsl2 flow regime resulting in a fully turbulent shear layer shorter formation length and stronger vorticity inducing the well known high lift in the trsl3 flow regime zdravkovich 1997 bernitsas et al 2009 bernitsas 2016 both of these factors affect the interaction between shear layers from the upstream body and the downstream body in a way that breaks the pattern of shear layers rolling up after the downstream cylinder creating the wiv driving mechanism fig 12 shows the dimensionless dominant frequency of the downstream cylinder in the two cylinder tandem configuration in order to compare with previous tests of the oscillation of the downstream cylinder in the wake of a stationary upstream cylinder some test data from assi et al 2010 with a spacing ratio of 4 0 and korkischko and meneghini 2010 with four spacing ratios t d 2 0 3 0 4 0 and 5 0 are also plotted in fig 12 it is worth noting that at higher reduced velocities the frequencies of transverse vibration for all three spacing ratios t d 3 0 4 0 and 5 0 in korkischko and meneghini 2010 gradually become nearly equal and stay above the natural frequency of the vibrating system in addition the dominant response frequency of the downstream cylinder with t d 2 0 is much larger than the other three spacing cases in their tests the response frequency in assi et al 2010 is close to the present experimental results for three spacing ratios t d 2 57 3 57 and 4 57 however a different trend in response frequency is observed in this paper in the case of the two cylinders in close proximity for t d 1 57 the response frequency gradually increases at 5 0 v r 10 8 the maximum response frequency achieved in the experiment is about 1 28 a decrease of response frequency with an increase in reduced velocity is shown at 11 4 v r 15 3 with a minimum value of response frequency of 1 06 at v r 15 9 then the frequency goes up again as the reduced velocity increases to better understand this phenomenon and provide a plausible explanation the following should be considered a at v r 15 9 where the minimum occurs in the frequency of oscillation see fig 12 a local maximum occurs in the added mass c a in fig 8b increase in c a causes a reduction in the natural frequency in water affecting similarly the frequency of oscillation while the denominator in f y f 0 is not affected b increased added mass indicates that the phase between force and acceleration reduces this is consistent with fig 7 showing phase φ between force and displacement shifting close to φ 180 c finally for t d 1 57 where f y f 0 deeps and the minimum occurs the two cylinders move in phase resulting in increased added mass 4 conclusions the fiv of two tandem cylinders with four spacing ratios t d 1 57 2 57 3 57 and 4 57 at subcritical reynolds numbers re 2 86 104 1 14 105 the low mass damping parameter m ζ 0 0269 m 1 343 ζ 0 02 was experimentally investigated in the low turbulence surface water ltfsw channel of the mrelab the reynolds number places the present tests in the trsl3 flow regime where high lift occurs due to the fully turbulent state of the shear layers based upon the presented experimental results and the corresponding discussion the following conclusions can be drawn 1 the maximum response amplitudes of the upstream and downstream cylinders in the experiment are 1 41d and 1 71d respectively these amplitudes are much larger than those in numerical studies papaioannou et al 2008 prasanth and mittal 2009 and experimental tests kim et al 2009 in addition the range of synchronization measured in the response amplitude curves is much wider in the experiment than in the aforementioned studies papaioannou et al 2008 prasanth and mittal 2009 kim et al 2009 2 the fiv characteristics of the upstream cylinder including displacement amplitude response frequency added mass coefficient and total fluid force coefficient for the higher spacing ratios tested t d 2 57 3 57 and 4 57 are similar with those of the single cylinder when the reduced velocity does not exceed 12 0 that means that for larger spacing ratios the upstream cylinder is insignificantly affected by the downstream cylinder for the cases with the smaller spacing ratio of 1 57 the upstream cylinder shows galloping like vibrations manifested as a divergent displacement amplitude this phenomenon is consistent with the experimental findings by kim et al 2009 on the features of fiv of two elastically supported cylinders in tandem in a closed circuit wind tunnel the downstream cylinder mainly shows the viv like response for all four spacing ratios tested 3 the vibration of and the fluid force on the downstream cylinder are strongly affected by the upstream cylinder in all four spacing ratios in the experiment moreover the fiv response of the downstream cylinder is obviously dependent upon the local reduced velocity which is calculated based upon an estimated mean wake velocity the experimental results indicate that the displacement amplitude curve of the downstream cylinder shifts to lower local reduced velocity and lock in occurs at much lower local reduced velocity the total fluid force coefficients of the two cylinders in a tandem arrangement for all four spacing values tested are similar to those of the single cylinder for local reduced velocity larger than 6 0 it is known that even for a single cylinder very close proximity to the bottom boundary or free surface affects vortex shedding and may even suppress viv raghavan et al 2009 chung 2016 the further experimental investigation should be conducted to understand fiv of two cylinders near a free surface or a bottom boundary such information would be very useful in harnessing hydrokinetic energy using fiv when cylinders operate in shallow waters as in rivers and streams moreover there are several important parameters t d re m ζ v r for understanding the fiv mechanism of two tandem cylinders it is very difficult to connect these parameters and investigate their interrelationships hence the effect of reynolds number on the synchronization range and amplitude of fiv for two tandem cylinders system has not been documented well in laboratory or field tests which

22998,the performance of an oscillating water column device with l shape chamber has been investigated experimentally to explore beneficial aspects of the implemented geometrical configuration this work is mainly focused on the assessment of the primary efficiency as well as the amplification factor of the device the obtained results revealed that the wave characteristics have prominent effects on the device performance which is improved in the frequency ranges near to the natural frequency of the system by reducing the immersion depth of the device keywords l shaped duct owc primary efficiency amplification factor draft of owc 1 introduction applications of various types of wave energy converter wec devices have been developed in recent years to harness the vast amount of wave renewable energy resources it is expected that the increasing trend of research and development carried out in the field of wecs will be pursued due to limitations of fossil energy resources and environmental pollution oscillating water column owc devices are one of the well developed wave energy converters devised yet the working concept of the owc devices is to confine the specific volume of water by a reservoir which is immersed partially in the water with the open end on the air side of the air chamber the power take off unit normally consists of a high speed air turbine under the action of the waves the water pressure at the immersed end will fluctuate and enforce the reciprocity motions to the water column confined inside the cylinder chamber hence the air trapped above the water column inside the chamber will also be enforced to compress and decompress as well the fluctuating motions of the air will eventually drive the turbine owc devices have obvious advantages which make them distinguished against many of the other types of wec devices in which there is no moving part installed in underwater level and hence access to the power take off unit is straightforward a comprehensive set of investigations have been carried out so far to explore the hydrodynamic characteristics of owc devices the influences of incident wave parameters as well as the damping imposed to the system due to the power take off unit in conventional types of owc devices are studied using numerical and experimental approaches in previous research works lópez et al 2015 iturrioz et al 2015 rezanejad et al 2017 kou et al 2017 various aspects of the hydrodynamic behavior of the owc devices as well as corresponding structural loadings are also investigated in several previous studies in this regard thiruvenkatasamy and neelamani 1997 investigated the hydrodynamic characteristics of owc devices in arrays by implementing an experimental study they found out that the appropriate spacing between chambers of owc devices installed in arrays would be three times of the width of the chambers to obtain the optimum performance viviano et al 2016 performed an experimental study using a large scale model test and studied the wave loads on the structure of the owc devices by doing the reflection analysis of waves in the tank they concluded that an owc structure can serve as a wave absorber for reducing wave reflection thus it can be integrated in vertical wall breakwaters ning et al 2016a simulated the owc device in time domain using the fully non linear acceleration potential method and estimated the forced exerted to the structure of the device they validated the obtained results by carrying out a set of experiments iturrioz et al 2014 presented a simplified time domain model to analyze the performance of the owc device and validated the introduced model by experimental method as well as cfd model müller and whittaker 1995 conducted the flow visualization experiments on a 2d model to investigate flow patterns and energy dissipating mechanisms it was found that large vortices develop around the comparatively thin front wall for in and outflow xu et al 2016 studied a cylindrical owc device using both numerical and experimental approaches the influence of the power take of unit was modelled by an orifice in the experimental study to simulate a quadratic pto mechanism the viscous effects were applied in their introduced numerical model and the quadratic pto model was linearized to perform frequency domain analysis they validated the numerical model using experimental data and concluded that the viscous loss could be noticeable for shorter waves he and huang 2014 carried out experimental investigations to explore the influence of pile supported owc devices which acts as a fixed breakwater it is detected that remarkable improvements in the performance of the system as a breakwater can be gained comparing with other conventional types of pile supported breakwaters the high cost of energy production in wec devices is probably the main barrier to their development and commercialization hence several concepts have been proposed and investigations carried out to deal with this challenge e g incorporating wec devices into multi purpose platforms utilizing wec devices in arrays as an energy park improving performance of wec devices e g in the hydrodynamic characteristics or pto units and using more efficient and low cost technologies in this context some recent investigations on to the hydrodynamic characteristics of owc devices to deal with above mentioned challenge are briefly addressed as follows prominent studies have been accomplished in early literature to investigate the conditions that might enhance the performance of the owc devices the seabed influence is one of these factors which can affect the hydrodynamic performance in this regard wang et al 2002 studied the influence of different bottom slopes located outside the chamber of the owc device and illustrated that the corresponding effects would be significant ning et al 2016b conducted an experimental study to evaluate the influence of the bottom slope applied beneath the chamber of the owc device they found that although the bottom slope has little influence on the resonant frequency the optimal hydrodynamic efficiency increases with the increase of bottom slope rezanejad et al 2013 illustrated that by adding a properly designed step in the sea bottom which enforces abrupt changes to the water depth outside of the chamber of the owc device the hydrodynamic efficiency will be improved significantly adding a projecting wall a plate located beneath the device and elongated outside the chamber in front of the floating owc device with negligible motions can lead to analogous improvements ikoma et al 2011 rezanejad and guedes soares 2014 analogously saadat et al 2016 investigated the hydrodynamic behavior of the helmholtz wave energy converter device which is an owc device installed in a narrow channel they reported that resonance in the channel results in amplification of wave height relative to incoming waves and the corresponding wave power available for absorption some investigations have focused on modifying the geometrical characteristics of owc devices to improve the hydrodynamic efficiency tseng et al 2000 studied a multi resonance owc device which could be exploited as a breakwater they detected that the introduced concept has a low capture width due to high energy loss in the chamber dizadji and sajadian 2011 and mahnamfar and altunkaynak 2017 evaluated the influence of the lip angle of the owc chamber and discussed about the corresponding influences on the hydrodynamic behavior of the owc device boccotti 2007 introduced a novel owc device which has the u shaped duct chamber it has been proved by using a set of small scaled field experiments that the introduced concept could have enhanced performance with respect to the conventional types of owc devices boccotti et al 2007 rezanejad et al 2015 introduced a novel owc design with dual chambers installed adjacently parallel to the dominant direction of incident waves in the stepped sea bottom condition they proved that in the properly designed concept the device has quite high performance in a wide range of frequencies with respect to the conventional types of owc devices ning et al 2017 performed detailed investigations on the effects of the chamber geometry of the dual chamber owc concept using higher order boundary element method hobem in the time domain elhanafi et al 2018 compared the hydrodynamic performance of single chamber versus dual chamber offshore stationary owc devices using cfd and found that the dual chamber device provided superior results to the single chamber device especially over the intermediate and long wave periods where the capture width ratio could be improved by a maximum of about 140 ning et al 2018 further developed the efficient concept of dual chamber owc devices and introduced a novel cylindrical owc including double chambers to harvest the wave energy effectively in deep water they developed an analytical model to investigate hydrodynamic characteristics based on the linear potential flow theory and eigenfunction expansion technique the comparison between the results of the single and dual chamber owc wecs shows that the effective frequency bandwidth of the dual chamber owc wec is broader than that of the single chamber owc wec vyzikas et al 2017 carried out an experimental campaign to investigate various geometrical configurations of owc devices and proved that the u shaped duct owc device has improved hydrodynamic efficiency and the corresponding performance could be even improved by adding a ramp with properly designed angle connecting the sea bottom to the opening wave entrance of the device gouaud et al 2010 studied experimentally the hydrodynamic behavior of an owc device in the presence of an underwater mound they observed a significant increase of the capture width ratio due to wave focusing above the mound owcs also have the capability to be utilized as floating devices hence the energy of the waves in energetic offshore zones can be harnessed avoiding the disadvantages of onshore devices e g space limitations visual impacts undesired sounds of air turbine etc the obvious advantages of implementing floating owc fowc devices fostered various attempts to investigate unknown aspects of their hydrodynamic behavior in this regard rapaka et al 2004 carried out an experimental study to investigate motion characteristics as well as mooring forces of a fowc device which can act also as a floating breakwater it should be noted that application of owc devices as breakwaters can cause to reduce the energy production costs as the construction costs being shared basically with the shore protection structures gomes et al 2015a b performed numerical and experimental studies on a small scaled single chamber spar type fowc device linear hydrodynamic coefficients as well as a quasi static slack mooring model and drag forces due to viscous effects were applied in the numerical model the good agreement between numerical results and experimental data was reported except for a small range of wave periods where the device seems to present a nonlinear coupled effect between the heave and pitch motion he et al 2013 2017 carried out a series of experiments to investigate motion characteristics hydrodynamic efficiency and wave transmission and reflection coefficient of a box type floating breakwater supported by owc devices installed symmetrically and also asymmetrically in the fore and rear part of the device they detected that the front chamber always played the main role in power extraction in contrast the power extraction of the rear chamber was only a supplement kelly et al 2013 introduced a v shaped floating wave energy converter consisting of multiple chambers of owc devices they conducted numerical modelling as well as an experimental study to prove the concept and also discussed about the validity and usefulness of the numerical model chen et al 2017 studied the performance of a backward bent duct buoy with the pentagon buoyancy module using an experimental approach it is revealed in their study that the device can capture the energy of waves passing the surrounding area of the device hence the efficiency of the device can be reached to the values greater than unit in the resonance frequencies in continuation of previous research investigations carried out so far to introduce concepts of owc devices which can have improved performance the l shaped duct owc device is considered in this study the idea of using an l shaped duct bent duct as owc chamber has been previously proposed by howe and nader 2017 they mainly focused on investigating influence of the cross section shape of the duct on the hydrodynamic behavior of the device they also assessed the hydrodynamic behavior of the device when it functions within a breakwater or in the standalone isolated condition they found that the implementation of the device within the breakwater significantly enhances the capture width while the variation in inlet geometry cross sectional shape provides low deviations in the results in this context it has been striven in this research work to continue the previously performed research study mainly focusing on assessing the performance and hydrodynamic behavior of the l shaped owc device with respect to various wave conditions furthermore three different drafts are investigated to explore the influence of the wave entrance opening distance from the still water level on the performance of the device 2 primary efficiency of owc the primary efficiency of the owc corresponds to the ratio of the captured power to the incident wave power the captured power from incident waves is converted to the pneumatic form of energy stored in the air trapped inside of the chamber the pneumatic energy of air runs the air turbine which eventually leads to the production of electricity by the generator coupled with the air turbine it is intended in this study to investigate the primary efficiency of the l shaped duct owc device shown in fig 1 in regular waves the primary efficiency η of the owc device in regular waves is given by 1 η w r e g w w where w r e g is the averaged power absorbed from regular waves and w w is the average incident wave power over one wave period the average power absorbed from regular waves w r e g is equal to the pneumatic power transferred to the air inside the chamber of owc device hence it can be determined using experimental data as follows 2 w r e g 1 t m a x 0 t m a x p q d t where t m a x is the duration of the test p is the air pressure inside the owc chamber measured by the pressure gauge sensor and q is the air volume flux through the hole of the owc model it is noteworthy to remark that the influence of the air turbine in owc system is simulated here in this study by means of implementing a hole in the cap of the model whose characteristics will be presented in the next section the available power over one wave period of a monochromatic wave is given by 3 w w e c g where e is the total energy per wave period and c g is the group velocity which are given by dean and dalrymple 2001 4 e 1 2 ρ g b a 2 5 c g 1 2 ω k 1 2 k h sinh 2 k h where ρ is the density of water g is gravitational acceleration b is the width of the owc device perpendicular to the incident wave direction h is the water depth a is the amplitude of the wave ω is the angular frequency of the wave and k is the wave number which can be related to the angular wave frequency via the dispersion relation 6 ω 2 g k tanh k h 3 experimental set up a model of a floating owc device with l shaped duct has been built with a scale factor ε equal to 1 18 ε 1 18 to undertake the experimental investigation the scale factor was designed based on the water depth of the location in which the device was intended to be installed the sketch of the model as well as the built physical model with its corresponding dimensions is shown in fig 1 the dimensions of the artefact were decided in a previous industrial project and the present research study adopted the existing model the main aim of the study is to evaluate the primary efficiency of the floating owc device with negligible motions hence the model is connected rigidly to the structure of the carrier as shown in fig 1 it is noteworthy to remark that the data acquisition system and control facilities are positioned on the structure of the carrier the following three main non dimensional values have a dominant influence on the primary performance of owc devices froude number fr reynolds number re and dimensionless pressure p the froude and reynolds similarities cannot be satisfied simultaneously in the model testing of floating objects the effects due to variations in froude number are almost always much more important than those associated with changes in reynolds number falcão and henriques 2014 sheng et al 2014 hence froude number is kept on the basis of the lessons learnt in previous studies and reynolds number is ignored as a modelling rule it should be noted that it is required to consider large quantities of air volume inside the owc chamber if the dimensionless pressure is intended to be applied simultaneously with considering froude similarity rule in the experimental setup in this regard large air reservoirs should be connected to the air chamber of the owc model to provide corresponding volume of air participating in the energy absorption however this technique is normally applicable for large model testing conditions and hence the simulation of the air compressibility effects is ignored in the experimental setup used for this study the model is built from plexiglas material as it has appropriate mechanical strength furthermore it is less cumbersome to design and build the model using plexiglas material with respect to the other commonly used materials the transparency of the plexiglas material also allowed to observe the motions of the inside water free surface as the scale factor for owc model in this study has been chosen equal to 1 18 it is not practical to simulate the influence of the power take off system with a mini turbine this is due to the reason that the chosen scale factor corresponds to a power ratio equal to 1 24743 according to the froude similarity rule which makes it unfeasible to measure the corresponding small values of the power using typical instrumentations in the laboratory hence the power take off unit has been simulated as a circular orifice hole to apply the equivalent influence of the impulse turbine the reason for choosing an orifice for simulating the turbine effects being that the pressure drop across the orifice varies quadraticaly with the flow rate as it does across an impulse turbine lópez et al 2014 the impulse turbine has been chosen as the acting power take off unit due to the reason that it has quite enhanced performance with respect to other pto units commonly used for owc devices the diameter of the circular hole is selected equal to 35 mm the ratio of the cross sectional area of the hole to the water free surface area inside the device is consequently equal to 0 89 it should be remarked that the ratio of cross sectional area is designed equal to 0 89 using the experiences achieved in the past investigations which reported that the best performance of the owc devices mainly occurs when the corresponding ratio of cross sectional areas of the hole and owc is around 1 e g ashlin et al 2016 illustrated that the best energy absorption is obtained when the slot area is about 0 68 of the owc area it should be remarked that the optimal value of the opening ratio is expected to depend on the geometrical shape of the device it should be obtained by carrying out a parametric study on this factor which has been left for future work the experiments were conducted in the wave tank of etsin universidad politécnica de madrid which has the width and length equal to 3 8 m and 96 m respectively the water depth is set to 2 2 m and is kept constant during all the experiments the sketch of the wave tank as well as the location of the model and installed sensors wave gauges and air pressure sensor are illustrated in fig 2 a wave absorbing beach with a ramp shape configuration is installed at the end of the tank to dissipate the energy of waves propagated to that point the tank is equipped with a flap type wave generator paddle to generate regular waves as shown in fig 2 the model is positioned 56 m away from the wave generator paddle to maintain proper space between them hence till the occurrence of any wave reflections upon on the wave generator and approaching again to the model there is be enough time to record the waves with monotonic pattern three different drafts equal to d 33 5 38 5 and 43 5 cm have been applied to the vertical position of the model to evaluate the corresponding effects on the performance of the device in order to measure the free surface elevation outside the model three capacitance wave gauges wg2 wg3 and wg4 are installed in the wave flume as shown in fig 2 furthermore one capacitance wave sensor wg1 is positioned inside the chamber of the owc model as well as one air pressure gauge sensor the sampling frequency of all sensors is 20 hz the data gathered from the wave gauges wg2 wg3 and wg4 are used to analyze the incident and reflected wave characteristics during each experiment on the other hand the data measured from the wg1 sensor and the pressure gauge is used to evaluate the energy absorbed from the incoming waves in this regard the free surface elevation ζ measured by the wg1 and wg4 sensors located inside and outside of the owc model as well as air pressure measured by the pressure gauge sensor are illustrated in fig 3 for a regular wave with period and height equal to 2 s and 0 03 m respectively it can be observed from fig 3 that the amplitude of the free surface oscillations as well as the amplitude of the pressure become stable and tend to have a constant value during the time window from 50 s to around 90 s hence there would be enough sampling of waves with stable pattern to analyze the incident and reflected wave characteristics and also to evaluate captured power as aforementioned in the experimental campaign the l shaped duct owc device has been tested with three different draft values in the regular wave conditions sixteen wave periods t 1 1 2 4 s and two wave heights h 0 03 and 0 06 m are combined for the two draft values d 38 5 and 43 5 cm in the case that the draft value is equal to d 33 5 cm the tests for the wave height equal to 0 06 cm are removed and only 0 03 cm wave height is considered due to the occurrence of large splashing of water particles in total 96 tests have been carried out in the experimental campaign it is also noteworthy to remark that the quality of the tests done in this experimental investigation has been checked finding that the repeatability and uncertainly of the data measured by the sensors as well as the waves generated by the paddle remain in an acceptable range 4 evaluation of the performance the primary efficiency of the owc device in regular waves can be estimated using the simple mathematical expression stated in eq 1 hence each of the terms expressed in the numerator w r e g and denominator w w of this equation should be estimated using the experimental data the average power absorbed from regular waves w r e g can be evaluated by numerically approximating the integral in eq 2 for the time window t m a x in which the recorded data becomes stable in this context the air pressure data inside the chamber p can be directly picked up from the data measured by the pressure sensor as it does not normally contain energetic noises for estimating the air volume flux q in eq 2 it is assumed that the corresponding air flow is acting as an incompressible flow due to the small volume of air trapped inside of the model hence the air volume flux q can be calculated implementing the water free surface elevation ζ i inside of the owc detected by the wave gauge sensor as follows 7 q l b d 3 ζ i where l is the length of the water free surface plane inside the chamber parallel to the incident wave direction which is 200 mm in this study b is the width of the water free surface plane inside the chamber perpendicular to the incident wave direction which is 540 mm in this study and d 3 ζ i is the third order approximation to the time derivative of the free surface elevation which can be expressed as follows 8 d 3 ζ i 11 ζ i 18 ζ i 1 9 ζ i 2 2 ζ i 3 6 δ t where δ t 0 05 s is the time step between two consecutive data points in order to determine the incident wave power the data measured by the wave gauges wg2 wg3 and wg4 are used to estimate the energy spectrum s of the incoming waves as part of the incoming waves is always reflected upon intercepting the model the data measured by the wave gauges are the combination of both incoming and reflected waves in this regard the method of mansard and funke 1980 is used to decompose incoming and reflected wave data from each other and on that basis the energy spectrum of the incoming waves is determined as only regular waves are considered in this study it is expected that the corresponding spectra of incident and reflected waves are narrow banded containing only the frequency component of the corresponding generated wave in this regard incident and reflected wave spectra plotted with respect to the angular frequency ω for the case that h 0 03 m and t 1 s are illustrated in fig 4 it can be observed that the corresponding spectra are narrow banded with the peak occurring in ω 6 28 rad s or t 1 s the reflected spectrum has lower energy than the incident wave due to absorption of some part of the incoming wave energy by the device as the incident wave spectrum is determined the average incident wave energy flux w w can be calculated as follows 9 w w b ρ g 0 s ω c g ω d ω where c g ω is the group velocity calculated from eq 5 it is noteworthy to remark that the average incident wave energy flux is not estimated using the theoretical formula given by eq 3 as the precise height of the generated incident wave is not known yet hence the incident wave energy flux is calculated in a more straightforward way using eq 9 however as the spectrum of the incident wave is obtained for each of the case studies the significant wave height h s and the height of the corresponding regular wave h can be obtained simply as follows 10a h s 4 m 0 10b h 2 a h s 2 2 2 m 0 where a is the amplitude of the incident wave and m 0 0 s ω d ω as the incident wave amplitude a is determined from the measured experimental data using eq 10b the corresponding amplification factor a f ratio of the amplitude of the vertical oscillations of the free surface inside the chamber to the amplitude of the incident waves can be estimated as 11 a f a ζ a where a ζ is the mean amplitude of vertical displacement of the free surface plane inside the owc device for the corresponding regular waves it should be noted that the nature of the experiments is 3d although the implemented approach to do the reflection analysis is 2d however the incident waves propagating toward the model have still 2d nature while the reflected waves have 3d nature as they are diffracted by the model hence the implemented approach can correctly estimate the energy of the incident waves as they are propagating in 2d on the other hand there are some uncertainties regarding the precision of the results achieved for the reflected waves due to 3d effects however only the incident wave energy flux is used for the analysis of the performance of the system as well as for the estimation of the amplification factor therefore the presented results in this investigation are not influenced by the abovementioned uncertainties regarding the reflected wave energy the incident wave energy flux w w estimated based on the experimental measurements using eq 9 for the cases that h 0 03 and 0 06 m as well as the corresponding theoretical values calculated based on eq 3 are presented in fig 5 with respect to the wave period as can be seen in this figure the incident wave fluxes estimated from experimental data do not match with the theoretical values due to the reason that the wave generator could not generate waves precisely with the desired height characteristics in this regard fig 6 demonstrates the variations occurred in the height of the generated regular waves which is calculated using eq 10b with respect to the period as it is evident from this figure the generated waves do not reach the desired values of height specifically for the higher periods and the case that the desired wave height is 0 06 m hence the occurrence of the above mentioned phenomenon justifies the reason for using eq 9 instead of eq 3 to estimate the primary efficiency of the device 5 results and discussion it is reported in the previous research studies that the wave characteristics have a prominent influence on the performance of owc devices lópez et al 2015 rezanejad et al 2017 hence an experimental campaign is carried out in this study to investigate the influence of regular wave heights and periods on the performance of the device with the three different drafts d 33 5 38 5 and 43 5 cm in this context the variations of the amplification factor a f with respect to the wave period for two wave heights h 3 and 6 cm are illustrated in figs 7 and 8 for the drafts equal to 38 5 and 43 5 cm respectively as it can be seen in these figures the amplification factor is lower than one for the low periods meaning that small oscillations of the free surface occurred inside the chamber of the device hence the occurrence of low primary efficiency is expected for low periods in all the case studies furthermore it can be observed from these figures that increasing the wave height causes a general reduction in the amplification factor values with the shifted peak to a higher period the reason may be described by assuming the owc device as a simple one degree of freedom dof mass spring and dashpot oscillating system in this regard rezanejad and guedes soares 2017 interpreted the global behavior of single chamber owc devices by introducing a simplified formulation which corresponds to the one dof systems the amplitude of the water column motions inside the owc device as well as the primary efficiency of the device can be approximately determined as 12 x 0 f 0 k 1 1 β 2 2 2 ζ β 2 13 η η m a x 1 1 1 β 2 2 ζ β 2 where x 0 is the absolute amplitude of the motions of the oscillating column inside the device f 0 is the absolute amplitude of the force applied from incoming waves to the oscillating mass water column k is the restoring force which mainly corresponds to the hydrostatic forces β ω ω ω is the angular frequency of forcing function frequency of waves ω k m is the natural frequency of the system m is the oscillating mass in the case of owc device m is the mass of water surrounded by the chamber of device with its corresponding added mass η is the primary efficiency η m a x is the maximum value of the primary efficiency and ζ is the damping of the system which generally has a value between zero and unit the maximum absolute value of the motion amplitude x 0 occurs when 14 ω ω 1 2 ζ 2 as the influence of the power take off unit is simulated in this study by applying an orifice in the experimental model increasing the wave height leads to an increase in the flow rate through the orifice which causes an increase in the damping of the system ζ it is evident from eqs 12 and 14 that increasing the damping parameter equivalent to increasing the wave height reduces the amplitude of motions and causes the peak of the corresponding curve to shift to a lower frequency or to a higher period as it was seen earlier in figs 7 and 8 the variations of the primary efficiency η of the studied owc device with respect to the wave periods for two wave heights h 3 and 6 cm are presented in figs 9 and 10 for the drafts equal to 38 5 and 43 5 cm respectively as was predicted earlier from figs 7 and 8 the device has small primary efficiency in small wave periods due to the small amplification factors occurring in this condition the peak of all efficiency curves occurs in the period equal to 1 6 s and is not influenced by variations applied to the wave height in other words it is not affected by the damping of the system as the damping is a function of the wave height which is well predicted by eq 13 in this context it is clear from eq 13 that the maximum primary efficiency occurs when β tends to have the unit value or in other words the frequency of waves coincides with the natural frequency of the system irrespective of the damping value by considering the simple hydrostatic assumptions the natural frequency of an owc device is predicted to be occurring approximately at ω g l where l is the length of the chamber of owc device immersed in the water rezanejad et al 2013 hence by substituting the average length of the immersed part of the l duct owc device as the l parameter in the above expression the approximate natural period of the system is estimated to be occurring at t 1 50 1 56 and 1 62 s corresponding to draft values equal to d 33 5 38 5 and 43 5 cm respectively the predicted values are close to the occurred peaks of primary efficiency curves in figs 9 and 10 however as the experiments are carried out in the period intervals equal to 0 2 s the resolution of the examined periods is not fine enough to precisely detect the occurrence period of the peaks hence the peaks of the performance curve for all the drafts are detected at t 1 6 s in the experimental campaign furthermore the peak of the amplification factor curves occurs in the period higher than the corresponding period of the peak of the efficiency curve which is also predicted by eq 14 this is due to the reason that the peak of the efficiency curve occurs when ω ω according to eq 13 while the peak of the amplification factor curve occurs at frequencies less than the natural frequency of the device according to eq 14 as the damping parameter ζ has a positive value it can be observed from figs 9 and 10 that increasing the wave height reduces the efficiency of the device at the periods approximately less than 2 1 s and vice versa for the larger periods the reason might be due to increasing the wave nonlinearity effects occurred when the wave height increases in low periods in this case as wave nonlinearity increases so do the wave energy transfers from fundamental to higher order components consequently as the higher harmonics with shorter wavelength can be reflected more easily upon interacting with the owc device than the fundamental wave component the performance is reduced by increasing the wave height in the low periods see wang et al 2018 for further details furthermore the growing influence of the viscous effects as the wave height increases might be another reason for reducing the performance in low wave periods less than 2 1 s as the energy loss of the system increases on the other hand increasing the wave height will also increase the damping of the power take off unit ζ which can provide a better energy absorption capacity in the system for a range of periods we attribute to this reason the improvement of the efficiency curve caused by increasing the wave height for the periods greater than 2 1 s in this study in order to investigate the influence of the immersion depth of the device three different draft values d 33 5 38 5 and 43 5 cm are applied in the experimental campaign the influence of the draft of the device on the amplification factor coefficient as well as primary efficiency of the device is shown in figs 11 and 12 respectively it can be observed from these figures that the variations applied to the draft of the device do not impose significant changes to the amplification factor and performance of the device except in the frequencies near to the natural frequency of the device as it was stated earlier the corresponding period of the natural frequency of the device occurs approximately at 1 6 s the performance of the device and amplification factor is enhanced in the periods around 1 6 s by reducing the draft of the device this could be due to the fact that reducing the draft of the device may provide a more appropriate condition for incoming waves to interact with the oscillating column confined inside the chamber as the distance of the wave entrance of the device from water level is reduced 6 conclusions the l shaped duct oscillating water column device has been investigated in this research study based on an experimental approach a campaign of experiments has been carried out to investigate the influence of the wave characteristics as well as the immersion depth on the hydrodynamic performance of the device by analyzing the obtained results from the experiments it is found that the owc device with l shaped chamber acts similarly as a simple one degree of freedom oscillatory system the occurrence period of the peak of the amplification factor mainly depends on the natural frequency of the oscillations and the damping of the power take off unit hence increasing the wave height causes a shift occurring at the peak of the amplification factor to a higher period as the damping of the system increases on the other hand the occurrence period of the peak of the primary efficiency is solely dependent to the natural frequency of the system hence it is not influenced due to the variations applied in the incident wave height the amplification factor as well as performance of the device is enhanced by reducing the immersion depth of the device as the appropriate condition for proper interaction of the waves with the owc device is improved acknowledgements this study was performed within the strategic research plan of the centre for marine technology and ocean engineering which is financed by portuguese foundation for

22998,the performance of an oscillating water column device with l shape chamber has been investigated experimentally to explore beneficial aspects of the implemented geometrical configuration this work is mainly focused on the assessment of the primary efficiency as well as the amplification factor of the device the obtained results revealed that the wave characteristics have prominent effects on the device performance which is improved in the frequency ranges near to the natural frequency of the system by reducing the immersion depth of the device keywords l shaped duct owc primary efficiency amplification factor draft of owc 1 introduction applications of various types of wave energy converter wec devices have been developed in recent years to harness the vast amount of wave renewable energy resources it is expected that the increasing trend of research and development carried out in the field of wecs will be pursued due to limitations of fossil energy resources and environmental pollution oscillating water column owc devices are one of the well developed wave energy converters devised yet the working concept of the owc devices is to confine the specific volume of water by a reservoir which is immersed partially in the water with the open end on the air side of the air chamber the power take off unit normally consists of a high speed air turbine under the action of the waves the water pressure at the immersed end will fluctuate and enforce the reciprocity motions to the water column confined inside the cylinder chamber hence the air trapped above the water column inside the chamber will also be enforced to compress and decompress as well the fluctuating motions of the air will eventually drive the turbine owc devices have obvious advantages which make them distinguished against many of the other types of wec devices in which there is no moving part installed in underwater level and hence access to the power take off unit is straightforward a comprehensive set of investigations have been carried out so far to explore the hydrodynamic characteristics of owc devices the influences of incident wave parameters as well as the damping imposed to the system due to the power take off unit in conventional types of owc devices are studied using numerical and experimental approaches in previous research works lópez et al 2015 iturrioz et al 2015 rezanejad et al 2017 kou et al 2017 various aspects of the hydrodynamic behavior of the owc devices as well as corresponding structural loadings are also investigated in several previous studies in this regard thiruvenkatasamy and neelamani 1997 investigated the hydrodynamic characteristics of owc devices in arrays by implementing an experimental study they found out that the appropriate spacing between chambers of owc devices installed in arrays would be three times of the width of the chambers to obtain the optimum performance viviano et al 2016 performed an experimental study using a large scale model test and studied the wave loads on the structure of the owc devices by doing the reflection analysis of waves in the tank they concluded that an owc structure can serve as a wave absorber for reducing wave reflection thus it can be integrated in vertical wall breakwaters ning et al 2016a simulated the owc device in time domain using the fully non linear acceleration potential method and estimated the forced exerted to the structure of the device they validated the obtained results by carrying out a set of experiments iturrioz et al 2014 presented a simplified time domain model to analyze the performance of the owc device and validated the introduced model by experimental method as well as cfd model müller and whittaker 1995 conducted the flow visualization experiments on a 2d model to investigate flow patterns and energy dissipating mechanisms it was found that large vortices develop around the comparatively thin front wall for in and outflow xu et al 2016 studied a cylindrical owc device using both numerical and experimental approaches the influence of the power take of unit was modelled by an orifice in the experimental study to simulate a quadratic pto mechanism the viscous effects were applied in their introduced numerical model and the quadratic pto model was linearized to perform frequency domain analysis they validated the numerical model using experimental data and concluded that the viscous loss could be noticeable for shorter waves he and huang 2014 carried out experimental investigations to explore the influence of pile supported owc devices which acts as a fixed breakwater it is detected that remarkable improvements in the performance of the system as a breakwater can be gained comparing with other conventional types of pile supported breakwaters the high cost of energy production in wec devices is probably the main barrier to their development and commercialization hence several concepts have been proposed and investigations carried out to deal with this challenge e g incorporating wec devices into multi purpose platforms utilizing wec devices in arrays as an energy park improving performance of wec devices e g in the hydrodynamic characteristics or pto units and using more efficient and low cost technologies in this context some recent investigations on to the hydrodynamic characteristics of owc devices to deal with above mentioned challenge are briefly addressed as follows prominent studies have been accomplished in early literature to investigate the conditions that might enhance the performance of the owc devices the seabed influence is one of these factors which can affect the hydrodynamic performance in this regard wang et al 2002 studied the influence of different bottom slopes located outside the chamber of the owc device and illustrated that the corresponding effects would be significant ning et al 2016b conducted an experimental study to evaluate the influence of the bottom slope applied beneath the chamber of the owc device they found that although the bottom slope has little influence on the resonant frequency the optimal hydrodynamic efficiency increases with the increase of bottom slope rezanejad et al 2013 illustrated that by adding a properly designed step in the sea bottom which enforces abrupt changes to the water depth outside of the chamber of the owc device the hydrodynamic efficiency will be improved significantly adding a projecting wall a plate located beneath the device and elongated outside the chamber in front of the floating owc device with negligible motions can lead to analogous improvements ikoma et al 2011 rezanejad and guedes soares 2014 analogously saadat et al 2016 investigated the hydrodynamic behavior of the helmholtz wave energy converter device which is an owc device installed in a narrow channel they reported that resonance in the channel results in amplification of wave height relative to incoming waves and the corresponding wave power available for absorption some investigations have focused on modifying the geometrical characteristics of owc devices to improve the hydrodynamic efficiency tseng et al 2000 studied a multi resonance owc device which could be exploited as a breakwater they detected that the introduced concept has a low capture width due to high energy loss in the chamber dizadji and sajadian 2011 and mahnamfar and altunkaynak 2017 evaluated the influence of the lip angle of the owc chamber and discussed about the corresponding influences on the hydrodynamic behavior of the owc device boccotti 2007 introduced a novel owc device which has the u shaped duct chamber it has been proved by using a set of small scaled field experiments that the introduced concept could have enhanced performance with respect to the conventional types of owc devices boccotti et al 2007 rezanejad et al 2015 introduced a novel owc design with dual chambers installed adjacently parallel to the dominant direction of incident waves in the stepped sea bottom condition they proved that in the properly designed concept the device has quite high performance in a wide range of frequencies with respect to the conventional types of owc devices ning et al 2017 performed detailed investigations on the effects of the chamber geometry of the dual chamber owc concept using higher order boundary element method hobem in the time domain elhanafi et al 2018 compared the hydrodynamic performance of single chamber versus dual chamber offshore stationary owc devices using cfd and found that the dual chamber device provided superior results to the single chamber device especially over the intermediate and long wave periods where the capture width ratio could be improved by a maximum of about 140 ning et al 2018 further developed the efficient concept of dual chamber owc devices and introduced a novel cylindrical owc including double chambers to harvest the wave energy effectively in deep water they developed an analytical model to investigate hydrodynamic characteristics based on the linear potential flow theory and eigenfunction expansion technique the comparison between the results of the single and dual chamber owc wecs shows that the effective frequency bandwidth of the dual chamber owc wec is broader than that of the single chamber owc wec vyzikas et al 2017 carried out an experimental campaign to investigate various geometrical configurations of owc devices and proved that the u shaped duct owc device has improved hydrodynamic efficiency and the corresponding performance could be even improved by adding a ramp with properly designed angle connecting the sea bottom to the opening wave entrance of the device gouaud et al 2010 studied experimentally the hydrodynamic behavior of an owc device in the presence of an underwater mound they observed a significant increase of the capture width ratio due to wave focusing above the mound owcs also have the capability to be utilized as floating devices hence the energy of the waves in energetic offshore zones can be harnessed avoiding the disadvantages of onshore devices e g space limitations visual impacts undesired sounds of air turbine etc the obvious advantages of implementing floating owc fowc devices fostered various attempts to investigate unknown aspects of their hydrodynamic behavior in this regard rapaka et al 2004 carried out an experimental study to investigate motion characteristics as well as mooring forces of a fowc device which can act also as a floating breakwater it should be noted that application of owc devices as breakwaters can cause to reduce the energy production costs as the construction costs being shared basically with the shore protection structures gomes et al 2015a b performed numerical and experimental studies on a small scaled single chamber spar type fowc device linear hydrodynamic coefficients as well as a quasi static slack mooring model and drag forces due to viscous effects were applied in the numerical model the good agreement between numerical results and experimental data was reported except for a small range of wave periods where the device seems to present a nonlinear coupled effect between the heave and pitch motion he et al 2013 2017 carried out a series of experiments to investigate motion characteristics hydrodynamic efficiency and wave transmission and reflection coefficient of a box type floating breakwater supported by owc devices installed symmetrically and also asymmetrically in the fore and rear part of the device they detected that the front chamber always played the main role in power extraction in contrast the power extraction of the rear chamber was only a supplement kelly et al 2013 introduced a v shaped floating wave energy converter consisting of multiple chambers of owc devices they conducted numerical modelling as well as an experimental study to prove the concept and also discussed about the validity and usefulness of the numerical model chen et al 2017 studied the performance of a backward bent duct buoy with the pentagon buoyancy module using an experimental approach it is revealed in their study that the device can capture the energy of waves passing the surrounding area of the device hence the efficiency of the device can be reached to the values greater than unit in the resonance frequencies in continuation of previous research investigations carried out so far to introduce concepts of owc devices which can have improved performance the l shaped duct owc device is considered in this study the idea of using an l shaped duct bent duct as owc chamber has been previously proposed by howe and nader 2017 they mainly focused on investigating influence of the cross section shape of the duct on the hydrodynamic behavior of the device they also assessed the hydrodynamic behavior of the device when it functions within a breakwater or in the standalone isolated condition they found that the implementation of the device within the breakwater significantly enhances the capture width while the variation in inlet geometry cross sectional shape provides low deviations in the results in this context it has been striven in this research work to continue the previously performed research study mainly focusing on assessing the performance and hydrodynamic behavior of the l shaped owc device with respect to various wave conditions furthermore three different drafts are investigated to explore the influence of the wave entrance opening distance from the still water level on the performance of the device 2 primary efficiency of owc the primary efficiency of the owc corresponds to the ratio of the captured power to the incident wave power the captured power from incident waves is converted to the pneumatic form of energy stored in the air trapped inside of the chamber the pneumatic energy of air runs the air turbine which eventually leads to the production of electricity by the generator coupled with the air turbine it is intended in this study to investigate the primary efficiency of the l shaped duct owc device shown in fig 1 in regular waves the primary efficiency η of the owc device in regular waves is given by 1 η w r e g w w where w r e g is the averaged power absorbed from regular waves and w w is the average incident wave power over one wave period the average power absorbed from regular waves w r e g is equal to the pneumatic power transferred to the air inside the chamber of owc device hence it can be determined using experimental data as follows 2 w r e g 1 t m a x 0 t m a x p q d t where t m a x is the duration of the test p is the air pressure inside the owc chamber measured by the pressure gauge sensor and q is the air volume flux through the hole of the owc model it is noteworthy to remark that the influence of the air turbine in owc system is simulated here in this study by means of implementing a hole in the cap of the model whose characteristics will be presented in the next section the available power over one wave period of a monochromatic wave is given by 3 w w e c g where e is the total energy per wave period and c g is the group velocity which are given by dean and dalrymple 2001 4 e 1 2 ρ g b a 2 5 c g 1 2 ω k 1 2 k h sinh 2 k h where ρ is the density of water g is gravitational acceleration b is the width of the owc device perpendicular to the incident wave direction h is the water depth a is the amplitude of the wave ω is the angular frequency of the wave and k is the wave number which can be related to the angular wave frequency via the dispersion relation 6 ω 2 g k tanh k h 3 experimental set up a model of a floating owc device with l shaped duct has been built with a scale factor ε equal to 1 18 ε 1 18 to undertake the experimental investigation the scale factor was designed based on the water depth of the location in which the device was intended to be installed the sketch of the model as well as the built physical model with its corresponding dimensions is shown in fig 1 the dimensions of the artefact were decided in a previous industrial project and the present research study adopted the existing model the main aim of the study is to evaluate the primary efficiency of the floating owc device with negligible motions hence the model is connected rigidly to the structure of the carrier as shown in fig 1 it is noteworthy to remark that the data acquisition system and control facilities are positioned on the structure of the carrier the following three main non dimensional values have a dominant influence on the primary performance of owc devices froude number fr reynolds number re and dimensionless pressure p the froude and reynolds similarities cannot be satisfied simultaneously in the model testing of floating objects the effects due to variations in froude number are almost always much more important than those associated with changes in reynolds number falcão and henriques 2014 sheng et al 2014 hence froude number is kept on the basis of the lessons learnt in previous studies and reynolds number is ignored as a modelling rule it should be noted that it is required to consider large quantities of air volume inside the owc chamber if the dimensionless pressure is intended to be applied simultaneously with considering froude similarity rule in the experimental setup in this regard large air reservoirs should be connected to the air chamber of the owc model to provide corresponding volume of air participating in the energy absorption however this technique is normally applicable for large model testing conditions and hence the simulation of the air compressibility effects is ignored in the experimental setup used for this study the model is built from plexiglas material as it has appropriate mechanical strength furthermore it is less cumbersome to design and build the model using plexiglas material with respect to the other commonly used materials the transparency of the plexiglas material also allowed to observe the motions of the inside water free surface as the scale factor for owc model in this study has been chosen equal to 1 18 it is not practical to simulate the influence of the power take off system with a mini turbine this is due to the reason that the chosen scale factor corresponds to a power ratio equal to 1 24743 according to the froude similarity rule which makes it unfeasible to measure the corresponding small values of the power using typical instrumentations in the laboratory hence the power take off unit has been simulated as a circular orifice hole to apply the equivalent influence of the impulse turbine the reason for choosing an orifice for simulating the turbine effects being that the pressure drop across the orifice varies quadraticaly with the flow rate as it does across an impulse turbine lópez et al 2014 the impulse turbine has been chosen as the acting power take off unit due to the reason that it has quite enhanced performance with respect to other pto units commonly used for owc devices the diameter of the circular hole is selected equal to 35 mm the ratio of the cross sectional area of the hole to the water free surface area inside the device is consequently equal to 0 89 it should be remarked that the ratio of cross sectional area is designed equal to 0 89 using the experiences achieved in the past investigations which reported that the best performance of the owc devices mainly occurs when the corresponding ratio of cross sectional areas of the hole and owc is around 1 e g ashlin et al 2016 illustrated that the best energy absorption is obtained when the slot area is about 0 68 of the owc area it should be remarked that the optimal value of the opening ratio is expected to depend on the geometrical shape of the device it should be obtained by carrying out a parametric study on this factor which has been left for future work the experiments were conducted in the wave tank of etsin universidad politécnica de madrid which has the width and length equal to 3 8 m and 96 m respectively the water depth is set to 2 2 m and is kept constant during all the experiments the sketch of the wave tank as well as the location of the model and installed sensors wave gauges and air pressure sensor are illustrated in fig 2 a wave absorbing beach with a ramp shape configuration is installed at the end of the tank to dissipate the energy of waves propagated to that point the tank is equipped with a flap type wave generator paddle to generate regular waves as shown in fig 2 the model is positioned 56 m away from the wave generator paddle to maintain proper space between them hence till the occurrence of any wave reflections upon on the wave generator and approaching again to the model there is be enough time to record the waves with monotonic pattern three different drafts equal to d 33 5 38 5 and 43 5 cm have been applied to the vertical position of the model to evaluate the corresponding effects on the performance of the device in order to measure the free surface elevation outside the model three capacitance wave gauges wg2 wg3 and wg4 are installed in the wave flume as shown in fig 2 furthermore one capacitance wave sensor wg1 is positioned inside the chamber of the owc model as well as one air pressure gauge sensor the sampling frequency of all sensors is 20 hz the data gathered from the wave gauges wg2 wg3 and wg4 are used to analyze the incident and reflected wave characteristics during each experiment on the other hand the data measured from the wg1 sensor and the pressure gauge is used to evaluate the energy absorbed from the incoming waves in this regard the free surface elevation ζ measured by the wg1 and wg4 sensors located inside and outside of the owc model as well as air pressure measured by the pressure gauge sensor are illustrated in fig 3 for a regular wave with period and height equal to 2 s and 0 03 m respectively it can be observed from fig 3 that the amplitude of the free surface oscillations as well as the amplitude of the pressure become stable and tend to have a constant value during the time window from 50 s to around 90 s hence there would be enough sampling of waves with stable pattern to analyze the incident and reflected wave characteristics and also to evaluate captured power as aforementioned in the experimental campaign the l shaped duct owc device has been tested with three different draft values in the regular wave conditions sixteen wave periods t 1 1 2 4 s and two wave heights h 0 03 and 0 06 m are combined for the two draft values d 38 5 and 43 5 cm in the case that the draft value is equal to d 33 5 cm the tests for the wave height equal to 0 06 cm are removed and only 0 03 cm wave height is considered due to the occurrence of large splashing of water particles in total 96 tests have been carried out in the experimental campaign it is also noteworthy to remark that the quality of the tests done in this experimental investigation has been checked finding that the repeatability and uncertainly of the data measured by the sensors as well as the waves generated by the paddle remain in an acceptable range 4 evaluation of the performance the primary efficiency of the owc device in regular waves can be estimated using the simple mathematical expression stated in eq 1 hence each of the terms expressed in the numerator w r e g and denominator w w of this equation should be estimated using the experimental data the average power absorbed from regular waves w r e g can be evaluated by numerically approximating the integral in eq 2 for the time window t m a x in which the recorded data becomes stable in this context the air pressure data inside the chamber p can be directly picked up from the data measured by the pressure sensor as it does not normally contain energetic noises for estimating the air volume flux q in eq 2 it is assumed that the corresponding air flow is acting as an incompressible flow due to the small volume of air trapped inside of the model hence the air volume flux q can be calculated implementing the water free surface elevation ζ i inside of the owc detected by the wave gauge sensor as follows 7 q l b d 3 ζ i where l is the length of the water free surface plane inside the chamber parallel to the incident wave direction which is 200 mm in this study b is the width of the water free surface plane inside the chamber perpendicular to the incident wave direction which is 540 mm in this study and d 3 ζ i is the third order approximation to the time derivative of the free surface elevation which can be expressed as follows 8 d 3 ζ i 11 ζ i 18 ζ i 1 9 ζ i 2 2 ζ i 3 6 δ t where δ t 0 05 s is the time step between two consecutive data points in order to determine the incident wave power the data measured by the wave gauges wg2 wg3 and wg4 are used to estimate the energy spectrum s of the incoming waves as part of the incoming waves is always reflected upon intercepting the model the data measured by the wave gauges are the combination of both incoming and reflected waves in this regard the method of mansard and funke 1980 is used to decompose incoming and reflected wave data from each other and on that basis the energy spectrum of the incoming waves is determined as only regular waves are considered in this study it is expected that the corresponding spectra of incident and reflected waves are narrow banded containing only the frequency component of the corresponding generated wave in this regard incident and reflected wave spectra plotted with respect to the angular frequency ω for the case that h 0 03 m and t 1 s are illustrated in fig 4 it can be observed that the corresponding spectra are narrow banded with the peak occurring in ω 6 28 rad s or t 1 s the reflected spectrum has lower energy than the incident wave due to absorption of some part of the incoming wave energy by the device as the incident wave spectrum is determined the average incident wave energy flux w w can be calculated as follows 9 w w b ρ g 0 s ω c g ω d ω where c g ω is the group velocity calculated from eq 5 it is noteworthy to remark that the average incident wave energy flux is not estimated using the theoretical formula given by eq 3 as the precise height of the generated incident wave is not known yet hence the incident wave energy flux is calculated in a more straightforward way using eq 9 however as the spectrum of the incident wave is obtained for each of the case studies the significant wave height h s and the height of the corresponding regular wave h can be obtained simply as follows 10a h s 4 m 0 10b h 2 a h s 2 2 2 m 0 where a is the amplitude of the incident wave and m 0 0 s ω d ω as the incident wave amplitude a is determined from the measured experimental data using eq 10b the corresponding amplification factor a f ratio of the amplitude of the vertical oscillations of the free surface inside the chamber to the amplitude of the incident waves can be estimated as 11 a f a ζ a where a ζ is the mean amplitude of vertical displacement of the free surface plane inside the owc device for the corresponding regular waves it should be noted that the nature of the experiments is 3d although the implemented approach to do the reflection analysis is 2d however the incident waves propagating toward the model have still 2d nature while the reflected waves have 3d nature as they are diffracted by the model hence the implemented approach can correctly estimate the energy of the incident waves as they are propagating in 2d on the other hand there are some uncertainties regarding the precision of the results achieved for the reflected waves due to 3d effects however only the incident wave energy flux is used for the analysis of the performance of the system as well as for the estimation of the amplification factor therefore the presented results in this investigation are not influenced by the abovementioned uncertainties regarding the reflected wave energy the incident wave energy flux w w estimated based on the experimental measurements using eq 9 for the cases that h 0 03 and 0 06 m as well as the corresponding theoretical values calculated based on eq 3 are presented in fig 5 with respect to the wave period as can be seen in this figure the incident wave fluxes estimated from experimental data do not match with the theoretical values due to the reason that the wave generator could not generate waves precisely with the desired height characteristics in this regard fig 6 demonstrates the variations occurred in the height of the generated regular waves which is calculated using eq 10b with respect to the period as it is evident from this figure the generated waves do not reach the desired values of height specifically for the higher periods and the case that the desired wave height is 0 06 m hence the occurrence of the above mentioned phenomenon justifies the reason for using eq 9 instead of eq 3 to estimate the primary efficiency of the device 5 results and discussion it is reported in the previous research studies that the wave characteristics have a prominent influence on the performance of owc devices lópez et al 2015 rezanejad et al 2017 hence an experimental campaign is carried out in this study to investigate the influence of regular wave heights and periods on the performance of the device with the three different drafts d 33 5 38 5 and 43 5 cm in this context the variations of the amplification factor a f with respect to the wave period for two wave heights h 3 and 6 cm are illustrated in figs 7 and 8 for the drafts equal to 38 5 and 43 5 cm respectively as it can be seen in these figures the amplification factor is lower than one for the low periods meaning that small oscillations of the free surface occurred inside the chamber of the device hence the occurrence of low primary efficiency is expected for low periods in all the case studies furthermore it can be observed from these figures that increasing the wave height causes a general reduction in the amplification factor values with the shifted peak to a higher period the reason may be described by assuming the owc device as a simple one degree of freedom dof mass spring and dashpot oscillating system in this regard rezanejad and guedes soares 2017 interpreted the global behavior of single chamber owc devices by introducing a simplified formulation which corresponds to the one dof systems the amplitude of the water column motions inside the owc device as well as the primary efficiency of the device can be approximately determined as 12 x 0 f 0 k 1 1 β 2 2 2 ζ β 2 13 η η m a x 1 1 1 β 2 2 ζ β 2 where x 0 is the absolute amplitude of the motions of the oscillating column inside the device f 0 is the absolute amplitude of the force applied from incoming waves to the oscillating mass water column k is the restoring force which mainly corresponds to the hydrostatic forces β ω ω ω is the angular frequency of forcing function frequency of waves ω k m is the natural frequency of the system m is the oscillating mass in the case of owc device m is the mass of water surrounded by the chamber of device with its corresponding added mass η is the primary efficiency η m a x is the maximum value of the primary efficiency and ζ is the damping of the system which generally has a value between zero and unit the maximum absolute value of the motion amplitude x 0 occurs when 14 ω ω 1 2 ζ 2 as the influence of the power take off unit is simulated in this study by applying an orifice in the experimental model increasing the wave height leads to an increase in the flow rate through the orifice which causes an increase in the damping of the system ζ it is evident from eqs 12 and 14 that increasing the damping parameter equivalent to increasing the wave height reduces the amplitude of motions and causes the peak of the corresponding curve to shift to a lower frequency or to a higher period as it was seen earlier in figs 7 and 8 the variations of the primary efficiency η of the studied owc device with respect to the wave periods for two wave heights h 3 and 6 cm are presented in figs 9 and 10 for the drafts equal to 38 5 and 43 5 cm respectively as was predicted earlier from figs 7 and 8 the device has small primary efficiency in small wave periods due to the small amplification factors occurring in this condition the peak of all efficiency curves occurs in the period equal to 1 6 s and is not influenced by variations applied to the wave height in other words it is not affected by the damping of the system as the damping is a function of the wave height which is well predicted by eq 13 in this context it is clear from eq 13 that the maximum primary efficiency occurs when β tends to have the unit value or in other words the frequency of waves coincides with the natural frequency of the system irrespective of the damping value by considering the simple hydrostatic assumptions the natural frequency of an owc device is predicted to be occurring approximately at ω g l where l is the length of the chamber of owc device immersed in the water rezanejad et al 2013 hence by substituting the average length of the immersed part of the l duct owc device as the l parameter in the above expression the approximate natural period of the system is estimated to be occurring at t 1 50 1 56 and 1 62 s corresponding to draft values equal to d 33 5 38 5 and 43 5 cm respectively the predicted values are close to the occurred peaks of primary efficiency curves in figs 9 and 10 however as the experiments are carried out in the period intervals equal to 0 2 s the resolution of the examined periods is not fine enough to precisely detect the occurrence period of the peaks hence the peaks of the performance curve for all the drafts are detected at t 1 6 s in the experimental campaign furthermore the peak of the amplification factor curves occurs in the period higher than the corresponding period of the peak of the efficiency curve which is also predicted by eq 14 this is due to the reason that the peak of the efficiency curve occurs when ω ω according to eq 13 while the peak of the amplification factor curve occurs at frequencies less than the natural frequency of the device according to eq 14 as the damping parameter ζ has a positive value it can be observed from figs 9 and 10 that increasing the wave height reduces the efficiency of the device at the periods approximately less than 2 1 s and vice versa for the larger periods the reason might be due to increasing the wave nonlinearity effects occurred when the wave height increases in low periods in this case as wave nonlinearity increases so do the wave energy transfers from fundamental to higher order components consequently as the higher harmonics with shorter wavelength can be reflected more easily upon interacting with the owc device than the fundamental wave component the performance is reduced by increasing the wave height in the low periods see wang et al 2018 for further details furthermore the growing influence of the viscous effects as the wave height increases might be another reason for reducing the performance in low wave periods less than 2 1 s as the energy loss of the system increases on the other hand increasing the wave height will also increase the damping of the power take off unit ζ which can provide a better energy absorption capacity in the system for a range of periods we attribute to this reason the improvement of the efficiency curve caused by increasing the wave height for the periods greater than 2 1 s in this study in order to investigate the influence of the immersion depth of the device three different draft values d 33 5 38 5 and 43 5 cm are applied in the experimental campaign the influence of the draft of the device on the amplification factor coefficient as well as primary efficiency of the device is shown in figs 11 and 12 respectively it can be observed from these figures that the variations applied to the draft of the device do not impose significant changes to the amplification factor and performance of the device except in the frequencies near to the natural frequency of the device as it was stated earlier the corresponding period of the natural frequency of the device occurs approximately at 1 6 s the performance of the device and amplification factor is enhanced in the periods around 1 6 s by reducing the draft of the device this could be due to the fact that reducing the draft of the device may provide a more appropriate condition for incoming waves to interact with the oscillating column confined inside the chamber as the distance of the wave entrance of the device from water level is reduced 6 conclusions the l shaped duct oscillating water column device has been investigated in this research study based on an experimental approach a campaign of experiments has been carried out to investigate the influence of the wave characteristics as well as the immersion depth on the hydrodynamic performance of the device by analyzing the obtained results from the experiments it is found that the owc device with l shaped chamber acts similarly as a simple one degree of freedom oscillatory system the occurrence period of the peak of the amplification factor mainly depends on the natural frequency of the oscillations and the damping of the power take off unit hence increasing the wave height causes a shift occurring at the peak of the amplification factor to a higher period as the damping of the system increases on the other hand the occurrence period of the peak of the primary efficiency is solely dependent to the natural frequency of the system hence it is not influenced due to the variations applied in the incident wave height the amplification factor as well as performance of the device is enhanced by reducing the immersion depth of the device as the appropriate condition for proper interaction of the waves with the owc device is improved acknowledgements this study was performed within the strategic research plan of the centre for marine technology and ocean engineering which is financed by portuguese foundation for

22999,two approaches namely the crossing line and the monte carlo methods for navigation safety assessment in approaching channel based on automatic identification system ais are proposed the crossing line method evaluated the ship grounding probability using the probability density functions of the ship track parameters from single crossing line or multi crossing lines the monte carlo method considers the causation of the track parameters such a causation was realized using a regression algorithm by which the relationships among the ship track parameters can be established through a crossing line with the factors corresponding to the previous crossing lines with the relationships monte carlo simulation of ship trajectory evaluation was then applied to assess the grounding frequency the inbound ship behaviors of kaohsiung harbor are analyzed to quantitatively assess the grounding risk on entrance and inner traffic lane the results of the grounding probability acquired from both methods are consistent with each other the grounding probability of the starboard boundary is higher than the port one the proposed methods could be further applied to risk assessment and will facilitate navigational safety in congested waterways and ports keywords risk assessment approaching channel automatic identification system ais monte carlo method kaohsiung harbor 1 introduction due to the increase of international maritime transport the ever growing number of vessels together with the size and speed the frequency of ship accidents becomes higher navigation safety turns into one of the key issues in the design and operation of any approaching channel such accidents pose a great threat to the environment and subsequently lead to loss of life and expensive cargo shipping disasters in a traffic lane affect the traffic flow rate and therefore causing loss of both time and money these serious problems have plagued port authorities the shipping industry and society underlying the importance of traffic risk assessment however earlier safety analysis of ship navigation has been hindered by the lack of data describing vessels passing through an area over the sufficient time span for statistical analysis the risk in general is depicted by the degree or the probability of accidents and the associated consequences in this study we defined the risk as the probability of occurrence of a ship facing the danger of grounding and did not consider the consequences goerlandt and montewka 2015 gives an overview of risk definitions perspectives and scientific approaches to risk analysis found in the maritime transportation application area there are nine categories for definition of risk based on a historical analysis according to the categories for definitions of risk the risk defined in this study is as the category d2 that risk is the probability of an undesirable event or the chance of a loss there are many factors mentioned in the literature affecting the frequency of ship grounding accidents most of the factors are based on experts opinions and have rarely been examined quy et al 2006 martins and maturana 2010 akhtar and utne 2014 mazaheri et al 2014 the quantitative analysis methodology based on probabilistic methods is commonly used to assess navigational risk in restricted areas fairways harbor entrances and harbor basins pietrzykowski and gucma 2001 and gucma 2007 presented the theoretical basis of the probability fuzzy method using real time simulation rts data to assess the ship maneuvering risks on the fairways rts provides a method of assessing the ship s handling capabilities in diverse scenarios and can be used by the local pilots ship s master and officers for maneuvering rehearsals as well as in the design and development of new berth layouts and channel arrangements because real pilot behavior is incorporated in the simulation rts is the most reliable way of building up databases of ship maneuvering parameters for all possible maneuvering conditions such as ship types ship sizes and meteorological conditions although rts is a highly realistic and effective approach however owing to the difficulty of building up the diverse scenarios of environment and ship physical models it limits the number of runs and conditions which can be tested furthermore rts is difficult in fast track simulation since it is expensive and time consuming therefore only a few maneuvering data are obtained by rts moreover the reliability of data distributions highly depends on the number of maneuvering tested to overcome this limitation of rts the fast time simulation fts is used to generate data of ship trajectories for all possible maneuvering conditions quy et al 2005 applied the fts code developed by dutch institute marin to calculate the wave induced loads and motions with six degrees of freedom of hull ships in the shallow waterway the reliability of data distributions of ship motions was obtained as a function of the environmental condition ship size and ship speed with the databases quy et al 2005 proposed the methods to assess safety criteria of approaching channels with respect to the acceptability of ship grounding risks to incorporate the pilot behavior into fts lan et al 2010 developed a new simulation model namely the probabilistic fast time simulation pfts model and human behavior was taken into account the human model in pfts was achieved by using the rts results the pfts model is applied to the probabilistic design of the access channel to the port of coega the pfts is an effective method however it is difficult to consider all human behavior pfts can be regarded as an improved fast time simulation model rather than a substitution of the real time simulator in addition to sampling data from rts gucma and montewka 2005 applied the modern geodetic techniques measuring the distance of reference point on the ship by a laser range finder and proposed a model converting discrete measurements into continuous functions reproducing missing data and conducting more accurate and more detailed analysis of ship passage through the investigated area a similar work zalewski and montewka 2007 used advanced geodetic measuring techniques to capture ship paths along the approaching channel on the west coast of poland and the measured data were used to assess the channel width and the probability of ship accidents in a harbor entrance and channel advantages of the geodetic measuring techniques have a high level of accuracy better compliance with reality and practical applications for verification of existing methods nevertheless due to the fact that the measuring station needs to be installed and operated on board only such a specified vessel was chosen as the case study for evaluation thus the outcomes generated provide little contributions for other ships furthermore due to the passive nature of the experiment the method could not be applied to waterways that are being planned nor non existing yet recently with real traffic information from the automatic identification system ais we now have an abundance of ship track data the historical ais information is a very valuable source for navigational risk assessment and have been used in various applications including traffic flow characteristics such as traffic volume and distributions of the size and type of ships ship behavior analysis in the congested water area ship collision and the ship grounding risk assessment the approaches to perform a navigational risk analysis for maritime activities can be found in the literature including stochastic analysis such as bayesian networks mascaro and korb 2010 and monte carlo methods montewka et al 2010 goerlandt and kujala 2011 fuzzy logic methods pratiwi et al 2017 and dynamic simulation models rong et al 2015 a brief review of the studies using ais data deal with the applications of marine traffic is as follows eide et al 2007 describes an intelligent ship traffic monitoring system based on ais data which estimates the risk levels of individual crude oil tankers for oil spill prevention sawano et al 2011 adopted both the static and dynamic analysis to conduct the vessel traffic analysis and safety assessment of soya strait goerlandt and kujala 2011 applied the monte carlo simulation technique to obtain a meaningful prediction of the relevant factors of the collision events and studied the case of the gulf of finland showing reasonable agreement with registered accident and near miss data wang et al 2013 presents a microscopic analytical scheme for a two vessel collision accident investigation and the scheme may be heuristic to yield a generalized result for a multi vessel case talavera et al 2013 proposed a method to analyze the information contained in a known distribution of vessel traffic on a waterway to construct the corresponding dempster shafer structure the method quantifies the uncertainty inherent to the paths that ships will navigate in the future from the information provided by the ais system on the paths followed by the ships in the past good results obtained from studying the case of the canary islands zhang et al 2015 proposed a method for detecting possible near miss ship collisions from ais data and discusses how such near miss data can be used to gain further insight in safety of maritime transportation zaman et al 2015b and zaman et al 2015a studied on navigation safety using ais data for tanker ship in the malacca strait the ais data were implemented as a source of data for hazard identification and ship collision probability for the risk assessment step in the formal safety assessment based on the ais data analysis xiao et al 2012 developed a primary application of multi agent simulation for ship traffic on yangtze river that provides a realistic representation of the marine traffic xiao et al 2015 proposed a statistical approach for extracting and understanding ship traffic behaviors in waterways by using the ais data the understanding is important when realistic ship simulations are performed and for maritime risk analysis rong et al 2015 using ais data and artificial potential field method to develop a ship navigation method and used monte carlo simulation techniques to simulate the marine traffic in tagus river estuary the ais data of ships entering and leaving the port of lisbon are analyzed to obtain the main characteristics of the traffic parameters that are used as the inputs for the traffic simulation model the simulation results are compared to the ones obtained from the raw ais data to assess the capability of the simulation model for the marine traffic risk analysis mazaheri et al 2015 utilized the statistical analysis of maritime traffic to the gulf of finland from the ais data and grounding accidents the research incorporated the expert elicitation techniques considering the waterway complexity sang et al 2015 proposed a method to identify and remove the inaccurate data of ais database and developed a full trajectory restoration method incorporating navigational features of the inland waterway ship to model the ship trajectory wu et al 2016 investigated the waterway transportation features using ais data and evaluated the frequency of various types of vessel conflicts in the sabine neches waterway the ais data analysis provides insight in ship traffic and forms a realistic simulation model for confined areas such as port areas and inland waterways which can be used for risk assessment of the ship traffic in concerned waterways and improving safety or efficiency apparently more and more studies use ais data to assess the risk of marine traffic in recent years the ais data is definitely a powerful big data of marine traffic and can provide critical insights on developing artificial intelligence algorithms for risk assessment and ship navigation in the congested waterway in this study crossing line and monte carlo methods are proposed to quantitatively assess the grounding risk on entrance and inner traffic lane the probability of the potential grounding scenario and probability of grounding are defined and evaluated with the proposed methods the term single multi crossing line approaches are used to classify the approaches by acquiring data from one or several crossing lines the multi crossing line approach considers cautiously the influence of the no longer turn away point firstly a series of crossing lines perpendicular to the leading line of the approaching channel have been configured to record the data of the ship maneuvering parameters provided by the ais information for ship real behaviors the data including lateral position from leading line speed over ground sog and course over ground cog and true heading as a function of ship types and sizes that are sampled for statistical analysis secondly the crossing line method which is an independent crossing line transit method was applied to evaluate the probability of ships exceeding the channel borderline by using the univariate two variate probability density function of the samples on single or multi crossing lines the monte carlo method which is an interdependent crossing line transit method was proposed to consider the causation of ship navigation risk on approaching channel the causation among the ship track parameters can be established by a regression model through a crossing line with the track parameters corresponding to the previous crossing line or lines the monte carlo method of ship trajectory simulations was applied to assess the probability of ships exceeding the channel borderline on approaching channel a quantitative risk assessment of the grounding risk on the entrance and inner traffic lanes of kaohsiung harbor is subsequently conducted consequently a statistical method has been developed to assess the risk of ships on approaching channel and applied to the second entrance of kaohsiung harbor the sailing directions of kaohsiung port are investigated in section 2 the ais data and processing method are presented thoroughly in section 3 the statistical analysis of the route data on crossing lines and along the inner traffic lane was shown in sections 4 and 5 the crossing line and monte carlo methods for statistical analysis and risk assessment are presented in section 6 the results and discussions are also provided in the section finally the conclusions are drawn in section 7 2 analyzed area kaohsiung port according to the traffic guidelines of kaohsiung port the approaching channel of the second entrance is specifically defined as an area 3 nautical miles west of the location of the kaohsiung vessel traffic service vts tower shown as point b in fig 1 the area contains a two way traffic lane and an inner traffic lane the north boundary of the two way traffic lane extends from the head of the north breakwater with direction 270 outbound of 2 nautical miles long and the south boundary extends from the head of the south breakwater with direction 250 outbound of 1 7 nautical miles a traffic separation scheme connects with the two way traffic lane separation line with direction 260 length 1 8 miles divides the water area within the boundaries into two traffic lanes for inbound and outbound vessels south pilot station is located at the junction of the inbound and the two way traffic lanes for inbound sailings pilots embark at the pilot station and navigate vessels through the two way traffic lane to the entrance and then vessels continue the voyage along a leading line in the inner traffic lane the leading line sometimes called a range which is formed by a pair of marks and is used in position fixing and navigation indicating a safe passage through a channel shown in fig 1 the distance between the northern and southern poles of the harbor breakwater light at the entrance a a is about 430 m the pass bb is located in front of vts tower the length of the inner traffic lane extending from the entrance to the pass is nearly one nautical mile the width of the inner traffic lane is 230 m near the entrance and decreases to a minimum of 180 m at the pass in the present study the approaching channel defined as an area containing the two way and inner traffic lanes was chosen to study the navigational behaviors and grounding risk of inbound vessels the area extends from the head of the breakwater toward the west is about 2 nautical miles long and 1 nautical mile wide as shown in fig 1 3 ais data collection and processing in simple terms ais system is a technology to make ships visible to each other it transmits the sailing status of ships and exchanges such data with other nearby vessels and onshore stations the ais data is sent every few seconds over two dedicated digital marine vhf very high frequency channels in a limited geographical space the transmission interval varies based on speed and the rate of changing course faster and turning vessels are updated more frequently the ais transponder works in continuous mode regardless of whether the vessel is offshore within coastal or inland waters or at anchor moored and anchored vessels broadcast their positions less frequently such information includes ship positions courses headings rates of turn speed loading status the altitude of ais antenna ship types navigation status destinations time stamps together with a unique identification digit i e the maritime mobile service identity mmsi numbers see harati mokhtari et al 2007 the ais data used in the present study spans over a period of 42 months with more than fifteen million datasets per month there is a huge amount of data in the database in order to carry out the grounding risk of approaching channel it is important that meaningful data are extracted from the available database for each individual track of ships the data extracted from the ais database are originated from different ship types and sizes to highlight the sailing characteristics of inbound ships in this study two types of vessel container ships and bulk carriers are considered for container ships three classes are established namely panamax post panamax and new panamax the size of a panamax vessel is limited by the original panama canal s lock chambers which can accommodate ships with a beam of up to 32 31 m a length overall of up to 294 13 m and a draft of up to 12 04 m the post panamax class has historically been used to describe ships with a molded breadth over 32 31 m the new panamax class is based on the new panama canal s limitations of maximum vessel size with a length overall of 366 m maximum width of 49 m and tropical freshwater draft of 15 2 m such a vessel called new panamax class is wide enough to carry 19 rows of containers and have a total capacity of approximately 12 000 teu the data acquired from the ais database for each class with a filter shown in tables 1 and 2 for container ships and bulk carriers respectively in table 1 the data of panamax container ships acquire from the ais database with a filter of length between 250 m and 295 m beam between 29 m and 32 m and draft between 9 m and 12 m the post panamax container ships with a filter of length between 280 m and 345 m beam over 32 m and draft over 10 m the new panamax container ships with a filter of length more 350 m beam over 32 m and draft over 12 m fig 2 shows the paths of new panamax container ships in table 2 the data of panamax bulk carriers acquired from ais database with a filter of length between 185 m and 240 m beam between 30 m and 32 2 m and draft between 9 m and 12 m the capesize bulk carriers with a filter of length between 200 m and 280 m beam over 32 2 m and draft over 10 m the very large bulk carriers with a filter of length between 270 m and 320 m beam over 35 m and draft over 11 m the number of ship tracks sampled from the ais database is also shown in the tables in this study to assess the risk of ship grounding a reference track line extends from the pilot station to the entrance and along the leading line into the harbor is defined and shown in fig 1 a set of crossing lines perpendicular to the reference track line and the leading line shown in fig 2 is designed to acquire the trajectory data across the crossing line the statistical analysis is usually performed with the crossing lines to study the changes of those navigating characteristics throughout the inbound traffic lane the distance between two adjacent crossing lines is taken as a constant of 50 m the data of ship lateral position speed and heading provided by the ais information are recorded at each crossing line a total of 123 crossing lines are selected for analysis they are named as crossing line 1 crossing line 2 crossing line 3 to crossing line 123 from left to right in addition crossing lines 75 and 105 are located at the entrance and the pass of the harbor respectively the inner traffic lane is set in the area within such two crossing lines 4 statistical analysis of route data on crossing lines 4 1 spatial distribution montewka et al 2011 proposed an approach to evaluate the grounding probability two legs of a route leading to skldvig harbor were divided into sections and within each section the ship positions referred to the main sea lane axes were best fitted with the logistic loglogistic and weibull distributions xiao et al 2015 proposed a statistical approach for extracting and understanding ship traffic behaviors of ais data analysis in confined waterways such as a narrow waterway in the netherlands the port of rotterdam and a wide one in china wide waterway of yangtze river close to the su tong bridge by contrast with the logistic loglogistic and weibull distributions the normal distribution was used to fit the histogram of the lateral positions speeds and courses very well according to our studies the distribution function to fit the ship parameters acrossing crossing line acquired from ais data depends on many factors including the ship types and sizes environmental conditions such as wind and current the terrain of the area such as waterway width depth and its layout the traffic complexity and the local traffic regulation in this paper the inbound ship behaviors of kaohsiung harbor are analyzed to quantitatively assess the grounding risk on entrance and inner traffic lane for inbound sailings pilots embark at the pilot station and navigate vessels through the two way traffic lane to the entrance and then vessels continue the voyage along a leading line in the inner traffic lane the ship behavior data in the inner traffic lane are well approximated by a normal distribution through a chi square goodness of fit test and the comparison of statistical parameters fig 3 a and b shows the spatial distribution of post panamax container ships on crossing lines at the entrance and the pass the x axis is the lateral position from the leading line to the ship middle point and the y axis gives the fraction of ship numbers a chi square goodness of fit test shows that the spatial distribution is well approximated by a normal distribution further the parameters of the statistical test for example average standard deviation skewness and kurtosis are shown in table 3 we can find that most of the ships were navigating on the port side of leading line when approaching the entrance and the average lateral position is 30 1 m on the port side of the leading line however most of the ships prefer to stay closer to the leading line when navigating through the pass 4 2 speed distribution ship speed plays an important role in the inbound traffic safety it must be limited within a range if the ship speed is too slow it will affect maneuverability and may increase the inbound time the tidal window may be missed that will increase the grounding possibility on the other hand if the speed is too fast the operation time for striking or collision avoidance is reduced thus compromising the ship safety a ship will navigate with a safe speed in the inner traffic lane commonly the officer on watch should be able to decide a speed which guarantees the safety of the ship the ship speed is determined by many factors such as the experience of the officer ship position ship condition ship dimension ship type the waterway characteristic and the environment in general each ship will sail with its own speed which is required by good seamanship and that results in a variety of different ship speeds fig 4 a and b shows ship speed over ground sog distribution of post panamax containers at the entrance and the pass the x axis indicates the ship speed when the ship middle point passes through the crossing line and the y axis gives the fraction of ship numbers the speed of ships navigating across the entrance spanned in a range from 6 kn to 10 5 kn with a mean of 8 3 kn and a standard deviation of 1 1 kn since the pilot station is located at 1 5 nautical miles away from the entrance and the boarding speed for pilot embarkation is around 7 kn the pilots accelerate the ship speed to increase ship maneuverability and then keep the ship course and track to the entrance however after navigating through the entrance the ship decelerates along the inner traffic lane and proceeds to the pass the speed of ships across the pass spanned in a range from 4 kn to 8 kn with a mean of 6 2 kn and a standard deviation of 0 8 kn the speed maintained in this range was not too slow to anti wind force nor too fast to berthing or stopping a normal distribution function can be fitted well to the speed data shown in fig 4 4 3 heading angle distribution fig 5 a and b shows the histogram of heading angle distribution of post panamax container ships on crossing lines at the entrance and the pass the x axis is the heading angle and the y axis gives the density of numbers of fractions we can find that most of the ships keep heading consistent with the leading line when approaching the entrance however a majority of the ships turn to port side when navigating through the pass some of the vessels commence the turning at a distance from the pass this however causes the ships to deviate from the leading line of the channel and increase the danger of grounding 5 statistical analysis along inner traffic lane 5 1 average lateral position fig 6 a and b shows the mean lateral position along the inner traffic lane for container ships and bulk carriers the x axis denotes the index of the crossing lines whereas y axis indicates the mean lateral position the axis origin is the intercepts of the leading line and crossing lines positive for the starboard side for container ships we found that the ship track of the panamax class is similar to that of post panamax class the ships sail on the port side of the inner traffic lane in which a negative value of mean lateral position varied from 30 m at the entrance to 10 m at the pass on the other hand the track of the new panamax class is apparently different deviating to port side about 30 m than the panamax class the bulk carriers of all three classes keep the track port side away from the leading line and the deviations among the three classes are less than 20 m and with measures of more central tendency 5 2 average ship speed in fig 7 a and b show the sog along the inner traffic lane for container ships and bulk carriers the x axis signifies the index of crossing lines and y axis is the sog the inbound ships used a higher sog before proceeding through the entrance for standing against winds and currents the ship speed reduced when proceeding in the inner traffic lane for container ships the ship speed of the panamax class is similar to the post panamax one and is 8 3 kn at the entrance the speed of the new panamax class is 7 6 kn and is much slower than that of the post panamax class at the entrance while they have similar speeds around 5 4 kn at the pass the panamax class used a smaller sog and is around 5 2 kn at the pass for the bulk carriers the evolution of speed along the inner traffic lane is similar to the container ships the ship speed of the panamax class is similar to the capesize class and is 6 7 kn at the entrance the speed of very large bulk carriers is 6 0 kn and is much slower than the capesize class at the entrance although they have the similar speed of 5 2 kn at the pass 5 3 average heading angle fig 8 a and b shows the mean heading angle along the inner traffic lane for container ships and bulk carriers the direction of the leading line is 078 o the container group keeps the heading angle 080 o passing through the entrance and proceeding in the inner traffic lane the panamax and post panamax group begins to turn left at a distance about 0 4 nautical miles from the pass while new panamax keeps the heading up to 0 2 nautical miles the bulk carriers of all the three classes keep the heading angle on the leading line and begin to turn at about 0 2 nautical miles from the pass 6 risk assessment the depth of the inner traffic lane is around 16 17 m in this study we assume that the 14 m water depth line is the channel borderline about 230 m of width near the embankment and 180 m near the pass which is slightly stricter than the actual situation the draught of panamax and post panamax ships is about 9 12 m when the two types of ship sail beyond the channel borderline there may still be enough water depth to avoid grounding however the depth reduction shallow water and squatting effects will cause the grounding risk any divergence of tracks will increase the possibility of exceeding the channel borderline there are several reasons that significantly affect the ships navigating behavior and induce navigating danger one dangerous state is that fishing boats and merchant ships share the channel in kaohsiung port according to the experience of the vts supervisor some merchant ships give way to the fishing boats when encountering in the channel this avoiding operation will cause the merchant ships positions and courses to deviate from the inbound channel and lead to an additional danger another dangerous situation occurs when ships navigate through the pass it must turn left or right to approach the berthing piers some of the vessels commence the turning at a distance of 0 4 nautical miles from the pass this however causes the ships to deviate from the leading line of the channel and increase the danger of grounding according to the records of the ministry of transportation and communications the real number of grounding accidents is around 1 or 3 times a year however according to the experience of the vts vessel traffic service supervisor the ship is considered to be a high risk ship when it approaches the borderline of the channel the vts supervisor will contact and warn the ship to avoid exceeding the channel in this study to evaluate the navigating risk of inbound ships the potential grounding risk is defined as the probability of the ship s position exceeding the channel borderline that have caused or could have caused grounding accidents rather than that of the actual grounding events in order to more clearly illustrate the results of risk assessment we use the terminology of probability of the potential grounding scenario abbreviated as ppgs to denote the probability of exceeding the channel boundary moreover when a ship deviates to the leading line the pilot tends to correct the heading angle and ship position back to the leading line to avoid exceeding the borderline that means the grounding risk is not only dependent on the lateral position but also on the heading angle the probability of grounding abbreviated as pg is defined that the events satisfy both the criteria the ship exceeding the channel borderline and continues moving outside the boundary that is the pilot could not control the heading angle back to leading line 6 1 probability of the potential grounding scenario ppgs 6 1 1 crossing line method as the results in the previous section a ship proceeds in a channel the lateral position and the heading deviating from the leading line can be calculated with the ais data the positions of the four corners of ships including the port bow pb starboard bow sb port stern ps and starboard stern ss shown in fig 9 are of interest with the coordinate defined in fig 9 the following formulas define the lateral position of the four corner points the lateral position of the port and starboard outer corners y p and y s are easily identified as the smallest and the largest values of the four corner coordinates that are 5 y s max y s b y s s 6 y p min y p b y p s where y c is the position of the vessel midship point which is the lateral position or the cross track deviation from the leading line β is the deviation of the heading angle from the leading line with positive in clockwise direction l is the ship length and b indicates the ship beam the area between the track lines of y p and y s resulting from one ship path is mostly indicated as the swept path the lateral position of the port and starboard outer corners which are the function of the variables y c β l and b are evaluated at each crossing line the lateral position and heading for each ship path is acquired from the ais data as described in the previous section in order to assess the grounding risk at the entrance the following equations are used 7 p s i b s i n μ s i σ s i d x 8 p p i b p i n μ p i σ p i d x where p p i and p s i are the probability of exceeding channel borderline or the ppgs by previous definition on crossing line i at the port and starboard side the integral bounds b s i and b p i are the starboard and port boundary of the traffic lane in this study the spatial distributions of the outer port and starboard corners at each crossing line y p i and y s i are approximated by the normal distributions n μ p i σ p i and n μ s i σ s i respectively in the distributions μ p i μ s i and σ p i σ s i are the average and standard deviation of the random variables y p i and y s i at the crossing line i the ppgs at the port and the starboard side of the entrance and the pass of the inner traffic lane can be evaluated by the same procedures fig 10 a and b shows the histogram and the approximated normal distribution of the port and starboard outer corners at the entrance and the pass for post panamax container ships the lower tail port and the upper tail starboard of the distribution will give the probability of navigating outside the safe area in each crossing line and they will indicate the approximate risk area and its scope table 4 shows the ppgs of inbound container ships at the entrance and the pass the grounding risks of the starboard and port sides are evaluated by eqs 7 and 8 it is shown that the ppgs of the inbound ships at the entrance are around 10 5 order of magnitude or less for all three classes of container ships indicating the risk of grounding is not significant at the entrance however the ppgs at the starboard boundary of the pass are 10 2 to 10 3 order of magnitude which is apparently greater than the entrance in contrast to the starboard boundary the ppgs at the port boundary of the pass are 10 6 to 10 8 order of magnitude table 5 shows the ppgs of the inbound bulk carriers at the entrance and the pass in general the ppgs are around 10 5 order of magnitude or less except the ppgs of the class of very large bulk carrier at the starboard boundary of the entrance with a value of 10 4 indicating the risk of grounding is slightly larger than the others the ppgs at the starboard boundary of the pass are 10 2 to 10 4 order of magnitude for panamax and capsize vessels and are obviously greater than the entrance from tables 4 and 5 it is obvious that the ppgs at the starboard boundary of the inner traffic lane is significantly larger than the others and the pilots should pay more attention in this area it has to be pointed out that if a ship exceeds the channel boundary at a given crossing line the ship track would either go beyond the boundary in the following crossing lines and run aground or the vessel would be steered back within the boundary before a grounding takes place in this study a grounding sample is recorded when the ship track first exceeds the channel boundary at a given crossing line and the rest of the ship track would not be evaluated in following crossing lines accordingly we re defined the conditional probability of the potential grounding scenario which occurs precisely at the crossing line k p s k and p p k and is shown as follows 9 p s k p s k i 1 k 1 1 p s i 10 p p k p p k i 1 k 1 1 p p i the product over a set of terms from crossing line 1 to k 1 represents the probability of ship tracks from crossing line 1 to k 1 inside the channel width p s k and p p k are defined by eqs 7 and 8 respectively for crossing line k the aforementioned methodology denoted as a single crossing line method is used to evaluate the ppgs at the entrance with the single crossing line data a new methodology of risk assessment for the entrance denoted as a multi crossing line method in this research was proposed to compare with the previous results acquired using the single crossing line method in general pilots embark onboard ships at the pilot station navigates through the two way traffic lane and approach the entrance most of the collisions and groundings are reported during inbound maneuvering of the vessels thus the inbound maneuvering is considered as the most crucial stage a ship faces in her voyage the pilot plays an import role in a safe passage when approaching the port if any changes of the ambient factors occurred as the ship proceeds for example the effects of the wind tide wave or the state of the ship the danger of grounding would grow significantly under the conditions the pilot would maneuver the ship to turn away and abort its approaching plan before reaching a point distant away from the entrance where the occurrence of accidents is inevitable such a no longer turn away point is determined by many technical factors involved in maneuvering large seagoing merchant ships in the present study we assumed that the grounding risk at the entrance would include the area between the no longer turn away point and the entrance within which groundings would probably take place this phenomenon evaluated above illustrates that the ppgs at the entrance should consider the ships exceeding the channel boundary from a range of the upstream crossing lines accordingly the ppgs at the entrance p s e and p p e are redefined as follows 11 p s e i e p s i 12 p p e i e p p i where e is the set of crossing lines located in the no longer turn away area similarly we defined the ppgs when proceeding in the inner traffic lane p s i and p p i as follows 13 p s i i i p s i 14 p p i i i p p i where i is the set of crossing lines located in the inner traffic lane table 6 shows the ppgs of the inbound containers on the entrance and inner traffic lane the grounding risk at starboard and port sides of the entrance are evaluated by eqs 11 and 12 in this paper we assumed the no longer turn away point is located at a distance that is 2 times as long as the ship length away from the entrance where the crossing line in this region belongs to the set e it is shown that the ppgs of the inbound ships at the entrance are around 10 4 order of magnitude or less at the entrance the ppgs of the starboard boundary for the panamax class and the port boundary for the new panamax class are slightly larger than the others the comparison of the results between the single crossing line method shown in table 4 and multi crossing line method shown in table 6 reveals an acceptable agreement to evaluate the ppgs of the inner traffic lane using eqs 13 and 14 the crossing lines between the entrance and the pass are all included in a set of i the grounding probabilities at the starboard boundary of the inner traffic lane are 10 2 to 10 3 order of magnitude and are significantly greater than those of the port boundary from the results of the ppgs at the pass and inner traffic lane the starboard boundary is more dangerous than the port boundary table 7 shows the ppgs of the inbound bulk carriers on the entrance and inner traffic lane it is shown that the ppgs at the port boundary of the entrance are around 10 5 order of magnitude at the entrance the ppgs of the starboard boundary for panamax and very large bulk carriers by contrast are 10 4 order of magnitude and are larger than the port boundary when comparing the results of the single table 5 and multi crossing line methods table 7 the ppgs at the starboard boundary is larger than the port one in the vicinity of the entrance due to the consideration of the no longer turn away area similar results shown at the inner traffic lane the ppgs at the starboard boundary are larger than those of the port boundary in addition the capsize class is more dangerous in grounding among the three classes 6 1 2 monte carlo method burgers and kok 1988 used regression analysis method to deduce the ship navigation parameters under the pilot action in the specific environmental conditions in their method an attempt is made to construct a model which relates the distance from the channel border when ships pass by a crossing line with the one corresponding to the previous crossing lines based on the results of real time simulations in this study we extended the method to model the ship navigation parameters including the lateral position from the leading line denoted as y and the ship heading discrepancy from the leading line β see fig 9 with the one corresponding to the upstream cross lines the n t h degree polynomial model we proposed as follows 15 δ y i k 0 n a k y i 1 k z i y 16 δ β i k 0 n b k β i 1 k z i β where δ y i is the difference of lateral position to leading line between the cross line i and cross line i 1 shortly called increment of lateral position y i 1 is the lateral position to the leading line at cross line i 1 the parameters a k are obtained by a least square fit the similar polynomial model was used to define the difference of the heading discrepancy or shortly called the increment of heading denoted as δ β i which was described as a function of β i 1 the parameters b k are also obtained by a least square fit the random values z i y n 0 σ i y and z i β n 0 σ i β are generated from a normal distribution with a mean equal to 0 and standard deviation σ i y and σ i β which are in accordance with the root mean square error fig 11 a shows the linear correlation between the increment of the lateral position δ y and the lateral position y for new panamax containers at the entrance most of the sampled ships proceed through the entrance with a track close to the port side of the leading line the sampled increment δ y is strongly correlated with the ships lateral position it can be straightforwardly explained the more the ship is away from the leading line of the lane the more the pilot changes the ship position to come back to the leading line the correction rate per meter of the lateral deviation at the entrance is around 0 08 m fig 11b shows the linear correlation between the increment of heading δ β and heading deviation β for new panamax container ships at the entrance most of the sampled ships proceed through the entrance using a heading biased to the starboard side of the leading line the more the heading deviation on the starboard side of leading line is the greater the correction of the ship heading going back to the leading direction the correction rate is around 0 1 per degree of the heading deviation at the entrance it illustrated that the ships still continue correcting the ship position and direction at the entrance fig 12 a shows the linear correlation between the increment of heading δ β and heading deviation β for new panamax container ships at crossing line no 90 the most of the sampled ships proceed from the entrance to the pass along the inner traffic lane follows the direction of leading line the heading deviation and increment of heading are all around zero however at the pass shown in fig 12b the slope of correlation line is positive this means that the more the heading deviation is the greater the incremental of heading away to the leading line on both port and starboard sides it illustrated that the ships alter course before proceeding through the pass therefore the lateral positions at the pass are not concentrated around the leading line but spread out this increases the grounding risk at the pass since the width of the location is mostly confined to apply the monte carlo simulation three phases are worked out 1 the trajectory of the inbound ships based on ais data was restored and the ship navigation parameters are sampled at all of the crossing lines 2 the causation among the ship track parameters are established by using regression model through a crossing line with the track parameters corresponding to the previous crossing line or lines 3 the numerical simulation of a high number of maneuvers is conducted by means of the monto carlo method and the frequency of exceeding channel borderline on each crossing line was evaluated such a frequency was used to assess the risk of the entrance and the inner traffic lane with the notation in eqs 9 and 10 as well as by means of the results of monte carlo simulation the ppgs of the crossing line k p s k and p p k is defined as 17 p s k f s k i 1 k 1 1 f s i 18 p p k f p k i 1 k 1 1 f p i and 19 f s k n s k n i 1 k 1 n s i n p i 20 f p k n p k n i 1 k 1 n s i n p i where f s k and f p k are the frequencies of exceeding starboard and port borderline respectively on the crossing line k and n s k and n p k indicate the corresponding numbers n is the number of maneuvers with the definition of ppgs shown in eqs 11 14 the ppgs at the entrance p s e and p p e and the ppgs when proceeding in the inner traffic lane p s i and p p i can be evaluated by virtue of the monte carlo method and the ppgs at crossing line k defined based on eqs 17 and 18 then the ppgs of container ships on the entrance and inner traffic lane together with the consideration of no longer turn away area can be found in table 8 it is shown that the ppgs at the entrance are around 10 3 order of magnitude or less at the entrance the ppgs of the port boundary of new panamax containers are slightly larger than the others the results are consistent with the multi crossing lines method the ppgs at the starboard boundary of the inner traffic lane are 10 2 order of magnitude for panamax and post panamax container ships and are significantly greater than those of the port boundary the comparison of the results between the monte carlo method table 8 and multi crossing line method table 6 shows that the outcome of the monte carlo method one order of magnitude is larger than the multi crossing line method however a similar tendency and acceptable agreement of grounding risk are reached the ppgs of bulk carriers on the entrance and inner traffic lane with the effect of no longer turn away area is shown in table 9 the results show that the ppgs of the very large class at the entrance was larger than the others by contrast the ppgs of the three classes at the starboard boundary of the inner traffic lane was larger than those of the port boundary in order to achieve reasonable results by monte carlo simulations the required number of the simulations for each condition is based on the sensitivity analysis theoretically more repetitions of the maneuver will give more useful information on the specific limits of each condition nevertheless it is still balanced with the costs of obtaining such data 6 2 probability of grounding pg when a ship deviates to the right hand side of the leading line the pilot tends to correct the ship position back to the leading line to avoid exceeding the borderline hence the heading angle is negative on the contrary when the ship deviates to the left hand side of the leading line the heading angle is positive that means the grounding risk is not only dependent on the lateral position but also on the heading angle in addition to exceeding the channel borderline the condition of an event in which the ship is grounded must consider whether the ship continues to move outside the boundary that is the pilot could not control the heading angle back to leading line to evaluate the conditional probability of the grounding risk with the consideration of the lateral position and heading angle a two variate joint normal distribution was introduced to model the relations which has the density function as follows 21 n μ σ 1 2 π σ 1 2 e x p 1 2 x μ t σ 1 x μ where x y β is the vector of random variables the lateral position and the deviation of mean heading angle from the leading line μ and σ are the mean vector and the covariance matrix respectively defined as μ μ y μ β and σ σ y 2 ρ σ y σ β ρ σ y σ β σ β 2 fig 13 shows a typical sample scatter plot and the contour of probability density function of a joint normal distribution the data acquired from post panamax container ships at the entrance and the pass the means of the lateral positions μ y and the heading angle μ β are 29 2 and 0 11 respectively the standard deviations of the lateral position σ y and the heading from leading line σ β are 24 1 and 2 04 respectively the correlation coefficient ρ is 0 515 in addition to exceeding the channel borderline the condition of events in which the ship is grounded must consider whether the ship continues to move outside the boundary that is the pilot could not control the heading angle back to leading line the pg at crossing line i was defined as 22 p s i p y b s i β 0 0 π b s i n μ s i σ s i d y d β 23 p p i p y b p i β 0 π 0 b p i n μ s i σ s i d y d β the pg at the entrance and the pass for container ships and bulk carriers is shown in tables 10 and 11 respectively the comparison of the results between the pg by two variate model table 10 and the ppgs by univariate model table 4 shows that the probabilities of grounding are significantly decreased due to the elimination of the events sailing back to the leading line allowing for safety especially for the starboard side of the pass the probabilities of grounding are 10 5 order of magnitude since most ships turn left into the berthing pier with the two variate model the pg at the entrance considering the no longer turn away area as well as the grounding probability along inner traffic lane are defined using the multi crossing line method which is the same as equations 11 14 tables 12 and 13 show the results of the probability of grounding at the entrance and the inner traffic lane of container ships and bulk carriers accordingly the annual number of all the three classes of container ship grounding frequency is about 3 9 ships per year 6 3 the ais sensitivity test due to poor transmission or malfunctioning of sensors the information can easily be incorrectly coded broadcasted recorded or lost the ship trajectory is commonly restored by connecting the location points sequentially in terms of time series the accuracy of trajectory reduced due to lost data moreover the wrong trajectory was obtained from the incorrect data in this study the trajectory can be considered as a nearly straight line path when the inbound ship navigating on approaching channel the methods proposed by sang et al 2015 are used to identify and cleanse the irregularities moreover ship speed plays an important role in the inbound traffic safety it must be limited within a range the study focus on the navigating behaviors of the ship size larger the panamax on approaching channel the speed considered to acquire the ais data in a range of 4 14 knots according to the requirements of international telecommunication union itu the transmission period less than 10 s for class a ais that is the ship sailing distance between two continuous data points transmission distance around 20 70 m however the histogram of the transmission periods and the transmission distances obtained from the ais data analysis of the kaohsiung port are shown in fig 14 the average transmission period is 80 s and average transmission distance is 298 m the most of the data does not meet the requirements to improve the quality of data acquisition on crossing line we introduce two cutoff values the transmission period and distance to eliminate the poor data since the characteristic length of ship maneuverability was considered as the order of ship length the cutoff distance and time period are set to 600 m and 150 s respectively the trajectories missing signals that lead the period or distance between data exceeding the cutoff values are cleansed fig 2 shows the trajectories of new panamax container ship according to the annex 28 of imo resolution msc 115 73 the performance standards for combined gps glonass receiver equipment have the static and dynamic accuracy such that the position of the ship is determined to within 10 m with 95 confidence interval in differential mode and within 35 m with 95 confidence interval in non differential mode to consider the accuracy of ais data on the accuracy of the determination of the ppgs we add a noise from the gps receiver to the ais position data tables 14 and 15 show the impact of ais accuracy on the accuracy of the determination of the ppgs for single and multi crossing line method respectively the comparison of ppgs at the entrance and the pass or inner traffic lane among non noise 10 and 35 m 95 noise shows that the impacts are not obvious for 10 m 95 noise however the impacts are significant in the case of 35 m 95 noise 6 4 the reliability test following the criteria of reliability proposed by goerlandt and kujala 2014 the criteria r1 defined as the degree to which the risk analysis methods produce the same results at reruns of these methods in this study single and multi crossing line methods are deterministic algorithms based on historical ais data hence a rerun of these methods with identical parameter settings leads to identical results in contrast the monte carlo simulation is stochastic in nature a rerun of this method hence does not necessarily lead to identical results to test criterion r1 the monte carlo simulation is performed 3 times in each of these three applications of the method 50 monte carlo simulations are made and mean values of the calculated frequency estimate are compared as well as the confidence interval this test is referred to as test r1mcs figs 15 and 16 shows the rerun test results of monte carlo simulations mcs the scatterplots in the figure show pairwise comparisons of the risk metrics for the different crossing lines along the inner traffic lane fig 15 are the results of port side boundary and fig 16 are starboard boundary the left plot a is comparison of 1st and 2nd runs the middle plot b is for 2nd and 3rd runs and the right plot c is for 1st and 3rd runs the metric value for a specific crossing line according to the first test condition is read on the horizontal axis the results indicate that a rerun of monte carlo simulations a high reliability is obtained in terms of the mean overall ships exceed channel boundary frequency the multi crossing line and monte carlo methods are interdependent crossing line transit methods which are proposed to consider the causation of ship navigation risk on approaching channel the causation among the ship track parameters can be established by a regression model through a crossing line with the track parameters corresponding to the previous crossing line or lines the monte carlo method of ship trajectory evaluation was applied to assess the ppgs on approaching channel to investigate the effects of the spacing of crossing lines to the results we perform the crossing line refinement test with crossing line spacing of 25 50 100 150 m table 16 shows the comparison of ppgs among the different spacing with multi crossing line method the ppgs increase as the crossing line spacing reduced however the values are all in the same order of magnitude table 17 shows the comparison of ppgs among the different spacing with monte carlo method the ppgs converge well as the spacing reduced the result of crossing line refinement test indicates the performance of the monte carlo method which considers the causation of ship navigation risk 7 conclusion this study proposed two methods for assessing the safety of navigation on the entrance and the inner traffic lane based on the ais data such ais data were analyzed to acquire better knowledge about the ship behaviors of maneuvering the normal distribution functions can be fitted well to the spatial position and the speed data these results build up the basis of statistical analysis which can be applied to evaluate the navigation safety in addition both the crossing line and monte carlo methods which are independent and interdependent cross section transits are implemented to evaluate the maneuvering risk on the entrance and the inner traffic lane a quantitative risk assessment of the grounding risk at the entrance and inner traffic lane in kaohsiung port has been conducted the results of the risk probability acquired based on the crossing line and monte carlo methods are consistent with each other however the risk probability of the pass is relatively higher than that of the entrance the proposed methods could be applied to risk assessment of ship inbound operation for improving navigational safety in the congested waterway and approaching channel furthermore such a risk assessment methodology forms a useful tool in finding safety navigating routes and provides valuable information on waterway designs and traffic management we believe that the results of the grounding risk assessment can be provided to vts or oow officer of the watch as a reference for regulatory and transportation safety improvement much work still remains to be conducted for example the ship encounters on waterways human factors and ship responses to the navigational environment nevertheless the current work can be regarded as a pioneer paving the way for risk assessment of ships entering ports acknowledgments the support of this research by the ministry of science and technology taiwan through the grant most 103 2410 h 019 008 my2 are

22999,two approaches namely the crossing line and the monte carlo methods for navigation safety assessment in approaching channel based on automatic identification system ais are proposed the crossing line method evaluated the ship grounding probability using the probability density functions of the ship track parameters from single crossing line or multi crossing lines the monte carlo method considers the causation of the track parameters such a causation was realized using a regression algorithm by which the relationships among the ship track parameters can be established through a crossing line with the factors corresponding to the previous crossing lines with the relationships monte carlo simulation of ship trajectory evaluation was then applied to assess the grounding frequency the inbound ship behaviors of kaohsiung harbor are analyzed to quantitatively assess the grounding risk on entrance and inner traffic lane the results of the grounding probability acquired from both methods are consistent with each other the grounding probability of the starboard boundary is higher than the port one the proposed methods could be further applied to risk assessment and will facilitate navigational safety in congested waterways and ports keywords risk assessment approaching channel automatic identification system ais monte carlo method kaohsiung harbor 1 introduction due to the increase of international maritime transport the ever growing number of vessels together with the size and speed the frequency of ship accidents becomes higher navigation safety turns into one of the key issues in the design and operation of any approaching channel such accidents pose a great threat to the environment and subsequently lead to loss of life and expensive cargo shipping disasters in a traffic lane affect the traffic flow rate and therefore causing loss of both time and money these serious problems have plagued port authorities the shipping industry and society underlying the importance of traffic risk assessment however earlier safety analysis of ship navigation has been hindered by the lack of data describing vessels passing through an area over the sufficient time span for statistical analysis the risk in general is depicted by the degree or the probability of accidents and the associated consequences in this study we defined the risk as the probability of occurrence of a ship facing the danger of grounding and did not consider the consequences goerlandt and montewka 2015 gives an overview of risk definitions perspectives and scientific approaches to risk analysis found in the maritime transportation application area there are nine categories for definition of risk based on a historical analysis according to the categories for definitions of risk the risk defined in this study is as the category d2 that risk is the probability of an undesirable event or the chance of a loss there are many factors mentioned in the literature affecting the frequency of ship grounding accidents most of the factors are based on experts opinions and have rarely been examined quy et al 2006 martins and maturana 2010 akhtar and utne 2014 mazaheri et al 2014 the quantitative analysis methodology based on probabilistic methods is commonly used to assess navigational risk in restricted areas fairways harbor entrances and harbor basins pietrzykowski and gucma 2001 and gucma 2007 presented the theoretical basis of the probability fuzzy method using real time simulation rts data to assess the ship maneuvering risks on the fairways rts provides a method of assessing the ship s handling capabilities in diverse scenarios and can be used by the local pilots ship s master and officers for maneuvering rehearsals as well as in the design and development of new berth layouts and channel arrangements because real pilot behavior is incorporated in the simulation rts is the most reliable way of building up databases of ship maneuvering parameters for all possible maneuvering conditions such as ship types ship sizes and meteorological conditions although rts is a highly realistic and effective approach however owing to the difficulty of building up the diverse scenarios of environment and ship physical models it limits the number of runs and conditions which can be tested furthermore rts is difficult in fast track simulation since it is expensive and time consuming therefore only a few maneuvering data are obtained by rts moreover the reliability of data distributions highly depends on the number of maneuvering tested to overcome this limitation of rts the fast time simulation fts is used to generate data of ship trajectories for all possible maneuvering conditions quy et al 2005 applied the fts code developed by dutch institute marin to calculate the wave induced loads and motions with six degrees of freedom of hull ships in the shallow waterway the reliability of data distributions of ship motions was obtained as a function of the environmental condition ship size and ship speed with the databases quy et al 2005 proposed the methods to assess safety criteria of approaching channels with respect to the acceptability of ship grounding risks to incorporate the pilot behavior into fts lan et al 2010 developed a new simulation model namely the probabilistic fast time simulation pfts model and human behavior was taken into account the human model in pfts was achieved by using the rts results the pfts model is applied to the probabilistic design of the access channel to the port of coega the pfts is an effective method however it is difficult to consider all human behavior pfts can be regarded as an improved fast time simulation model rather than a substitution of the real time simulator in addition to sampling data from rts gucma and montewka 2005 applied the modern geodetic techniques measuring the distance of reference point on the ship by a laser range finder and proposed a model converting discrete measurements into continuous functions reproducing missing data and conducting more accurate and more detailed analysis of ship passage through the investigated area a similar work zalewski and montewka 2007 used advanced geodetic measuring techniques to capture ship paths along the approaching channel on the west coast of poland and the measured data were used to assess the channel width and the probability of ship accidents in a harbor entrance and channel advantages of the geodetic measuring techniques have a high level of accuracy better compliance with reality and practical applications for verification of existing methods nevertheless due to the fact that the measuring station needs to be installed and operated on board only such a specified vessel was chosen as the case study for evaluation thus the outcomes generated provide little contributions for other ships furthermore due to the passive nature of the experiment the method could not be applied to waterways that are being planned nor non existing yet recently with real traffic information from the automatic identification system ais we now have an abundance of ship track data the historical ais information is a very valuable source for navigational risk assessment and have been used in various applications including traffic flow characteristics such as traffic volume and distributions of the size and type of ships ship behavior analysis in the congested water area ship collision and the ship grounding risk assessment the approaches to perform a navigational risk analysis for maritime activities can be found in the literature including stochastic analysis such as bayesian networks mascaro and korb 2010 and monte carlo methods montewka et al 2010 goerlandt and kujala 2011 fuzzy logic methods pratiwi et al 2017 and dynamic simulation models rong et al 2015 a brief review of the studies using ais data deal with the applications of marine traffic is as follows eide et al 2007 describes an intelligent ship traffic monitoring system based on ais data which estimates the risk levels of individual crude oil tankers for oil spill prevention sawano et al 2011 adopted both the static and dynamic analysis to conduct the vessel traffic analysis and safety assessment of soya strait goerlandt and kujala 2011 applied the monte carlo simulation technique to obtain a meaningful prediction of the relevant factors of the collision events and studied the case of the gulf of finland showing reasonable agreement with registered accident and near miss data wang et al 2013 presents a microscopic analytical scheme for a two vessel collision accident investigation and the scheme may be heuristic to yield a generalized result for a multi vessel case talavera et al 2013 proposed a method to analyze the information contained in a known distribution of vessel traffic on a waterway to construct the corresponding dempster shafer structure the method quantifies the uncertainty inherent to the paths that ships will navigate in the future from the information provided by the ais system on the paths followed by the ships in the past good results obtained from studying the case of the canary islands zhang et al 2015 proposed a method for detecting possible near miss ship collisions from ais data and discusses how such near miss data can be used to gain further insight in safety of maritime transportation zaman et al 2015b and zaman et al 2015a studied on navigation safety using ais data for tanker ship in the malacca strait the ais data were implemented as a source of data for hazard identification and ship collision probability for the risk assessment step in the formal safety assessment based on the ais data analysis xiao et al 2012 developed a primary application of multi agent simulation for ship traffic on yangtze river that provides a realistic representation of the marine traffic xiao et al 2015 proposed a statistical approach for extracting and understanding ship traffic behaviors in waterways by using the ais data the understanding is important when realistic ship simulations are performed and for maritime risk analysis rong et al 2015 using ais data and artificial potential field method to develop a ship navigation method and used monte carlo simulation techniques to simulate the marine traffic in tagus river estuary the ais data of ships entering and leaving the port of lisbon are analyzed to obtain the main characteristics of the traffic parameters that are used as the inputs for the traffic simulation model the simulation results are compared to the ones obtained from the raw ais data to assess the capability of the simulation model for the marine traffic risk analysis mazaheri et al 2015 utilized the statistical analysis of maritime traffic to the gulf of finland from the ais data and grounding accidents the research incorporated the expert elicitation techniques considering the waterway complexity sang et al 2015 proposed a method to identify and remove the inaccurate data of ais database and developed a full trajectory restoration method incorporating navigational features of the inland waterway ship to model the ship trajectory wu et al 2016 investigated the waterway transportation features using ais data and evaluated the frequency of various types of vessel conflicts in the sabine neches waterway the ais data analysis provides insight in ship traffic and forms a realistic simulation model for confined areas such as port areas and inland waterways which can be used for risk assessment of the ship traffic in concerned waterways and improving safety or efficiency apparently more and more studies use ais data to assess the risk of marine traffic in recent years the ais data is definitely a powerful big data of marine traffic and can provide critical insights on developing artificial intelligence algorithms for risk assessment and ship navigation in the congested waterway in this study crossing line and monte carlo methods are proposed to quantitatively assess the grounding risk on entrance and inner traffic lane the probability of the potential grounding scenario and probability of grounding are defined and evaluated with the proposed methods the term single multi crossing line approaches are used to classify the approaches by acquiring data from one or several crossing lines the multi crossing line approach considers cautiously the influence of the no longer turn away point firstly a series of crossing lines perpendicular to the leading line of the approaching channel have been configured to record the data of the ship maneuvering parameters provided by the ais information for ship real behaviors the data including lateral position from leading line speed over ground sog and course over ground cog and true heading as a function of ship types and sizes that are sampled for statistical analysis secondly the crossing line method which is an independent crossing line transit method was applied to evaluate the probability of ships exceeding the channel borderline by using the univariate two variate probability density function of the samples on single or multi crossing lines the monte carlo method which is an interdependent crossing line transit method was proposed to consider the causation of ship navigation risk on approaching channel the causation among the ship track parameters can be established by a regression model through a crossing line with the track parameters corresponding to the previous crossing line or lines the monte carlo method of ship trajectory simulations was applied to assess the probability of ships exceeding the channel borderline on approaching channel a quantitative risk assessment of the grounding risk on the entrance and inner traffic lanes of kaohsiung harbor is subsequently conducted consequently a statistical method has been developed to assess the risk of ships on approaching channel and applied to the second entrance of kaohsiung harbor the sailing directions of kaohsiung port are investigated in section 2 the ais data and processing method are presented thoroughly in section 3 the statistical analysis of the route data on crossing lines and along the inner traffic lane was shown in sections 4 and 5 the crossing line and monte carlo methods for statistical analysis and risk assessment are presented in section 6 the results and discussions are also provided in the section finally the conclusions are drawn in section 7 2 analyzed area kaohsiung port according to the traffic guidelines of kaohsiung port the approaching channel of the second entrance is specifically defined as an area 3 nautical miles west of the location of the kaohsiung vessel traffic service vts tower shown as point b in fig 1 the area contains a two way traffic lane and an inner traffic lane the north boundary of the two way traffic lane extends from the head of the north breakwater with direction 270 outbound of 2 nautical miles long and the south boundary extends from the head of the south breakwater with direction 250 outbound of 1 7 nautical miles a traffic separation scheme connects with the two way traffic lane separation line with direction 260 length 1 8 miles divides the water area within the boundaries into two traffic lanes for inbound and outbound vessels south pilot station is located at the junction of the inbound and the two way traffic lanes for inbound sailings pilots embark at the pilot station and navigate vessels through the two way traffic lane to the entrance and then vessels continue the voyage along a leading line in the inner traffic lane the leading line sometimes called a range which is formed by a pair of marks and is used in position fixing and navigation indicating a safe passage through a channel shown in fig 1 the distance between the northern and southern poles of the harbor breakwater light at the entrance a a is about 430 m the pass bb is located in front of vts tower the length of the inner traffic lane extending from the entrance to the pass is nearly one nautical mile the width of the inner traffic lane is 230 m near the entrance and decreases to a minimum of 180 m at the pass in the present study the approaching channel defined as an area containing the two way and inner traffic lanes was chosen to study the navigational behaviors and grounding risk of inbound vessels the area extends from the head of the breakwater toward the west is about 2 nautical miles long and 1 nautical mile wide as shown in fig 1 3 ais data collection and processing in simple terms ais system is a technology to make ships visible to each other it transmits the sailing status of ships and exchanges such data with other nearby vessels and onshore stations the ais data is sent every few seconds over two dedicated digital marine vhf very high frequency channels in a limited geographical space the transmission interval varies based on speed and the rate of changing course faster and turning vessels are updated more frequently the ais transponder works in continuous mode regardless of whether the vessel is offshore within coastal or inland waters or at anchor moored and anchored vessels broadcast their positions less frequently such information includes ship positions courses headings rates of turn speed loading status the altitude of ais antenna ship types navigation status destinations time stamps together with a unique identification digit i e the maritime mobile service identity mmsi numbers see harati mokhtari et al 2007 the ais data used in the present study spans over a period of 42 months with more than fifteen million datasets per month there is a huge amount of data in the database in order to carry out the grounding risk of approaching channel it is important that meaningful data are extracted from the available database for each individual track of ships the data extracted from the ais database are originated from different ship types and sizes to highlight the sailing characteristics of inbound ships in this study two types of vessel container ships and bulk carriers are considered for container ships three classes are established namely panamax post panamax and new panamax the size of a panamax vessel is limited by the original panama canal s lock chambers which can accommodate ships with a beam of up to 32 31 m a length overall of up to 294 13 m and a draft of up to 12 04 m the post panamax class has historically been used to describe ships with a molded breadth over 32 31 m the new panamax class is based on the new panama canal s limitations of maximum vessel size with a length overall of 366 m maximum width of 49 m and tropical freshwater draft of 15 2 m such a vessel called new panamax class is wide enough to carry 19 rows of containers and have a total capacity of approximately 12 000 teu the data acquired from the ais database for each class with a filter shown in tables 1 and 2 for container ships and bulk carriers respectively in table 1 the data of panamax container ships acquire from the ais database with a filter of length between 250 m and 295 m beam between 29 m and 32 m and draft between 9 m and 12 m the post panamax container ships with a filter of length between 280 m and 345 m beam over 32 m and draft over 10 m the new panamax container ships with a filter of length more 350 m beam over 32 m and draft over 12 m fig 2 shows the paths of new panamax container ships in table 2 the data of panamax bulk carriers acquired from ais database with a filter of length between 185 m and 240 m beam between 30 m and 32 2 m and draft between 9 m and 12 m the capesize bulk carriers with a filter of length between 200 m and 280 m beam over 32 2 m and draft over 10 m the very large bulk carriers with a filter of length between 270 m and 320 m beam over 35 m and draft over 11 m the number of ship tracks sampled from the ais database is also shown in the tables in this study to assess the risk of ship grounding a reference track line extends from the pilot station to the entrance and along the leading line into the harbor is defined and shown in fig 1 a set of crossing lines perpendicular to the reference track line and the leading line shown in fig 2 is designed to acquire the trajectory data across the crossing line the statistical analysis is usually performed with the crossing lines to study the changes of those navigating characteristics throughout the inbound traffic lane the distance between two adjacent crossing lines is taken as a constant of 50 m the data of ship lateral position speed and heading provided by the ais information are recorded at each crossing line a total of 123 crossing lines are selected for analysis they are named as crossing line 1 crossing line 2 crossing line 3 to crossing line 123 from left to right in addition crossing lines 75 and 105 are located at the entrance and the pass of the harbor respectively the inner traffic lane is set in the area within such two crossing lines 4 statistical analysis of route data on crossing lines 4 1 spatial distribution montewka et al 2011 proposed an approach to evaluate the grounding probability two legs of a route leading to skldvig harbor were divided into sections and within each section the ship positions referred to the main sea lane axes were best fitted with the logistic loglogistic and weibull distributions xiao et al 2015 proposed a statistical approach for extracting and understanding ship traffic behaviors of ais data analysis in confined waterways such as a narrow waterway in the netherlands the port of rotterdam and a wide one in china wide waterway of yangtze river close to the su tong bridge by contrast with the logistic loglogistic and weibull distributions the normal distribution was used to fit the histogram of the lateral positions speeds and courses very well according to our studies the distribution function to fit the ship parameters acrossing crossing line acquired from ais data depends on many factors including the ship types and sizes environmental conditions such as wind and current the terrain of the area such as waterway width depth and its layout the traffic complexity and the local traffic regulation in this paper the inbound ship behaviors of kaohsiung harbor are analyzed to quantitatively assess the grounding risk on entrance and inner traffic lane for inbound sailings pilots embark at the pilot station and navigate vessels through the two way traffic lane to the entrance and then vessels continue the voyage along a leading line in the inner traffic lane the ship behavior data in the inner traffic lane are well approximated by a normal distribution through a chi square goodness of fit test and the comparison of statistical parameters fig 3 a and b shows the spatial distribution of post panamax container ships on crossing lines at the entrance and the pass the x axis is the lateral position from the leading line to the ship middle point and the y axis gives the fraction of ship numbers a chi square goodness of fit test shows that the spatial distribution is well approximated by a normal distribution further the parameters of the statistical test for example average standard deviation skewness and kurtosis are shown in table 3 we can find that most of the ships were navigating on the port side of leading line when approaching the entrance and the average lateral position is 30 1 m on the port side of the leading line however most of the ships prefer to stay closer to the leading line when navigating through the pass 4 2 speed distribution ship speed plays an important role in the inbound traffic safety it must be limited within a range if the ship speed is too slow it will affect maneuverability and may increase the inbound time the tidal window may be missed that will increase the grounding possibility on the other hand if the speed is too fast the operation time for striking or collision avoidance is reduced thus compromising the ship safety a ship will navigate with a safe speed in the inner traffic lane commonly the officer on watch should be able to decide a speed which guarantees the safety of the ship the ship speed is determined by many factors such as the experience of the officer ship position ship condition ship dimension ship type the waterway characteristic and the environment in general each ship will sail with its own speed which is required by good seamanship and that results in a variety of different ship speeds fig 4 a and b shows ship speed over ground sog distribution of post panamax containers at the entrance and the pass the x axis indicates the ship speed when the ship middle point passes through the crossing line and the y axis gives the fraction of ship numbers the speed of ships navigating across the entrance spanned in a range from 6 kn to 10 5 kn with a mean of 8 3 kn and a standard deviation of 1 1 kn since the pilot station is located at 1 5 nautical miles away from the entrance and the boarding speed for pilot embarkation is around 7 kn the pilots accelerate the ship speed to increase ship maneuverability and then keep the ship course and track to the entrance however after navigating through the entrance the ship decelerates along the inner traffic lane and proceeds to the pass the speed of ships across the pass spanned in a range from 4 kn to 8 kn with a mean of 6 2 kn and a standard deviation of 0 8 kn the speed maintained in this range was not too slow to anti wind force nor too fast to berthing or stopping a normal distribution function can be fitted well to the speed data shown in fig 4 4 3 heading angle distribution fig 5 a and b shows the histogram of heading angle distribution of post panamax container ships on crossing lines at the entrance and the pass the x axis is the heading angle and the y axis gives the density of numbers of fractions we can find that most of the ships keep heading consistent with the leading line when approaching the entrance however a majority of the ships turn to port side when navigating through the pass some of the vessels commence the turning at a distance from the pass this however causes the ships to deviate from the leading line of the channel and increase the danger of grounding 5 statistical analysis along inner traffic lane 5 1 average lateral position fig 6 a and b shows the mean lateral position along the inner traffic lane for container ships and bulk carriers the x axis denotes the index of the crossing lines whereas y axis indicates the mean lateral position the axis origin is the intercepts of the leading line and crossing lines positive for the starboard side for container ships we found that the ship track of the panamax class is similar to that of post panamax class the ships sail on the port side of the inner traffic lane in which a negative value of mean lateral position varied from 30 m at the entrance to 10 m at the pass on the other hand the track of the new panamax class is apparently different deviating to port side about 30 m than the panamax class the bulk carriers of all three classes keep the track port side away from the leading line and the deviations among the three classes are less than 20 m and with measures of more central tendency 5 2 average ship speed in fig 7 a and b show the sog along the inner traffic lane for container ships and bulk carriers the x axis signifies the index of crossing lines and y axis is the sog the inbound ships used a higher sog before proceeding through the entrance for standing against winds and currents the ship speed reduced when proceeding in the inner traffic lane for container ships the ship speed of the panamax class is similar to the post panamax one and is 8 3 kn at the entrance the speed of the new panamax class is 7 6 kn and is much slower than that of the post panamax class at the entrance while they have similar speeds around 5 4 kn at the pass the panamax class used a smaller sog and is around 5 2 kn at the pass for the bulk carriers the evolution of speed along the inner traffic lane is similar to the container ships the ship speed of the panamax class is similar to the capesize class and is 6 7 kn at the entrance the speed of very large bulk carriers is 6 0 kn and is much slower than the capesize class at the entrance although they have the similar speed of 5 2 kn at the pass 5 3 average heading angle fig 8 a and b shows the mean heading angle along the inner traffic lane for container ships and bulk carriers the direction of the leading line is 078 o the container group keeps the heading angle 080 o passing through the entrance and proceeding in the inner traffic lane the panamax and post panamax group begins to turn left at a distance about 0 4 nautical miles from the pass while new panamax keeps the heading up to 0 2 nautical miles the bulk carriers of all the three classes keep the heading angle on the leading line and begin to turn at about 0 2 nautical miles from the pass 6 risk assessment the depth of the inner traffic lane is around 16 17 m in this study we assume that the 14 m water depth line is the channel borderline about 230 m of width near the embankment and 180 m near the pass which is slightly stricter than the actual situation the draught of panamax and post panamax ships is about 9 12 m when the two types of ship sail beyond the channel borderline there may still be enough water depth to avoid grounding however the depth reduction shallow water and squatting effects will cause the grounding risk any divergence of tracks will increase the possibility of exceeding the channel borderline there are several reasons that significantly affect the ships navigating behavior and induce navigating danger one dangerous state is that fishing boats and merchant ships share the channel in kaohsiung port according to the experience of the vts supervisor some merchant ships give way to the fishing boats when encountering in the channel this avoiding operation will cause the merchant ships positions and courses to deviate from the inbound channel and lead to an additional danger another dangerous situation occurs when ships navigate through the pass it must turn left or right to approach the berthing piers some of the vessels commence the turning at a distance of 0 4 nautical miles from the pass this however causes the ships to deviate from the leading line of the channel and increase the danger of grounding according to the records of the ministry of transportation and communications the real number of grounding accidents is around 1 or 3 times a year however according to the experience of the vts vessel traffic service supervisor the ship is considered to be a high risk ship when it approaches the borderline of the channel the vts supervisor will contact and warn the ship to avoid exceeding the channel in this study to evaluate the navigating risk of inbound ships the potential grounding risk is defined as the probability of the ship s position exceeding the channel borderline that have caused or could have caused grounding accidents rather than that of the actual grounding events in order to more clearly illustrate the results of risk assessment we use the terminology of probability of the potential grounding scenario abbreviated as ppgs to denote the probability of exceeding the channel boundary moreover when a ship deviates to the leading line the pilot tends to correct the heading angle and ship position back to the leading line to avoid exceeding the borderline that means the grounding risk is not only dependent on the lateral position but also on the heading angle the probability of grounding abbreviated as pg is defined that the events satisfy both the criteria the ship exceeding the channel borderline and continues moving outside the boundary that is the pilot could not control the heading angle back to leading line 6 1 probability of the potential grounding scenario ppgs 6 1 1 crossing line method as the results in the previous section a ship proceeds in a channel the lateral position and the heading deviating from the leading line can be calculated with the ais data the positions of the four corners of ships including the port bow pb starboard bow sb port stern ps and starboard stern ss shown in fig 9 are of interest with the coordinate defined in fig 9 the following formulas define the lateral position of the four corner points the lateral position of the port and starboard outer corners y p and y s are easily identified as the smallest and the largest values of the four corner coordinates that are 5 y s max y s b y s s 6 y p min y p b y p s where y c is the position of the vessel midship point which is the lateral position or the cross track deviation from the leading line β is the deviation of the heading angle from the leading line with positive in clockwise direction l is the ship length and b indicates the ship beam the area between the track lines of y p and y s resulting from one ship path is mostly indicated as the swept path the lateral position of the port and starboard outer corners which are the function of the variables y c β l and b are evaluated at each crossing line the lateral position and heading for each ship path is acquired from the ais data as described in the previous section in order to assess the grounding risk at the entrance the following equations are used 7 p s i b s i n μ s i σ s i d x 8 p p i b p i n μ p i σ p i d x where p p i and p s i are the probability of exceeding channel borderline or the ppgs by previous definition on crossing line i at the port and starboard side the integral bounds b s i and b p i are the starboard and port boundary of the traffic lane in this study the spatial distributions of the outer port and starboard corners at each crossing line y p i and y s i are approximated by the normal distributions n μ p i σ p i and n μ s i σ s i respectively in the distributions μ p i μ s i and σ p i σ s i are the average and standard deviation of the random variables y p i and y s i at the crossing line i the ppgs at the port and the starboard side of the entrance and the pass of the inner traffic lane can be evaluated by the same procedures fig 10 a and b shows the histogram and the approximated normal distribution of the port and starboard outer corners at the entrance and the pass for post panamax container ships the lower tail port and the upper tail starboard of the distribution will give the probability of navigating outside the safe area in each crossing line and they will indicate the approximate risk area and its scope table 4 shows the ppgs of inbound container ships at the entrance and the pass the grounding risks of the starboard and port sides are evaluated by eqs 7 and 8 it is shown that the ppgs of the inbound ships at the entrance are around 10 5 order of magnitude or less for all three classes of container ships indicating the risk of grounding is not significant at the entrance however the ppgs at the starboard boundary of the pass are 10 2 to 10 3 order of magnitude which is apparently greater than the entrance in contrast to the starboard boundary the ppgs at the port boundary of the pass are 10 6 to 10 8 order of magnitude table 5 shows the ppgs of the inbound bulk carriers at the entrance and the pass in general the ppgs are around 10 5 order of magnitude or less except the ppgs of the class of very large bulk carrier at the starboard boundary of the entrance with a value of 10 4 indicating the risk of grounding is slightly larger than the others the ppgs at the starboard boundary of the pass are 10 2 to 10 4 order of magnitude for panamax and capsize vessels and are obviously greater than the entrance from tables 4 and 5 it is obvious that the ppgs at the starboard boundary of the inner traffic lane is significantly larger than the others and the pilots should pay more attention in this area it has to be pointed out that if a ship exceeds the channel boundary at a given crossing line the ship track would either go beyond the boundary in the following crossing lines and run aground or the vessel would be steered back within the boundary before a grounding takes place in this study a grounding sample is recorded when the ship track first exceeds the channel boundary at a given crossing line and the rest of the ship track would not be evaluated in following crossing lines accordingly we re defined the conditional probability of the potential grounding scenario which occurs precisely at the crossing line k p s k and p p k and is shown as follows 9 p s k p s k i 1 k 1 1 p s i 10 p p k p p k i 1 k 1 1 p p i the product over a set of terms from crossing line 1 to k 1 represents the probability of ship tracks from crossing line 1 to k 1 inside the channel width p s k and p p k are defined by eqs 7 and 8 respectively for crossing line k the aforementioned methodology denoted as a single crossing line method is used to evaluate the ppgs at the entrance with the single crossing line data a new methodology of risk assessment for the entrance denoted as a multi crossing line method in this research was proposed to compare with the previous results acquired using the single crossing line method in general pilots embark onboard ships at the pilot station navigates through the two way traffic lane and approach the entrance most of the collisions and groundings are reported during inbound maneuvering of the vessels thus the inbound maneuvering is considered as the most crucial stage a ship faces in her voyage the pilot plays an import role in a safe passage when approaching the port if any changes of the ambient factors occurred as the ship proceeds for example the effects of the wind tide wave or the state of the ship the danger of grounding would grow significantly under the conditions the pilot would maneuver the ship to turn away and abort its approaching plan before reaching a point distant away from the entrance where the occurrence of accidents is inevitable such a no longer turn away point is determined by many technical factors involved in maneuvering large seagoing merchant ships in the present study we assumed that the grounding risk at the entrance would include the area between the no longer turn away point and the entrance within which groundings would probably take place this phenomenon evaluated above illustrates that the ppgs at the entrance should consider the ships exceeding the channel boundary from a range of the upstream crossing lines accordingly the ppgs at the entrance p s e and p p e are redefined as follows 11 p s e i e p s i 12 p p e i e p p i where e is the set of crossing lines located in the no longer turn away area similarly we defined the ppgs when proceeding in the inner traffic lane p s i and p p i as follows 13 p s i i i p s i 14 p p i i i p p i where i is the set of crossing lines located in the inner traffic lane table 6 shows the ppgs of the inbound containers on the entrance and inner traffic lane the grounding risk at starboard and port sides of the entrance are evaluated by eqs 11 and 12 in this paper we assumed the no longer turn away point is located at a distance that is 2 times as long as the ship length away from the entrance where the crossing line in this region belongs to the set e it is shown that the ppgs of the inbound ships at the entrance are around 10 4 order of magnitude or less at the entrance the ppgs of the starboard boundary for the panamax class and the port boundary for the new panamax class are slightly larger than the others the comparison of the results between the single crossing line method shown in table 4 and multi crossing line method shown in table 6 reveals an acceptable agreement to evaluate the ppgs of the inner traffic lane using eqs 13 and 14 the crossing lines between the entrance and the pass are all included in a set of i the grounding probabilities at the starboard boundary of the inner traffic lane are 10 2 to 10 3 order of magnitude and are significantly greater than those of the port boundary from the results of the ppgs at the pass and inner traffic lane the starboard boundary is more dangerous than the port boundary table 7 shows the ppgs of the inbound bulk carriers on the entrance and inner traffic lane it is shown that the ppgs at the port boundary of the entrance are around 10 5 order of magnitude at the entrance the ppgs of the starboard boundary for panamax and very large bulk carriers by contrast are 10 4 order of magnitude and are larger than the port boundary when comparing the results of the single table 5 and multi crossing line methods table 7 the ppgs at the starboard boundary is larger than the port one in the vicinity of the entrance due to the consideration of the no longer turn away area similar results shown at the inner traffic lane the ppgs at the starboard boundary are larger than those of the port boundary in addition the capsize class is more dangerous in grounding among the three classes 6 1 2 monte carlo method burgers and kok 1988 used regression analysis method to deduce the ship navigation parameters under the pilot action in the specific environmental conditions in their method an attempt is made to construct a model which relates the distance from the channel border when ships pass by a crossing line with the one corresponding to the previous crossing lines based on the results of real time simulations in this study we extended the method to model the ship navigation parameters including the lateral position from the leading line denoted as y and the ship heading discrepancy from the leading line β see fig 9 with the one corresponding to the upstream cross lines the n t h degree polynomial model we proposed as follows 15 δ y i k 0 n a k y i 1 k z i y 16 δ β i k 0 n b k β i 1 k z i β where δ y i is the difference of lateral position to leading line between the cross line i and cross line i 1 shortly called increment of lateral position y i 1 is the lateral position to the leading line at cross line i 1 the parameters a k are obtained by a least square fit the similar polynomial model was used to define the difference of the heading discrepancy or shortly called the increment of heading denoted as δ β i which was described as a function of β i 1 the parameters b k are also obtained by a least square fit the random values z i y n 0 σ i y and z i β n 0 σ i β are generated from a normal distribution with a mean equal to 0 and standard deviation σ i y and σ i β which are in accordance with the root mean square error fig 11 a shows the linear correlation between the increment of the lateral position δ y and the lateral position y for new panamax containers at the entrance most of the sampled ships proceed through the entrance with a track close to the port side of the leading line the sampled increment δ y is strongly correlated with the ships lateral position it can be straightforwardly explained the more the ship is away from the leading line of the lane the more the pilot changes the ship position to come back to the leading line the correction rate per meter of the lateral deviation at the entrance is around 0 08 m fig 11b shows the linear correlation between the increment of heading δ β and heading deviation β for new panamax container ships at the entrance most of the sampled ships proceed through the entrance using a heading biased to the starboard side of the leading line the more the heading deviation on the starboard side of leading line is the greater the correction of the ship heading going back to the leading direction the correction rate is around 0 1 per degree of the heading deviation at the entrance it illustrated that the ships still continue correcting the ship position and direction at the entrance fig 12 a shows the linear correlation between the increment of heading δ β and heading deviation β for new panamax container ships at crossing line no 90 the most of the sampled ships proceed from the entrance to the pass along the inner traffic lane follows the direction of leading line the heading deviation and increment of heading are all around zero however at the pass shown in fig 12b the slope of correlation line is positive this means that the more the heading deviation is the greater the incremental of heading away to the leading line on both port and starboard sides it illustrated that the ships alter course before proceeding through the pass therefore the lateral positions at the pass are not concentrated around the leading line but spread out this increases the grounding risk at the pass since the width of the location is mostly confined to apply the monte carlo simulation three phases are worked out 1 the trajectory of the inbound ships based on ais data was restored and the ship navigation parameters are sampled at all of the crossing lines 2 the causation among the ship track parameters are established by using regression model through a crossing line with the track parameters corresponding to the previous crossing line or lines 3 the numerical simulation of a high number of maneuvers is conducted by means of the monto carlo method and the frequency of exceeding channel borderline on each crossing line was evaluated such a frequency was used to assess the risk of the entrance and the inner traffic lane with the notation in eqs 9 and 10 as well as by means of the results of monte carlo simulation the ppgs of the crossing line k p s k and p p k is defined as 17 p s k f s k i 1 k 1 1 f s i 18 p p k f p k i 1 k 1 1 f p i and 19 f s k n s k n i 1 k 1 n s i n p i 20 f p k n p k n i 1 k 1 n s i n p i where f s k and f p k are the frequencies of exceeding starboard and port borderline respectively on the crossing line k and n s k and n p k indicate the corresponding numbers n is the number of maneuvers with the definition of ppgs shown in eqs 11 14 the ppgs at the entrance p s e and p p e and the ppgs when proceeding in the inner traffic lane p s i and p p i can be evaluated by virtue of the monte carlo method and the ppgs at crossing line k defined based on eqs 17 and 18 then the ppgs of container ships on the entrance and inner traffic lane together with the consideration of no longer turn away area can be found in table 8 it is shown that the ppgs at the entrance are around 10 3 order of magnitude or less at the entrance the ppgs of the port boundary of new panamax containers are slightly larger than the others the results are consistent with the multi crossing lines method the ppgs at the starboard boundary of the inner traffic lane are 10 2 order of magnitude for panamax and post panamax container ships and are significantly greater than those of the port boundary the comparison of the results between the monte carlo method table 8 and multi crossing line method table 6 shows that the outcome of the monte carlo method one order of magnitude is larger than the multi crossing line method however a similar tendency and acceptable agreement of grounding risk are reached the ppgs of bulk carriers on the entrance and inner traffic lane with the effect of no longer turn away area is shown in table 9 the results show that the ppgs of the very large class at the entrance was larger than the others by contrast the ppgs of the three classes at the starboard boundary of the inner traffic lane was larger than those of the port boundary in order to achieve reasonable results by monte carlo simulations the required number of the simulations for each condition is based on the sensitivity analysis theoretically more repetitions of the maneuver will give more useful information on the specific limits of each condition nevertheless it is still balanced with the costs of obtaining such data 6 2 probability of grounding pg when a ship deviates to the right hand side of the leading line the pilot tends to correct the ship position back to the leading line to avoid exceeding the borderline hence the heading angle is negative on the contrary when the ship deviates to the left hand side of the leading line the heading angle is positive that means the grounding risk is not only dependent on the lateral position but also on the heading angle in addition to exceeding the channel borderline the condition of an event in which the ship is grounded must consider whether the ship continues to move outside the boundary that is the pilot could not control the heading angle back to leading line to evaluate the conditional probability of the grounding risk with the consideration of the lateral position and heading angle a two variate joint normal distribution was introduced to model the relations which has the density function as follows 21 n μ σ 1 2 π σ 1 2 e x p 1 2 x μ t σ 1 x μ where x y β is the vector of random variables the lateral position and the deviation of mean heading angle from the leading line μ and σ are the mean vector and the covariance matrix respectively defined as μ μ y μ β and σ σ y 2 ρ σ y σ β ρ σ y σ β σ β 2 fig 13 shows a typical sample scatter plot and the contour of probability density function of a joint normal distribution the data acquired from post panamax container ships at the entrance and the pass the means of the lateral positions μ y and the heading angle μ β are 29 2 and 0 11 respectively the standard deviations of the lateral position σ y and the heading from leading line σ β are 24 1 and 2 04 respectively the correlation coefficient ρ is 0 515 in addition to exceeding the channel borderline the condition of events in which the ship is grounded must consider whether the ship continues to move outside the boundary that is the pilot could not control the heading angle back to leading line the pg at crossing line i was defined as 22 p s i p y b s i β 0 0 π b s i n μ s i σ s i d y d β 23 p p i p y b p i β 0 π 0 b p i n μ s i σ s i d y d β the pg at the entrance and the pass for container ships and bulk carriers is shown in tables 10 and 11 respectively the comparison of the results between the pg by two variate model table 10 and the ppgs by univariate model table 4 shows that the probabilities of grounding are significantly decreased due to the elimination of the events sailing back to the leading line allowing for safety especially for the starboard side of the pass the probabilities of grounding are 10 5 order of magnitude since most ships turn left into the berthing pier with the two variate model the pg at the entrance considering the no longer turn away area as well as the grounding probability along inner traffic lane are defined using the multi crossing line method which is the same as equations 11 14 tables 12 and 13 show the results of the probability of grounding at the entrance and the inner traffic lane of container ships and bulk carriers accordingly the annual number of all the three classes of container ship grounding frequency is about 3 9 ships per year 6 3 the ais sensitivity test due to poor transmission or malfunctioning of sensors the information can easily be incorrectly coded broadcasted recorded or lost the ship trajectory is commonly restored by connecting the location points sequentially in terms of time series the accuracy of trajectory reduced due to lost data moreover the wrong trajectory was obtained from the incorrect data in this study the trajectory can be considered as a nearly straight line path when the inbound ship navigating on approaching channel the methods proposed by sang et al 2015 are used to identify and cleanse the irregularities moreover ship speed plays an important role in the inbound traffic safety it must be limited within a range the study focus on the navigating behaviors of the ship size larger the panamax on approaching channel the speed considered to acquire the ais data in a range of 4 14 knots according to the requirements of international telecommunication union itu the transmission period less than 10 s for class a ais that is the ship sailing distance between two continuous data points transmission distance around 20 70 m however the histogram of the transmission periods and the transmission distances obtained from the ais data analysis of the kaohsiung port are shown in fig 14 the average transmission period is 80 s and average transmission distance is 298 m the most of the data does not meet the requirements to improve the quality of data acquisition on crossing line we introduce two cutoff values the transmission period and distance to eliminate the poor data since the characteristic length of ship maneuverability was considered as the order of ship length the cutoff distance and time period are set to 600 m and 150 s respectively the trajectories missing signals that lead the period or distance between data exceeding the cutoff values are cleansed fig 2 shows the trajectories of new panamax container ship according to the annex 28 of imo resolution msc 115 73 the performance standards for combined gps glonass receiver equipment have the static and dynamic accuracy such that the position of the ship is determined to within 10 m with 95 confidence interval in differential mode and within 35 m with 95 confidence interval in non differential mode to consider the accuracy of ais data on the accuracy of the determination of the ppgs we add a noise from the gps receiver to the ais position data tables 14 and 15 show the impact of ais accuracy on the accuracy of the determination of the ppgs for single and multi crossing line method respectively the comparison of ppgs at the entrance and the pass or inner traffic lane among non noise 10 and 35 m 95 noise shows that the impacts are not obvious for 10 m 95 noise however the impacts are significant in the case of 35 m 95 noise 6 4 the reliability test following the criteria of reliability proposed by goerlandt and kujala 2014 the criteria r1 defined as the degree to which the risk analysis methods produce the same results at reruns of these methods in this study single and multi crossing line methods are deterministic algorithms based on historical ais data hence a rerun of these methods with identical parameter settings leads to identical results in contrast the monte carlo simulation is stochastic in nature a rerun of this method hence does not necessarily lead to identical results to test criterion r1 the monte carlo simulation is performed 3 times in each of these three applications of the method 50 monte carlo simulations are made and mean values of the calculated frequency estimate are compared as well as the confidence interval this test is referred to as test r1mcs figs 15 and 16 shows the rerun test results of monte carlo simulations mcs the scatterplots in the figure show pairwise comparisons of the risk metrics for the different crossing lines along the inner traffic lane fig 15 are the results of port side boundary and fig 16 are starboard boundary the left plot a is comparison of 1st and 2nd runs the middle plot b is for 2nd and 3rd runs and the right plot c is for 1st and 3rd runs the metric value for a specific crossing line according to the first test condition is read on the horizontal axis the results indicate that a rerun of monte carlo simulations a high reliability is obtained in terms of the mean overall ships exceed channel boundary frequency the multi crossing line and monte carlo methods are interdependent crossing line transit methods which are proposed to consider the causation of ship navigation risk on approaching channel the causation among the ship track parameters can be established by a regression model through a crossing line with the track parameters corresponding to the previous crossing line or lines the monte carlo method of ship trajectory evaluation was applied to assess the ppgs on approaching channel to investigate the effects of the spacing of crossing lines to the results we perform the crossing line refinement test with crossing line spacing of 25 50 100 150 m table 16 shows the comparison of ppgs among the different spacing with multi crossing line method the ppgs increase as the crossing line spacing reduced however the values are all in the same order of magnitude table 17 shows the comparison of ppgs among the different spacing with monte carlo method the ppgs converge well as the spacing reduced the result of crossing line refinement test indicates the performance of the monte carlo method which considers the causation of ship navigation risk 7 conclusion this study proposed two methods for assessing the safety of navigation on the entrance and the inner traffic lane based on the ais data such ais data were analyzed to acquire better knowledge about the ship behaviors of maneuvering the normal distribution functions can be fitted well to the spatial position and the speed data these results build up the basis of statistical analysis which can be applied to evaluate the navigation safety in addition both the crossing line and monte carlo methods which are independent and interdependent cross section transits are implemented to evaluate the maneuvering risk on the entrance and the inner traffic lane a quantitative risk assessment of the grounding risk at the entrance and inner traffic lane in kaohsiung port has been conducted the results of the risk probability acquired based on the crossing line and monte carlo methods are consistent with each other however the risk probability of the pass is relatively higher than that of the entrance the proposed methods could be applied to risk assessment of ship inbound operation for improving navigational safety in the congested waterway and approaching channel furthermore such a risk assessment methodology forms a useful tool in finding safety navigating routes and provides valuable information on waterway designs and traffic management we believe that the results of the grounding risk assessment can be provided to vts or oow officer of the watch as a reference for regulatory and transportation safety improvement much work still remains to be conducted for example the ship encounters on waterways human factors and ship responses to the navigational environment nevertheless the current work can be regarded as a pioneer paving the way for risk assessment of ships entering ports acknowledgments the support of this research by the ministry of science and technology taiwan through the grant most 103 2410 h 019 008 my2 are
