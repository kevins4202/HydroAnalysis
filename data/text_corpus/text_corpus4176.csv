20880,steel catenary riser scr is a preferred solution for deepwater oil and gas exploitation under harsh marine environment its riser seabed interaction rsi among touchdown zone tdz in consideration of the vortex induced vibration viv of sag bend is at present a research frontier in ocean engineering this paper integrates randolph quiggin model into a published global numerical riser model to investigate the nonlinear rsi response among tdz of an scr with viv the adopted numerical model is validated against some published experimental measurements for viv and rsi respectively three combined cases with top end platform heave motion and viv are simulated and the trench development as well as the scr s response characteristics among tdz is analyzed viv makes the trench develop more smoothly and the trench length as well as depth turns smaller the viv effect on rsi is relatively significant with violent heave excitation under which the p z curves present clearer interaction mode transitions viv enlarges the maximum bending moment visibly and makes the sag bend of scr dominated by higher order modes which are both detrimental to the structural safety the coupling effect between rsi and viv on the riser s dynamic response needs to be considered for the design of full scale scrs keywords steel catenary riser riser seabed interaction vortex induced vibration nonlinear dynamic response numerical analysis 1 introduction the growing demand for exploitation of oil gas mineral etc in deeper sea fields has led increasing attention towards the design of ultra long subsea pipelines steel catenary riser scr is one of the common marine equipment flexibly attached to a floating platform and seabed wellhead respectively at its top end and bottom the touchdown zone tdz could be defined as the region between the possible touchdown points tdps nearest and farthest from anchor point the region from anchor point to tdz is called flow line segment while the region between tdz and suspend point is sag bend segment as shown in fig 1 owing to its slender feature and particular configuration scr can withstand harsh marine environment and gradually becomes a preferred solution for deepwater resource production which is technically feasible and commercially efficient however scr is inevitably subjected to cyclic motions due to environmental loads and consequently susceptible to fatigue damage therefore the estimation of scr s structural safety especially among tdz is the most challenging issue in its design because of highly complicated riser seabed interaction rsi experimental investigation and numerical simulation are two mainly alternative approaches to achieve new sight of rsi at present according to different test scales the existing experimental investigations can be classified into field measurements constantinides et al 2011 full scale model tests 2h offshore engineering 2002 and small scale model tests wang et al 2014 dai and zhou 2018 zhao et al 2019 regarding numerical simulations two mathematical models of nonlinear soil resistance respectively proposed by randolph and quiggin 2009 hereinafter referred as r q model and aubeny and biscontin 2009 hereinafter referred as a b model are well recognized elosta et al 2013 and dong and shiri 2018 2019 adopted r q model to evaluate the local and globe dynamic response of steel catenary risers with seabed soil resistance while nakhaee and zhang 2010 and bai et al 2015 carried out the similar research work based on a b model zargar and kimiaei 2015 conducted a comparative study to investigate the advantages and disadvantages of r q model and a b model apart from r q model and a b model hejazi and kimiaei 2016 investigated the equivalent linear soil stiffness for the early stages of fatigue design of scrs to avoid the tremendously increasing computational costs dutta et al 2018 simulated the penetration and extraction of a shallow embedded riser section subjected to cyclic vertical loading with a computational fluid dynamics cfd approach zhang and wu 2019 used a dynamic boundary surface model with three dimensional finite element method to simulate saturated seabed and proposed an empirical degradation coefficient for the riser penetration resistance zargar et al 2019 reviewed the advantages and limitations of existing nonlinear models and introduced a new hysteretic model with a unified mathematical approach to simulate the seabed response for practical application the fatigue performance of scrs induced by rsi among tdz was investigated with several numerical simulations as well shoghi and shiri 2019 2020 above mentioned researches mainly focused on the cyclic loads induced by top end platform motions which could also be deemed as wave frequency excitations however under the actual marine environment vortex would shed periodically around cylindrical riser when ocean current flows through and generate oscillatory hydrodynamic force driving the riser vibrate significantly i e vortex induced vibration viv viv itself is a complex fluid structure interaction phenomenon and has been widely investigated with experimental observations blevins and coughran 2009 lie and kaasen 2006 zheng 2014 fu et al 2014 and numerical simulations vandiver and li 2005 thorsen et al 2016 wang et al 2019 qu and metrikine 2020 for an scr s dynamic analysis the tdz laying on the seabed would not experience ocean current excitation but the viv of sag bend is significant and the high frequency response energy would propagate along the riser to tdz in the manner of travelling wave therefore the scr s periodic oscillation induced by viv at tdp actually acts as an extra dynamic boundary condition for riser seabed interaction rsi while most of the existing researches on rsi did not take the viv of sag bend into account wang et al 2015 analyzed the fatigue damage among tdz of an scr experiencing riser seabed interaction induced by viv however since they employed a linear soil reaction force model and did not consider the top end platform motion excitation the numerical investigation still needs to be improved for further insight of the realistic dynamic behaviors of scrs the authors have developed a time domain numerical model for marine riser s viv prediction which is proved available for time varying tension and unsteady flow cases yuan et al 2018a 2018b as a consequent investigation this paper integrates r q model into the developed global numerical riser model to investigate the nonlinear rsi response among tdz of a steel catenary riser in consideration of vortex induced vibration firstly the adopted numerical model is validated against some published experimental measurements respectively for viv and rsi next the response characteristics of scr among tdz and seabed trench formation are analyzed in which both top end platform heave motion and viv are included then the effect of viv on rsi is discussed under slight moderate and violent excitation cases finally several conclusions are obtained to provide some reference for engineering application 2 methodology the adopted numerical analysis model for scr s dynamic response mainly originates from yuan et al 2018a based on which the nonlinear hysteretic rsi model proposed by randolph and quiggin 2009 are included this section concentrates on the description of rsi model and introduces the global numerical riser model briefly for the sake of conciseness more details about viv model could be found in yuan et al 2018a 2018b 2 1 global governing motion equation and numerical solution cartesian coordinate system is used to describe the numerical model where x axis is parallel with flat seabed y axis is perpendicular to riser layout plane and z axis is vertically upwards as shown in fig 1 in this study the incoming current is perpendicular to xoz plane so that the cross flow viv is in plane and affects the rsi among tdz directly the riser can be deemed as a flexural elastic structure satisfying the euler bernoulli beam hypothesis the governing differential equation of motion can be expressed as eq 1 bai et al 2015 elaborated that the continuous distributed force of soil and large curvature near the tdz of scr could be considered acceptably with euler bernoulli beam elements as long as the mesh size is small enough 1 m s r

tension f hydro is the hydrodynamic force and f soil is the seabed soil resistance eq 1 is discretized in space by using finite element method fem and the adopted time domain numerical model is based on direct integration dynamic analysis hilber hughes taylor hht method is used to solve the scr s global governing motion equation due to its better convergence calculation accuracy and computational efficiency hht method is regarded as an improved newmark β method when α 1 3 0 β 1 α 2 4 and γ 1 2 α 2 hht method is unconditionally stable automatic convergence checks are applied to the force residuals with standard parameter α 0 05 the stable time increment is selected as 0 001 f max where f max is the maximum expected fundamental frequency it means there are at least 1000 steps during each vibration period of the cylinder which has been found to be sufficient i e reducing the time increment gives no change in the predicted results 2 2 rsi model randolph and quiggin 2009 proposed a mathematical model of the reaction force normal to the seabed experienced by a catenary riser in contact with the seabed it could capture the hysteretic behavior of the seabed response and the increasing penetration of the riser under cycles of load in the vertical plane the model is intended for use in practical engineering analysis and has been implemented in a commercial riser analysis program orcina 2008 with the satisfactory validations against the measured results for riser seabed interaction from laboratory and harbor experiments this paper adopts the mathematical model proposed by randolph and quiggin 2009 to simulate the nonlinear rsi fig 2 a shows the seven possible modes existing in the rsi process i e ①initial penetration ②uplift ③further uplift resisted by suction ④suction decays if uplift continues ⑤suction releases with repenetration ⑥further penetration ⑦repenetration following lift off during each episode the nonlinear soil model is described with a hyperbolic secant stiffness formulation the ultimate penetration resistance limits p u z for penetration and p u suc z for uplift are given by eq 2 and eq 3 2 p u z n c z s z d 3 p u s u c z f s u c p

element at each structure node among tdz to take the nonlinear spring dashpot effect into consideration as shown in fig 3 the flowchart of the procedure of nonlinear rsi is illustrated in fig 4 wang et al 2015 used three lines to simplify the complicated riser seabed interaction and proposed a linear model where five modes i e initial penetration uplift partial riser seabed separation full riser seabed separation and repenetration are included as shown in fig 2 b the backbone curve during initial penetration episode still follows eq 2 and then point z 1 p 1 is obtained with eq 15 eq 17 points z 2 p 2 and z 3 p 3 are located and finally three lines could be drawn to further evaluate the performance of r q model the linear model is simulated for comparison as well 15 p 2 f s u c p 1 16 y 1 y

hydrodynamic force f h y d r o is written as eq 18 decomposed into three force components i e excitation force f v damping force f d and inertia force f m i e the first second and third terms on the right side respectively 18 f h y d r o f v f d f m 1 2 c v a d f d v t ρ f d v t v t cos 2 π f t 1 2 c f a d f d v t y t π 4 c a ρ f d 2 2 y t 2 where c v is the excitation force coefficient a is the

coefficient c a is the added mass coefficient which is assumed as a constant 1 0 in this paper hydrodynamic force coefficients c v and c f are both time varying functions of response amplitude a and frequency f based on the measured coefficient contour from the cylinder forced vibration test gopalkrishnan 1993 positive c v represents excitation zone where the power will be transferred from fluid to riser among the damping zone or outside the experimental data range c v will be negative and transfer to hydrodynamic damping force strouhal number is a non dimensional hydrodynamic parameter and can be expressed as f s d v where f s is the vortex shedding frequency lock in is the most significant characteristic of viv according to zheng 2014 the non dimensional frequency range of 0 125 0 25 is set as the lock in region in this study which needs to be corrected by eq 19 for the difference of strouhal number between the actual and test circumstances 19 f r s t t e s t f r s t a c t u a l where f r is the non dimensional frequency f r f d v if the non dimensional response frequency is located within the excitation bandwidth lock in occurs the cylinder element will be synchronized onto the structural natural frequency closest to f r 0 17 where corresponds to the largest excitation force coefficient here f r 0 17 also needs to be corrected by eq 19 the lock in natural frequency is regarded as viv dominant frequency to calculate excitation force coefficient c v the second order digital control loop in grant et al 2000 is adopted to guarantee the excitation force is always in phase with the local velocity of the cylinder when c v is negative i e the non dimensional response frequency is outside the excitation bandwidth hydrodynamic damping will act on the cylinder and viv dominant frequency is regarded equal to response frequency the negative c v is translated to hydrodynamic damping coefficient c f with eq 20 20 c f c v a d f d v t ρ f v 2 t d 4 π a f outside the experimental data range the empirical nonlinear damping model proposed by venugopal 1996 will be adopted where the empirical coefficients c hf c sw and c lf are recommended taking 0 18 0 25 and 0 2 the adopted viv model assembling with structural governing motion equation and numerical solution has been widely used to handle different load cases in yuan et al 2018a 2018b where more detailed descriptions could be found 3 model validation to the knowledge of the authors there seems still no comparable experimental investigation in consideration of scr s rsi and viv simultaneously the developed numerical model could only be validated for rsi and viv separately 3 1 validation for rsi wang et al 2014 conducted a large scale 3d soil structure test at zhejiang university the test apparatus configuration is shown in fig 5 a mainly consisting of two parts a long flume with soil and water inside a bidirectional loading actuation system located at flume end the actuator system can drive the riser s top end to follow specified movement paths in vertical and horizontal directions the main parameters of the test riser model are given in table 1 ten draw wire displacement sensors dw are mounted above the riser to monitor local displacements and quantify trench formation the measurement positions are shown in fig 5 b dw1 dw4 are 3m 4m 5m 6m horizontally from the riser s top end a vertically cyclic test case is selected for comparison and the harmonic amplitude and frequency are 48 mm and 0 2hz respectively fig 6 gives the riser penetration comparison at different axial locations left is test measurements middle is the predicted result from r q model and right is from linear model r q model could bring reasonable time histories of the riser s local penetration at dw1 dw4 which are close to test measurements both test and predicted results show that riser penetration increases with more cycles and the penetration variation trends to slow down after two hundred cycles the maximum and minimum penetration appears at dw2 and dw4 and the test and predicted values are quantitatively approximate however the predicted results with linear model are a little unsatisfactory the riser location penetration at dw1 dw4 keeps unchanged after about ten movement cycles both the variation trend and magnitude value deviate from test measurements the trench development comparison between test and predicted results is presented by fig 7 where symbols denote test measurements solid lines denote the predicted result from r q model and dotted lines denote that from line model for the predicted result with r q model the static initial trench shape shows a good agreement with test measurement although it is slightly far from test data when n 10 and 50 the trench development becomes gradually consistent with test data from n 100 to n 200 while with linear model the trench stops developing after n 10 corresponding to the variation trend in fig 6 the maximum trench depth at n 200 from linear model is 0 5d and the prediction error is 17 with test data equal to 0 6d while the corresponding error of r q model is only 3 in general r q model is able to reflect the trench development process and shows better performance for rsi simulation 3 2 validation for viv yuan et al 2017 2018a 2018b have well validated the adopted viv model against experimental measurements of top tensioned risers ttrs under steady flow cases unsteady flow cases and time varying tension cases here just gives an additional result comparison of an scr undergoing viv in flow to prove the availability of the numerical model for scrs the model test performed by 2h offshore engineering ltd in marintek which is described by moe et al 2004 is simulated in this study fig 8 presents the test apparatus configuration the model riser is mounted in the water below the carriage the lower end of the scr was supported by a vertical strut which is fixed to the carriage while the top end was supported by a swivel arm attached to the strut just below the carriage the main parameters of the test scr are listed in table 2 both the current velocity and the inclination angle between the current and the riser plane are systematically varied different from ttr the viv of scr under the currents with different directions may present different response characteristics in fact mainly the response in and out of riser plane is easy to be excited this section selects two cases with the current perpendicular and parallel to riser plane to compare the cross flow viv response and the current velocity is 0 26 m s fig 9 shows the maximum viv displacement envelop comparison along the scr between test and predicted results left and right denote the current perpendicular and parallel to riser plane respectively under the two simulated cases both the 5th modes dominate the viv response with current parallel to riser plane the viv displacement envelop a max 0 86d is relatively smaller than that with current perpendicular to riser plane a max 0 66d the predicted displacement distributions as well as magnitude values shows a good agreement with test result which means the adopted viv model is available for both ttr and scr although it seems still difficult to evaluate the performance of the developed numerical model for the rsi response prediction among tdz of scrs in consideration of viv its availability for rsi and viv is validated well against comparable experimental measurements respectively thus the adopted numerical model could be believed able to provide reasonable prediction results for subsequent investigations 4 dynamic response analysis based on section 3 1 r q model presents obvious advantages over linear model therefore only r q model is used for the following rsi investigation the main parameters of the simulated full scale riser and seabed soil in this section are listed by table 3 4 1 region classification of scr with scr and seabed interacting the tdp actually changes with time rather than a fixed location here firstly describes the region classification along the riser span using a representative top end heave case viv is not included with x s 1000m a heave 4m and t heave 30s where x s is the transverse span of scr s top end suspend point a heave and t heave are the amplitude and frequency of top end heave fig 10 shows the respective tdps at two different time points where red line denotes the trench shape when t 65s tdp is s 730m while it becomes s 764m when t 80s tdz is the region between the possible tdps nearest and farthest from anchor point i e type ii region in fig 10 the region from anchor point to tdz is flow line segment i e type i region and the region between tdz and suspend point is sag bend segment i e type iii region according to the riser region classification three axial locations i e s 720m 750m and 780m are selected as shown in fig 10 to compare the local response characteristics among different regions fig 11 presents the vertical displacement time histories left and p z curves right at s 720m 750m and 780m since s 780m among scr s sag bend will not contact with seabed no p z curve is given and the displacement time history follows standard sinusoidal shape s 720m among flow line always attaches to seabed and its movement is restricted so the vertical displacement develops slowly without obvious vibration the p z curve evolves among a narrow range and no soil suction force appears while for s 750m among tdz its movement is relatively free and affected by rsi significantly the displacement time history has a large amplitude modulation and its trough part is flat due to the action of soil resistance the maximum penetration enlarges evidently with cyclic top end heave excitation the corresponding p z curve presents complete loops containing the resistance and suction variations with riser initially penetrating uplifting and repenetrating since the riser s tdz presents the most complicated dynamic response and could reflect rsi process entirely the consequent investigation mainly focuses on the response characteristics among tdz of the scr 4 2 viv analysis to investigate the effect of viv on rsi it is necessary to firstly understand the viv response characteristics of scr in flow the riser configuration and encountered flow field are two main influence factors of viv response for a specific scr the transverse span of suspend point affects the riser configuration evidently fig 12 presents the scr s static configurations with near x s 1300m mean x s 1350m and far x s 1400m suspension under far suspension case the tdp of scr is closest to anchor point corresponding to s 325m while s tdp for mean and near cases are 420m and 495m respectively from sea surface to seabed the transverse span deviation at suspend point is magnified at tdp the rms displacement envelops along the scr with different suspend states under uniform flow with v 0 6 m s are given in fig 13 the viv response among scr s top part looks approximate under three suspension cases while the response among bottom part presents obvious differences although the dynamic response of scr is all dominated by mode 7 the local displacement amplitude near tdp is visibly larger under near suspension case than mean and far cases in fact near suspension case brings the steepest sag bend especially for the bottom part near tdz and the local encountered flow velocity is relatively large which is beneficial for viv to be excited the rsi of scr is mainly affected by the dynamic response near tdp so the near suspension case is selected for subsequent investigation due to its most significant viv response the flow velocity profile also affects scr s viv evidently uniform flow sheared flow and quadratic flow are three common flow velocity profiles to simply simulate the encountered flow field of scr in the existing researches this section includes these three flow forms as well and the adopted flow velocity distributions from seabed to sea surface of uniform flow sheared flow and quadratic flow are shown in fig 14 fig 15 gives the rms displacement envelops along the scr under different flow profiles where the near suspension with x s 1300m is simulated the viv response excited by uniform flow sheared flow and quadratic flow looks quite different mode 17 dominates the scr s dynamic response under uniform flow while the dominant modal order under sheared flow and quadratic flow is lower in general the viv response among scr s top part under quadratic flow is relatively large while among the focus area of rsi i e bottom part of sag bend the displacement amplitude is larger under uniform flow and sheared flow in fact sheared flow is more approximate to the actual flow field form than uniform flow based on the published field measurements of marine environment therefore the sheared flow in fig 14 is performed in the following numerical analysis 4 3 simulated cases of rsi with viv this paper aims to reveal the rsi response characteristics with the combined excitation of top end heave and viv according to section 4 2 the near suspension with x s 1300m and sheared flow with v top 1 m s are chosen to simulate the significant viv response where v top means the flow velocity at sea surface three different levels of top end heave excitations are considered in this paper small amplitude and long period bring slight heave excitation the slight heave case denotes a heave 1m and t heave 25s the moderate case denotes a heave 2m and t heave 20s and the violent case denotes a heave 3m and t heave 15s ten entire cycles are simulated to present the viv effect on rsi clearly each heave case is performed with and without viv respectively and both the trench development process and scr s dynamic response are compared as follows 4 4 trench development fig 16 shows the trench shape evolution with different top end heave excitations a b and c are slight moderate and violent cases respectively firstly focusing the result with rsi only top end cyclic heave excitation forms a spoon shape trench gradually and the trench length as well as depth trends to enlarge with more violent heave excitation i e large amplitude or short period the trench depth excited by slight heave after ten load cycles is 0 15m while the corresponding value with violent heave is 0 26m the heave level has little influence on the trench location and the trench maximum penetration all corresponds to s 485m after enough load cycles when viv is included the trench shape keeps unchanged but trench length and depth turn smaller with the same load cycles as far as the final trench depth is concerned the reduction proportion with and without viv is 10 20 based on the simulated three cases the time histories of trench maximum penetration and depth increment with different top end heave excitations are given by fig 17 different levels of heave excitations follow the same variation tendency the trench maximum penetration gradually increases with cyclic heave excitation from the trench depth increment variation the trench development velocity decreases significantly during the first several load cycles then trends to zero after enough load cycles and the slight heave excitation uses less load cycles to form a stable trench configuration viv makes the trench maximum penetration increase more smoothly the trench development velocity with viv is obviously smaller than that without viv and the trench configuration reaches a stable situation experiencing less heave excitations in essence with the same heave excitation level the trench depth is proportional to the local stiffness of scr s tdz scr s top end heave belongs to a kind of low frequency excitation difficult to trigger the riser s resonance under which the dynamic stiffness is approximate to the structural static stiffness while when viv occurs the riser is synchronized to its natural frequencies and the structural dynamic stiffness among tdz fades significantly much smaller than the static stiffness that s why viv results in a smooth trench formation process 4 5 scr s response characteristics the time histories left and amplitude spectra right of vertical displacement at s 485m with different top end heave excitations are presented in fig 18 during each heave period the riser s local segment among tdz moves up and down and the deepest vertical displacement gradually sinks after each load cycle especially for violent heave case the vertical displacement at s 485s follows an obvious modulation process containing a lifting segment and a stepped sinking segment accompanying with viv the vertical displacement also presents the similar variation tendency of gradual decrease and the deepest displacement is slightly larger than that without viv the viv effect is relatively significant under violent heave case where the modulation amplitude of vertical displacement changes a lot at different load cycles for example the amplitude at 6th cycle is obviously larger than that at the adjacent cycles this is a synergism of low frequency rsi and high frequency viv according to the amplitude spectra the dynamic response excited by slight and moderate heaves is dominated by low frequency components and the frequency spectra with and without viv look approximate while under violent heave case some high frequency response is excited moreover viv makes the concentrated energy at high frequencies strengthen furtherly in fact violent heave excitation results in deeper trench as well as steeper sag bend beneath mudline which is beneficial for viv to propagate along riser span to tdz therefore the viv effect turns visible with top end violent heave excitation fig 19 gives the p z curves at s 485m with different top end heave excitations a b and c denote slight moderate and violent cases respectively associated with the illustration of seven rsi modes in fig 2 a the p z curves with different heave excitations could be analyzed in detail with top end slightly heaving the seabed reaction force of scr is always positive and changes without obvious regularity the interaction between scr and seabed is not pronounced at the first phase and then quickly keeps narrow p z curves containing initial penetration uplift and further repenetration modes only under moderate heave case the nonlinear rsi is triggered significantly and finally presents some complete p z loops with uplift further uplift resisted by suction and further penetration modes transiting alternately the further penetration segment is very steep and the suction decays if uplift continues mode is still not evident enough when top end heave turns violent the regularity of seabed reaction force variation trends to be clear according to the p z curves at the rsi beginning the seabed suction acting on scr decays to zero and the riser repenetrates following lift off after the first several unstable load cycles the scr would experience periodical seabed reactions different from the other two cases the penetration deviation between the scr s uplift and further penetration is much larger so the suction decays if uplift continues mode is very visible compared the results with and without viv the p z curves generally follows the similar tendency but viv drives the rsi smoother which manifests as smaller penetration depth and clearer interaction mode transitions the maximum bending moment envelops along the scr s tdz with different top end heave excitations are shown in fig 20 more violent heave excitation results in larger bending moment and the axial location corresponding to maximum bending moment is closer to trench bottom i e s 485m in this study in essence the maximum bending moment always appears at the axial location where the curvature variation of riser is maximum since the trench shape is smooth at its rear part near anchor point the maximum riser s curvature variation should locates at the front of seabed trench near sag bend violent top end cyclic load drives the trench especially the front part to be deep and steep which means maximum curvature variation location moves close to trench bottom therefore the maximum bending moment under slight moderate and violent cases corresponds to s 495m 490m and 486m respectively moreover with heave excitation changing from slight to violent the maximum bending moment envelop trends to present two peaks viv enlarges the maximum bending moment visibly and makes the two peaks much clearer under violent case the coupling effect of viv and rsi worsens the scr s bending moment response which is detrimental to the structural safety thus it is necessary to take the aggravation effect between rsi and viv on the riser s dynamic response into consideration at the engineering design stage of full scale scrs fig 21 gives the rms displacement envelops along the scr with different top end heave excitations more violent top end heave leads to larger rms displacement response when only rsi is considered slight and moderate cases excite the 2nd mode of sag bend while violent case excites the higher order i e 3rd mode for the combined cases the 3rd and 4th modes are excited respectively with moderate and violent heave excitations which means viv makes the sag bend of scr dominated by higher order modes viv also enlarges the maximum rms displacement under violent heave case 5 conclusion based on a published viv model and the widely used randolph quiggin soil reaction force model the nonlinear riser seabed interaction response among tdz of a steel catenary riser is investigated numerically the adopted numerical analysis method is compared with experimental measurements for rsi and viv respectively at first rsi and viv are investigated separately then three combined cases with both top end platform heave motion and viv are simulated and the response characteristics of scr among tdz as well as seabed trench formation is analyzed some conclusions are drawn as follows 1 since there seems still no directly comparable experimental research the developed numerical model is respectively validated available for rsi and viv against the published test measurements which to some extent proves the numerical analysis method able to give reasonable prediction results for the combined cases with rsi and viv 2 as far as rsi is concerned top end cyclic heave excitation forms a spoon shape trench gradually and the scr s tdp changes with time according to the different response characteristics the riser could be classified as three segments along its whole span i e tdz flow line and sag bend tdz presents the most complicated dynamic response since it interacts with seabed directly and frequently 3 the scr s configuration and encountered flow field are two main influence factors of the viv response of sag bend under far suspension case the tdp of scr is closest to anchor point while near suspension case presents the largest viv displacement response near tdz under the actual marine environment the encountered flow is approximate to sheared or quadratic flow compared with quadratic flow sheared flow excites relatively large viv displacement among the focused bottom area of the riser s rsi 4 different levels of heave excitations follow the same trench variation tendency the trench maximum penetration gradually increases with cyclic load and the trench development velocity trends to decrease slight heave excitation uses less load cycles to form a stable trench configuration both the trench length and depth trend to enlarge with more violent heave excitation while the heave level has little influence on the trench location viv makes the trench depth increase more smoothly and the trench development velocity turns lower the trench configuration reaches stable situation experiencing less heave excitations and the trench length as well as depth becomes smaller 5 the viv effect on rsi is relatively significant with violent heave excitation under violent heave case some high frequency response among scr s tdz is excited and viv makes the concentrated energy at high frequencies strengthen furtherly with top end slightly heaving the seabed reaction force of scr is always positive and changes without obvious regularity when top end heave turns violent the scr would experience periodical seabed reaction and the suction decays if uplift continues mode is very visible viv drives the rsi smoother manifesting as smaller penetration depth and clearer interaction mode transitions 6 more violent heave excitation results in larger bending moment and the axial location corresponding to maximum bending moment is closer to trench bottom viv enlarges the maximum bending moment visibly and makes the two peaks much clearer under violent case violent heave case excites higher order mode of scr s sag bend and viv makes the sag bend of scr dominated by higher order modes furtherly viv also enlarges the maximum rms displacement under violent heave case it is necessary to take the coupling effect between rsi and viv on the riser s dynamic response into account at the engineering design stage of full scale scrs the present numerical model has not included the stiffness degradation of seabed induced by long term cyclic load or fluid flushing besides the lateral rsi is another interesting research issue worthy of attention and would couple with vertical rsi while this paper mainly focuses on vertical rsi only at the current stage the relevant experimental investigations could be carried out in the future to understand the essential mechanism of seabed stiffness

20880,steel catenary riser scr is a preferred solution for deepwater oil and gas exploitation under harsh marine environment its riser seabed interaction rsi among touchdown zone tdz in consideration of the vortex induced vibration viv of sag bend is at present a research frontier in ocean engineering this paper integrates randolph quiggin model into a published global numerical riser model to investigate the nonlinear rsi response among tdz of an scr with viv the adopted numerical model is validated against some published experimental measurements for viv and rsi respectively three combined cases with top end platform heave motion and viv are simulated and the trench development as well as the scr s response characteristics among tdz is analyzed viv makes the trench develop more smoothly and the trench length as well as depth turns smaller the viv effect on rsi is relatively significant with violent heave excitation under which the p z curves present clearer interaction mode transitions viv enlarges the maximum bending moment visibly and makes the sag bend of scr dominated by higher order modes which are both detrimental to the structural safety the coupling effect between rsi and viv on the riser s dynamic response needs to be considered for the design of full scale scrs keywords steel catenary riser riser seabed interaction vortex induced vibration nonlinear dynamic response numerical analysis 1 introduction the growing demand for exploitation of oil gas mineral etc in deeper sea fields has led increasing attention towards the design of ultra long subsea pipelines steel catenary riser scr is one of the common marine equipment flexibly attached to a floating platform and seabed wellhead respectively at its top end and bottom the touchdown zone tdz could be defined as the region between the possible touchdown points tdps nearest and farthest from anchor point the region from anchor point to tdz is called flow line segment while the region between tdz and suspend point is sag bend segment as shown in fig 1 owing to its slender feature and particular configuration scr can withstand harsh marine environment and gradually becomes a preferred solution for deepwater resource production which is technically feasible and commercially efficient however scr is inevitably subjected to cyclic motions due to environmental loads and consequently susceptible to fatigue damage therefore the estimation of scr s structural safety especially among tdz is the most challenging issue in its design because of highly complicated riser seabed interaction rsi experimental investigation and numerical simulation are two mainly alternative approaches to achieve new sight of rsi at present according to different test scales the existing experimental investigations can be classified into field measurements constantinides et al 2011 full scale model tests 2h offshore engineering 2002 and small scale model tests wang et al 2014 dai and zhou 2018 zhao et al 2019 regarding numerical simulations two mathematical models of nonlinear soil resistance respectively proposed by randolph and quiggin 2009 hereinafter referred as r q model and aubeny and biscontin 2009 hereinafter referred as a b model are well recognized elosta et al 2013 and dong and shiri 2018 2019 adopted r q model to evaluate the local and globe dynamic response of steel catenary risers with seabed soil resistance while nakhaee and zhang 2010 and bai et al 2015 carried out the similar research work based on a b model zargar and kimiaei 2015 conducted a comparative study to investigate the advantages and disadvantages of r q model and a b model apart from r q model and a b model hejazi and kimiaei 2016 investigated the equivalent linear soil stiffness for the early stages of fatigue design of scrs to avoid the tremendously increasing computational costs dutta et al 2018 simulated the penetration and extraction of a shallow embedded riser section subjected to cyclic vertical loading with a computational fluid dynamics cfd approach zhang and wu 2019 used a dynamic boundary surface model with three dimensional finite element method to simulate saturated seabed and proposed an empirical degradation coefficient for the riser penetration resistance zargar et al 2019 reviewed the advantages and limitations of existing nonlinear models and introduced a new hysteretic model with a unified mathematical approach to simulate the seabed response for practical application the fatigue performance of scrs induced by rsi among tdz was investigated with several numerical simulations as well shoghi and shiri 2019 2020 above mentioned researches mainly focused on the cyclic loads induced by top end platform motions which could also be deemed as wave frequency excitations however under the actual marine environment vortex would shed periodically around cylindrical riser when ocean current flows through and generate oscillatory hydrodynamic force driving the riser vibrate significantly i e vortex induced vibration viv viv itself is a complex fluid structure interaction phenomenon and has been widely investigated with experimental observations blevins and coughran 2009 lie and kaasen 2006 zheng 2014 fu et al 2014 and numerical simulations vandiver and li 2005 thorsen et al 2016 wang et al 2019 qu and metrikine 2020 for an scr s dynamic analysis the tdz laying on the seabed would not experience ocean current excitation but the viv of sag bend is significant and the high frequency response energy would propagate along the riser to tdz in the manner of travelling wave therefore the scr s periodic oscillation induced by viv at tdp actually acts as an extra dynamic boundary condition for riser seabed interaction rsi while most of the existing researches on rsi did not take the viv of sag bend into account wang et al 2015 analyzed the fatigue damage among tdz of an scr experiencing riser seabed interaction induced by viv however since they employed a linear soil reaction force model and did not consider the top end platform motion excitation the numerical investigation still needs to be improved for further insight of the realistic dynamic behaviors of scrs the authors have developed a time domain numerical model for marine riser s viv prediction which is proved available for time varying tension and unsteady flow cases yuan et al 2018a 2018b as a consequent investigation this paper integrates r q model into the developed global numerical riser model to investigate the nonlinear rsi response among tdz of a steel catenary riser in consideration of vortex induced vibration firstly the adopted numerical model is validated against some published experimental measurements respectively for viv and rsi next the response characteristics of scr among tdz and seabed trench formation are analyzed in which both top end platform heave motion and viv are included then the effect of viv on rsi is discussed under slight moderate and violent excitation cases finally several conclusions are obtained to provide some reference for engineering application 2 methodology the adopted numerical analysis model for scr s dynamic response mainly originates from yuan et al 2018a based on which the nonlinear hysteretic rsi model proposed by randolph and quiggin 2009 are included this section concentrates on the description of rsi model and introduces the global numerical riser model briefly for the sake of conciseness more details about viv model could be found in yuan et al 2018a 2018b 2 1 global governing motion equation and numerical solution cartesian coordinate system is used to describe the numerical model where x axis is parallel with flat seabed y axis is perpendicular to riser layout plane and z axis is vertically upwards as shown in fig 1 in this study the incoming current is perpendicular to xoz plane so that the cross flow viv is in plane and affects the rsi among tdz directly the riser can be deemed as a flexural elastic structure satisfying the euler bernoulli beam hypothesis the governing differential equation of motion can be expressed as eq 1 bai et al 2015 elaborated that the continuous distributed force of soil and large curvature near the tdz of scr could be considered acceptably with euler bernoulli beam elements as long as the mesh size is small enough 1 m s r

tension f hydro is the hydrodynamic force and f soil is the seabed soil resistance eq 1 is discretized in space by using finite element method fem and the adopted time domain numerical model is based on direct integration dynamic analysis hilber hughes taylor hht method is used to solve the scr s global governing motion equation due to its better convergence calculation accuracy and computational efficiency hht method is regarded as an improved newmark β method when α 1 3 0 β 1 α 2 4 and γ 1 2 α 2 hht method is unconditionally stable automatic convergence checks are applied to the force residuals with standard parameter α 0 05 the stable time increment is selected as 0 001 f max where f max is the maximum expected fundamental frequency it means there are at least 1000 steps during each vibration period of the cylinder which has been found to be sufficient i e reducing the time increment gives no change in the predicted results 2 2 rsi model randolph and quiggin 2009 proposed a mathematical model of the reaction force normal to the seabed experienced by a catenary riser in contact with the seabed it could capture the hysteretic behavior of the seabed response and the increasing penetration of the riser under cycles of load in the vertical plane the model is intended for use in practical engineering analysis and has been implemented in a commercial riser analysis program orcina 2008 with the satisfactory validations against the measured results for riser seabed interaction from laboratory and harbor experiments this paper adopts the mathematical model proposed by randolph and quiggin 2009 to simulate the nonlinear rsi fig 2 a shows the seven possible modes existing in the rsi process i e ①initial penetration ②uplift ③further uplift resisted by suction ④suction decays if uplift continues ⑤suction releases with repenetration ⑥further penetration ⑦repenetration following lift off during each episode the nonlinear soil model is described with a hyperbolic secant stiffness formulation the ultimate penetration resistance limits p u z for penetration and p u suc z for uplift are given by eq 2 and eq 3 2 p u z n c z s z d 3 p u s u c z f s u c p

element at each structure node among tdz to take the nonlinear spring dashpot effect into consideration as shown in fig 3 the flowchart of the procedure of nonlinear rsi is illustrated in fig 4 wang et al 2015 used three lines to simplify the complicated riser seabed interaction and proposed a linear model where five modes i e initial penetration uplift partial riser seabed separation full riser seabed separation and repenetration are included as shown in fig 2 b the backbone curve during initial penetration episode still follows eq 2 and then point z 1 p 1 is obtained with eq 15 eq 17 points z 2 p 2 and z 3 p 3 are located and finally three lines could be drawn to further evaluate the performance of r q model the linear model is simulated for comparison as well 15 p 2 f s u c p 1 16 y 1 y

hydrodynamic force f h y d r o is written as eq 18 decomposed into three force components i e excitation force f v damping force f d and inertia force f m i e the first second and third terms on the right side respectively 18 f h y d r o f v f d f m 1 2 c v a d f d v t ρ f d v t v t cos 2 π f t 1 2 c f a d f d v t y t π 4 c a ρ f d 2 2 y t 2 where c v is the excitation force coefficient a is the

can be expressed as f s d v where f s is the vortex shedding frequency lock in is the most significant characteristic of viv according to zheng 2014 the non dimensional frequency range of 0 125 0 25

regarded as viv dominant frequency to calculate excitation force coefficient c v the second order digital control loop in grant et al 2000 is adopted to guarantee the excitation force is always in phase with the local velocity of the cylinder when c v is negative i e the non dimensional response frequency is outside the excitation bandwidth hydrodynamic damping will act on the cylinder and viv dominant frequency is regarded equal to response frequency the negative c v is translated to hydrodynamic damping coefficient c f with eq 20 20 c f c v a d f d v t ρ f v 2 t d 4 π a f outside the experimental data range the empirical nonlinear damping model proposed by venugopal 1996 will be adopted where the empirical coefficients c hf c sw and c lf are recommended taking 0 18 0 25 and 0 2 the adopted viv model assembling with structural governing motion equation and numerical solution has been widely used to handle different load cases in yuan et al 2018a 2018b where more detailed descriptions could be found 3 model validation to the knowledge of the authors there seems still no comparable experimental investigation in consideration of scr s rsi and viv simultaneously the developed numerical model could only be validated for rsi and viv separately 3 1 validation for rsi wang et al 2014 conducted a large scale 3d soil structure test at zhejiang university the test apparatus configuration is shown in fig 5 a mainly consisting of two parts a long flume with soil and water inside a bidirectional loading actuation system located at flume end the actuator system can drive the riser s top end to follow specified movement paths in vertical and horizontal directions the main parameters of the test riser model are given in table 1 ten draw wire displacement sensors dw are mounted above the riser to monitor local displacements and quantify trench formation the measurement positions are shown in fig 5 b dw1 dw4 are 3m 4m 5m 6m horizontally from the riser s top end a vertically cyclic test case is selected for comparison and the harmonic amplitude and frequency are 48 mm and 0 2hz respectively fig 6 gives the riser penetration comparison at different axial locations left is test measurements middle is the predicted result from r q model and right is from linear model r q model could bring reasonable time histories of the riser s local penetration at dw1 dw4 which are close to test measurements both test and predicted results show that riser penetration increases with more cycles and the penetration variation trends to slow down after two hundred cycles the maximum and minimum penetration appears at dw2 and dw4 and the test and predicted values are quantitatively approximate however the predicted results with linear model are a little unsatisfactory the riser location penetration at dw1 dw4 keeps unchanged after about ten movement cycles both the variation trend and magnitude value deviate from test measurements the trench development comparison between test and predicted results is presented by fig 7 where symbols denote test measurements solid lines denote the predicted result from r q model and dotted lines denote that from line model for the predicted result with r q model the static initial trench shape shows a good agreement with test measurement although it is slightly far from test data when n 10 and 50 the trench development becomes gradually consistent with test data from n 100 to n 200 while with linear model the trench stops developing after n 10 corresponding to the variation trend in fig 6 the maximum trench depth at n 200 from linear model is 0 5d and the prediction error is 17 with test data equal to 0 6d while the corresponding error of r q model is only 3 in general r q model is able to reflect the trench development process and shows better performance for rsi simulation 3 2 validation for viv yuan et al 2017 2018a 2018b have well validated the adopted viv model against experimental measurements of top tensioned risers ttrs under steady flow cases unsteady flow cases and time varying tension cases here just gives an additional result comparison of an scr undergoing viv in flow to prove the availability of the numerical model for scrs the model test performed by 2h offshore engineering ltd in marintek which is described by moe et al 2004 is simulated in this study fig 8 presents the test apparatus configuration the model riser is mounted in the water below the carriage the lower end of the scr was supported by a vertical strut which is fixed to the carriage while the top end was supported by a swivel arm attached to the strut just below the carriage the main parameters of the test scr are listed in table 2 both the current velocity and the inclination angle between the current and the riser plane are systematically varied different from ttr the viv of scr under the currents with different directions may present different response characteristics in fact mainly the response in and out of riser plane is easy to be excited this section selects two cases with the current perpendicular and parallel to riser plane to compare the cross flow viv response and the current velocity is 0 26 m s fig 9 shows the maximum viv displacement envelop comparison along the scr between test and predicted results left and right denote the current perpendicular and parallel to riser plane respectively under the two simulated cases both the 5th modes dominate the viv response with current parallel to riser plane the viv displacement envelop a max 0 86d is relatively smaller than that with current perpendicular to riser plane a max 0 66d the predicted displacement distributions as well as magnitude values shows a good agreement with test result which means the adopted viv model is available for both ttr and scr although it seems still difficult to evaluate the performance of the developed numerical model for the rsi response prediction among tdz of scrs in consideration of viv its availability for rsi and viv is validated well against comparable experimental measurements respectively thus the adopted numerical model could be believed able to provide reasonable prediction results for subsequent investigations 4 dynamic response analysis based on section 3 1 r q model presents obvious advantages over linear model therefore only r q model is used for the following rsi investigation the main parameters of the simulated full scale riser and seabed soil in this section are listed by table 3 4 1 region classification of scr with scr and seabed interacting the tdp actually changes with time rather than a fixed location here firstly describes the region classification along the riser span using a representative top end heave case viv is not included with x s 1000m a heave 4m and t heave 30s where x s is the transverse span of scr s top end suspend point a heave and t heave are the amplitude and frequency of top end heave fig 10 shows the respective tdps at two different time points where red line denotes the trench shape when t 65s tdp is s 730m while it becomes s 764m when t 80s tdz is the region between the possible tdps nearest and farthest from anchor point i e type ii region in fig 10 the region from anchor point to tdz is flow line segment i e type i region and the region between tdz and suspend point is sag bend segment i e type iii region according to the riser region classification three axial locations i e s 720m 750m and 780m are selected as shown in fig 10 to compare the local response characteristics among different regions fig 11 presents the vertical displacement time histories left and p z curves right at s 720m 750m and 780m since s 780m among scr s sag bend will not contact with seabed no p z curve is given and the displacement time history follows standard sinusoidal shape s 720m among flow line always attaches to seabed and its movement is restricted so the vertical displacement develops slowly without obvious vibration the p z curve evolves among a narrow range and no soil suction force appears while for s 750m among tdz its movement is relatively free and affected by rsi significantly the displacement time history has a large amplitude modulation and its trough part is flat due to the action of soil resistance the maximum penetration enlarges evidently with cyclic top end heave excitation the corresponding p z curve presents complete loops containing the resistance and suction variations with riser initially penetrating uplifting and repenetrating since the riser s tdz presents the most complicated dynamic response and could reflect rsi process entirely the consequent investigation mainly focuses on the response characteristics among tdz of the scr 4 2 viv analysis to investigate the effect of viv on rsi it is necessary to firstly understand the viv response characteristics of scr in flow the riser configuration and encountered flow field are two main influence factors of viv response for a specific scr the transverse span of suspend point affects the riser configuration evidently fig 12 presents the scr s static configurations with near x s 1300m mean x s 1350m and far x s 1400m suspension under far suspension case the tdp of scr is closest to anchor point corresponding to s 325m while s tdp for mean and near cases are 420m and 495m respectively from sea surface to seabed the transverse span deviation at suspend point is magnified at tdp the rms displacement envelops along the scr with different suspend states under uniform flow with v 0 6 m s are given in fig 13 the viv response among scr s top part looks approximate under three suspension cases while the response among bottom part presents obvious differences although the dynamic response of scr is all dominated by mode 7 the local displacement amplitude near tdp is visibly larger under near suspension case than mean and far cases in fact near suspension case brings the steepest sag bend especially for the bottom part near tdz and the local encountered flow velocity is relatively large which is beneficial for viv to be excited the rsi of scr is mainly affected by the dynamic response near tdp so the near suspension case is selected for subsequent investigation due to its most significant viv response the flow velocity profile also affects scr s viv evidently uniform flow sheared flow and quadratic flow are three common flow velocity profiles to simply simulate the encountered flow field of scr in the existing researches this section includes these three flow forms as well and the adopted flow velocity distributions from seabed to sea surface of uniform flow sheared flow and quadratic flow are shown in fig 14 fig 15 gives the rms displacement envelops along the scr under different flow profiles where the near suspension with x s 1300m is simulated the viv response excited by uniform flow sheared flow and quadratic flow looks quite different mode 17 dominates the scr s dynamic response under uniform flow while the dominant modal order under sheared flow and quadratic flow is lower in general the viv response among scr s top part under quadratic flow is relatively large while among the focus area of rsi i e bottom part of sag bend the displacement amplitude is larger under uniform flow and sheared flow in fact sheared flow is more approximate to the actual flow field form than uniform flow based on the published field measurements of marine environment therefore the sheared flow in fig 14 is performed in the following numerical analysis 4 3 simulated cases of rsi with viv this paper aims to reveal the rsi response characteristics with the combined excitation of top end heave and viv according to section 4 2 the near suspension with x s 1300m and sheared flow with v top 1 m s are chosen to simulate the significant viv response where v top means the flow velocity at sea surface three different levels of top end heave excitations are considered in this paper small amplitude and long period bring slight heave excitation the slight heave case denotes a heave 1m and t heave 25s the moderate case denotes a heave 2m and t heave 20s and the violent case denotes a heave 3m and t heave 15s ten entire cycles are simulated to present the viv effect on rsi clearly each heave case is performed with and without viv respectively and both the trench development process and scr s dynamic response are compared as follows 4 4 trench development fig 16 shows the trench shape evolution with different top end heave excitations a b and c are slight moderate and violent cases respectively firstly focusing the result with rsi only top end cyclic heave excitation forms a spoon shape trench gradually and the trench length as well as depth trends to enlarge with more violent heave excitation i e large amplitude or short period the trench depth excited by slight heave after ten load cycles is 0 15m while the corresponding value with violent heave is 0 26m the heave level has little influence on the trench location and the trench maximum penetration all corresponds to s 485m after enough load cycles when viv is included the trench shape keeps unchanged but trench length and depth turn smaller with the same load cycles as far as the final trench depth is concerned the reduction proportion with and without viv is 10 20 based on the simulated three cases the time histories of trench maximum penetration and depth increment with different top end heave excitations are given by fig 17 different levels of heave excitations follow the same variation tendency the trench maximum penetration gradually increases with cyclic heave excitation from the trench depth increment variation the trench development velocity decreases significantly during the first several load cycles then trends to zero after enough load cycles and the slight heave excitation uses less load cycles to form a stable trench configuration viv makes the trench maximum penetration increase more smoothly the trench development velocity with viv is obviously smaller than that without viv and the trench configuration reaches a stable situation experiencing less heave excitations in essence with the same heave excitation level the trench depth is proportional to the local stiffness of scr s tdz scr s top end heave belongs to a kind of low frequency excitation difficult to trigger the riser s resonance under which the dynamic stiffness is approximate to the structural static stiffness while when viv occurs the riser is synchronized to its natural frequencies and the structural dynamic stiffness among tdz fades significantly much smaller than the static stiffness that s why viv results in a smooth trench formation process 4 5 scr s response characteristics the time histories left and amplitude spectra right of vertical displacement at s 485m with different top end heave excitations are presented in fig 18 during each heave period the riser s local segment among tdz moves up and down and the deepest vertical displacement gradually sinks after each load cycle especially for violent heave case the vertical displacement at s 485s follows an obvious modulation process containing a lifting segment and a stepped sinking segment accompanying with viv the vertical displacement also presents the similar variation tendency of gradual decrease and the deepest displacement is slightly larger than that without viv the viv effect is relatively significant under violent heave case where the modulation amplitude of vertical displacement changes a lot at different load cycles for example the amplitude at 6th cycle is obviously larger than that at the adjacent cycles this is a synergism of low frequency rsi and high frequency viv according to the amplitude spectra the dynamic response excited by slight and moderate heaves is dominated by low frequency components and the frequency spectra with and without viv look approximate while under violent heave case some high frequency response is excited moreover viv makes the concentrated energy at high frequencies strengthen furtherly in fact violent heave excitation results in deeper trench as well as steeper sag bend beneath mudline which is beneficial for viv to propagate along riser span to tdz therefore the viv effect turns visible with top end violent heave excitation fig 19 gives the p z curves at s 485m with different top end heave excitations a b and c denote slight moderate and violent cases respectively associated with the illustration of seven rsi modes in fig 2 a the p z curves with different heave excitations could be analyzed in detail with top end slightly heaving the seabed reaction force of scr is always positive and changes without obvious regularity the interaction between scr and seabed is not pronounced at the first phase and then quickly keeps narrow p z curves containing initial penetration uplift and further repenetration modes only under moderate heave case the nonlinear rsi is triggered significantly and finally presents some complete p z loops with uplift further uplift resisted by suction and further penetration modes transiting alternately the further penetration segment is very steep and the suction decays if uplift continues mode is still not evident enough when top end heave turns violent the regularity of seabed reaction force variation trends to be clear according to the p z curves at the rsi beginning the seabed suction acting on scr decays to zero and the riser repenetrates following lift off after the first several unstable load cycles the scr would experience periodical seabed reactions different from the other two cases the penetration deviation between the scr s uplift and further penetration is much larger so the suction decays if uplift continues mode is very visible compared the results with and without viv the p z curves generally follows the similar tendency but viv drives the rsi smoother which manifests as smaller penetration depth and clearer interaction mode transitions the maximum bending moment envelops along the scr s tdz with different top end heave excitations are shown in fig 20 more violent heave excitation results in larger bending moment and the axial location corresponding to maximum bending moment is closer to trench bottom i e s 485m in this study in essence the maximum bending moment always appears at the axial location where the curvature variation of riser is maximum since the trench shape is smooth at its rear part near anchor point the maximum riser s curvature variation should locates at the front of seabed trench near sag bend violent top end cyclic load drives the trench especially the front part to be deep and steep which means maximum curvature variation location moves close to trench bottom therefore the maximum bending moment under slight moderate and violent cases corresponds to s 495m 490m and 486m respectively moreover with heave excitation changing from slight to violent the maximum bending moment envelop trends to present two peaks viv enlarges the maximum bending moment visibly and makes the two peaks much clearer under violent case the coupling effect of viv and rsi worsens the scr s bending moment response which is detrimental to the structural safety thus it is necessary to take the aggravation effect between rsi and viv on the riser s dynamic response into consideration at the engineering design stage of full scale scrs fig 21 gives the rms displacement envelops along the scr with different top end heave excitations more violent top end heave leads to larger rms displacement response when only rsi is considered slight and moderate cases excite the 2nd mode of sag bend while violent case excites the higher order i e 3rd mode for the combined cases the 3rd and 4th modes are excited respectively with moderate and violent heave excitations which means viv makes the sag bend of scr dominated by higher order modes viv also enlarges the maximum rms displacement under violent heave case 5 conclusion based on a published viv model and the widely used randolph quiggin soil reaction force model the nonlinear riser seabed interaction response among tdz of a steel catenary riser is investigated numerically the adopted numerical analysis method is compared with experimental measurements for rsi and viv respectively at first rsi and viv are investigated separately then three combined cases with both top end platform heave motion and viv are simulated and the response characteristics of scr among tdz as well as seabed trench formation is analyzed some conclusions are drawn as follows 1 since there seems still no directly comparable experimental research the developed numerical model is respectively validated available for rsi and viv against the published test measurements which to some extent proves the numerical analysis method able to give reasonable prediction results for the combined cases with rsi and viv 2 as far as rsi is concerned top end cyclic heave excitation forms a spoon shape trench gradually and the scr s tdp changes with time according to the different response characteristics the riser could be classified as three segments along its whole span i e tdz flow line and sag bend tdz presents the most complicated dynamic response since it interacts with seabed directly and frequently 3 the scr s configuration and encountered flow field are two main influence factors of the viv response of sag bend under far suspension case the tdp of scr is closest to anchor point while near suspension case presents the largest viv displacement response near tdz under the actual marine environment the encountered flow is approximate to sheared or quadratic flow compared with quadratic flow sheared flow excites relatively large viv displacement among the focused bottom area of the riser s rsi 4 different levels of heave excitations follow the same trench variation tendency the trench maximum penetration gradually increases with cyclic load and the trench development velocity trends to decrease slight heave excitation uses less load cycles to form a stable trench configuration both the trench length and depth trend to enlarge with more violent heave excitation while the heave level has little influence on the trench location viv makes the trench depth increase more smoothly and the trench development velocity turns lower the trench configuration reaches stable situation experiencing less heave excitations and the trench length as well as depth becomes smaller 5 the viv effect on rsi is relatively significant with violent heave excitation under violent heave case some high frequency response among scr s tdz is excited and viv makes the concentrated energy at high frequencies strengthen furtherly with top end slightly heaving the seabed reaction force of scr is always positive and changes without obvious regularity when top end heave turns violent the scr would experience periodical seabed reaction and the suction decays if uplift continues mode is very visible viv drives the rsi smoother manifesting as smaller penetration depth and clearer interaction mode transitions 6 more violent heave excitation results in larger bending moment and the axial location corresponding to maximum bending moment is closer to trench bottom viv enlarges the maximum bending moment visibly and makes the two peaks much clearer under violent case violent heave case excites higher order mode of scr s sag bend and viv makes the sag bend of scr dominated by higher order modes furtherly viv also enlarges the maximum rms displacement under violent heave case it is necessary to take the coupling effect between rsi and viv on the riser s dynamic response into account at the engineering design stage of full scale scrs the present numerical model has not included the stiffness degradation of seabed induced by long term cyclic load or fluid flushing besides the lateral rsi is another interesting research issue worthy of attention and would couple with vertical rsi while this paper mainly focuses on vertical rsi only at the current stage the relevant experimental investigations could be carried out in the future to understand the essential mechanism of seabed stiffness degradation and coupling rsi between lateral and vertical directions credit authorship contribution statement yuchao yuan conceptualization methodology writing original draft mengtian zheng validation

can serve as a reference for the design of flexible bags and das for acvs 2 governing equations 2 1 cv method the inflation model developed by wang and nefske was adopted herein wang and nefske 1988 the inflation process of the flexible bag can be simulated as an expanding closed volume cv the pressure in the cv changes with the mass of the air inside it the air in the cv is assumed to be an ideal gas with a constant specific heat the inflation process of the cv is adiabatic and the pressure and temperature inside the cv are uniform therefore the air in the cv follows eq 1 1 p v m r t where p represents the cv pressure v represents the volume m represents the mass r represents the gas constant and t represents the temperature 2 2 ale method the conservation equations for the ale formulation are as follows benson 1989 souli et al 2000 the mass conservation equation is 2 ρ t ρ v i x i w i ρ x i the momentum conservation equation is 3 ρ v i t σ i j j ρ b i ρ w i v i x j the energy conservation equation is 4 ρ e t σ i j v i j ρ b i v i ρ w j e x j where ρ represents the density v represents the velocity of the material w represents the relative velocity between the velocity of the material and the velocity of the mesh b represents the body acceleration and e represents the energy σ i j is the stress tensor 5 σ i j p δ i j μ v i j v j i where p represents the

the unit normal vector towards the outside of the boundary the initial velocity in the entire fluid domain was assumed to be zero a multi material eulerian formulation was adopted to analyse the fluids the young method was adopted to track the interface between the fluids in the elements where the material layout is characterised by the volume fraction of the fluids aquelet et al 2006 the

bulk modulus of the fluid element a represents the average area of the structural elements related to the structure node v represents the volume of the fluid element enclosing the master fluid node and d represents the penetration between the node of the structure and the fluid element 3 numerical modelling the numerical procedure to analyse a two dimensional flexible bag of an acv subjected to slamming loads was executed using the ls dyna software 3 1 flexible bag configuration a flexible bag mounted on the hull in common use as shown in fig 2 is used to research section geometries under slamming loads the flexible bag considered herein consists of two segments with different curvatures the segment with the larger curvature is mounted to the deck at point a and the segment with the smaller curvature is mounted to the deck at point c the two segments are linked to each other at point b the thickness of the deck and the hull are 6 mm each and the thickness of the flexible bag equals to 7 mm a cartesian coordinate system x z was introduced to describe the section geometry of the flexible bag under slamming loads with the origin located at point a as the section geometry is not monotonic in the defined cartesian coordinate system a polar coordinate system λ θ was adopted to avoid defects and is used to describe the section geometry using an empirical equation the polar coordinate system shares the same origin as the cartesian coordinate system and the origin moves with point a during the water entry process the coordinates in the cartesian and polar coordinate systems can be transformed from one system to the other using eq 8 8 λ x 2 z 2 tan θ z x x λ cos θ z λ sin θ 3 2 finite element modelling the fluids containing water and air were modelled using solid elements and solved using the eulerian formulation the structures including the flexible bag deck and hull were modelled using shell elements and solved using the lagrangian formulation stretchy permeable shells were modelled to form a cv with the flexible bag and the deck thereby allowing the cv method to be used in the numerical simulation the stretchy permeable shells which were formed by linking the lateral nodes of the flexible bag and deck were also modelled using shell elements no nodes were created in the interior of the stretchy permeable shells to prevent unexpected computation errors li et al 2015 russell and tibert 2008 as all the structures utilise the same type of shell element they can be connected directly and extra constraints are not required the length and depth of the water and the height of the air were 16 m 9 m and 6 5 m respectively to perform a two dimensional analysis as the flexible bag enters the water the model was provided with a width of 0 6 m the mesh size of the fluids in the slamming domain was approximately 100 mm and this value gradually increased toward the boundaries as shown in fig 3 a the meshes of the individual structures are shown in fig 3 b the meshes of the flexible bag hull and deck were of the same size of approximately 100 mm the coordinates used to describe the section geometries of the flexible bag under slamming loads were fixed at the mid points of the width of the model to alleviate the effect of the boundaries 3 3 material properties the flexible bag and the deck were modelled using a linear elastic material different young s moduli were used for the flexible bag to study their effect on the section geometries and the results were used as a guide to select a suitable material for the flexible bag the flexible bag primarily experiences a large deformation rather than a large strain when subjected to slamming loads and consequently it can be appropriately modelled using a linear elastic material the parameters of the material model are listed in table 1 the hull was modelled as a rigid structure with its displacement constrained in the z direction the combined weight of the hull and the mass points was used to simulate the ballast weight ballast weights bw of 1 t 2 t and 3 t were used to determine the effect of the ballast weight on the section geometries of the flexible bag under slamming loads a null material was used to model the stretchy permeable shell the thickness and material density of the stretchy permeable shells are assumed to be infinitesimal and therefore their constraints on the flexible bag and deck can be neglected li et al 2015 the inflation of the flexible bag was modelled using the cv method the ambient pressure was 1 013 105 pa the specific heat at a constant volume was 717 j kgk the specific heat at a constant pressure was 1004 j kgk and the temperature of the input air was 298 k li et al 2015 compressibility pressure cut off and viscosity were considered in the simulation of the air and water outside the cv the equations of states eoss were used to describe the external air and water the air was modelled using the linear polynomial eos shown in eq 9 and the water was modelled using the gruneisen eos shown in eq 10 9 p c 0 c 1 u c 2 u 2 c 3 u 3 c 4 c 5 u c 6 u 2 e 10 p ρ c 2 μ 1 1 γ 0 2 μ a 2 μ 2 1 s 1 1 μ s 2 μ 2 μ 1 s 3 μ 3 μ 1 2 2 γ 0 a μ e where p is the pressure e is the internal energy per initial volume c 0 c 1 c 2 c 3 c 4 c 5 c 6 s 1 s 2 s 3 γ 0 and a are coefficients related to the fluid and c is the speed of sound 11 u 1 v 1 where v is the relative volume the nonzero coefficients of the eoss are listed in table 2 shi et al 2019a 2019b 3 4 boundary conditions the flexible bag was initially in a stress free state in a static geometry in this state p b is the same as the ambient pressure before entering the water the flexible bag was inflated by inserting a certain mass of air into the flexible bag and p c was applied to the outside of the segment bc to model the cushion pressure where p c is a constant pressure of 4 kpa relative to the ambient pressure mass weighted damping was adopted to eliminate the effect of the unnecessary kinetic energy induced by the inflation of the bag the unnecessary kinetic energy was dissipated before the flexible bag entered the water after which the mass weighted damping was withdrawn as the inflation process of the flexible bag is highly nonlinear numerous trials were performed to ensure that the pressure acting on the flexible bag was equal to the desired value of p b p c values of 1 4 1 8 and 2 2 were adopted herein to investigate the effect of p b p c on the section geometries of the flexible bag under slamming loads after inflation initial velocities v of 6 m s 8 m s and 10 m s were imposed on the structural segment to investigate the influence of the initial velocity on the section geometries of the flexible bag under slamming loads the nodes of the flexible bag and the deck at y 0 and y 0 6 were fixed in the y direction to simulate a two dimensional condition the fluid boundaries that were modelled using solid elements were constrained in the normal direction the hull was fully fixed during the inflation process and could move in the z direction during water entry the acceleration due to gravity was set to 9 8 m s2 3 5 convergence tests the convergence of the section geometries was investigated considering the size of the fluid domains length width depth and mesh sizes fig 4 a shows the section geometries of the flexible bag at the time t max x which is the time at which the x coordinate reaches the maximum value in the figure legend mesh 100 mm indicates that the mesh size near the water entry domain was 100 mm and water 16 m 0 6 m 9 m indicates that the length of the water domain was 16 m the width was 0 6 m and the depth was 9 m the other figure legends can also be interpreted similarly fig 4 b shows the section geometries of the flexible bag at the time t max z which is the time at which the z coordinate reaches the maximum value the static geometry is also plotted in fig 4 as a reference the results indicate that the numerical simulation has good convergence 3 6 verification of numerical model owing to the significant challenges associated with the research of flexible bags entering water to the best of our knowledge no related research has been published consequently two benchmark tests jarasjarungkiat et al 2008 zhang et al 2019 were used to validate the cv and ale methods adopted herein the section geometries predicted by the numerical model developed herein were qualitatively compared with the test results of the flexible bag equipped on craft 711 ⅱ and craft 722 yun and bliault 2000 numerical simulations on the inflation of airbags presented by jarasjarungkiat et al 2008 and zhang et al 2019 were used to verify the cv method a sketch of the airbag is shown in fig 5 a the length of the diagonal line l ac was 1 2 m the thickness of the membrane was 6 10 4 m and e and ν were 588 mpa and 0 4 respectively a mesh size of approximately 9 5 mm was used in the numerical simulation the four sides of the airbag were fixed in the out of plane direction while the horizontal and vertical middle lines were fixed in the y and x directions respectively the internal pressure was 5 kpa relative to the ambient pressure the deformation of the airbag is shown in fig 5 b the results at representative points are compared with the previous studies in table 3 the results obtained herein including those of the displacement at point m in the out of plane direction w m the displacement at point a in the diagonal direction r a the displacement at point b in the y direction v b and the maximum principal stress at point m σ m show good agreement with the previous studies a drop test with a steel plate faltinsen 1997 faltinsen et al 1997 was used to verify the ale method fig 6 shows the numerical model of the steel plate entering water the main parameters of the plate are listed in table 4 elastic plates were used to model the boundary springs whereas the rigid plate and mass points represent the ballast yu et al 2019b the structures and fluids near the slamming domain were discretised using a mesh with a length of 10 mm whereas the length of the meshes in the other domains of the fluids gradually expanded towards the boundaries the steel plate impacted on the water at a velocity of 3 03 m s the boundaries of the fluids were constrained in the normal direction and the gravitational effect was considered as well the results of the numerical simulation were compared with the results of the drop test as shown in fig 7 the small difference between the two is due to three dimensional flow faltinsen 1997 the typical deformation process of the flexible bag during water entry as predicted by the numerical model developed herein is shown in fig 8 the flexible bag begins to contact the water at t 0 the test results of the deformation of the flexible bag equipped on crafts 711 ⅱ and 722 subjected to the action of water are shown in fig 9 yun and bliault 2000 the numerical and test results exhibit similar tendencies wherein the flexible bag bounces up unlike the steel structures increasing the depth of the water entry with time the effects of the shape of the water surface will be investigated in future studies the numerical results obtained herein are in reasonable agreement with experimental and numerical observations therefore the proposed numerical model can be used to predict the section geometries of flexible bags under slamming loads 4 results and discussion 4 1 effect of initial velocity fig 10 shows the section geometries at t max x and t max z as the flexible bag enters the water at various velocities the initial unstrained static geometry is also shown for reference the section geometry can be divided into horizontal segments with small curvatures and vertical segments with large curvatures using intersection points the differences in curvature occur because the slamming pressure acting on the flexible bag is much larger than the resistance of air the difference between the maximum x coordinate of the deformed geometry and the static geometry denoted by l e is used to describe the deformation caused by the extension in the x direction the difference between the minimum z coordinate of the deformed geometry and the static geometry denoted by h e is used to describe the deformation caused by the elevation in the z direction the x coordinates of the intersection points at t max x and t max z are around 1 2 m and 1 1 m respectively the values of l e and h e in fig 10 are listed in table 5 as shown they increased with the increase in velocity the difference between the values of h e at t max x and t max z does not appear to be evidently affected by the velocity the difference between the values of l e at t max x and t max z increases slightly with the increase in velocity 4 2 effect of young s modulus fig 11 presents the section geometries of the flexible bags made with materials with different young s moduli at t max x and t max z young s modulus has a negligible effect on the horizontal segment and has a significant effect on the vertical segment the deformation decreases with the increase in young s modulus the x coordinates of the intersection points at t max x and t max z are around 0 6 m and 0 2 m respectively the values of l e and h e in fig 11 are listed in table 6 l e decreases with the increase in young s modulus the difference between the values of h e at t max x and t max z is negligibly affected by young s modulus the difference between the values of l e at t max x and t max z at young s moduli of 100 mpa and 200 mpa are similar and increases as the young s modulus increases to 300 mpa 4 3 effect of ballast weight fig 12 shows the effect of the ballast weight on the section geometries of the flexible bag at t max x and t max z the section geometry was sensitive to the variation in ballast weight the deformation increased with the increase in ballast weight the increase in deformation was more evident as the ballast weight increased from 1 t to 2 t than when it increased from 2 t to 3 t the x coordinates of the intersection points at t max x and t max z are around 1 2 m and 1 1 m respectively the values of l e and h e in fig 12 are listed in table 7 the difference between the values of h e at t max x and t max z increases slightly with the increase in ballast weight the difference between the values of l e at t max x and t max z at ballast weights of 2 t and 3 t are similar and are lesser than that at a ballast weight of 1 t 4 4 effect of pb pc as p b p c is a fundamental parameter in the design of flexible bags its effect was also analysed herein fig 13 shows the section geometries of the flexible bag at different values of p b p c as shown the effect of p b p c on the section geometry is limited this is because before the flexible bag enters the water p b and p c are mainly used to maintain the geometry of the flexible bag which is much smaller than the increase in p b induced by the slamming loads 5 derivation of empirical equation as the section geometry at t max x is the primary design consideration and the difference between the section geometries at t max x and t max z is considerably smaller than the difference between the deformed geometry and the static geometry an empirical equation is fitted to describe the section geometry at t max x this equation can be used for stability assessment and the development of a das as p b p c has a negligible effect it is not considered in this equation the initial velocity young s modulus of the flexible bag and ballast weight are normalised and used in the empirical equation the young s modulus of the flexible bag was normalised to 100 mpa and is denoted by e r the ballast weight was normalised by the width of the numerical simulation bw 0 6 and is denoted by bw r the initial velocity was normalised by its unit and is denoted by v r the coordinates at points a and c which are the joints between the flexible bag and the deck were determined separately to guarantee consistency the polar coordinates at points a and c are 0 0 and 6 77 2 75 respectively an empirical equation was fitted to the coordinates of the interiors of the section geometries of the flexible bag the fitting process was split into two steps first the section geometry of the flexible bag was described by the sum of the polynomial and trigonometric functions with different coefficients and second the coefficients were related to the normalised initial velocity young s modulus of the flexible bag and ballast weight the coefficients of a situation were much larger than others and were ignored the section geometry of the flexible bag predicted by the empirical equation showed good agreement with the results the numerical simulation in all situations the empirical equation to predict the section geometries of the flexible bag is given by eq 12 the mean and standard deviation of the coefficient of determination r 2 of the first step were 0 9881 and 0 0053 respectively the coefficients of determination of the second step are listed below the equation an example of the section geometry calculated from the numerical simulation and the empirical equation is shown in fig 14 as shown the fitting results are acceptable 12 λ a b θ 2 c cos θ d cos 2 θ e sin 4 θ a 0 723 0 8685 v r

bag of an acv subjected to slamming loads the numerical model was verified using benchmark tests the effects of the initial velocity young s modulus of the flexible bag ballast weight in addition to p b p c on the section geometry of the flexible bag were systematically investigated the results provide a foundation for the stability assessment and development of a das for an acv subjected to slamming loads the main conclusions of the study are as follows 1 the section geometry exhibits similar trends at t max x and t max z 2 the deformation of the section geometry in the horizontal segment increases with the increase in the initial velocity and ballast weight but has little relation with the young s modulus of the flexible bag the deformation of the section geometry in the vertical segment increases with the increase in the initial velocity and ballast weight and decreases with the increase in the young s modulus of the flexible bag 3 the deformation of the section geometry has little relation with p b p c 4 the proposed empirical equation can be used to describe the section geometry under slamming loads credit authorship contribution statement yongyi jiang

where p represents the cv pressure v represents the volume m represents the mass r represents the gas constant and t represents the temperature 2 2 ale method the conservation equations for the ale

the unit normal vector towards the outside of the boundary the initial velocity in the entire fluid domain was assumed to be zero a multi material eulerian formulation was adopted to analyse the fluids the young method was adopted to track the interface between the fluids in the elements where the material layout is characterised by the volume fraction of the fluids aquelet et al 2006 the coupling force between the fluid and the structure was calculated using the penalty method described by eq 7 aquelet et al 2006 7 f p f k a 2 v d where p f represents the scale factor k represents the bulk modulus of the fluid element a represents the average area of the structural elements related to the structure node v represents the volume of the fluid element enclosing the master fluid node and d represents the penetration between the node of the structure and the fluid element 3 numerical modelling the numerical procedure to analyse a two dimensional flexible bag of an acv subjected to slamming loads was executed using the ls dyna software 3 1 flexible bag configuration a flexible bag mounted on the hull in common use as shown in fig 2 is used to research section geometries under slamming loads the flexible bag considered herein consists of two segments with different curvatures the segment with the larger curvature is mounted to the deck at point a and the segment with the smaller curvature is mounted to the deck at point c the two segments are linked to each other at point b the thickness of the deck and the hull are 6 mm each and the thickness of the flexible bag equals to 7 mm a cartesian coordinate system x z was introduced to describe the section geometry of the flexible bag under slamming loads with the origin located at point a as the section geometry is not monotonic in the defined cartesian coordinate system a polar coordinate system λ θ was adopted to avoid defects and is used to describe the section geometry using an empirical equation the polar coordinate system shares the same origin as the cartesian coordinate system and the origin moves with point a during the water entry process the coordinates in the cartesian and polar coordinate systems can be transformed from one system to the other using eq 8 8 λ x 2 z 2 tan θ z x x λ cos θ z λ sin θ 3 2 finite element modelling the fluids containing water and air were modelled using solid elements and solved using the eulerian formulation the structures including the flexible bag deck and hull were modelled using shell elements and solved using the lagrangian formulation stretchy permeable shells were modelled to form a cv with the flexible bag and the deck thereby allowing the cv method to be used in the numerical simulation the stretchy permeable shells which were formed by linking the lateral nodes of the flexible bag and deck were also modelled using shell elements no nodes were created in the interior of the stretchy permeable shells to prevent unexpected computation errors li et al 2015 russell and tibert 2008 as all the structures utilise the same type of shell element they can be connected directly and extra constraints are not required the length and depth of the water and the height of the air were 16 m 9 m and 6 5 m respectively to perform a two dimensional analysis as the flexible bag enters the water the model was provided with a width of 0 6 m the mesh size of the fluids in the slamming domain was approximately 100 mm and this value gradually increased toward the boundaries as shown in fig 3 a the meshes of the individual structures are shown in fig 3 b the meshes of the flexible bag hull and deck were of the same size of approximately 100 mm the coordinates used to describe the section geometries of the flexible bag under slamming loads were fixed at the mid points of the width of the model to alleviate the effect of the boundaries 3 3 material properties the flexible bag and the deck were modelled using a linear elastic material different young s moduli were used for the flexible bag to study their effect on the section geometries and the results were used as a guide to select a suitable material for the flexible bag the flexible bag primarily experiences a large deformation rather than a large strain when subjected to slamming loads and consequently it can be appropriately modelled using a linear elastic material the parameters of the material model are listed in table 1 the hull was modelled as a rigid structure with its displacement constrained in the z direction the combined weight of the hull and the mass points was used to simulate the ballast weight ballast weights bw of 1 t 2 t and 3 t were used to determine the effect of the ballast weight on the section geometries of the flexible bag under slamming loads a null material was used to model the stretchy permeable shell the thickness and material density of the stretchy permeable shells are assumed to be infinitesimal and therefore their constraints on the flexible bag and deck can be neglected li et al 2015 the inflation of the flexible bag was modelled using the cv method the ambient pressure was 1 013 105 pa the specific heat at a constant volume was 717 j kgk the specific heat at a constant pressure was 1004 j kgk and the temperature of the input air was 298 k li et al 2015 compressibility pressure cut off and viscosity were considered in the simulation of the air and water outside the cv the equations of states eoss were used to describe the external air and water the air was modelled using the linear polynomial eos shown in eq 9 and the water was modelled using the gruneisen eos shown in eq 10 9 p c 0 c 1 u c 2 u 2 c 3 u 3 c 4 c 5 u c 6 u 2 e 10 p ρ c 2 μ 1 1 γ 0 2 μ a 2 μ 2 1 s 1 1 μ s 2 μ 2 μ 1 s 3 μ 3 μ 1 2 2

v 1 where v is the relative volume the nonzero coefficients of the eoss are listed in table 2 shi et al 2019a 2019b 3 4 boundary conditions the flexible bag was initially in a stress free state in a static geometry in this state p b is the same as the ambient pressure before entering the water the flexible bag was inflated by inserting a certain mass of air into the flexible bag and p c was applied to the outside of the segment bc to model the cushion pressure where p c is a constant pressure of 4 kpa relative to the ambient pressure mass weighted damping was adopted to eliminate the effect of the unnecessary kinetic energy induced by the inflation of the bag the unnecessary kinetic energy was dissipated before the flexible bag entered the water after which the mass weighted damping was withdrawn as the inflation process of the flexible bag is highly nonlinear numerous trials were performed to ensure that the pressure acting on the flexible bag was equal to the desired value of p b p c values of 1 4 1 8 and 2 2 were adopted herein to investigate the effect of p b p c on the section geometries of the flexible bag under slamming loads after inflation initial velocities v of 6 m s 8 m s and 10 m s were imposed on the structural segment to investigate the influence of the initial velocity on the section geometries of the flexible bag under slamming loads the nodes of the flexible bag and the deck at y 0 and y 0 6 were fixed in the y direction to simulate a two dimensional condition the fluid boundaries that were modelled using solid elements were constrained in the normal direction the hull was fully fixed during the inflation process and could move in the z direction during water entry the acceleration due to gravity was set to 9 8 m s2 3 5 convergence tests the convergence of the section geometries was investigated considering the size of the fluid domains length width depth and mesh sizes fig 4 a shows the section geometries of the flexible bag at the time t max x which is the time at which the x coordinate reaches the maximum value in the figure legend mesh 100 mm indicates that the mesh size near the water entry domain was 100 mm and water 16 m 0 6 m 9 m indicates that the length of the water domain was 16 m the width was 0 6 m and the depth was 9 m the other figure legends can also be interpreted similarly fig 4 b shows the section geometries of the flexible bag at the time t max z which is the time at which the z coordinate reaches the maximum value the static geometry is also plotted in fig 4 as a reference the results indicate that the numerical simulation has good convergence 3 6 verification of numerical model owing to the significant challenges associated with the research of flexible bags entering water to the best of our knowledge no related research has been published consequently two benchmark tests jarasjarungkiat et al 2008 zhang et al 2019 were used to validate the cv and ale methods adopted herein the section geometries predicted by the numerical model developed herein were qualitatively compared with the test results of the flexible bag equipped on craft 711 ⅱ and craft 722 yun and bliault 2000 numerical simulations on the inflation of airbags presented by jarasjarungkiat et al 2008 and zhang et al 2019 were used to verify the cv method a sketch of the airbag is shown in fig 5 a the length of the diagonal line l ac was 1 2 m the thickness of the membrane was 6 10 4 m and e and ν were 588 mpa and 0 4 respectively a mesh size of approximately 9 5 mm was used in the numerical simulation the four sides of the airbag were fixed in the out of plane direction while the horizontal and vertical middle lines were fixed in the y and x directions respectively the internal pressure was 5 kpa relative to the ambient pressure the deformation of the airbag is shown in fig 5 b the results at representative points are compared with the previous studies in table 3 the results obtained herein including those of the displacement at point m in the out of plane direction w m the displacement at point a in the diagonal direction r a the displacement at point b in the y direction v b and the maximum principal stress at point m σ m show good agreement with the previous studies a drop test with a steel plate faltinsen 1997 faltinsen et al 1997 was used to verify the ale method fig 6 shows the numerical model of the steel plate entering water the main parameters of the plate are listed in table 4 elastic plates were used to model the boundary springs whereas the rigid plate and mass points represent the ballast yu et al 2019b the structures and fluids near the slamming domain were discretised using a mesh with a length of 10 mm whereas the length of the meshes in the other domains of the fluids gradually expanded towards the boundaries the steel plate impacted on the water at a velocity of 3 03 m s the boundaries of the fluids were constrained in the normal direction and the gravitational effect was considered as well the results of the numerical simulation were compared with the results of the drop test as shown in fig 7 the small difference between the two is due to three dimensional flow faltinsen 1997 the typical deformation process of the flexible bag during water entry as predicted by the numerical model developed herein is shown in fig 8 the flexible bag begins to contact the water at t 0 the test results of the deformation of the flexible bag equipped on crafts 711 ⅱ and 722 subjected to the action of water are shown in fig 9 yun and bliault 2000 the numerical and test results exhibit similar tendencies wherein the flexible bag bounces up unlike the steel structures increasing the depth of the water entry with time the effects of the shape of the water surface will be investigated in future studies the numerical results obtained herein are in reasonable agreement with experimental and numerical observations therefore the proposed numerical model can be used to predict the section geometries of flexible bags under slamming loads 4 results and discussion 4 1 effect of initial velocity fig 10 shows the section geometries at t max x and t max z as the flexible bag enters the water at various velocities the initial unstrained static geometry is also shown for reference the section geometry can be divided into horizontal segments with small curvatures and vertical segments with large curvatures using intersection points the differences in curvature occur because the slamming pressure acting on the flexible bag is much larger than the resistance of air the difference between the maximum x coordinate of the deformed geometry and the static geometry denoted by l e is used to describe the deformation caused by the extension in the x direction the difference between the minimum z coordinate of the deformed geometry and the static geometry denoted by h e is used to describe the deformation caused by the elevation in the z direction the x coordinates of the intersection points at t max x and t max z are around 1 2 m and 1 1 m respectively the values of l e and h e in fig 10 are listed in table 5 as shown they increased with the increase in velocity the difference between the values of h e at t max x and t max z does not appear to be evidently affected by the velocity the difference between the values of l e at t max x and t max z increases slightly with the increase in velocity 4 2 effect of young s modulus fig 11 presents the section geometries of the flexible bags made with materials with different young s moduli at t max x and t max z young s modulus has a negligible effect on the horizontal segment and has a significant effect on the vertical segment the deformation decreases with the increase in young s modulus the x coordinates of the intersection points at t max x and t max z are around 0 6 m and 0 2 m respectively the values of l e and h e in fig 11 are listed in table 6 l e decreases with the increase in young s modulus the difference between the values of h e at t max x and t max z is negligibly affected by young s modulus the difference between the values of l e at t max x and t max z at young s moduli of 100 mpa and 200 mpa are similar and increases as the young s modulus increases to 300 mpa 4 3 effect of ballast weight fig 12 shows the effect of the ballast weight on the section geometries of the flexible bag at t max x and t max z the section geometry was sensitive to the variation in ballast weight the deformation increased with the increase in ballast weight the increase in deformation was more evident as the ballast weight increased from 1 t to 2 t than when it increased from 2 t to 3 t the x coordinates of the intersection points at t max x and t max z are around 1 2 m and 1 1 m respectively the values of l e and h e in fig 12 are listed in table 7 the difference between the values of h e at t max x and t max z increases slightly with the increase in ballast weight the difference between the values of l e at t max x and t max z at ballast weights of 2 t and 3 t are similar and are lesser than that at a ballast weight of 1 t 4 4 effect of pb pc as p b p c is a fundamental parameter in the design of flexible bags its effect was also analysed herein fig 13 shows the section geometries of the flexible bag at different values of p b p c as shown the effect of p b p c on the section geometry is limited this is because before the flexible bag enters the water p b and p c are mainly used to maintain the geometry of the flexible bag which is much smaller than the increase in p b induced by the slamming loads 5 derivation of empirical equation as the section geometry at t max x is the primary design consideration and the difference between the section geometries at t max x and t max z is considerably smaller than the difference between the deformed geometry and the static geometry an empirical equation is fitted to describe the section geometry at t max x this equation can be used for stability assessment and the development of a das as p b p c has a negligible effect it is not considered in this equation the initial velocity young s modulus of the flexible bag and ballast weight are normalised and used in the empirical equation the young s modulus of the flexible bag was normalised to 100 mpa and is denoted by e r the ballast weight was normalised by the width of the numerical simulation bw 0 6 and is denoted by bw r the initial velocity was normalised by its unit and is denoted by v r the coordinates at points a and c which are the joints between the flexible bag and the deck were determined separately to guarantee consistency the polar coordinates at points a and c are 0 0 and 6 77 2 75 respectively an empirical equation was fitted to the coordinates of the interiors of the section geometries of the flexible bag the fitting process was split into two steps first the section geometry of the flexible bag was described by the sum of the polynomial and trigonometric functions with different coefficients and second the coefficients were related to the normalised initial velocity young s modulus of the flexible bag and ballast weight the coefficients of a situation were much larger than others and were ignored the section geometry of the flexible bag predicted by the empirical equation showed good agreement with the results the numerical simulation in all situations the empirical equation to predict the section geometries of the flexible bag is given by eq 12 the mean and standard deviation of the coefficient of determination r 2 of the first step were 0 9881 and 0 0053 respectively the coefficients of determination of the second step are listed below the equation an example of the section geometry calculated from the numerical simulation and the empirical equation is shown in fig 14 as shown the fitting results are acceptable 12 λ a b θ 2 c cos θ d cos 2 θ e sin 4 θ a 0 723 0 8685 v r

bag of an acv subjected to slamming loads the numerical model was verified using benchmark tests the effects of the initial velocity young s modulus of the flexible bag ballast weight in addition to p b p c on the section geometry of the flexible bag were systematically investigated the results provide a foundation for the stability assessment and development of a das for an acv subjected to slamming loads the main conclusions of the study are as follows 1 the section geometry exhibits similar trends at t max x and t max z 2 the deformation of the section geometry in the horizontal segment increases with the increase in the initial velocity and ballast weight but has little relation with the young s modulus of the flexible bag the deformation of the section geometry in the vertical segment increases with the increase in the initial velocity and ballast weight and decreases with the increase in the young s modulus of the flexible bag 3 the deformation of the section geometry has little relation with p b p c 4 the proposed empirical equation can be used to describe the section geometry under slamming loads credit authorship contribution statement yongyi jiang

20882,the classical problem of time harmonic diffraction and radiation of free surface flows due to wave body interaction is revisited based on the fourier kochin theory for zero forward speed the key idea of the fourier kochin theory is reversing the order of the two fundamental tasks of the green function based direct solutions of free surface flows i e evaluation of the green function and its gradient and their subsequent integration over the boundary surface by implementing a higher order numerical approximation along with the use of extended boundary integral equation method to suppress the irregular frequencies three different bodies a hemisphere a vertical cylinder and a frigate model are studied the fourier kochin framework accurately captures the radiated and diffracted flow about oscillating bodies in general but slight irregularities are also observed at high frequencies for complicated body forms since the floating body is stationary here the problem has a standard unambiguous solution and the indirect approach introduced by the fourier kochin theory may not seem worthwhile to adopt however its perspective becomes rewarding when the forward speed effects are considered as a premise of this idea the main goals here are to assess the practical application of the theory to identify the challenges and to investigate how to surmount them keywords fourier kochin theory free surface green function free surface hydrodynamics wave body interaction 1 introduction the diffraction and radiation of free surface waves due to stationary floating bodies are studied by using the indirect perspective favored by the fourier kochin theory the solution approach provided is related with the frequency domain boundary integral representations that rely on free surface green functions and is in fact most rewarding when the forward speed effects are considered where limited methods of practical importance are present despite the increasing use of computational fluid dynamics for marine applications el moctar et al 2017 takami and iijima 2019 where true estimation of the motion and response is pursued the potential flow theory still dominates the field with its capability to capture the main aspects of wave body interaction and to predict the associated elements of fundamental importance i e pressure distributions and wave loads with sufficient accuracy potential theory based approximations to free surface flow problems are usually expressed as conventional boundary integral formulations and their numerical solutions come in two flavors they either adopt a free surface or wave green function as the fundamental solution which implicitly satisfies the appropriate linearized free surface boundary condition and radiation condition or distribute simple sources over the wetted body surface and also free surface where the free surface boundary condition and far field radiation condition are exclusively considered when the nonlinear effects mainly resulting from the large amplitude oscillations of the free surface or geometric factors such as large bow flare need to be acknowledged the latter approach referred to as the rankine panel method steps forth see kim et al 1997 for the fundamentals of the method for linear and high frequency second order problems around offshore structures and kim et al 2015 as a hydroelastic application for the whipping response analysis of a containership that employed the finite element method for the structural analysis and generalized wagner model for slamming load assessment the main advantages of the rankine panel methods are that the simple form of the source term significantly accelerates the analysis and complicated base flows e g steady ship flow and double body flow can be used for approximating the free surface boundary condition the green function based approach usually identified as the free surface green function method lack these features but enjoy their own owing to the inherent properties of the green function imposing artificial damping zones to substitute the radiation condition and including the free surface plane into the computational domain which should be wide enough to permit wave propagation and its discretization should be properly set up to capture the high frequency wave components and complex wave patterns as enforced by rankine panel methods can be avoided by adopting the transient free surface green function weak nonlinearities of froude krylov type can also be addressed sengupta et al 2016 one additional group of methods that uses a hybrid approach can be mentioned yang et al 2019 shan et al 2020 they combine the strengths of two principle methods by subdividing the fluid volume into an inner domain which includes the floating body and a bounded part of the free surface plane that are enclosed by a control surface and the remaining outer domain the simple sources are distributed within the inner domain for employing more realistic conditions about the body and the free surface green function with its advantages is applied just over the control surface free surface green function methods are particularly used for regular seakeeping and hydroelastic analyses they provide the spectral data for response prediction in random waves since the pulsating free surface green function can be computed efficiently frequency domain solutions are generally preferred for zero forward speed applications e g offshore platforms and marine energy converters for ships however complicated form of the translating pulsating free surface green function along with the involved computational difficulties resulting from its singular and highly oscillatory behavior about the free surface limit the frequency domain studies and the time domain approach is frequently promoted kara 2015 if one prefer the frequency dependent hydrodynamic coefficients can be obtained from the time dependent impulse response functions ma et al 2016 nevertheless the original double fourier integral form of the translating pulsating free surface green function is given by alternative expressions to acquire better numerical behavior where more efficient computation techniques are also presented inglis and price 1981 wu and eatock taylor 1987 iwashita and ohkusu 1992 ba and guilbaud 1995 noblesse et al 2004 yao and dong 2014 based on these attempts a number of methods of practical application are developed du et al 2000 adopted bessho s formulation bessho 1977 which contains elementary functions but is also mathematically more involved they applied the steepest descent method for the complex oscillating integrand to find a path on which the integrand does not oscillate maury et al 2003 proposed two different solutions for considering the forward speed effects in frequency domain the first one is similarly based on the application of the steepest descent method on bessho form the second one uses the formulation by guevel and bougis 1982 where the complex exponential integral function is calculated by the simpson adaptive method due to the insufficiency of numerical quadrature especially about the free surface space integration is performed analytically liang et al 2016 working on the form by wu and eatock taylor 1987 offered a new discretization scheme to avoid the influence of high oscillations of the green function and its derivative about the free surface accordingly the element wise integration is approximated as a series of horizontal line integrals that are distributed vertically which allows the green function to be expressed as a polar integral in the fourier space the complex exponential integral is evaluated by a fraction polynomial and the effect of singularities at the end points of the line segments is eliminated by applying the lobatto quadrature the fourier kochin theory noblesse 2001 follows an indirect route for the solution of diffraction and radiation problems of water waves about floating bodies with or without forward speed it is characterized by two key ideas reversing the order of the fundamental tasks evaluation of the free surface green function and its gradient and their successive integration over the boundary surface within the classical solution of the green function based boundary integral formulation of the problem and decomposing the flow field into wave and non oscillatory local flow components the consequences of the first idea which gain importance when the body advances in waves are that the space integration is transformed into computation of elementary wave distributions over the boundary surface and as a result the singular behavior of the green function about the free surface ceases to exist the second idea serves for extracting the wave information from the green function which could permit analytic investigations and for expressing the fourier integrals for the free surface part of the potential representation in relatively simple forms that also avoid singularities the present study can be considered as the first step towards the application of these ideas for a platform targeting efficient solution of general wave floating structure interaction problems in frequency domain the goal here is to demonstrate and assess the practical application of the fourier kochin theory as well as to identify the challenges and to investigate how to surmount them during numerical implementation after a brief and condensed review of the theory along with the well known fundamental relations a higher order numerical implementation is presented for stationary floating structures as test cases three different body forms a hemisphere a vertical cylinder and a scaled frigate model are studied the predictions are verified against the results obtained using the classical direct solution approach it is observed that the fourier kochin framework accurately captures the radiated and diffracted flow about oscillating floating bodies in general however slight irregularities especially at high frequencies and more apparent for hydrodynamic damping coefficients are also detected when the body form is complicated the main critics to the fourier kochin approach are owing to its computational aspects i e excessive amount of numerical operations compared to the classical solution and the lack of precise quadrature scheme for approximating the fourier integrals 2 mathematical model the diffraction and radiation of regular free surface waves due to stationary floating structures are considered in a water domain of infinite depth the flow is observed from a cartesian coordinate system with the x axis pointing the positive lengthwise direction of the floating body and z axis pointing upward the mean free surface is taken as the plane z 0 the linear potential flow theory is used so that the fluid motion is associated with a velocity potential function φ which can be decomposed as φ φ i φ s φ r with φ i φ s and φ r representing the ambient waves diffracted waves by the presence of the body and radiated waves resulting from the motion of the body respectively in general φ satisfies the laplace equation 2 φ 0 throughout the fluid domain the linearized free surface boundary condition g φ z ω 2 φ on the free surface where g is the gravitational acceleration and ω is the wave angular frequency φ s and φ r additionally satisfy the kinematical boundary condition on the fluid structure interface and the far field radiation condition fundamental relations the general dynamic response of a floating structure q s can be described by modal expansion i e as the sum of the displacements in its principal modes 1 q s x t i 1 n m 6 u i x p i t here both the rigid body and elastic modes are considered the first six modes are the rigid body modes and n m designates the number of elastic modes used in the expansion u i and p i represent the i th mode of the floating structure and i th modal coordinate respectively with the latter describing the contribution of the i th mode on overall response x and t denote the position and time respectively a similar expansion may also be adopted for the radiation potential φ r by proposing a series of potential components corresponding to each mode consequently to each modal coordinate 2 φ r x t i 1 n m 6 φ i x p i t φ i is the radiation potential component in response to the i th mode since the excitation is time harmonic with frequency ω the modal coordinates may have the form p i t p i e i ω t so that the kinematic boundary condition for the radiation potential φ r n w t defined over the wetted surface of the floating body σ can be given for the ith component as 3 φ i n i ω w i where n n x n y n z represents the unit normal vector over σ pointing out of the fluid domain and w i u i n is the body motion in the direction of n with u u x u y u z denoting the displacement w i n i for translational rigid body modes i 1 3 and w i r n i 3 for rotational rigid body modes i 4 6 for the diffraction potential the body is taken in a fixed position thus the kinematic boundary condition over σ becomes φ d n φ i n the boundary value problem for the diffraction and radiation of time harmonic water waves due to a stationary floating body described by the laplace equation free surface boundary condition appropriate kinematical boundary condition and suitable far field radiation condition can be expressed by the classical green function based boundary integral equation defined over σ 4 c ξ φ ξ σ q x g x ξ φ x g x ξ n x d a here q φ n represents the flux 4 π g 1 r 1 r f is the associated free surface green function x x y z and ξ ξ η ζ denote the source and field points when applying g over σ respectively 1 r and 1 r are the rankine singularities with r ξ x 2 η y 2 ζ z 2 r ξ x 2 η y 2 ζ z 2 representing the distance between the field point and source point and the distance between the field point and free surface image of the source point respectively f stands for the free surface effects contained in the green function and c ξ is the free term identifying the fraction of φ that lies inside the fluid domain of interest hereafter all coordinates are taken non dimensional through a reference length l e g ship length similarly ϕ φ l g l and f ω g l represent the non dimensional potential and non dimensional frequency respectively the free surface component in green function f can be expressed with the following fourier integral noblesse 2001 5 f lim ϵ 0 1 π a d ϵ χ ξ χ x d α d β here a f 2 k α and β are the fourier variables k α 2 β 2 is the wave number d ϵ d ϵ d f with d f 2 k as the dispersion function and d f d f f and χ ξ e k ζ i α ξ β η χ x e k z i α x β y are the elementary wave functions related with the field and source points respectively the parameter ϵ is introduced through complex valued frequency i e f i ϵ as suggested by lighthill 1967 for dispersive wave systems with periodic forcing the limit ϵ 0 implies that the resulting time harmonic wave system has been developed from a rest state and reached its steady state it also ensures that the green function satisfies the radiation condition elementary waves satisfy the laplace equation in free space and χ ξ additionally fulfills the free surface boundary condition provided that the fourier variables satisfy the relation d ϵ 0 even though the rankine singularities and elementary wave functions are related with the fourier transform such as the pair 1 r and χ x χ ξ e k ζ z i α ξ x β η y they are appropriate for representing the non oscillatory local flow disturbances and waves respectively and should be rather considered as complementary fundamental solutions as reflected by the form of g along with the expression for f fourier kochin representation of free surface effects the direct solution of integral equation 4 involves two fundamental tasks evaluation of the green function and its gradient and their subsequent integration over the boundary surface recalling that the floating structure is stationary the computation and surface integration of the singular rankine components are straightforward and several simple expressions for the evaluation of the free surface component which has logarithmic singularity about the free surface are provided see xie et al 2018 for the widely used numerical approximations of the pulsating green function the direct approach thus is well established nevertheless the fourier kochin theory of free surface waves introduces an indirect solution basis to the problem which in fact gets its worth when the body is advancing in regular waves where the green function in use cannot be evaluated effectively owing to its singular and highly oscillatory behavior about the free surface i e as ζ z 0 where it is the most dominant thus most important the main principle of the fourier kochin approach for the computation of free surface effects is reversing the order of the evaluation and subsequent boundary integration of the free surface terms f and f in direct solution more precisely expression 5 for f is substituted into eq 4 and the space integration is performed before the fourier integration benefits are twofold i the space integration which becomes complicated when singularities are involved is transformed into computation of spectrum functions the elementary wave distributions over the boundary surface and ii the fourier integral becomes finite as ξ x over the free surface whether or not forward speed is present since the integrand of the fourier integral vanishes for singularity distribution as k this is not case for the free surface component of the green function itself i e for point singularity when the forward speed is considered noblesse 2001 by assigning ϕ f for the potential distribution due to the free surface effects the associated boundary integral equation can be written from eqs 4 5 as 6 c ξ ϕ f ξ lim ϵ 0 1 π σ a d ϵ q ϕ i α n x i β n y k n z χ x χ ξ d α d β d a here c ξ 4 π c ξ owing to the form of the green function performing the space integration first eq 6 becomes 7 c ξ ϕ f ξ lim ϵ 0 1 π a s d ϵ χ ξ d α d β where s is the wave spectrum function defined by noblesse and yang 1995 as 8 s σ q ϕ i α n x i β n y k n z χ x d a the spectrum function collects elementary wave distributions over σ it replaces the space integration in the direct approach and can be considered as the base for building the boundary element influence coefficients its computation is straightforward and entails no special consideration apart from relying on spectrum functions the key feature of the fourier kochin representation of the free surface effects is expressing the flow field as ϕ f ϕ w ϕ l where ϕ w and ϕ l are the wave and non oscillatory near field or local flow components respectively this decomposition allows the resulting wave system to be described through single integrals along the dispersion curves which are defined by the dispersion relation d α β 0 in fourier plane noblesse and chen 1995 9 c ξ ϕ w ξ i d 0 d 0 sgn d f sgn ξ d α η d β a d e i φ d s here the summation implies that the integration covers all dispersion curves specified by d 0 and sgn refers to the sign function a a s e k ζ is the amplitude function φ α ξ β η is the phase function d α d β d α d β d d α 2 d β 2 and d s is the differential arc element as noted before a f 2 k and the summation involves a single dispersion curve for time harmonic flow without forward speed as notified below but eq 9 is valid for other types flow e g time harmonic flow with forward speed if a is selected accordingly this is the case for all expressions given in terms of a below there are two terms contributing to the waves generated by the body in eq 9 the term sgn d f is due to the limit ϵ 0 thus it is responsible for satisfaction of the radiation condition the term sgn ξ d α η d β is obtained by far field asymptotic analysis of eq 7 after setting ϵ 0 it represents the far field approximation of ϕ f as ρ ξ 2 η 2 i e it accounts for the contained far field waves the non oscillatory local flow component is the difference between ϕ f and ϕ w considering that the total potential can be represented by the wave potential alone in the far field ϕ l is expected to be significant only in the near field from eqs 7 and 9 by also dropping the effect of ϵ ϕ l can be given as 10 c ξ ϕ l ξ 1 π a d e i φ d α d β i d 0 d 0 sgn ξ d α η d β a d e i φ d s to cancel the singularities at the dispersion curves that prevent direct use of the double integral here dispersion strips can be defined about the dispersion curves centered at d 0 in the fourier plane and localizing functions which are equal to one at dispersion curves and negligible outside dispersion strips can be put into use noblesse and chen 1997 this allows to express the wave potential in double integral form so that both terms in eq 10 are compatible and to define the region where the local flow component is significant the resulting expressions for the wave and local flow potentials can be given as follows noblesse 2001 11a c ξ ϕ w ξ i d 0 d 0 sgn d f erf θ a d e i φ d s 11b c ξ ϕ l ξ 1 π 1 d a d 0 e a d 0 e i φ d α d β here erf is the error function the localizing function e and the corresponding localizing effect on wave potential θ are assigned to each dispersion curve they are defined as 12a e d l δ d e σ 2 l 2 δ 2 12b θ sgn δ d δ φ δ 2 σ δ and l represent a roughly orthogonal vector to a dispersion curve and the distance from the dispersion curve in the direction of δ in the fourier plane respectively δ and σ determine the shape and width of the dispersion strip δ can be related to the curvature k of the dispersion curve by δ 1 μ 2 k 2 where the real valued function μ 0 should be considered for dispersion curves with vanishing curvature if δ d d then sgn δ d 1 and δ φ ξ d α η d β d thus eq 12b can be given as 13 θ ξ d α η d β 2 σ k d the subscript d 0 in eq 11b states that all related terms are computed at a dispersion curve with the exception l in eq 12a which is the distance with respect to a dispersion curve the summation includes all dispersion curves as before the parameter σ and the function k resolve the fourier plane into inside and outside regions of dispersion strips and also divide the flow region into a far field zone where expression 11a becomes identical to the far field approximation 9 and a near field zone where the local flow is effective considering that erf θ sgn ξ d α η d β as ρ θ 2 specifies the transition from the near to far field as can be seen from eq 13 θ is proportional to ρ 2 σ k hence by taking σ π 2 for the field within a wavelength λ with respect to a source point located at origin i e ρ λ 2 π k the near field region is determined by k 1 k in other words σ π 2 and k 1 k roughly sets the near field region as one wavelength the extent of near field can be adjusted by tuning σ which will also alter the resulting flow components since both the wave and local flow potentials depend on it however the total flow indifferent to value of σ and remains the same noblesse et al 1999 observing the variation of e may give additional insight for the behavior in fourier plane according to eq 11b there is no contribution to local flow for e 1 i e within a dispersion strip determined by l for a given σ in eq 12a for all α β outside the dispersion strips and with increasing l e quickly descends and becomes practically zero the larger the value of σ the narrower the dispersion strip and the larger the extent of the near field region this implies that the near field region diminishes for σ 0 and the far field approximation represents the flow as a side note since e 1 at a dispersion curve the integrand of the double integral in eq 11b is now continuous over the whole fourier plane it should be pointed that when the boundary surface is partitioned into elements as will be discussed in section 3 the absolute position of a field point is replaced by the position with respect to the source point it is interacting hence the given argument for the physical space is still valid for time harmonic flows without forward speed the dispersion relation k f 2 defines a single closed curve a circle of radius f 2 yielding ring waves so the fourier plane can be represented with polar coordinates k θ expressing the fourier variables as α β k cos θ sin θ and considering that the radius of curvature 1 k f 2 then θ f 2 φ 2 σ e e τ with φ ξ cos θ η sin θ τ σ 2 1 k f 2 2 from eqs 11 the wave and local flow components become 14a c ξ ϕ w ξ i f 2 π π erf f 2 φ 2 σ 1 s e f 2 ζ i φ d θ 14b c ξ

sin θ and the spectrum function with the index d is evaluated at the dispersion curve i e for α β f 2 cos θ sin θ furthermore the relation s α β s α β is employed where s is the conjugate of s and μ is avoided owing to the always positive curvature in accordance with the definition of the free surface green function and given fourier kochin decomposition of the free surface effects the diffracted and radiated time harmonic flow due to a stationary floating body can be given as 15 ϕ ϕ r ϕ r ϕ w ϕ l here ϕ r and ϕ r denote the flow components due to the rankine components 1 r and 1 r of the free surface green function respectively hydrodynamic forces and dynamic response using the bernoulli s equation with neglecting the second order and hydrostatic terms the unsteady fluid pressure p can be given as 16 p ρ f φ t i ω ρ f φ i φ s i 1 n m φ i p i e i ω t here the decomposed form of the velocity potential and the series expansion 2 for the radiation term are used along with incident waves of unit amplitude and ρ f is the fluid density hereafter all symbols for time harmonic variables will also indicate their amplitudes and n m denotes the total number of considered modes rigid and elastic for regular waves propagating in deep water as in this study φ i i g ω e k z i x cos γ y sin γ with γ denoting the direction of the waves with respect to the x axis the ith component of the generalized fluid forces acting on the floating structure is defined as 17 f i σ p w i d a f i w f i r where f i w and f i r represent the wave exciting and radiation forces respectively they are given as 18a f i w i ω ρ f σ w i φ i φ s d a 18b f i r i ω ρ f j 1 n m p j σ w i φ j d a by using the haskind relations newman 1977 f i w can be expressed in a form independent of the diffraction potential hence without solving the diffraction problem provided that the radiation potential is available furthermore considering that φ r is a complex valued function and also recalling eq 3 that substitutes w for q in eqs 4 8 and transfers the i ω factor to φ r eqs 18 can be written as 19a f i w i ω ρ f σ φ i w i φ i φ i n d a 19b f i r j 1 n m ω 2 a i j i ω b i j p j here a i j and b i j are the generalized added mass and hydrodynamic damping coefficients respectively that are defined by 20a a i j ρ f σ w i ℜ φ j d a 20b b i j ρ f ω σ w i ℑ φ j d a in eqs 19 and below φ i is taken as i ω φ i to expose the explicit dependence on i ω ℑ in eq 20b denotes the imaginary part of its argument using the wave excitation and radiation forces from eqs 19 the equation of motion for the floating structure that is subjected to regular waves of frequency ω can be written as 21 j 1 n m ω 2 m i j a i j i ω b i j k i j c i j p j f i w i 1 n m here m i j and k i j represent the inertia and elastic stiffness of the structure respectively and c i j denotes the hydrostatic restoring force structural damping is neglected the dynamic response of the structure can be obtained by substituting the solution p from 21 into the modal expansion 1 for each wave frequency 3 numerical implementation the solution of the boundary integral equation 4 accounting for the rankine components of the green function and for the fourier kochin distributions defined by the fourier integrals 14 for a floating body of general shape requires the boundary surface σ to be idealized using surface elements over which the potential and flux distributions are interpolated in terms of shape functions and nodal values for the ith boundary element corresponding representations ϕ i and q i can be given as 22 ϕ i s q i s j 1 n i ϕ i j q i j n j s where n i denotes the number of nodal points assigned to the ith element ϕ i j and q i j represent the potential and flux values for the j th node of the element respectively n j represents the associated shape functions and s s t stands for the coordinate system local to the element in eq 22 and hereafter all quantities are taken as non dimensional applying this scheme to the spectrum functions is trivial yet more complicated compared to the classical solution assume that the wave spectrum function s representing the surface integration of elementary waves has the form 23 s σ χ x d a here q ϕ i α n x i β n y k n z obtained from eq 8 denotes the part of the integrand that does not depend on x explicitly the term is related with both the unknown field of ϕ and known quantities in terms of body motion for the radiation problem hence from eq 3 it has the implicit form i ω w ϕ where the subscripts mark the associations by defining over an element in the same way as eq 22 i e i j 1 n i i j n j and similarly representing x s becomes a collection of element spectrum functions for the ith element substituted by a generic quadrilateral parent element it is given by 24 s i j 1 n i i j 1 1 1 1 n j s χ x s j s d s d t where j s is the jacobian of the transformation from x to s there is one small caveat in eq 24 that i j involves the fourier variables α β in fourier kochin representation 15 of the diffracted radiated flow the fourier components ϕ w and ϕ l are computed using spectrum functions whereas the direct approach is preferred for the rankine components since spectrum functions are free from singularity or near singularity conditions relatively few number of gauss points is sufficient to achieve high precision numerical quadrature which is not the case for the direct solution there is a drawback however that the spectrum functions feed fourier integrals hence they depend on fourier variables they are computed for each α β pair nevertheless ϕ w is determined by a single fourier integral about a circle as given with eq 14a and ϕ l rapidly decays as k thus the k integral in eq 14b is effective within a limited region furthermore once the element spectrum functions are obtained they can be used for each node pair when constructing the influence coefficients of the boundary element solution another reservation the rapid oscillations of the wave function in eq 24 for large values of x that may enforce using special quadrature schemes can be avoided by slightly modifying the form of the wave function rather than direct use of the global position over an element we can make use of the element wise position and express the element spectrum function as 25 s i j 1 n i i j χ x j s i j with 26 s i j 1 1 1 1 n j χ x x j j d s d t here χ x j e k z j i α x j β y j and χ x x j e k z i i α x i β y i are the wave functions due to the j th node and due to the position with respect to j th node over the element respectively with x j x j y j k j denoting the position of the j th node and x i y i z i j 1 n i x j n j x j using eqs 4 14 22 and 25 the boundary integral equation for time harmonic flow without forward speed can be discretized as 27 c ξ ϕ ξ i 1 n e j 1 n i q i j g i j ϕ i j h i j i f 2 π π d θ i 1 n e j 1 n i erf f 2 φ j 2 σ 1 s i j e f 2 z j i φ j q i j f 2 λ i j ϕ i j 2 π f 2

scheme abramowitz and stegun 1964 by applying eq 27 for each node of the discretization and considering the boundary condition 3 in terms of principal modes the following set of algebraic equations

a hemisphere and a vertical cylinder as primitive cases and a scaled frigate model as a more realistic case for the primitive bodies only the rigid body modes are considered for the frigate model elastic modes are also adopted for all problems the predictions by the fourier kochin approach are verified against the results based on the classical approach i e direct solution of the boundary integral equation using the free surface green function the radiation forces in terms of added mass and hydrodynamic damping coefficients wave excitation forces and transfer functions are provided as the assessment data the free surface green function used for the direct solution is calculated based on the expressions proposed by telste and noblesse 1986 accordingly the green function is decomposed into rankine wave and near field components as in this study for fourier kochin representation the rankine component is the r function as given here the wave component corresponds to eq 14a for σ 0 and the near field component is approximated depending on the position of the field point with respect to the source it is well known that the numerical solution of the boundary integral equation 4 generates erroneous results at specific frequencies which correspond to the eigenvalues of the homogeneous dirichlet problem for the associated fictitious internal flow this mathematical flaw is due to the fact that the green function satisfies the free surface boundary condition over the whole free surface plane both external and internal to the floating body even if the internal fluid is non physical the fourier kochin framework adopts an indirect approach yet it relies on the free surface green function so it is also exposed to this irregular frequency effects among the methods that have been proposed for suppressing the irregular frequencies the extended boundary integral equation method lee et al 1996 is applied it can be readily integrated into the existing solutions indirect and direct by including the internal free surface into the solution domain and applying the rigid wall boundary condition over it quadratic six and eight noded isoparametric elements are adopted for the boundary element approximations here the idealizations are identified as nn nnf where nn and nnf are the number of nodes distributed over the wetted surface and internal free surface respectively the free terms c ξ for the wetted surface nodes are computed by considering the volume enclosed by the wetted surface and internal free surface and applying a constant flux over its whole surface for ω 0 i e by taking g 1 4 π r the free terms for the internal free surface nodes are taken as 1 as prescribed by the extended boundary integral equation method the added mass and hydrodynamic damping coefficients are given in their standard non dimensional form for the rigid body modes i e for translations as a δ and b δ ω and for rotations as a δ l and b δ ω l with δ and l denoting the body displacement and reference length respectively the elastic modes are mass normalized and related coefficients are given in dimensional form e g added mass coefficients in kg m 2 correspond to unit modal mass the non dimensional frequency f ω g l represents the horizontal axis in the plots if the magnitude of the displayed data is in the order of 10 2 or smaller it is multiplied accordingly as given in the axis label since the main goal here is demonstrating the practical application of the fourier kochin approach as well as confirming its predictions no convergence study is explicitly presented the results based on the fourier kochin theory and the classical approach are abbreviated as fk and wg for wave green respectively 4 1 hemisphere the diagonal components of the added mass and hydrodynamic damping matrices that are associated with the surge and heave motions of a floating hemisphere are given in figs 1 and 2 respectively l is taken as the radius of the hemisphere 1 m and the applied idealization is 465 279 fk and wg results are in very good agreement along the entire frequency range yet very small differences can be observed for the hydrodynamic damping coefficient due to heave for high frequencies 4 2 vertical cylinder the second studied floating body of primitive shape is an oscillating vertical cylinder of circular cross section the length to radius ratio of the cylinder is 2 reference length is taken as the radius 1 m and the applied idealization is 353 161 the added mass and hydrodynamic damping coefficients for the surge heave and roll motions of the cylinder are presented in figs 3 and 4 respectively fk and wg predictions are in overall agreement with almost exact match 4 3 scaled frigate model as the final and more realistic case a 1 3 scaled frigate model a modified form of dtmb 5415 is investigated both the rigid body and elastic modes are considered but with two different idealizations the hydroelastic analysis requires finer discretization main particulars and material properties of the model are given in tables 1 and 2 respectively material stiffness is reduced through elastic modulus with the intention of lowering the natural frequencies to the order of the wave frequencies studied at least for some of the modes views of the wetted surface and internal free surface for the first boundary element idealization are given in fig 5 this idealization adopted for the rigid body modes is 4286 1739 the midship section and the bottom and profile views of the structural model that is used for the hydroelastic analysis are shown in fig 6 the corresponding boundary element idealization is 6653 3517 the reference length is taken as the model length for all computations natural frequencies along with the distortion types of the associated mode shapes for the first eight modes are presented in table 3 vb hb and t denote vertical bending horizontal bending and torsion respectively as seen some mode shapes are identified as a combination of two different distortion types the first five mode shapes are given in fig 7 where different views are selected to make the distortions more apparent the radiation coefficients for the rigid body modes of the frigate model are compared in figs 8 9 indirect fk and direct wg predictions fit fairly along the frequency range unlike the simpler cases however for roll and with a lesser extent for surge the fk values exhibit slight discrepancies with respect to the wg values at higher frequencies which are more visible for the hydrodynamic damping coefficients fig 9 the radiation coefficients due to the first six elastic modes are additionally presented in figs 10 11 the differences between the two sets of results at higher frequencies become more apparent now especially for the hydrodynamic damping despite the overall close agreement two factors can be related with these small yet noticeable differences i even though not presented here when suppression is not applied frequent irregular frequency effects are monitored along the examined frequency range for both type of analysis which are more significant for hydrodynamic damping it is well known that most of the irregular frequency removal techniques could defer the irregular frequencies and reduce their effects yet could not completely eliminate them e g see tunca et al 2018 for the performance of the extended boundary integral equation method on the direct approach the fluctuations of the radiation coefficients for both the rigid body and elastic modes are observed about two of the irregular frequencies 13 06 and 14 98 corresponding to 6 86 and 7 86 in rad s for both solution approaches direct and indirect the extended boundary integral equation formulation seems to be not sufficiently effective for high frequencies hence due to the high condition number of the discrete boundary element systems about the irregular frequencies even small valued differences may lead to relatively large output differences in fact for some modes fk results are less influenced by the irregular frequencies and for others wg results ii depending on the complexity of the flow field about the oscillating body the number of quadrature points used for the numerical evaluation of the angular and radial integrals that sweep the dispersion curve and fourier plane for the fourier kochin components expressed by eqs 14 may vary e g the number of gauss points required for an accurate representation of the wave potential is higher for the frigate model compared to the vertical cylinder in fig 12 the hydrodynamic damping coefficients due to surge and roll motions and due to 2nd and 3rd vertical bending modes the two modes that are more noticeable in figs 9 11 of the frigate model are reproduced again this time considering three different implementations of the numerical quadrature for the angular integral over the dispersion curve related with the wave component 80 100 and 120 quadrature points for the rigid body modes and 120 140 and 160 quadrature points for the elastic modes are adopted recalling that for zero forward speed the dispersion curve corresponds to a circle of radius f 2 a consistent approximation for higher frequencies can be achieved by increasing the number quadrature points the 120 point and 160 point quadrature however are clearly not sufficient for the complete frequency interval investigated the gauss and gauss laguerre quadrature associated with the angular and semi infinite radial integrals of the near field potential component respectively also display similar behavior for attaining convergent results with the increasing frequency yet the required order of quadrature is generally more limited compared to the one for the wave component the wave excitation forces due to the rigid body modes of the frigate model for quarter γ 45 and head waves γ 180 are compared in figs 13 and 14 respectively for quarter waves all rigid body modes for head waves only surge heave and pitch the modes for which the forces have notable magnitude are presented they are given in non dimensional form using the reference values f r ρ f g ζ l b for force f and m r ρ g ζ l b d for moment m type excitation where l b d and ζ denote the length breadth and draft of the frigate model table 1 and the amplitude of the incident waves respectively the wave excitation forces for the first six elastic modes are also given in fig 15 with their values both type of results not surprisingly resemble the radiation forces by their overall agreement and small differences since they are essentially based on the radiation coefficients through the haskind relations i e eq 19a fk and wg results are generally in perfect match yet the traces of the irregularities observed for the radiation coefficients can be seen in the high frequency region to indirectly confirm the computations the diffraction problem is additionally solved for quarter waves and the resulting wave forces are compared with the haskind relation based values in fig 16 for the elastic modes here wg results which are practically same as the fk results are used the two sets nicely fit but the haskind relation can be said to offer better performance for high frequencies as the final assessment the transfer functions corresponding to heave roll and pitch motions of the frigate model are presented in fig 17 for γ 45 following the fine agreement for the radiation coefficients and wave forces the two solution approaches predict identical responses as can be expected 5 conclusion the fourier kochin theory of free surface flows noblesse 2001 is considered for time harmonic wave radiation and diffraction problems about stationary floating bodies the key principles of the fourier kochin theory are switching the order of the fundamental tasks within the classical solution of the green function based boundary integral representations of free surface flows evaluation of the green function and its gradient and their subsequent integration over the boundary surface and delicately decomposing the flow field into wave and non oscillatory local flow components by implementing a higher order numerical approximation along with the use of extended boundary integral equation method for removal of the irregular frequency effects three different body forms a hemisphere a vertical cylinder and a 1 3 scaled frigate model are used as the test cases for the application of the theory the predictions in terms of radiation coefficients wave excitation forces and transfer functions are verified against the results obtained using the classical approach the given mathematical model in section 2 and implementation scheme in section 3 allow application for both rigid body and elastic modes hence by constructing a structural representation of the frigate model and evaluating its dynamic characteristics through finite element analysis hydroelastic assessments are also performed some conclusions can be drawn as follows when the floating body is taken stationary as in the present work the wave body interaction problem has a standard unambiguous solution and the fourier kochin theory may not seem worthwhile to adopt the indirect solution approach awarded by the fourier kochin theory however has profound consequences for the analytic and numerical analysis of the free surface flows resulting from the wave body interactions the space integration is transformed into computation of elementary wave distributions over the boundary surface and as a result the fourier integral becomes finite over the free surface it should be pointed out that both the space and fourier integration become quite involved in the classical treatment of the problem when the body advances in regular waves this is where the real gain of the indirect approach lies the fourier kochin framework readily captures the radiated flow about oscillating primitive floating bodies the results for the added mass and hydrodynamic damping coefficients match perfectly with the values obtained by the classical solution for the entire frequency range considered when the body form is complicated however despite usually achieving identical predictions irregularities especially at high frequencies and more apparent for hydrodynamic damping coefficients are also observed two possible explanations can be given i it is well known that with increasing frequency and depending on the mesh fineness the extended boundary integral equation formulation may become insufficient for suppressing the irregular frequencies the high condition number of the resulting discrete system about the irregular frequencies can develop the differences between the two group of results ii the adopted number of quadrature points may offer insufficient approximation for the integral expressions defining the wave and local flow components of the fourier kochin representation two critiques can be directed to the fourier kochin approach considering its computational aspects i both the wave and near field components of the flow field contain integration of oscillatory functions in the fourier plane the required number of quadrature points for achieving accurate representations depend on the complexity of the body form but also varies with the wave frequency hence pursuing an optimal number of quadrature points for specific frequency ranges rather than adopting an unnecessarily high number is critical from this point of view applying an adaptive scheme for numerical quadrature can be convenient ii compared to the classical solution that benefits from effective approximations for the pulsating free surface green function the excessive amount of numerical operations enforced by the fourier kochin approach is a serious flaw the whole solution process however is suitable for a parallel computation environment and substantial acceleration has been achieved with an openmp

20882,the classical problem of time harmonic diffraction and radiation of free surface flows due to wave body interaction is revisited based on the fourier kochin theory for zero forward speed the key idea of the fourier kochin theory is reversing the order of the two fundamental tasks of the green function based direct solutions of free surface flows i e evaluation of the green function and its gradient and their subsequent integration over the boundary surface by implementing a higher order numerical approximation along with the use of extended boundary integral equation method to suppress the irregular frequencies three different bodies a hemisphere a vertical cylinder and a frigate model are studied the fourier kochin framework accurately captures the radiated and diffracted flow about oscillating bodies in general but slight irregularities are also observed at high frequencies for complicated body forms since the floating body is stationary here the problem has a standard unambiguous solution and the indirect approach introduced by the fourier kochin theory may not seem worthwhile to adopt however its perspective becomes rewarding when the forward speed effects are considered as a premise of this idea the main goals here are to assess the practical application of the theory to identify the challenges and to investigate how to surmount them keywords fourier kochin theory free surface green function free surface hydrodynamics wave body interaction 1 introduction the diffraction and radiation of free surface waves due to stationary floating bodies are studied by using the indirect perspective favored by the fourier kochin theory the solution approach provided is related with the frequency domain boundary integral representations that rely on free surface green functions and is in fact most rewarding when the forward speed effects are considered where limited methods of practical importance are present despite the increasing use of computational fluid dynamics for marine applications el moctar et al 2017 takami and iijima 2019 where true estimation of the motion and response is pursued the potential flow theory still dominates the field with its capability to capture the main aspects of wave body interaction and to predict the associated elements of fundamental importance i e pressure distributions and wave loads with sufficient accuracy potential theory based approximations to free surface flow problems are usually expressed as conventional boundary integral formulations and their numerical solutions come in two flavors they either adopt a free surface or wave green function as the fundamental solution which implicitly satisfies the appropriate linearized free surface boundary condition and radiation condition or distribute simple sources over the wetted body surface and also free surface where the free surface boundary condition and far field radiation condition are exclusively considered when the nonlinear effects mainly resulting from the large amplitude oscillations of the free surface or geometric factors such as large bow flare need to be acknowledged the latter approach referred to as the rankine panel method steps forth see kim et al 1997 for the fundamentals of the method for linear and high frequency second order problems around offshore structures and kim et al 2015 as a hydroelastic application for the whipping response analysis of a containership that employed the finite element method for the structural analysis and generalized wagner model for slamming load assessment the main advantages of the rankine panel methods are that the simple form of the source term significantly accelerates the analysis and complicated base flows e g steady ship flow and double body flow can be used for approximating the free surface boundary condition the green function based approach usually identified as the free surface green function method lack these features but enjoy their own owing to the inherent properties of the green function imposing artificial damping zones to substitute the radiation condition and including the free surface plane into the computational domain which should be wide enough to permit wave propagation and its discretization should be properly set up to capture the high frequency wave components and complex wave patterns as enforced by rankine panel methods can be avoided by adopting the transient free surface green function weak nonlinearities of froude krylov type can also be addressed sengupta et al 2016 one additional group of methods that uses a hybrid approach can be mentioned yang et al 2019 shan et al 2020 they combine the strengths of two principle methods by subdividing the fluid volume into an inner domain which includes the floating body and a bounded part of the free surface plane that are enclosed by a control surface and the remaining outer domain the simple sources are distributed within the inner domain for employing more realistic conditions about the body and the free surface green function with its advantages is applied just over the control surface free surface green function methods are particularly used for regular seakeeping and hydroelastic analyses they provide the spectral data for response prediction in random waves since the pulsating free surface green function can be computed efficiently frequency domain solutions are generally preferred for zero forward speed applications e g offshore platforms and marine energy converters for ships however complicated form of the translating pulsating free surface green function along with the involved computational difficulties resulting from its singular and highly oscillatory behavior about the free surface limit the frequency domain studies and the time domain approach is frequently promoted kara 2015 if one prefer the frequency dependent hydrodynamic coefficients can be obtained from the time dependent impulse response functions ma et al 2016 nevertheless the original double fourier integral form of the translating pulsating free surface green function is given by alternative expressions to acquire better numerical behavior where more efficient computation techniques are also presented inglis and price 1981 wu and eatock taylor 1987 iwashita and ohkusu 1992 ba and guilbaud 1995 noblesse et al 2004 yao and dong 2014 based on these attempts a number of methods of practical application are developed du et al 2000 adopted bessho s formulation bessho 1977 which contains elementary functions but is also mathematically more involved they applied the steepest descent method for the complex oscillating integrand to find a path on which the integrand does not oscillate maury et al 2003 proposed two different solutions for considering the forward speed effects in frequency domain the first one is similarly based on the application of the steepest descent method on bessho form the second one uses the formulation by guevel and bougis 1982 where the complex exponential integral function is calculated by the simpson adaptive method due to the insufficiency of numerical quadrature especially about the free surface space integration is performed analytically liang et al 2016 working on the form by wu and eatock taylor 1987 offered a new discretization scheme to avoid the influence of high oscillations of the green function and its derivative about the free surface accordingly the element wise integration is approximated as a series of horizontal line integrals that are distributed vertically which allows the green function to be expressed as a polar integral in the fourier space the complex exponential integral is evaluated by a fraction polynomial and the effect of singularities at the end points of the line segments is eliminated by applying the lobatto quadrature the fourier kochin theory noblesse 2001 follows an indirect route for the solution of diffraction and radiation problems of water waves about floating bodies with or without forward speed it is characterized by two key ideas reversing the order of the fundamental tasks evaluation of the free surface green function and its gradient and their successive integration over the boundary surface within the classical solution of the green function based boundary integral formulation of the problem and decomposing the flow field into wave and non oscillatory local flow components the consequences of the first idea which gain importance when the body advances in waves are that the space integration is transformed into computation of elementary wave distributions over the boundary surface and as a result the singular behavior of the green function about the free surface ceases to exist the second idea serves for extracting the wave information from the green function which could permit analytic investigations and for expressing the fourier integrals for the free surface part of the potential representation in relatively simple forms that also avoid singularities the present study can be considered as the first step towards the application of these ideas for a platform targeting efficient solution of general wave floating structure interaction problems in frequency domain the goal here is to demonstrate and assess the practical application of the fourier kochin theory as well as to identify the challenges and to investigate how to surmount them during numerical implementation after a brief and condensed review of the theory along with the well known fundamental relations a higher order numerical implementation is presented for stationary floating structures as test cases three different body forms a hemisphere a vertical cylinder and a scaled frigate model are studied the predictions are verified against the results obtained using the classical direct solution approach it is observed that the fourier kochin framework accurately captures the radiated and diffracted flow about oscillating floating bodies in general however slight irregularities especially at high frequencies and more apparent for hydrodynamic damping coefficients are also detected when the body form is complicated the main critics to the fourier kochin approach are owing to its computational aspects i e excessive amount of numerical operations compared to the classical solution and the lack of precise quadrature scheme for approximating the fourier integrals 2 mathematical model the diffraction and radiation of regular free surface waves due to stationary floating structures are considered in a water domain of infinite depth the flow is observed from a cartesian coordinate system with the x axis pointing the positive lengthwise direction of the floating body and z axis pointing upward the mean free surface is taken as the plane z 0 the linear potential flow theory is used so that the fluid motion is associated with a velocity potential function φ which can be decomposed as φ φ i φ s φ r with φ i φ s and φ r representing the ambient waves diffracted waves by the presence of the body and radiated waves resulting from the motion of the body respectively in general φ satisfies the laplace equation 2 φ 0 throughout the fluid domain the linearized free surface boundary condition g φ z ω 2 φ on the free surface where g is the gravitational acceleration and ω is the wave angular frequency φ s and φ r additionally satisfy the kinematical boundary condition on the fluid structure interface and the far field radiation condition fundamental relations the general dynamic response of a floating structure q s can be described by modal expansion i e as the sum of the displacements in its principal modes 1 q s x t i 1 n m 6 u i x p i t here both the rigid body and elastic modes are considered the first six modes are the rigid body modes and n m designates the number of elastic modes used in the expansion u i and p i represent the i th mode of the floating structure and i th modal coordinate respectively with the latter describing the contribution of the i th mode on overall response x and t denote the position and time respectively a similar expansion may also be adopted for the radiation potential φ r by proposing a series of potential components corresponding to each mode consequently to each modal coordinate 2 φ r x t i 1 n m 6 φ i x p i t φ i is the radiation potential component in response to the i th mode since the excitation is time harmonic with frequency ω the modal coordinates may have the form p i t p i e i ω t so that the kinematic boundary condition for the radiation potential φ r n w t defined over the wetted surface of the floating body σ can be given for the ith component as 3 φ i n i ω w i where n n x n y n z represents the unit normal vector over σ pointing out of the fluid domain and w i u i n is the body motion in the direction of n with u u x u y u z denoting the displacement w i n i for translational rigid body modes i 1 3 and w i r n i 3 for rotational rigid body modes i 4 6 for the diffraction potential the body is taken in a fixed position thus the kinematic boundary condition over σ becomes φ d n φ i n the boundary value problem for the diffraction and radiation of time harmonic water waves due to a stationary floating body described by the laplace equation free surface boundary condition appropriate kinematical boundary condition and suitable far field radiation condition can be expressed by the classical green function based boundary integral equation defined over σ 4 c ξ φ ξ σ q x g x ξ φ x g x ξ n x d a here q φ n represents the flux 4 π g 1 r 1 r f is the associated free surface green function x x y z and ξ ξ η ζ denote the source and field points when applying g over σ respectively 1 r and 1 r are the rankine singularities with r ξ x 2 η y 2 ζ z 2 r ξ x 2 η y 2 ζ z 2 representing the distance between the field point and source point and the distance between the field point and free surface image of the source point respectively f stands for the free surface effects contained in the green function and c ξ is the free term identifying the fraction of φ that lies inside the fluid domain of interest hereafter all coordinates are taken non dimensional through a reference length l e g ship length similarly ϕ φ l g l and f ω g l represent the non dimensional potential and non dimensional frequency respectively the free surface component in green function f can be expressed with the following fourier integral noblesse 2001 5 f lim ϵ 0 1 π a d ϵ χ ξ χ x d α d β here a f 2 k α and β are the fourier variables k α 2 β 2 is the wave number d ϵ d ϵ d f with d f 2 k as the dispersion function and d f d f f and χ ξ e k ζ i α ξ β η χ x e k z i α x β y are the elementary wave functions related with the field and source points respectively the parameter ϵ is introduced through complex valued frequency i e f i ϵ as suggested by lighthill 1967 for dispersive wave systems with periodic forcing the limit ϵ 0 implies that the resulting time harmonic wave system has been developed from a rest state and reached its steady state it also ensures that the green function satisfies the radiation condition elementary waves satisfy the laplace equation in free space and χ ξ additionally fulfills the free surface boundary condition provided that the fourier variables satisfy the relation d ϵ 0 even though the rankine singularities and elementary wave functions are related with the fourier transform such as the pair 1 r and χ x χ ξ e k ζ z i α ξ x β η y they are appropriate for representing the non oscillatory local flow disturbances and waves respectively and should be rather considered as complementary fundamental solutions as reflected by the form of g along with the expression for f fourier kochin representation of free surface effects the direct solution of integral equation 4 involves two fundamental tasks evaluation of the green function and its gradient and their subsequent integration over the boundary surface recalling that the floating structure is stationary the computation and surface integration of the singular rankine components are straightforward and several simple expressions for the evaluation of the free surface component which has logarithmic singularity about the free surface are provided see xie et al 2018 for the widely used numerical approximations of the pulsating green function the direct approach thus is well established nevertheless the fourier kochin theory of free surface waves introduces an indirect solution basis to the problem which in fact gets its worth when the body is advancing in regular waves where the green function in use cannot be evaluated effectively owing to its singular and highly oscillatory behavior about the free surface i e as ζ z 0 where it is the most dominant thus most important the main principle of the fourier kochin approach for the computation of free surface effects is reversing the order of the evaluation and subsequent boundary integration of the free surface terms f and f in direct solution more precisely expression 5 for f is substituted into eq 4 and the space integration is performed before the fourier integration benefits are twofold i the space integration which becomes complicated when singularities are involved is transformed into computation of spectrum functions the elementary wave distributions over the boundary surface and ii the fourier integral becomes finite as ξ x over the free surface whether or not forward speed is present since the integrand of the fourier integral vanishes for singularity distribution as k this is not case for the free surface component of the green function itself i e for point singularity when the forward speed is considered noblesse 2001 by assigning ϕ f for the potential distribution due to the free surface effects the associated boundary integral equation can be written from eqs 4 5 as 6 c ξ ϕ f ξ lim ϵ 0 1 π σ a d ϵ q ϕ i α n x i β n y k n z χ x χ ξ d α d β d a here c ξ 4 π c ξ owing to the form of the green function performing the space integration first eq 6 becomes 7 c ξ ϕ f ξ lim ϵ 0 1 π a s d ϵ χ ξ d α d β where s is the wave spectrum function defined by noblesse and yang 1995 as 8 s σ q ϕ i α n x i β n y k n z χ x d a the spectrum function collects elementary wave distributions over σ it replaces the space integration in the direct approach and can be considered as the base for building the boundary element influence coefficients its computation is straightforward and entails no special consideration apart from relying on spectrum functions the key feature of the fourier kochin representation of the free surface effects is expressing the flow field as ϕ f ϕ w ϕ l where ϕ w and ϕ l are the wave and non oscillatory near field or local flow components respectively this decomposition allows the resulting wave system to be described through single integrals along the dispersion curves which are defined by the dispersion relation d α β 0 in fourier plane noblesse and chen 1995 9 c ξ ϕ w ξ i d 0 d 0 sgn d f sgn ξ d α η d β a d e i φ d s here the summation implies that the integration covers all dispersion curves specified by d 0 and sgn refers to the sign function a a s e k ζ is the amplitude function φ α ξ β η is the phase function d α d β d α d β d d α 2 d β 2 and d s is the differential arc element as noted before a f 2 k and the summation involves a single dispersion curve for time harmonic flow without forward speed as notified below but eq 9 is valid for other types flow e g time harmonic flow with forward speed if a is selected accordingly this is the case for all expressions given in terms of a below there are two terms contributing to the waves generated by the body in eq 9 the term sgn d f is due to the limit ϵ 0 thus it is responsible for satisfaction of the radiation condition the term sgn ξ d α η d β is obtained by far field asymptotic analysis of eq 7 after setting ϵ 0 it represents the far field approximation of ϕ f as ρ ξ 2 η 2 i e it accounts for the contained far field waves the non oscillatory local flow component is the difference between ϕ f and ϕ w considering that the total potential can be represented by the wave potential alone in the far field ϕ l is expected to be significant only in the near field from eqs 7 and 9 by also dropping the effect of ϵ ϕ l can be given as 10 c ξ ϕ l ξ 1 π a d e i φ d α d β i d 0 d 0 sgn ξ d α η d β a d e i φ d s to cancel the singularities at the dispersion curves that prevent direct use of the double integral here dispersion strips can be defined about the dispersion curves centered at d 0 in the fourier plane and localizing functions which are equal to one at dispersion curves and negligible outside dispersion strips can be put into use noblesse and chen 1997 this allows to express the wave potential in double integral form so that both terms in eq 10 are compatible and to define the region where the local flow component is significant the resulting expressions for the wave and local flow potentials can be given as follows noblesse 2001 11a c ξ ϕ w ξ i d 0 d 0 sgn d f erf θ a d e i φ d s 11b c ξ ϕ l ξ 1 π 1 d a d 0 e a d 0 e i φ d α d β here erf is the error function the localizing function e and the corresponding localizing effect on wave potential θ are assigned to each dispersion curve they are defined as 12a e d l δ d e σ 2 l 2 δ 2 12b θ sgn δ d δ φ δ 2 σ δ and l represent a roughly orthogonal vector to a dispersion curve and the distance from the dispersion curve in the direction of δ in the fourier plane respectively δ and σ determine the shape and width of the dispersion strip δ can be related to the curvature k of the dispersion curve by δ 1 μ 2 k 2 where the real valued function μ 0 should be considered for dispersion curves with vanishing curvature if δ d d then sgn δ d 1 and δ φ ξ d α η d β d thus eq 12b can be given as 13 θ ξ d α η d β 2 σ k d the subscript d 0 in eq 11b states that all related terms are computed at a dispersion curve with the exception l in eq 12a which is the distance with respect to a dispersion curve the summation includes all dispersion curves as before the parameter σ and the function k resolve the fourier plane into inside and outside regions of dispersion strips and also divide the flow region into a far field zone where expression 11a becomes identical to the far field approximation 9 and a near field zone where the local flow is effective considering that erf θ sgn ξ d α η d β as ρ θ 2 specifies the transition from the near to far field as can be seen from eq 13 θ is proportional to ρ 2 σ k hence by taking σ π 2 for the field within a wavelength λ with respect to a source point located at origin i e ρ λ 2 π k the near field region is determined by k 1 k in other words σ π 2 and k 1 k roughly sets the near field region as one wavelength the extent of near field can be adjusted by tuning σ which will also alter the resulting flow components since both the wave and local flow potentials depend on it however the total flow indifferent to value of σ and remains the same noblesse et al 1999 observing the variation of e may give additional insight for the behavior in fourier plane according to eq 11b there is no contribution to local flow for e 1 i e within a dispersion strip determined by l for a given σ in eq 12a for all α β outside the dispersion strips and with increasing l e quickly descends and becomes practically zero the larger the value of σ the narrower the dispersion strip and the larger the extent of the near field region this implies that the near field region diminishes for σ 0 and the far field approximation represents the flow as a side note since e 1 at a dispersion curve the integrand of the double integral in eq 11b is now continuous over the whole fourier plane it should be pointed that when the boundary surface is partitioned into elements as will be discussed in section 3 the absolute position of a field point is replaced by the position with respect to the source point it is interacting hence the given argument for the physical space is still valid for time harmonic flows without forward speed the dispersion relation k f 2 defines a single closed curve a circle of radius f 2 yielding ring waves so the fourier plane can be represented with polar coordinates k θ expressing the fourier variables as α β k cos θ sin θ and considering that the radius of curvature 1 k f 2 then θ f 2 φ 2 σ e e τ with φ ξ cos θ η sin θ τ σ 2 1 k f 2 2 from eqs 11 the wave and local flow components become 14a c ξ ϕ w ξ i f 2 π π erf f 2 φ 2 σ 1 s e f 2 ζ i φ d θ 14b c ξ

sin θ and the spectrum function with the index d is evaluated at the dispersion curve i e for α β f 2 cos θ sin θ furthermore the relation s α β s α β is employed where s is the conjugate of s and μ is avoided owing to the always positive curvature in accordance with the definition of the free surface green function and given fourier kochin decomposition of the free surface effects the diffracted and radiated time harmonic flow due to a stationary floating body can be given as 15 ϕ ϕ r ϕ r ϕ w ϕ l here ϕ r and ϕ r denote the flow components due to the rankine components 1 r and 1 r of the free surface green function respectively hydrodynamic forces and dynamic response using the bernoulli s equation with neglecting the second order and hydrostatic terms the unsteady fluid pressure p can be given as 16 p ρ f φ t i ω ρ f φ i φ s i 1 n m φ i p i e i ω t here the decomposed form of the velocity potential and the series expansion 2 for the radiation term are used along with incident waves of unit amplitude and ρ f is the fluid density hereafter all symbols for time harmonic variables will also indicate their amplitudes and n m denotes the total number of considered modes rigid and elastic for regular waves propagating in deep water as in this study φ i i g ω e k z i x cos γ y sin γ with γ denoting the direction of the waves with respect to the x axis the ith component of the generalized fluid forces acting on the floating structure is defined as 17 f i σ p w i d a f i w f i r where f i w and f i r represent the wave exciting and radiation forces respectively they are given as 18a f i w i ω ρ f σ w i φ i φ s d a 18b f i r i ω ρ f j 1 n m p j σ w i φ j d a by using the haskind relations newman 1977 f i w can be expressed in a form independent of the diffraction potential hence without solving the diffraction problem provided that the radiation potential is available furthermore considering that φ r is a complex valued function and also recalling eq 3 that substitutes w for q in eqs 4 8 and transfers the i ω factor to φ r eqs 18 can be written as 19a f i w i ω ρ f σ φ i w i φ i φ i n d a 19b f i r j 1 n m ω 2 a i j i ω b i j p j here a i j and b i j are the generalized added mass and hydrodynamic damping coefficients respectively that are defined by 20a a i j ρ f σ w i ℜ φ j d a 20b b i j ρ f ω σ w i ℑ φ j d a in eqs 19 and below φ i is taken as i ω φ i to expose the explicit dependence on i ω ℑ in eq 20b denotes the imaginary part of its argument using the wave excitation and radiation forces from eqs 19 the equation of motion for the floating structure that is subjected to regular waves of frequency ω can be written as 21 j 1 n m ω 2 m i j a i j i ω b i j k i j c i j p j f i w i 1 n m here m i j and k i j represent the inertia and elastic stiffness of the structure respectively and c i j denotes the hydrostatic restoring force structural damping is neglected the dynamic response of the structure can be obtained by substituting the solution p from 21 into the modal expansion 1 for each wave frequency 3 numerical implementation the solution of the boundary integral equation 4 accounting for the rankine components of the green function and for the fourier kochin distributions defined by the fourier integrals 14 for a floating body of general shape requires the boundary surface σ to be idealized using surface elements over which the potential and flux distributions are interpolated in terms of shape functions and nodal values for the ith boundary element corresponding representations ϕ i and q i can be given as 22 ϕ i s q i s j 1 n i ϕ i j q i j n j s where n i denotes the number of nodal points assigned to the ith element ϕ i j and q i j represent the potential and flux values for the j th node of the element respectively n j represents the associated shape functions and s s t stands for the coordinate system local to the element in eq 22 and hereafter all quantities are taken as non dimensional applying this scheme to the spectrum functions is trivial yet more complicated compared to the classical solution assume that the wave spectrum function s representing the surface integration of elementary waves has the form 23 s σ χ x d a here q ϕ i α n x i β n y k n z obtained from eq 8 denotes the part of the integrand that does not depend on x explicitly the term is related with both the unknown field of ϕ and known quantities in terms of body motion for the radiation problem hence from eq 3 it has the implicit form i ω w ϕ where the subscripts mark the associations by defining over an element in the same way as eq 22 i e i j 1 n i i j n j and similarly representing x s becomes a collection of element spectrum functions for the ith element substituted by a generic quadrilateral parent element it is given by 24 s i j 1 n i i j 1 1 1 1 n j s χ x s j s d s d t where j s is the jacobian of the transformation from x to s there is one small caveat in eq 24 that i j involves the fourier variables α β in fourier kochin representation 15 of the diffracted radiated flow the fourier components ϕ w and ϕ l are computed using spectrum functions whereas the direct approach is preferred for the rankine components since spectrum functions are free from singularity or near singularity conditions relatively few number of gauss points is sufficient to achieve high precision numerical quadrature which is not the case for the direct solution there is a drawback however that the spectrum functions feed fourier integrals hence they depend on fourier variables they are computed for each α β pair nevertheless ϕ w is determined by a single fourier integral about a circle as given with eq 14a and ϕ l rapidly decays as k thus the k integral in eq 14b is effective within a limited region furthermore once the element spectrum functions are obtained they can be used for each node pair when constructing the influence coefficients of the boundary element solution another reservation the rapid oscillations of the wave function in eq 24 for large values of x that may enforce using special quadrature schemes can be avoided by slightly modifying the form of the wave function rather than direct use of the global position over an element we can make use of the element wise position and express the element spectrum function as 25 s i j 1 n i i j χ x j s i j with 26 s i j 1 1 1 1 n j χ x x j j d s d t here χ x j e k z j i α x j β y j and χ x x j e k z i i α x i β y i are the wave functions due to the j th node and due to the position with respect to j th node over the element respectively with x j x j y j k j denoting the position of the j th node and x i y i z i j 1 n i x j n j x j using eqs 4 14 22 and 25 the boundary integral equation for time harmonic flow without forward speed can be discretized as 27 c ξ ϕ ξ i 1 n e j 1 n i q i j g i j ϕ i j h i j i f 2 π π d θ i 1 n e j 1 n i erf f 2 φ j 2 σ 1 s i j e f 2 z j i φ j q i j f 2 λ i j ϕ i j 2 π f 2

scheme abramowitz and stegun 1964 by applying eq 27 for each node of the discretization and considering the boundary condition 3 in terms of principal modes the following set of algebraic equations

implied with the implicit form the linear system 30 is set up for each principal mode and each wave frequency the radiation force coefficients a i j and b i j can be given from eqs 20 as 31 a i j b i

a hemisphere and a vertical cylinder as primitive cases and a scaled frigate model as a more realistic case for the primitive bodies only the rigid body modes are considered for the frigate model elastic modes are also adopted for all problems the predictions by the fourier kochin approach are verified against the results based on the classical approach i e direct solution of the boundary integral equation using the free surface green function the radiation forces in terms of added mass and hydrodynamic damping coefficients wave excitation forces and transfer functions are provided as the assessment data the free surface green function used for the direct solution is calculated based on the expressions proposed by telste and noblesse 1986 accordingly the green function is decomposed into rankine wave and near field components as in this study for fourier kochin representation the rankine component is the r function as given here the wave component corresponds to eq 14a for σ 0 and the near field component is approximated depending on the position of the field point with respect to the source it is well known that the numerical solution of the boundary integral equation 4 generates erroneous results at specific frequencies which correspond to the eigenvalues of the homogeneous dirichlet problem for the associated fictitious internal flow this mathematical flaw is due to the fact that the green function satisfies the free surface boundary condition over the whole free surface plane both external and internal to the floating body even if the internal fluid is non physical the fourier kochin framework adopts an indirect approach yet it relies on the free surface green function so it is also exposed to this irregular frequency effects among the methods that have been proposed for suppressing the irregular frequencies the extended boundary integral equation method lee et al 1996 is applied it can be readily integrated into the existing solutions indirect and direct by including the internal free surface into the solution domain and applying the rigid wall boundary condition over it quadratic six and eight noded isoparametric elements are adopted for the boundary element approximations here the idealizations are identified as nn nnf where nn and nnf are the number of nodes distributed over the wetted surface and internal free surface respectively the free terms c ξ for the wetted surface nodes are computed by considering the volume enclosed by the wetted surface and internal free surface and applying a constant flux over its whole surface for ω 0 i e by taking g 1 4 π r the free terms for the internal free surface nodes are taken as 1 as prescribed by the extended boundary integral equation method the added mass and hydrodynamic damping coefficients are given in their standard non dimensional form for the rigid body modes i e for translations as a δ and b δ ω and for rotations as a δ l and b δ ω l with δ and l denoting the body displacement and reference length respectively the elastic modes are mass normalized and related coefficients are given in dimensional form e g added mass coefficients in kg m 2 correspond to unit modal mass the non dimensional frequency f ω g l represents the horizontal axis in the plots if the magnitude of the displayed data is in the order of 10 2 or smaller it is multiplied accordingly as given in the axis label since the main goal here is demonstrating the practical application of the fourier kochin approach as well as confirming its predictions no convergence study is explicitly presented the results based on the fourier kochin theory and the classical approach are abbreviated as fk and wg for wave green respectively 4 1 hemisphere the diagonal components of the added mass and hydrodynamic damping matrices that are associated with the surge and heave motions of a floating hemisphere are given in figs 1 and 2 respectively l is taken as the radius of the hemisphere 1 m and the applied idealization is 465 279 fk and wg results are in very good agreement along the entire frequency range yet very small differences can be observed for the hydrodynamic damping coefficient due to heave for high frequencies 4 2 vertical cylinder the second studied floating body of primitive shape is an oscillating vertical cylinder of circular cross section the length to radius ratio of the cylinder is 2 reference length is taken as the radius 1 m and the applied idealization is 353 161 the added mass and hydrodynamic damping coefficients for the surge heave and roll motions of the cylinder are presented in figs 3 and 4 respectively fk and wg predictions are in overall agreement with almost exact match 4 3 scaled frigate model as the final and more realistic case a 1 3 scaled frigate model a modified form of dtmb 5415 is investigated both the rigid body and elastic modes are considered but with two different idealizations the hydroelastic analysis requires finer discretization main particulars and material properties of the model are given in tables 1 and 2 respectively material stiffness is reduced through elastic modulus with the intention of lowering the natural frequencies to the order of the wave frequencies studied at least for some of the modes views of the wetted surface and internal free surface for the first boundary element idealization are given in fig 5 this idealization adopted for the rigid body modes is 4286 1739 the midship section and the bottom and profile views of the structural model that is used for the hydroelastic analysis are shown in fig 6 the corresponding boundary element idealization is 6653 3517 the reference length is taken as the model length for all computations natural frequencies along with the distortion types of the associated mode shapes for the first eight modes are presented in table 3 vb hb and t denote vertical bending horizontal bending and torsion respectively as seen some mode shapes are identified as a combination of two different distortion types the first five mode shapes are given in fig 7 where different views are selected to make the distortions more apparent the radiation coefficients for the rigid body modes of the frigate model are compared in figs 8 9 indirect fk and direct wg predictions fit fairly along the frequency range unlike the simpler cases however for roll and with a lesser extent for surge the fk values exhibit slight discrepancies with respect to the wg values at higher frequencies which are more visible for the hydrodynamic damping coefficients fig 9 the radiation coefficients due to the first six elastic modes are additionally presented in figs 10 11 the differences between the two sets of results at higher frequencies become more apparent now especially for the hydrodynamic damping despite the overall close agreement two factors can be related with these small yet noticeable differences i even though not presented here when suppression is not applied frequent irregular frequency effects are monitored along the examined frequency range for both type of analysis which are more significant for hydrodynamic damping it is well known that most of the irregular frequency removal techniques could defer the irregular frequencies and reduce their effects yet could not completely eliminate them e g see tunca et al 2018 for the performance of the extended boundary integral equation method on the direct approach the fluctuations of the radiation coefficients for both the rigid body and elastic modes are observed about two of the irregular frequencies 13 06 and 14 98 corresponding to 6 86 and 7 86 in rad s for both solution approaches direct and indirect the extended boundary integral equation formulation seems to be not sufficiently effective for high frequencies hence due to the high condition number of the discrete boundary element systems about the irregular frequencies even small valued differences may lead to relatively large output differences in fact for some modes fk results are less influenced by the irregular frequencies and for others wg results ii depending on the complexity of the flow field about the oscillating body the number of quadrature points used for the numerical evaluation of the angular and radial integrals that sweep the dispersion curve and fourier plane for the fourier kochin components expressed by eqs 14 may vary e g the number of gauss points required for an accurate representation of the wave potential is higher for the frigate model compared to the vertical cylinder in fig 12 the hydrodynamic damping coefficients due to surge and roll motions and due to 2nd and 3rd vertical bending modes the two modes that are more noticeable in figs 9 11 of the frigate model are reproduced again this time considering three different implementations of the numerical quadrature for the angular integral over the dispersion curve related with the wave component 80 100 and 120 quadrature points for the rigid body modes and 120 140 and 160 quadrature points for the elastic modes are adopted recalling that for zero forward speed the dispersion curve corresponds to a circle of radius f 2 a consistent approximation for higher frequencies can be achieved by increasing the number quadrature points the 120 point and 160 point quadrature however are clearly not sufficient for the complete frequency interval investigated the gauss and gauss laguerre quadrature associated with the angular and semi infinite radial integrals of the near field potential component respectively also display similar behavior for attaining convergent results with the increasing frequency yet the required order of quadrature is generally more limited compared to the one for the wave component the wave excitation forces due to the rigid body modes of the frigate model for quarter γ 45 and head waves γ 180 are compared in figs 13 and 14 respectively for quarter waves all rigid body modes for head waves only surge heave and pitch the modes for which the forces have notable magnitude are presented they are given in non dimensional form using the reference values f r ρ f g ζ l b for force f and m r ρ g ζ l b d for moment m type excitation where l b d and ζ denote the length breadth and draft of the frigate model table 1 and the amplitude of the incident waves respectively the wave excitation forces for the first six elastic modes are also given in fig 15 with their values both type of results not surprisingly resemble the radiation forces by their overall agreement and small differences since they are essentially based on the radiation coefficients through the haskind relations i e eq 19a fk and wg results are generally in perfect match yet the traces of the irregularities observed for the radiation coefficients can be seen in the high frequency region to indirectly confirm the computations the diffraction problem is additionally solved for quarter waves and the resulting wave forces are compared with the haskind relation based values in fig 16 for the elastic modes here wg results which are practically same as the fk results are used the two sets nicely fit but the haskind relation can be said to offer better performance for high frequencies as the final assessment the transfer functions corresponding to heave roll and pitch motions of the frigate model are presented in fig 17 for γ 45 following the fine agreement for the radiation coefficients and wave forces the two solution approaches predict identical responses as can be expected 5 conclusion the fourier kochin theory of free surface flows noblesse 2001 is considered for time harmonic wave radiation and diffraction problems about stationary floating bodies the key principles of the fourier kochin theory are switching the order of the fundamental tasks within the classical solution of the green function based boundary integral representations of free surface flows evaluation of the green function and its gradient and their subsequent integration over the boundary surface and delicately decomposing the flow field into wave and non oscillatory local flow components by implementing a higher order numerical approximation along with the use of extended boundary integral equation method for removal of the irregular frequency effects three different body forms a hemisphere a vertical cylinder and a 1 3 scaled frigate model are used as the test cases for the application of the theory the predictions in terms of radiation coefficients wave excitation forces and transfer functions are verified against the results obtained using the classical approach the given mathematical model in section 2 and implementation scheme in section 3 allow application for both rigid body and elastic modes hence by constructing a structural representation of the frigate model and evaluating its dynamic characteristics through finite element analysis hydroelastic assessments are also performed some conclusions can be drawn as follows when the floating body is taken stationary as in the present work the wave body interaction problem has a standard unambiguous solution and the fourier kochin theory may not seem worthwhile to adopt the indirect solution approach awarded by the fourier kochin theory however has profound consequences for the analytic and numerical analysis of the free surface flows resulting from the wave body interactions the space integration is transformed into computation of elementary wave distributions over the boundary surface and as a result the fourier integral becomes finite over the free surface it should be pointed out that both the space and fourier integration become quite involved in the classical treatment of the problem when the body advances in regular waves this is where the real gain of the indirect approach lies the fourier kochin framework readily captures the radiated flow about oscillating primitive floating bodies the results for the added mass and hydrodynamic damping coefficients match perfectly with the values obtained by the classical solution for the entire frequency range considered when the body form is complicated however despite usually achieving identical predictions irregularities especially at high frequencies and more apparent for hydrodynamic damping coefficients are also observed two possible explanations can be given i it is well known that with increasing frequency and depending on the mesh fineness the extended boundary integral equation formulation may become insufficient for suppressing the irregular frequencies the high condition number of the resulting discrete system about the irregular frequencies can develop the differences between the two group of results ii the adopted number of quadrature points may offer insufficient approximation for the integral expressions defining the wave and local flow components of the fourier kochin representation two critiques can be directed to the fourier kochin approach considering its computational aspects i both the wave and near field components of the flow field contain integration of oscillatory functions in the fourier plane the required number of quadrature points for achieving accurate representations depend on the complexity of the body form but also varies with the wave frequency hence pursuing an optimal number of quadrature points for specific frequency ranges rather than adopting an unnecessarily high number is critical from this point of view applying an adaptive scheme for numerical quadrature can be convenient ii compared to the classical solution that benefits from effective approximations for the pulsating free surface green function the excessive amount of numerical operations enforced by the fourier kochin approach is a serious flaw the whole solution process however is suitable for a parallel computation environment and substantial acceleration has been achieved with an openmp

20883,the liquid impact induced by slamming in the membrane type tank is an important issue for the design of floating liquefied natural gas flng facilities the free surface entrapping air may easily happen under shallow water condition in the tank which could result in structural local failure studying the effect of entrapped air on slamming load is essential to understand the air free surface elastic structure interaction thus a series of experiments are designed and conducted in an elastic rectangular tank under shallow water condition the evolution of free surface and the development of entrapped air are analyzed quantitatively furthermore both impact load and structural response are measured and studied in the spatial and temporal distribution under shallow water condition the results show that the air cavity plays a cushion role between free surface and elastic wall therefore the impact mode is changed from liquid direct impact to liquid indirect impact the existence of the air cavity leads to a significant reduction of the maximum slamming load and structural response but an increase in the pressure impulse in spatial distribution it is suggested to consider the effect of the entrapped air on the determination of the slamming load for the design of super large lng tanks in the offshore engineering keywords entrapped air liquid slamming hydroelasticity slamming pressure structural response 1 introduction the challenges to design floating liquefied natural gas flng facilities have attracted lots of attention from both industry and academia the flng facilities are used for production liquidation storage and unloading offshore liquefied natural gas lng because of the super tank sizes and no filling restrictions excessive slamming loads might be generated and result in structural local damage during flng service thus the impact load of liquid slamming on the elastic tank wall is one of the main loads in the design of super large tanks in offshore engineering abramson et al 1974 gavory and de seze 2009 zhao and mcphail 2017 lu et al 2018 yu et al 2019 luo et al 2020 due to its large volume and size the tank in reality is elastic and the tank wall will dynamically respond to the slamming load the liquid structure interaction plays an important role in the determination of the slamming load due to the elasticity of the membrane type containment system jiang et al 2015 ryu et al 2016 strand and faltinsen 2017 akkaoui et al 2019 the air is very common to be entrapped during the free surface motion in the tank when the air is entrapped during liquid slamming the compressibility of the trapped air and its interaction between the free surface and structure is important graczyk et al 2012 lugni et al 2014 because of the complicated physical phenomena during liquid slamming the interactions of air liquid air structure and liquid structure have been attracted lots of attention zhang and suzuki 2007 yu et al 2020 paik and carrica 2014 xue et al 2017 2019 sun et al 2019 lu et al 2020 the interaction between air and liquid has been investigated by many researchers for example bagnold 1939 studied the impact of a liquid trapping an air pocket with a one dimensional piston model and found that the compressibility of air leads to the appearance of pressure peaks the research progress of air entrainment mechanisms in plunging jets and breaking waves has been reviewed by kiger and duncan 2012 and the air entraining flows such as plunging breaking waves were investigated to gain insight into air entrainment mechanisms the relationship between the shape of air cavity and free surface tension is emphasized the above studies mainly focus on the interaction between air and free surface but form the design of super large storage tanks point of view it is important to consider the structure of the tank during liquid slamming the interactions of air structure and liquid structure have been also investigated by theoretical numerical and experimental methods but most of them focus on the rigid structure dias and ghidaglia 2018 for example cooker and peregrine 1995 proposed a pressure impulse theory to investigate the pressure characteristics when the wave impacts on a rigid wall then wood et al 2000 extended the theory with a trapped air pocket and found that the presence of an air pocket can lead to a higher pressure impulse recently based on potential flow theory song and zhang 2019 studied the wave impact on a rigid wall with and without air cavity entrapment they found that the size and shape of air cavity have a great influence on the pressure gradient near the intersection line of the cavity on the rigid wall flip through was experimentally found to be the most severe impact type lugni et al 2006 2010a 2010b the evolution of air cavity during liquid slamming on the rigid wall was studied kinematically and dynamically under depressurized condition lugni et al 2010a lugni et al 2010b it is emphasized that the existence of the air cavity could affect the slamming load on the rigid wall and the evolution of free surface thus the importance of the hydroelasticity liquid elastic structure during liquid slamming should be taken into account dias and ghidaglia 2018 however there are fewer studies on hydroelasticity in the sloshing tank the role of the hydroelasticity during the evolution of flip through in a sloshing tank with a deformable plate was experimentally analyzed by lugni et al 2014 three different regimes were proposed during the hydroelastic evolution furthermore it is found that the young s modulus of tank walls could influence the impact pressure its duration and the dynamic responses of the structures zhang and wan 2018 the entrapped air might affect the characterization of the hydrodynamic loads during the hydroelastic evolution in the sloshing tank which needs systematically studied zhang and wan 2018 dias and ghidaglia 2018 however the studies on the interaction of air liquid elastic structure are still rare therefore it is necessary to investigate the effect of entrapped air on hydroelasticity during the liquid slamming the main purpose of this paper is to study the role of the entrapped air on the hydroelasticity induced by liquid slamming a series of experiments are conducted in a nearly 2d elastic tank under a shallow water condition the free surface evolution is described qualitatively which is important to understand the interaction of air liquid elastic structure during the liquid slamming with and without entrapped air understanding the role of entrapped air on liquid slamming is of great significance for the design of super large lng tanks in the offshore engineering this paper is organized as follows the experimental setup including the instrumentations and experimental procedures is described in section ii in section iii the kinematic flow field is discussed for the liquid slamming with and without entrapped air then the effect of entrapped air on the slamming pressure pressure impulse and structural response is analyzed in detail 2 experimental setup the experiments were performed on the six degree of freedom platform in the state key laboratory of structure analysis of industrial equipment at dalian university of technology dut china a nearly two dimensional 2d rectangular tank is made with the internal length l 1000 mm width b 100 mm and height h 1000 mm respectively the experimental setup and the model tank are shown in fig 1 the tank is made of 12 mm thick acrylic plate except two vertical sidewalls the vertical sidewall of the tank is designed elastically in order to study the role of entrapped air on structural response for meeting the requirements of elastic similarity the lowest bending mode of the vertical sidewall should keep the same in the full scale and model scale by froude scaling faltinsen and timokha 2009 according to lugni et al 2014 2 7 mm elastic aluminum plate was used to satisfy the elastic similarity special fixture is made to connect the tank and the elastic sidewalls which makes sure the free vibration of the sidewalls during slamming the material tests of elastic plate have been performed in the fundamental mechanics testing center at dalian university of technology dut to determine the young s modulus of the elastic plate and e 210 mpa is obtained the tank mounted at the center of the plane of the six degree of freedom platform is forced to move along the surge direction see eq 1 1 x η 2 a sin 2 π t t where η 2a is the excitation amplitude t is the experimental time and t is the excitation period of the prescribed motion in order to prevent the occurrence of tank roof impact a shallow intermediate liquid depth h 125 mm is applied the ullage pressure inside the tank is atmospheric for all experimental tests and the liquid used in all experimental tests is fresh water with room temperature in order to evaluate the hydroelasticity during liquid slamming both the slamming pressure and the structural response are measured eight pressure transducers and ten strain gauges were installed on the central line of the sidewall according to the previous research work lugni et al 2014 wei et al 2015 and the results of numerical simulation the locations of monitoring sensors are determined as shown in fig 2 according to the previous research work wei et al 2014 2015 the static and dynamic calibration of the pressure transducers the range of the pressure transducers in the experiment is 40 kpa furthermore the natural frequency of the pressure transducers is 1000 khz which is far away from the oscillation frequency of the elastic sidewall therefore the selected pressure transducers could work well with high precision for liquid slamming the strain gauge has relative high precision up to 0 5 micro strain in order to guarantee the precision of the stain gauges the static calibration experiment of the strain gauges was carried out in the calibration experiment we installed strain gauges on a cantilever beam and measured the value of the cantilever beam by adding different weights gradually furthermore in order to reduce the effect of the ambient environment on the result the compensating strain gauge was installed for the working strain gauge the systematic error of the strain gauge in the calibration experiment is less than 3 a single degree of free displacement meter was installed on the platform to check the desired surge motion of the platform its direction is parallel to the direction of tank motion the sampling frequency and the procedures for calibrating pressure sensors for liquid slamming have been investigated in our previous research work wei et al 2014 the rise time of slamming load is very short generally in the order of milliseconds according to nyquist sampling theory the sampling frequency of the data acquisition instrument is set to at least 2 times of the highest characteristic frequency in the actual measurement therefore it is suggested that the sampling frequency of transducers and data acquisition system should be at least 5 khz based on the previous study the sampling frequency of 10 khz for the data acquisition system in this study is enough to meet the accuracy of experimental measurement to qualitatively visualize the evolution of the local flow field during the liquid slamming a high speed camera with 100 fps at a resolution of 3000 1500 was arranged not far in front of the right vertical sidewall furthermore a low speed camera with 25 fps at a resolution of 1920 1080 was also used to capture the overall sloshing phenomena and it is placed far in front of the entire tank the arrangement of the cameras is shown in fig 1 the experimental procedures are summarized as follows first the reliability of the experimental setup is verified during preparation by comparing the slamming load with other experimental results lugni et al 2006 additionally it is important to check the designed locations of experimental sensors during experimental preparation in order to properly capture the trend and extreme characteristic of liquid slamming subsequently a series of experiments were conducted in order to compare the effect of the entrapped air on the hydroelasticity induced by liquid slamming it is required to import the same energy to the whole system the phenomena with and without entrapped air should occur in the different stages of the sloshing wave evolution under the same excitation several excitation parameters different combinations of η 2a and t were tested and the excitation parameters η 2a 30 mm and t 1 60 s was found to satisfy the experimental requirement during experimental preparation it is found that flip through is always occurring in the fourth cycle of oscillation and the wave front entrapping air happens in the subsequent oscillation cycle for contrastive analysis the test cases of wave front with and without entrapped air are named as case i and case ii respectively due to the stochastic behavior of slamming load all experimental tests under the same test condition were performed at least three times 3 results and discussions 3 1 the effect of entrapped air on the free surface evolution in this section in order to quantitatively describe the evolution of free surface during the liquid slamming the kinematic parameter of the wave front with entrapped air is schematically shown in fig 3 the parameters including the area a 0 the diameter d 0 impact angle α and velocities of wave crest and trough are defined a 0 is the area of the region of air enclosed at the moment of jet impact d 0 is the diameter of the region α is determined from the jet centerline red dashed line in fig 3 and the vertical sidewall v h and v v are the velocities of the horizontal velocity of the advancing wave crest and the rising velocity of the wave trough the evolution of free surface scenarios in the early stage of liquid slamming for the wave front with entrapped air are shown in fig 4 an advancing wave propagates toward the right sidewall of the tank as shown in frame a and b then a distinct plunging wave is formed and moves rapidly forward see frame c and d and a local fragmentation is formed at the wave crest simultaneously the wave crest is moving approximately parallel to the horizontal direction before it impacts on the vertical sidewall the horizontal and vertical velocity of the wave crest can be roughly calculated as 2 00 m s and 0 50 m s from the frames respectively during the wave propagating the horizontal velocity of wave crest is larger than the vertical rising velocity of the wave trough i e the horizontal velocity of the jet is 2 10 m s and the vertical rising velocity of the wave trough is about 2 00 m s when the jet impact on the sidewall therefore when the wave crest just reached the vertical sidewall the wave trough does not arrive the impact point as shown in frame e and f there exists a significant air cavity entrapped by the wave crest trough and the vertical sidewall meanwhile the jet impacts the sidewall with an impact angle α from 70 to 80 which is determined from the jet centerline and the vertical sidewall according to lugni et al 2010 a b the evolution of the free surface with entrapped air at this moment is in the first and second stage during the entire free surface evolution i e the closure of the air cavity against the sidewall see frame e and the isotropic compression of the air cavity see frame f furthermore as two dimensional condition is assumed the initial area denoted a 0 and the initial vertical diameter denoted d 0 of the air cavity is approximate 0 0016 m2 and 0 07 m in frame e respectively the impact point on the sidewall by the wave crest is in the range of 190 mm 200 mm from the bottom of the tank then due to the compression of air by the successive wave crest and the rising wave trough the air cavity starts to escape from the gap between the top of the wave crest and vertical sidewall therefore the wave impacts on the sidewall with air water mixture at the range of 170 mm 200 mm at the same time several wave splashes are formed against the vertical sidewall around the impact point during the instantaneous moment just before impact the area a 0 of entrapped air becomes smaller a 0 0 0006 m2 in frame f until the rising wave trough arrives at the impact point completely a 0 0 m2 in frame g and h in the later stage of the liquid slamming of the free surface evolution for wave front with entrapped air there is a distinct upward jet and more wave splashes are formed as shown in frame a and b in fig 5 and the air cavity is separated into several small bubbles during the later stage of liquid slamming the evolution of free surface with entrapped air is consistent with the third and fourth stage of entire free surface evolution in the research of lugni et al 2010 a b i e the anisotropic compression expansion of the entrapped air and the rise of entrapped air along the vertical sidewall during the later stage of liquid slamming the vertical velocity of the wave reduces gradually until zero which means the kinetic energy of the wave gradually turns into the potential energy of the liquid the highest vertical position of the wave arrived is around 430 mm after that the fluid begins to fall down along the sidewall due to the gravity the images are not listed the evolution of free surface scenarios in the early stage of liquid slamming for the wave front without entrapped air i e flip through are shown in fig 6 similar to the above condition an advancing wave propagates toward the right sidewall of the tank then the impinging wave is formed and moves rapidly forward as shown in frame b c d and e from frame d and e the horizontal and vertical velocity of the wave crest can be roughly calculated as 1 50 m s and 1 25 m s respectively and at this moment a local fragmentation is formed at the wave crest after 0 01 s see frame f both the wave crest and the wave trough travel the same distance corresponding to 0 02 m indicating that the wave crest and trough have the same velocity before impact occurs i e 2 00 m s therefore the wave crest and trough gradually focus on the impact point and impact on the sidewall directly as shown in frame g and h meantime the wave impacts the sidewall at an impact α from 60 to 70 the range of the impact point is in the range of 210 mm 220 mm from the bottom of the tank in the later stage of the flip through a distinct upward jet is produced and some wave splashes are formed as shown in frame a and b in fig 7 then the kinetic energy of the wave is all converted into potential energy and the wave eventually arrives at 440 mm finally the wave begins to fall down along the vertical sidewall the images are not listed due to no air is introduced into the free surface there are no bubbles in the later stage of flip through the values of these kinematic parameters of case i with air and case ii flip through are listed in table 1 due to inexistence of the entrapped air in case ii the values of parameters a 0 and d 0 are none the impact angle and the position of impact point are different in case i and case ii furthermore before liquid impact the velocities of wave crest and trough are nearly same in different cases according to the above description about the evolution of the free surface there are some differences between case i with air and case ii flip through in case i the crest reaches the impact point and the trough arrived later but in case ii the wave crest and trough reach the impact point at the same time therefore the air cavity is produced in case i and it changes the impact mode from the liquid direct impact case ii to liquid indirect impact case i furthermore due to the existence of entrapped air the position of the impact point and impact angle are changed impact angle α in case i is larger than that in case ii which leads to the range of impact point is lower than that in case ii 3 2 the effect of entrapped air on slamming pressure in order to evaluate the slamming load on the sidewall during the slamming event the slamming pressure is measured and analyzed the slamming pressure is highly localized in both space and time domain which has been reported by many researches therefore the spatial distribution and temporal history of the slamming pressure is an essential issue to understand the role of entrapped air in liquid slamming the mean maximum pressures at different locations on the sidewall which is calculated by four identical independent experimental tests are presented in fig 8 for case i with air and case ii flip through the horizontal coordinate is the dimensionless slamming pressure p max ρgh where ρgh is the hydrostatic pressure the vertical coordinate is the dimensionless position z h of the pressure measuring points and h is the height of the static water level the maximum slamming pressures are found to occur at 170 mm in case i and at 190 mm in case ii the results are consistent with the above discussion i e the position of the impact point has moved down due to the existence of the entrapped air and there is a dramatic reduction of the slamming pressure due to the entrapped air in order to quantitatively analyze the effect of the entrapped air on the slamming pressure at different locations the descent rate dr of pressure values are listed in table 2 in table 2 dr is calculated by the eq 2 2 d r c a s e i i c a s e i c a s e i i from table 2 it is clearly seen that the position of maximum descent rate is at p5 and p6 up to 67 18 and 73 64 respectively the results show that the slamming pressure around the air cavity is significantly affected by the presence of the entrapped air since the location of p8 is not the impact region the entrapped air has little influence on the slamming pressure at this point because the values of maximum pressure at the measuring points drop significantly the most representative cases for p5 and p6 are selected for detail analysis figs 9 and 10 show the pressure time history of case i with air and case ii flip through the pressure values are the average of four identical independent experimental tests from the figures there is a significant reduction around the peak pressure for slamming in case i compared to that in case ii furthermore it is observed that there is an increase of rise time from zero to peak pressure in case i comparing with case ii the most noticeable phenomenon is that the pressure time history of case ii has an obvious oscillation this is because the interaction between flow and the elastic plate which is different from the rigid case from the comparison of the pressure time history and the evolution of the free surface the role of the entrapped air acts as an air cushion to reduce the interaction between the liquid and structure 3 3 the effect of entrapped air on pressure impulse the slamming pressure impulse i has been proposed as a relatively well behaved quantity for structural analysis thus in this paper the slamming pressure impulse is used to assess the role of entrapped air on liquid slamming as well the impulse value is integrated over the duration of the measured pressure cooker and peregrine 1995 due to the difficulty of determining the duration time the rise time and duration corresponding to a simplified triangular history of the slamming pressure are defined in fig 11 the mean pressure impulses along the vertical sidewall for case i with air and case ii flip through are shown in fig 12 the results show that the impulse value in case i is much larger than that in case ii when the position is lower than 170 mm the trend of impulse is different with the spatial distribution of maximum pressure the reason is also discussed in section 3 2 i e the oscillation of the entrapped air significantly increases the duration of the slamming therefore even small slamming pressure could result in large slamming impulse thus it is necessary to comprehensively evaluate the effect of the entrapped air on the slamming load from slamming pressure and its corresponding impulse point of view 3 4 the effect of entrapped air on structural response to investigate the hydroelasticity behavior of the elastic plate during liquid slamming with entrapped air the structural response of vertical sidewall is discussed by means of the measured strain the stress σ is calculated by the equation σ e ε and ε is the measured strain e represents the young modulus of the elastic plate and e 210 mpa is obtained by the material tests in this paper the positive stress is defined as the tensile stress and the negative as the compressive stress the tensile stress and compressive stress are in the tensile and compressive regions of the elastic plate respectively the definitions of the tensile and compressive regions during liquid slamming are schematically shown in fig 13 in this figure the red dashed line represents the deformed sidewall during liquid slamming the spatial distribution and temporal history of the stress are discussed in detail fig 14 illustrates the spatial distribution of the mean maximum stress obtained by three identical independent experimental tests of case i with air and case ii flip through the horizontal coordinate is the structural stress σ the vertical coordinate is the dimensionless position z h the maximum stresses are found to occur at 158 mm in case i and 175 mm in case ii this is because the presence of the entrapped air changes the position of impact point it is observed that there are both positive and negative values at s9 and only negative value is measured at s10 similarly only positive values are obtained at s1 s7 it is indicated that the measuring point s9 is a turning point during the liquid slamming that is to say the stress state at s9 has changed during liquid slamming the position above s9 is in the compressive region while the position of s1 s8 is in the tensile region by comparing the overall trend of the spatial distribution of the maximum stress of case i and case ii the presence of entrapped air can reduce the stress values around the impact point furthermore the maximum stress values at s1 s6 of case i and case ii are almost the same it is indicated the entrapped air has little influence at that position according to the spatial distribution of mean maximum stress the time history at three representative measuring points i e s7 s9 and s10 are selected figs 15 17 show the stress time history of case i with air and case ii flip through the stress values are the average of three identical independent experimental tests at s7 175 mm a relative larger stress value is observed it is indicated the elastic plate is deformed greatly during liquid slamming furthermore an obvious oscillation of stress values is observed at s7 of case ii by calculation the stress oscillation frequency is ascribed to the structural natural frequency the natural frequency of the elastic plate is evaluated by the hammer tests at the turning point s9 208 mm the stress values change from negative to positive the reason for the turning is that s9 feel compressive before wave reaches the impact point while the stress state of elastic plate changes to tensile when the impact occurs since the measuring point s10 is far from the maximum deformation position of the elastic plate the position of s10 is compressive 4 conclusions the liquid impact induced by slamming in the membrane type tank is an important issue for the design of floating liquefied natural gas flng facilities the free surface entrapping air may easily happen under shallow water condition in the tank which could result in structural local failure studying the effect of entrapped air on slamming load is essential to understanding the air free surface elastic structure interaction this paper examined the effect of entrapped air on slamming load and structural response during liquid slamming under shallow water condition a series of experiments have been systematically designed and conducted in a nearly 2d elastic rectangular tank the evolution of kinematic free surface with and without entrapped air are observed and described qualitatively furthermore the role of entrapped air on the slamming pressure pressure impulse and structural response are analyzed in the spatial and temporal distribution the results show that the air cavity plays likely an air cushion during slamming thus the slamming mode is changed from liquid direct impact to liquid indirect impact due to the existence of air cushion the existence of the air cavity leads to a significant reduction of the maximum slamming load and structural response but the oscillation of entrapped air significantly increases the duration of the slamming which causes an increase in the pressure impulse in spatial distribution the experimental results not only reveal the mechanism for the interaction of air liquid structure but also help validate the theoretical and numerical results it is suggested to consider the effect of the entrapped air to determine the slamming

should be increased in order to record the more detail of the interactions between air free surface elastic structures and the thermodynamic of entrapped air is not taken into account in this paper in

20883,the liquid impact induced by slamming in the membrane type tank is an important issue for the design of floating liquefied natural gas flng facilities the free surface entrapping air may easily happen under shallow water condition in the tank which could result in structural local failure studying the effect of entrapped air on slamming load is essential to understand the air free surface elastic structure interaction thus a series of experiments are designed and conducted in an elastic rectangular tank under shallow water condition the evolution of free surface and the development of entrapped air are analyzed quantitatively furthermore both impact load and structural response are measured and studied in the spatial and temporal distribution under shallow water condition the results show that the air cavity plays a cushion role between free surface and elastic wall therefore the impact mode is changed from liquid direct impact to liquid indirect impact the existence of the air cavity leads to a significant reduction of the maximum slamming load and structural response but an increase in the pressure impulse in spatial distribution it is suggested to consider the effect of the entrapped air on the determination of the slamming load for the design of super large lng tanks in the offshore engineering keywords entrapped air liquid slamming hydroelasticity slamming pressure structural response 1 introduction the challenges to design floating liquefied natural gas flng facilities have attracted lots of attention from both industry and academia the flng facilities are used for production liquidation storage and unloading offshore liquefied natural gas lng because of the super tank sizes and no filling restrictions excessive slamming loads might be generated and result in structural local damage during flng service thus the impact load of liquid slamming on the elastic tank wall is one of the main loads in the design of super large tanks in offshore engineering abramson et al 1974 gavory and de seze 2009 zhao and mcphail 2017 lu et al 2018 yu et al 2019 luo et al 2020 due to its large volume and size the tank in reality is elastic and the tank wall will dynamically respond to the slamming load the liquid structure interaction plays an important role in the determination of the slamming load due to the elasticity of the membrane type containment system jiang et al 2015 ryu et al 2016 strand and faltinsen 2017 akkaoui et al 2019 the air is very common to be entrapped during the free surface motion in the tank when the air is entrapped during liquid slamming the compressibility of the trapped air and its interaction between the free surface and structure is important graczyk et al 2012 lugni et al 2014 because of the complicated physical phenomena during liquid slamming the interactions of air liquid air structure and liquid structure have been attracted lots of attention zhang and suzuki 2007 yu et al 2020 paik and carrica 2014 xue et al 2017 2019 sun et al 2019 lu et al 2020 the interaction between air and liquid has been investigated by many researchers for example bagnold 1939 studied the impact of a liquid trapping an air pocket with a one dimensional piston model and found that the compressibility of air leads to the appearance of pressure peaks the research progress of air entrainment mechanisms in plunging jets and breaking waves has been reviewed by kiger and duncan 2012 and the air entraining flows such as plunging breaking waves were investigated to gain insight into air entrainment mechanisms the relationship between the shape of air cavity and free surface tension is emphasized the above studies mainly focus on the interaction between air and free surface but form the design of super large storage tanks point of view it is important to consider the structure of the tank during liquid slamming the interactions of air structure and liquid structure have been also investigated by theoretical numerical and experimental methods but most of them focus on the rigid structure dias and ghidaglia 2018 for example cooker and peregrine 1995 proposed a pressure impulse theory to investigate the pressure characteristics when the wave impacts on a rigid wall then wood et al 2000 extended the theory with a trapped air pocket and found that the presence of an air pocket can lead to a higher pressure impulse recently based on potential flow theory song and zhang 2019 studied the wave impact on a rigid wall with and without air cavity entrapment they found that the size and shape of air cavity have a great influence on the pressure gradient near the intersection line of the cavity on the rigid wall flip through was experimentally found to be the most severe impact type lugni et al 2006 2010a 2010b the evolution of air cavity during liquid slamming on the rigid wall was studied kinematically and dynamically under depressurized condition lugni et al 2010a lugni et al 2010b it is emphasized that the existence of the air cavity could affect the slamming load on the rigid wall and the evolution of free surface thus the importance of the hydroelasticity liquid elastic structure during liquid slamming should be taken into account dias and ghidaglia 2018 however there are fewer studies on hydroelasticity in the sloshing tank the role of the hydroelasticity during the evolution of flip through in a sloshing tank with a deformable plate was experimentally analyzed by lugni et al 2014 three different regimes were proposed during the hydroelastic evolution furthermore it is found that the young s modulus of tank walls could influence the impact pressure its duration and the dynamic responses of the structures zhang and wan 2018 the entrapped air might affect the characterization of the hydrodynamic loads during the hydroelastic evolution in the sloshing tank which needs systematically studied zhang and wan 2018 dias and ghidaglia 2018 however the studies on the interaction of air liquid elastic structure are still rare therefore it is necessary to investigate the effect of entrapped air on hydroelasticity during the liquid slamming the main purpose of this paper is to study the role of the entrapped air on the hydroelasticity induced by liquid slamming a series of experiments are conducted in a nearly 2d elastic tank under a shallow water condition the free surface evolution is described qualitatively which is important to understand the interaction of air liquid elastic structure during the liquid slamming with and without entrapped air understanding the role of entrapped air on liquid slamming is of great significance for the design of super large lng tanks in the offshore engineering this paper is organized as follows the experimental setup including the instrumentations and experimental procedures is described in section ii in section iii the kinematic flow field is discussed for the liquid slamming with and without entrapped air then the effect of entrapped air on the slamming pressure pressure impulse and structural response is analyzed in detail 2 experimental setup the experiments were performed on the six degree of freedom platform in the state key laboratory of structure analysis of industrial equipment at dalian university of technology dut china a nearly two dimensional 2d rectangular tank is made with the internal length l 1000 mm width b 100 mm and height h 1000 mm respectively the experimental setup and the model tank are shown in fig 1 the tank is made of 12 mm thick acrylic plate except two vertical sidewalls the vertical sidewall of the tank is designed elastically in order to study the role of entrapped air on structural response for meeting the requirements of elastic similarity the lowest bending mode of the vertical sidewall should keep the same in the full scale and model scale by froude scaling faltinsen and timokha 2009 according to lugni et al 2014 2 7 mm elastic aluminum plate was used to satisfy the elastic similarity special fixture is made to connect the tank and the elastic sidewalls which makes sure the free vibration of the sidewalls during slamming the material tests of elastic plate have been performed in the fundamental mechanics testing center at dalian university of technology dut to determine the young s modulus of the elastic plate and e 210 mpa is obtained the tank mounted at the center of the plane of the six degree of freedom platform is forced to move along the surge direction see eq 1 1 x η 2 a sin 2 π t t where η 2a is the excitation amplitude t is the experimental time and t is the excitation period of the prescribed motion in order to prevent the occurrence of tank roof impact a shallow intermediate liquid depth h 125 mm is applied the ullage pressure inside the tank is atmospheric for all experimental tests and the liquid used in all experimental tests is fresh water with room temperature in order to evaluate the hydroelasticity during liquid slamming both the slamming pressure and the structural response are measured eight pressure transducers and ten strain gauges were installed on the central line of the sidewall according to the previous research work lugni et al 2014 wei et al 2015 and the results of numerical simulation the locations of monitoring sensors are determined as shown in fig 2 according to the previous research work wei et al 2014 2015 the static and dynamic calibration of the pressure transducers the range of the pressure transducers in the experiment is 40 kpa furthermore the natural frequency of the pressure transducers is 1000 khz which is far away from the oscillation frequency of the elastic sidewall therefore the selected pressure transducers could work well with high precision for liquid slamming the strain gauge has relative high precision up to 0 5 micro strain in order to guarantee the precision of the stain gauges the static calibration experiment of the strain gauges was carried out in the calibration experiment we installed strain gauges on a cantilever beam and measured the value of the cantilever beam by adding different weights gradually furthermore in order to reduce the effect of the ambient environment on the result the compensating strain gauge was installed for the working strain gauge the systematic error of the strain gauge in the calibration experiment is less than 3 a single degree of free displacement meter was installed on the platform to check the desired surge motion of the platform its direction is parallel to the direction of tank motion the sampling frequency and the procedures for calibrating pressure sensors for liquid slamming have been investigated in our previous research work wei et al 2014 the rise time of slamming load is very short generally in the order of milliseconds according to nyquist sampling theory the sampling frequency of the data acquisition instrument is set to at least 2 times of the highest characteristic frequency in the actual measurement therefore it is suggested that the sampling frequency of transducers and data acquisition system should be at least 5 khz based on the previous study the sampling frequency of 10 khz for the data acquisition system in this study is enough to meet the accuracy of experimental measurement to qualitatively visualize the evolution of the local flow field during the liquid slamming a high speed camera with 100 fps at a resolution of 3000 1500 was arranged not far in front of the right vertical sidewall furthermore a low speed camera with 25 fps at a resolution of 1920 1080 was also used to capture the overall sloshing phenomena and it is placed far in front of the entire tank the arrangement of the cameras is shown in fig 1 the experimental procedures are summarized as follows first the reliability of the experimental setup is verified during preparation by comparing the slamming load with other experimental results lugni et al 2006 additionally it is important to check the designed locations of experimental sensors during experimental preparation in order to properly capture the trend and extreme characteristic of liquid slamming subsequently a series of experiments were conducted in order to compare the effect of the entrapped air on the hydroelasticity induced by liquid slamming it is required to import the same energy to the whole system the phenomena with and without entrapped air should occur in the different stages of the sloshing wave evolution under the same excitation several excitation parameters different combinations of η 2a and t were tested and the excitation parameters η 2a 30 mm and t 1 60 s was found to satisfy the experimental requirement during experimental preparation it is found that flip through is always occurring in the fourth cycle of oscillation and the wave front entrapping air happens in the subsequent oscillation cycle for contrastive analysis the test cases of wave front with and without entrapped air are named as case i and case ii respectively due to the stochastic behavior of slamming load all experimental tests under the same test condition were performed at least three times 3 results and discussions 3 1 the effect of entrapped air on the free surface evolution in this section in order to quantitatively describe the evolution of free surface during the liquid slamming the kinematic parameter of the wave front with entrapped air is schematically shown in fig 3 the parameters including the area a 0 the diameter d 0 impact angle α and velocities of wave crest and trough are defined a 0 is the area of the region of air enclosed at the moment of jet impact d 0 is the diameter of the region α is determined from the jet centerline red dashed line in fig 3 and the vertical sidewall v h and v v are the velocities of the horizontal velocity of the advancing wave crest and the rising velocity of the wave trough the evolution of free surface scenarios in the early stage of liquid slamming for the wave front with entrapped air are shown in fig 4 an advancing wave propagates toward the right sidewall of the tank as shown in frame a and b then a distinct plunging wave is formed and moves rapidly forward see frame c and d and a local fragmentation is formed at the wave crest simultaneously the wave crest is moving approximately parallel to the horizontal direction before it impacts on the vertical sidewall the horizontal and vertical velocity of the wave crest can be roughly calculated as 2 00 m s and 0 50 m s from the frames respectively during the wave propagating the horizontal velocity of wave crest is larger than the vertical rising velocity of the wave trough i e the horizontal velocity of the jet is 2 10 m s and the vertical rising velocity of the wave trough is about 2 00 m s when the jet impact on the sidewall therefore when the wave crest just reached the vertical sidewall the wave trough does not arrive the impact point as shown in frame e and f there exists a significant air cavity entrapped by the wave crest trough and the vertical sidewall meanwhile the jet impacts the sidewall with an impact angle α from 70 to 80 which is determined from the jet centerline and the vertical sidewall according to lugni et al 2010 a b the evolution of the free surface with entrapped air at this moment is in the first and second stage during the entire free surface evolution i e the closure of the air cavity against the sidewall see frame e and the isotropic compression of the air cavity see frame f furthermore as two dimensional condition is assumed the initial area denoted a 0 and the initial vertical diameter denoted d 0 of the air cavity is approximate 0 0016 m2 and 0 07 m in frame e respectively the impact point on the sidewall by the wave crest is in the range of 190 mm 200 mm from the bottom of the tank then due to the compression of air by the successive wave crest and the rising wave trough the air cavity starts to escape from the gap between the top of the wave crest and vertical sidewall therefore the wave impacts on the sidewall with air water mixture at the range of 170 mm 200 mm at the same time several wave splashes are formed against the vertical sidewall around the impact point during the instantaneous moment just before impact the area a 0 of entrapped air becomes smaller a 0 0 0006 m2 in frame f until the rising wave trough arrives at the impact point completely a 0 0 m2 in frame g and h in the later stage of the liquid slamming of the free surface evolution for wave front with entrapped air there is a distinct upward jet and more wave splashes are formed as shown in frame a and b in fig 5 and the air cavity is separated into several small bubbles during the later stage of liquid slamming the evolution of free surface with entrapped air is consistent with the third and fourth stage of entire free surface evolution in the research of lugni et al 2010 a b i e the anisotropic compression expansion of the entrapped air and the rise of entrapped air along the vertical sidewall during the later stage of liquid slamming the vertical velocity of the wave reduces gradually until zero which means the kinetic energy of the wave gradually turns into the potential energy of the liquid the highest vertical position of the wave arrived is around 430 mm after that the fluid begins to fall down along the sidewall due to the gravity the images are not listed the evolution of free surface scenarios in the early stage of liquid slamming for the wave front without entrapped air i e flip through are shown in fig 6 similar to the above condition an advancing wave propagates toward the right sidewall of the tank then the impinging wave is formed and moves rapidly forward as shown in frame b c d and e from frame d and e the horizontal and vertical velocity of the wave crest can be roughly calculated as 1 50 m s and 1 25 m s respectively and at this moment a local fragmentation is formed at the wave crest after 0 01 s see frame f both the wave crest and the wave trough travel the same distance corresponding to 0 02 m indicating that the wave crest and trough have the same velocity before impact occurs i e 2 00 m s therefore the wave crest and trough gradually focus on the impact point and impact on the sidewall directly as shown in frame g and h meantime the wave impacts the sidewall at an impact α from 60 to 70 the range of the impact point is in the range of 210 mm 220 mm from the bottom of the tank in the later stage of the flip through a distinct upward jet is produced and some wave splashes are formed as shown in frame a and b in fig 7 then the kinetic energy of the wave is all converted into potential energy and the wave eventually arrives at 440 mm finally the wave begins to fall down along the vertical sidewall the images are not listed due to no air is introduced into the free surface there are no bubbles in the later stage of flip through the values of these kinematic parameters of case i with air and case ii flip through are listed in table 1 due to inexistence of the entrapped air in case ii the values of parameters a 0 and d 0 are none the impact angle and the position of impact point are different in case i and case ii furthermore before liquid impact the velocities of wave crest and trough are nearly same in different cases according to the above description about the evolution of the free surface there are some differences between case i with air and case ii flip through in case i the crest reaches the impact point and the trough arrived later but in case ii the wave crest and trough reach the impact point at the same time therefore the air cavity is produced in case i and it changes the impact mode from the liquid direct impact case ii to liquid indirect impact case i furthermore due to the existence of entrapped air the position of the impact point and impact angle are changed impact angle α in case i is larger than that in case ii which leads to the range of impact point is lower than that in case ii 3 2 the effect of entrapped air on slamming pressure in order to evaluate the slamming load on the sidewall during the slamming event the slamming pressure is measured and analyzed the slamming pressure is highly localized in both space and time domain which has been reported by many researches therefore the spatial distribution and temporal history of the slamming pressure is an essential issue to understand the role of entrapped air in liquid slamming the mean maximum pressures at different locations on the sidewall which is calculated by four identical independent experimental tests are presented in fig 8 for case i with air and case ii flip through the horizontal coordinate is the dimensionless slamming pressure p max ρgh where ρgh is the hydrostatic pressure the vertical coordinate is the dimensionless position z h of the pressure measuring points and h is the height of the static water level the maximum slamming pressures are found to occur at 170 mm in case i and at 190 mm in case ii the results are consistent with the above discussion i e the position of the impact point has moved down due to the existence of the entrapped air and there is a dramatic reduction of the slamming pressure due to the entrapped air in order to quantitatively analyze the effect of the entrapped air on the slamming pressure at different locations the descent rate dr of pressure values are listed in table 2 in table 2 dr is calculated by the eq 2 2 d r c a s e i i c a s e i c a s e i i from table 2 it is clearly seen that the position of maximum descent rate is at p5 and p6 up to 67 18 and 73 64 respectively the results show that the slamming pressure around the air cavity is significantly affected by the presence of the entrapped air since the location of p8 is not the impact region the entrapped air has little influence on the slamming pressure at this point because the values of maximum pressure at the measuring points drop significantly the most representative cases for p5 and p6 are selected for detail analysis figs 9 and 10 show the pressure time history of case i with air and case ii flip through the pressure values are the average of four identical independent experimental tests from the figures there is a significant reduction around the peak pressure for slamming in case i compared to that in case ii furthermore it is observed that there is an increase of rise time from zero to peak pressure in case i comparing with case ii the most noticeable phenomenon is that the pressure time history of case ii has an obvious oscillation this is because the interaction between flow and the elastic plate which is different from the rigid case from the comparison of the pressure time history and the evolution of the free surface the role of the entrapped air acts as an air cushion to reduce the interaction between the liquid and structure 3 3 the effect of entrapped air on pressure impulse the slamming pressure impulse i has been proposed as a relatively well behaved quantity for structural analysis thus in this paper the slamming pressure impulse is used to assess the role of entrapped air on liquid slamming as well the impulse value is integrated over the duration of the measured pressure cooker and peregrine 1995 due to the difficulty of determining the duration time the rise time and duration corresponding to a simplified triangular history of the slamming pressure are defined in fig 11 the mean pressure impulses along the vertical sidewall for case i with air and case ii flip through are shown in fig 12 the results show that the impulse value in case i is much larger than that in case ii when the position is lower than 170 mm the trend of impulse is different with the spatial distribution of maximum pressure the reason is also discussed in section 3 2 i e the oscillation of the entrapped air significantly increases the duration of the slamming therefore even small slamming pressure could result in large slamming impulse thus it is necessary to comprehensively evaluate the effect of the entrapped air on the slamming load from slamming pressure and its corresponding impulse point of view 3 4 the effect of entrapped air on structural response to investigate the hydroelasticity behavior of the elastic plate during liquid slamming with entrapped air the structural response of vertical sidewall is discussed by means of the measured strain the stress σ is calculated by the equation σ e ε and ε is the measured strain e represents the young modulus of the elastic plate and e 210 mpa is obtained by the material tests in this paper the positive stress is defined as the tensile stress and the negative as the compressive stress the tensile stress and compressive stress are in the tensile and compressive regions of the elastic plate respectively the definitions of the tensile and compressive regions during liquid slamming are schematically shown in fig 13 in this figure the red dashed line represents the deformed sidewall during liquid slamming the spatial distribution and temporal history of the stress are discussed in detail fig 14 illustrates the spatial distribution of the mean maximum stress obtained by three identical independent experimental tests of case i with air and case ii flip through the horizontal coordinate is the structural stress σ the vertical coordinate is the dimensionless position z h the maximum stresses are found to occur at 158 mm in case i and 175 mm in case ii this is because the presence of the entrapped air changes the position of impact point it is observed that there are both positive and negative values at s9 and only negative value is measured at s10 similarly only positive values are obtained at s1 s7 it is indicated that the measuring point s9 is a turning point during the liquid slamming that is to say the stress state at s9 has changed during liquid slamming the position above s9 is in the compressive region while the position of s1 s8 is in the tensile region by comparing the overall trend of the spatial distribution of the maximum stress of case i and case ii the presence of entrapped air can reduce the stress values around the impact point furthermore the maximum stress values at s1 s6 of case i and case ii are almost the same it is indicated the entrapped air has little influence at that position according to the spatial distribution of mean maximum stress the time history at three representative measuring points i e s7 s9 and s10 are selected figs 15 17 show the stress time history of case i with air and case ii flip through the stress values are the average of three identical independent experimental tests at s7 175 mm a relative larger stress value is observed it is indicated the elastic plate is deformed greatly during liquid slamming furthermore an obvious oscillation of stress values is observed at s7 of case ii by calculation the stress oscillation frequency is ascribed to the structural natural frequency the natural frequency of the elastic plate is evaluated by the hammer tests at the turning point s9 208 mm the stress values change from negative to positive the reason for the turning is that s9 feel compressive before wave reaches the impact point while the stress state of elastic plate changes to tensile when the impact occurs since the measuring point s10 is far from the maximum deformation position of the elastic plate the position of s10 is compressive 4 conclusions the liquid impact induced by slamming in the membrane type tank is an important issue for the design of floating liquefied natural gas flng facilities the free surface entrapping air may easily happen under shallow water condition in the tank which could result in structural local failure studying the effect of entrapped air on slamming load is essential to understanding the air free surface elastic structure interaction this paper examined the effect of entrapped air on slamming load and structural response during liquid slamming under shallow water condition a series of experiments have been systematically designed and conducted in a nearly 2d elastic rectangular tank the evolution of kinematic free surface with and without entrapped air are observed and described qualitatively furthermore the role of entrapped air on the slamming pressure pressure impulse and structural response are analyzed in the spatial and temporal distribution the results show that the air cavity plays likely an air cushion during slamming thus the slamming mode is changed from liquid direct impact to liquid indirect impact due to the existence of air cushion the existence of the air cavity leads to a significant reduction of the maximum slamming load and structural response but the oscillation of entrapped air significantly increases the duration of the slamming which causes an increase in the pressure impulse in spatial distribution the experimental results not only reveal the mechanism for the interaction of air liquid structure but also help validate the theoretical and numerical results it is suggested to consider the effect of the entrapped air to determine the slamming load for the design of super large lng tanks in the offshore engineering there exists some technology should be improved in the future for example the pixels and frame rates of the high speed camera should be increased in order to record the more detail of the interactions between air free surface elastic structures and the thermodynamic of entrapped air is not taken into account in this paper in

20884,due to the substantial volume of materials used in the structural members of jacket platforms weight optimization is of critical importance a genetic algorithm is a powerful tool that allows for consideration of many parameters in the optimum design of platforms simultaneously a feature hardly found in ordinary circumstances regarding the cyclic loads derived from waves fatigue is one of the most fundamental issues in the design and optimization of offshore platforms in this study using the genetic algorithm a real platform is optimized with two optimization scenarios named cf and wcf the cf optimization considers constraints including fatigue life in connections stress and buckling design requirements in structural members horizontal displacement at the working point level and structural adequacy control of connections while the wcf optimization ignores fatigue constraint in the mentioned constraints the results show that cf and wcf optimizations reduced the structural weight of the platform by the ratios of 13 and 15 respectively moreover an investigation of the results obtained from wcf optimization reveals that ignoring fatigue could significantly lead to unreliable results in the design optimization of the jacket platform keywords jacket platforms optimization genetic algorithm fatigue 1 introduction the steel jacket platforms are one of the most common kinds of fixed offshore structures worldwide about 95 of the offshore platforms in the world are using jacket platforms fu 2018 due to the considerable volume of materials used in the jacket platforms structural optimization could remarkably reduce their investment satisfying various constraints such as stress ratio maximum displacement and fatigue life the structural optimization aims at minimizing an objective function which is usually the weight of the structure since a majority of the reported failures in the lifetime of offshore structures are fatigue failures fatigue life is one of the major concerns in the design and optimization of offshore structures considering various variables and objective functions researchers performed many studies on the optimization of diverse offshore structures zhang et al 2018 deng et al 2020 different methods and algorithms such as cyclical parthenogenesis algorithm cpa hosseini and zolghadr 2017 particle swarm optimization algorithm pso häafele and rolfes 2016 colliding bodies optimization algorithm cbo kaveh and sabeti 2018 and enhanced colliding bodies optimization ecbo kaveh and sabeti 2019 were also examined to optimize

weight to an overall minimum value the constraints of their problem included the design criteria for stress buckling and displacement while the outer diameter and thickness of the structural members

al 2010 moreover many researchers have investigated the topology optimization of these structures over recent years tian et al 2019 abou el makarem et al 2019 topologically optimized a standard jacket platform under earthquake loading in the gulf of suez they did not take the other types of pre service and in service loading such as environmental loading and fatigue into consideration given the presence of cyclic forces caused by waves winds and ocean currents in the seas the phenomenon of fatigue is of crucial importance in the design of offshore platforms which has widely been studied in recent years hammerstad et al 2016 ju et al 2019 in this regard shabakhty and khansari 2019 obtained the failure caused by fatigue in platform connections according to the simulation of the force of linear and nonlinear random waves using the energy spectrum and morison equation the fatigue has also been of interest in the optimization of offshore structures oest et al 2017 carried out a study on developing and implementing an effective method for gradient based sizing optimization of a support structure for offshore wind turbines in this method the diameter and thickness of the structural

frequencies strength and fatigue lifetime stolpe and sandal 2018 applied a structural optimization method with multiple discrete variables per part to size optimization of the tubular members in an offshore wind turbine jacket support structure a review of the literature revealed that despite various studies on the fatigue and optimization of offshore platforms it is critical to examine whether considering the fatigue as a constraint in the optimization results is effective or not in this study two optimizations were carried out for the spd19a platform located in the south pars field in the persian gulf this real model was positioned in the 100 year storm conditions subjected to the environmental loads at 100 year maximum still water depth concerning all engineering considerations

objective function this research was aimed at achieving an optimized design for the jacket structural members leading to the optimum weight of the platform the weight of the jacket structure was considered as the objective function it is a function of the cross sectional geometric properties of its members and varies with the changes in the thickness and diameter of the examined members during the optimization process the weight of the spd19a platform consisted of the weights of the jacket structure plus the topside which the latter was considered constant during the optimization process eq 1 gives the total weight of the platform 1 w p l a t f o r m w t o p s i d e w j a c k e t w t o p s i d e i 1 n γ i l i a i 2 a i π d o i 2 d o i 2 t i 2 4 where γ i denotes the density of steel materials of members and equals to 7 85 ton m3 also l i and a i are the length and cross section area of the jacket s structural members respectively a i for each member is calculated through eq 2 in which d oi and t i are the outer diameter and thickness of the jacket members respectively 2 2 decision variables the outer diameter and thickness of the tubular members of the jacket structure were considered as the decision variables in the optimization process to reduce the number of decision variables the main structural members were divided into 14 groups four groups of the jacket members namely hr1 hr2 hr3 and hr4 were taken for the horizontal tubular members located in the four horizontal frames as shown in fig 1 a three other groups of the jacket members belonged to the lateral braces as illustrated in fig 1 b each of these three groups named lb1 lb2 and lb3 consisted of eight members on four sides between the horizontal frames of the jacket the legs of the jacket structure composed of six other groups three of which named lg1 lg2 and lg3 and shown in fig 1 c included the members in different levels of the two legs each with one battered side besides as indicated in fig 1 d the three other ones called lga lgb and lgc consisted of members in different levels of the two legs whose two orthogonal sides were battered the last group of the structural members of the jacket included the vertical braces named vb1 and shown in fig 1 e 2 3 constraints the constraints of the optimization problem included those associated with the control of stress and buckling in the members displacement and structural adequacy control of connections along with fatigue damage according to the design requirements of api rp 2a code api recommended practice 2000 all members of the platform were subjected to the dead and live gravitational loads as well as environmental loads of winds currents and waves therefore in these members different types of axial shear in plane flexural and out plane flexural stresses or combinations of them were likely to form the api rp 2a wsd api recommended practice 2000 and aisc aisc manual of steel construction 1989 codes were used to calculate the interaction unity check ratios uc for tubular members such that the amounts of stress or buckling existing in the members would not exceed their allowable limits defined by the equations presented in the codes for members in tension tension plus bending was checked per api using eq 3 moreover each member was also checked for bending only as given in eq 4 api recommended

local x axis bending stress about the local y axis and finally allowable bending stress respectively for load cases in which the member is in compression and the compressive stress is less than or equal to 0 15fa eq 5 was used for calculating the interaction unity check 5 u c f a f a f b x 2 f b y 2 f b 1 0 where f a is allowable axial compressive stress according to the aisc code aisc manual of steel construction 1989 tubular members subjected to combined compression and flexure with compressive stress greater than 0 15fa were also checked using both eq 6 and eq 7 api recommended practice 2000 6 u c f a 0 6 f y f b x 2 f b y 2 f b 1 0 7 u c f a f a c m f b x 2 f b y 2 1 f a f e f b 1 0 where f e is euler buckling stress per aisc code and c m is the coefficient applied to bending term in interaction formula and dependent upon column curvature caused by applied moments aisc manual of steel construction 1989 plus the euler buckling stress ratio for members in compression was determined by eq 8 sacs user s manual 2010 8 u c f a f e 1 0 the shear unity check ratio was also taken as the larger of the following equations api recommended practice 2000 9 u c f v f v f v 0 4 f y

each member is kept separately f yc is the yield strength of the chord member at the joint or 2 3 of the tensile strength if less while θ τ and γ are joint geometry parameters defined by section 4 of the api code api recommended practice 2000 furthermore each tubular connection was checked to determine the capability of the connection to carry 50 of the effective member strength of any connecting brace this check can be considered satisfied for simple tubular joints when the following condition is obtained api recommended practice 2000 12 u c f y b γ τ sin θ f y c 11 1 5 β 1 0 where f yb is the yield strength of the brace member while θ τ γ and β are joint geometry parameters the amount of horizontal deflection at the working point in the x and y directions of the platform was limited to 1 200 of the platform height relative to the seabed level spd19a structural design basis 2011 the fatigue criterion was also controlled by performing a deterministic fatigue analysis and obtaining the fatigue life in each of the connections generally the constraints related to the stress and buckling in the members platform deflection and punching shear in the joints connections were controlled in such a way that the ratios of their obtained values to their allowable values were lower than one eq 13 shows the general form of constraints in the optimization problem where g i is the calculated stress or fatigue life in a group of members or a connection or the maximum horizontal deflection at the working point ga is the allowable amount of the stress service life of the platform or horizontal deflection and finally nc is the total number of the constraints 13 u c g a g i 1 for fatigue i 1 2 n c u c g i g a 1 for other constraints i 1 2 n c 2 4 fitness function the adopted approach in this study for the infeasible solutions in the genetic algorithm was to impose a penalty on them so that for each unsatisfied constraint a penalty function was added to the objective function the exterior penalty function of the optimization problem which equaled the summation of penalty functions was a function of distance from the feasible decision space as well as the number of unsatisfied constraints so it was remarkably efficient the cost function of the genetic algorithm was obtained by adding an exterior penalty function to the weight objective function of the platform therefore by penalizing the objective function and removing the limitations of the problem an equivalent free function or a cost function was obtained which is called the fitness function eq 14 indicates the relationship between the objective function exterior penalty function and the cost function nasseri et al 2014 14 φ w p l a t f o r m r p i 1 n c max 0 g i g a 1 2 in eq 14 φ indicates

of the exterior penalty function was considered constant equal to 480967 3 kn the greatest weight of the platform for maximum values of outer diameter and thickness of all structural members of the jacket 2 5 genetic algorithm the background of the genetic algorithm goes back to the 1960s in the 50s and 60s numerous researches were pursued to apply the theory of evolution in the optimization of engineering problems independently mitchell 1998 the genetic algorithm is a part of evolutionary computing which is rapidly growing at the moment as a part of artificial intelligence in this study since the decision space of the variables or the chromosome genes was continuous having real values a continuous genetic algorithm was used the primary difference between continuous and binary ga is the fact that in continuous ga variables are no longer represented by bits of zeros and ones but instead by floating point numbers over whatever range is deemed appropriate haupt and haupt 2004 the structure of chromosome or individual which was one of the solutions for the design problem of the jacket consisted of 14 pairs of particular values as a string of bits or genes for the sizes of decision variables including outer diameter and cross sectional thickness of the classified structural members of the jacket therefore each chromosome was considered a 28 bit string or a row matrix with 28 columns eq 15 illustrates the chromosome structure of the problem 15 c h r o m o s o m e d o 1 t 1 d o 2 t 2 d o 14 t 14 the population of the first generation to initiate the optimization process of the problem was determined randomly the population size was assumed constant in all generations during the optimization process in this method the values of the genes associated with the cross sectional outer diameter of the jacket s classified structural members in the first generation s chromosome were chosen continuously based on uniform random distribution from 30 cm to 300 cm with an accuracy of four decimal places given the physical constraints imposed by the api rp 2a wsd code along with the ignorance of thin walled pipes by the sacs software lower and upper boundary values for the outer diameter were determined using eq 16 nasseri et al 2014 16 d o i 300 t i d o i 2 in the next step the values of genes related to the thickness were also selected continuously with accuracy to four decimal places based on uniform random distribution in a way like the procedure adopted for outer diameter according to eq 16 in optimization processes the lack of progress or lack of improvement of the best solution of each generation through 50 generations were considered as the stopping criterion of the genetic algorithm in such conditions if the difference between the chromosomes with the lowest costs or the optimum ones over 50 successive generations were not larger than 0 01 of the initial weight of the platform including the topside and the jacket with an approximate value of 400 kg the optimization process using the genetic algorithm would stop table 1 lists the specifications of the genetic algorithm employed in the study nasseri 2013 3 the platform and environmental specifications 3 1 spd19a platform the jacket platform studied in this paper is spd19a this platform is located in the 19th phase of the south pars field in the persian gulf and has the overall deck dimensions of 32 5 m 27 5 m shown in fig 2 a spd19a structural design basis 2011 various equipment such as piping sources and instrumentation along with mechanical electrical safety and firefighting equipment were included but for simplicity they were not modeled however their weights were added to the simplified model of the platform the spd19a consists of a four leg jacket structure whose legs are continuously extended to the fixity level in the soil of seabed and fixed there the platform has single battered legs on one side by the slope of 1 7 and double battered legs on the other side with the slopes of 1 7 and 1 8 in two orthogonal directions as illustrated in figs 2 b and fig 3 spd19a structural design basis 2011 the dimensions between the legs at the working point elevation are 24 m 13 72 m shown in fig 2 b the platform s foundation consists of four piles which are considered the extension of the legs to the fixity level with a simple tubular cross section as demonstrated in fig 3 the structural elevations of the jacket structure including the working point top of the jacket the first frame the second frame the third frame and the fourth frame aligned with seabed level are at 8 3 7 25 5 75 m above the lowest astronomical tide lat and 13 35 and 64 7 m below the lat respectively spd19a structural design basis 2011 hence the total height of the jacket structure is 73 m moreover the length of the jacket members of the platform model is considered constant equal to the initial value the tubular members of the jacket are made of s355 steel plates 3 2 structural model the platform structure was modeled and analyzed using the finite element structural analysis software sacs version 5 3 1 1 the in place analysis was performed for the jacket platform subjected to dead and live loads along with the environmental loads caused by marine phenomena such as waves currents and winds in the persian gulf moreover in order to investigate the fatigue life of the structure a deterministic fatigue analysis was performed as described in detail in the following section 3 3 environmental information and loads the 1 min mean wind speed at 10 m above mean sea level was considered according to the wind information recorded in the project specifications spd19a structural design basis 2011 the wind force applied to the unit length of a tubular member was calculated by eq 17 chakrabarti 2005 17 f 1 2 ρ c d d o u w 2 where in eq 17 ρ is the water density kg m3 d o m is the outer diameter of tubular member normal to the wind flow u w m s is the mean wind speed and c d is the drag coefficient the water depth at the location of the spd19a platform is 64 7 m relative to lat spd19a structural design basis 2011 the minimum water depth in the in place analysis is the distance between the lat and seabed the maximum still water depth in extreme storm conditions can be obtained by adding the mean highest high water mhhw and 100 year surge to the water depth relative to lat the 100 year maximum still water depth for eight geographical directions was determined according to the information recorded in the project specifications spd19a structural design basis 2011 directional waves were used for in place analysis since the optimization process was conducted based on 100 year extreme storm conditions the information about the wave heights and their periods for eight geographical directions in such conditions were extracted from the related tables in the project specifications spd19a structural design basis 2011 fig 4 demonstrates the eight different directions evaluated under 100 year extreme storm conditions for the optimization of structural members of the platform s jacket wave loads are generated using the environmental criteria together with an applicable wave theory and morison s equation as outlined in api rp 2a api recommended practice 2000 when a current is present the total water particle velocity is modified by adding the wave particle velocity to the current velocity if the current is inline the magnitudes are added to give the total velocity the wave particle velocity is computed based on the apparent wave period in this case the normal wave loading for a unit length of a cylindrical structure is based on the modified morison equation as shown in eq 18 chakrabarti 2005 18 f ρ c m π d o 2 4 u 1 2 ρ c d d o u u u u in this equation ρ stands for fluid density d o m is the outer diameter of the tubular member while u m s and u m s2 are the horizontal velocity and acceleration of the water particle inside the wave respectively the parameters c m and c d also denote the hydrodynamic coefficients of inertia and drag respectively with constant empirical values the current data for 100 year extreme storm conditions were based on the project specifications spd19a structural design basis 2011 3 4 fatigue damage estimation fatigue analyses in offshore structures are performed by different methods divided into time domain and frequency domain groups the latter includes spectral simplified and deterministic methods cui et al 2016 although the spectral method is the most reliable for the fatigue analysis of offshore structures it is considered time consuming due to its complexity xiang chun et al 2006 therefore this research applied the deterministic method for fatigue analysis due to its simplicity the offshore jacket platforms are usually built in the form of welded tubular structures the joints of these tubular members experience fatigue damage mainly due to small defects in welding which act as crack initiators high stress concentrations and the variable and cyclic loads caused by ocean waves gupta and singh 1986 based on the diameter and thickness of tubular members framing into each connection chords and braces are designated sacs user s manual 2010 regarding the geometry of each chord brace combination connections are then classified as t y x k or tk shown in fig 5 api recommended practice 2000 in the deterministic method the seastate energy is simulated using discrete frequencies and wave heights with the corresponding number of occurrences according to the information available in the project specifications for fatigue analysis of the platform spd19a a scatter diagram was used in eight directions of waves each with a definite height period and the number of occurrences in one year spd19a structural design basis 2011 for each discrete wave the structure s response is computed by linear static analysis in order to simulate the dynamic effects of deterministic waves the structure s responses should be modified with a dynamic amplification factor daf the following approximate equation is used to obtain the daf in the major directions of the vibration modes x and y barltrop et al 1991 19 d a f 1 1 t s t w 2 2 2 ξ t s t w 2 in this equation t s is the natural period of the structure t w is the wave period and ξ is the damping ratio which was considered 2 the daf for each wave varies with its period the responses of the structure which includes the amplitude of nominal stresses in the connections are separately converted to hssr s hot spot stress range in the circumferential connection points for each of the waves by multiplying the stress concentration factors scf suitable for each one of the connections 20 s c f hssr at the location range of the nominal stress the key hot spot stress range locations at the tubular joint intersection are termed saddle and crown as shown in fig 6 a minimum of eight stress range locations needs to be considered around each chord brace intersection in order to adequately cover all relevant locations api recommended practice 2000 the hot spot stress at these points is derived by summation of the single stress components from axial in plane and out of plane action as given in eq 21 sacs user s manual 2010 dnvgl rp c203 fatigue design offshore steel structures 21 σ hot spot d a f σ x s c f a c cos 2 θ s c f a s sin 2 θ σ m y s c f m i p sin θ σ m z s c f m o p cos θ in eq 21 σ x σ my and σ mz are the maximum nominal stresses due to axial load bending in plane and out of plane respectively scf as is the stress concentration factor at the saddle for axial load and the scf ac is the stress concentration factor at the crown scf mip is the stress concentration factor for in plane moment and scf mop is the stress concentration factor for out of plane moment moreover θ denotes the angle measured around the brace from the crown scf s were obtained based on the joint geometry load pattern distribution as per the efthymiou s equations according to api code spd19a structural design basis 2011 api recommended practice 2000 then given the number of occurrences of each wave in a definite period according to the wave scatter diagram and by using the palmgren miner s rule the hypothesis of linear cumulative fatigue damage the volume of fatigue damage for each wave was determined according to eq 22 api recommended practice 2000 the summation of fatigue damages due to these discrete wave load cases are then summed up to obtain the total damage during the life of the structure 22 d n n in this equation n is the number of cycles associated with a particular stress range while n is the number of allowable cycles for the intended stress range which is obtained from the suitable s n curve api recommended practice 2000 with respect to the project specifications the api x prime curve with thickness correction was used for fatigue analysis of the spd19a platform spd19a structural design basis 2011 furthermore based on the api rp 2a code the fatigue life should not be less than 2 times the service life of the structure api recommended practice 2000 given the project specifications the service life of the spd19a platform was considered 25 years spd19a structural design basis 2011 according to the information recorded in the project specifications the safety factor for the fatigue analysis of the spd19a platform was considered 2 spd19a structural design basis 2011 it is worth noting that the amounts of fatigue damage were calculated considering the safety factor in the output of the sacs software and the service life reported for each connection should be compared with the base service life 25 years fig 7 demonstrates the joints considered for the fatigue analysis of spd19a platform while fig 8 shows the process of deterministic fatigue analysis 4 design optimization of the jacket platform as fatigue analysis is time consuming considering fatigue damage as a constraint can substantially extend the optimization time therefore it is critical to evaluate whether considering fatigue damage as a constraint is effective in the optimization results or not to evaluate the impact of fatigue damage in the optimization of spd19a two optimizations were performed using a continuous genetic algorithm with the same specifications shown in table 1 the first optimization referred as wcf optimization considered constraints including the stress and buckling control in the members displacement and structural adequacy control of the connections while the second optimization called cf optimization took account all mentioned constraints along with fatigue damage table 2 demonstrates the properties of the designs optimized by two mentioned optimizations given fig 9 a and fig 9 b wcf optimization approached optimum results in 223 generations while in cf optimization the platform was optimized during 311 generations however compared to cf optimization ignoring fatigue constraint in wcf optimization led to reduction of optimization time the great difference in the number of generations in two optimizations is due to the random determination of the first generations populations table 4 shows that wcf optimization reduced the initial weight of platform by the ratio of 15 while by considering fatigue damage the optimization ratio for cf optimization decreased to 13 meanwhile fig 10 and fig 11 reveal that in both optimizations a major part of weight changes in the optimum designs were caused by the thickness reduction of the jacket s structural members performing a fatigue analysis for the designs optimized by wcf and cf optimization the joint s fatigue lives were calculated as shown in table 3 fig 12 indicates the volume of optimized materials in each group of the jacket s structural members while fig 13 shows the contribution percentage of each group in both optimizations the lb1 group had the largest contribution in the optimized weights while there are no weight reductions in lgb and vb1 groups overall as shown in fig 14 the lateral braces of the jacket structure with ratios of 56 and 52 2 made the greatest contribution to the weight reduction of the platform in cf optimization and wcf optimization respectively while the horizontal members and legs had lower contributions to the optimization processes moreover in both optimizations the vertical braces had no effect on the weight reduction of the platform as discussed wcf optimization obtained a design considering the satisfaction of the constraints including stress and buckling control in the members displacement criterion and structural adequacy control of connections to evaluate the impact of fatigue damage in the optimization process regarding the wcf optimization s results shown in table 2 the cost function was recalculated using eq 14 considering fatigue constraint the cost function in this case equaled 135 021 tons much more than the initial weight of the platform which is 3834 tones this considerable difference shows that in the calculation of the cost function the fatigue constraint was exceeded as shown in tables 3 and 4 connections including 191 192 194 and 294 had a fatigue life of less than 25 years the service life of the structure confirming the excess of the fatigue constraint in the wcf optimization meanwhile the fatigue analysis of joints in the design optimized by cf optimization shows all joints had a service life of more than 25 years therefore although ignoring fatigue constraint increased the optimization ratio and reduced the time of optimization it leads to unreliable results regarding the service life of the joints consequently according to the importance of fatigue damage in offshore structures cf optimization provides more reliable results for the spd19a jacket platform 5 conclusion in this research a real jacket type platform namely spd19a located in the south pars field the persian gulf was optimized by two optimizations scenarios using a continuous genetic algorithm the jacket platform was positioned in the extreme storm conditions subjected to environmental forces of the sea the outer diameter and thickness of the jacket s structural members were the two decision variables the first optimization wcf optimization considered constraints including the stress and buckling design requirements in the members maximum deflection at the working point and structural adequacy control of connections while the second cf optimization added fatigue damage to mentioned constraints as fatigue analysis is time consuming ignoring fatigue constraint in wcf optimization led to reduction of optimization time compared to cf optimization by conducting wcf optimization the optimum design showed a weight reduction by a ratio of 15 however by considering fatigue damage the optimization ratio for cf optimization decreased to 13 in both wcf and cf optimizations the lateral braces made the greatest contribution to the weight reduction of the jacket platform by ratios of 52 2 and 56 respectively while vertical braces did not contribute to reducing the weight the investigation of the results obtained from wcf optimization ignoring fatigue constraint revealed that despite the reduction of optimization time and increase of optimization ratio the fatigue lives in 4 connections were not acceptable due to the jacket platform s service life hence it could be concluded that fatigue damage should be considered as significant constraint in the optimization process and cf optimization consequently provided more reliable results for that spd19a jacket platform the simultaneous in place and fatigue analyses in one step in the sacs software was an important innovation of this research in the optimization process the fatigue and in place analyses should be iterated several times in addition in sacs software the fatigue analysis is performed in a number of steps in some of which the information should be entered manually by the user however it is required to perform in place and fatigue analyses continuously in one step in the sacs software this was made possible by creating an interface between the two software matlab and sacs furthermore since the fatigue analysis is time consuming and it should be iterated in each generation the cf optimization applied in this research was also time consuming thus it is suggested to work on reducing the time of the optimization

20884,due to the substantial volume of materials used in the structural members of jacket platforms weight optimization is of critical importance a genetic algorithm is a powerful tool that allows for consideration of many parameters in the optimum design of platforms simultaneously a feature hardly found in ordinary circumstances regarding the cyclic loads derived from waves fatigue is one of the most fundamental issues in the design and optimization of offshore platforms in this study using the genetic algorithm a real platform is optimized with two optimization scenarios named cf and wcf the cf optimization considers constraints including fatigue life in connections stress and buckling design requirements in structural members horizontal displacement at the working point level and structural adequacy control of connections while the wcf optimization ignores fatigue constraint in the mentioned constraints the results show that cf and wcf optimizations reduced the structural weight of the platform by the ratios of 13 and 15 respectively moreover an investigation of the results obtained from wcf optimization reveals that ignoring fatigue could significantly lead to unreliable results in the design optimization of the jacket platform keywords jacket platforms optimization genetic algorithm fatigue 1 introduction the steel jacket platforms are one of the most common kinds of fixed offshore structures worldwide about 95 of the offshore platforms in the world are using jacket platforms fu 2018 due to the considerable volume of materials used in the jacket platforms structural optimization could remarkably reduce their investment satisfying various constraints such as stress ratio maximum displacement and fatigue life the structural optimization aims at minimizing an objective function which is usually the weight of the structure since a majority of the reported failures in the lifetime of offshore structures are fatigue failures fatigue life is one of the major concerns in the design and optimization of offshore structures considering various variables and objective functions researchers performed many studies on the optimization of diverse offshore structures zhang et al 2018 deng et al 2020 different methods and algorithms such as cyclical parthenogenesis algorithm cpa hosseini and zolghadr 2017 particle swarm optimization algorithm pso häafele and rolfes 2016 colliding bodies optimization algorithm cbo kaveh and sabeti 2018 and enhanced colliding bodies optimization ecbo kaveh and sabeti 2019 were also examined to optimize

weight to an overall minimum value the constraints of their problem included the design criteria for stress buckling and displacement while the outer diameter and thickness of the structural members of the jacket were considered as decision variables in order to optimize offshore structures studies have also focused on their shape optimization including the slope of their legs mohammad nejad et al 2010 moreover many researchers have investigated the topology optimization of these structures over recent years tian et al 2019 abou el makarem et al 2019 topologically optimized a standard jacket platform under earthquake loading in the gulf of suez they did not take the other types of pre service and in service loading such as environmental loading and fatigue into consideration given the presence of cyclic forces caused by waves winds and ocean currents in the seas the phenomenon of fatigue is of crucial importance in the design of offshore platforms which has widely been studied in recent years hammerstad et al 2016 ju et al 2019 in this regard shabakhty and khansari 2019 obtained the failure caused by fatigue in platform connections according to the simulation of the force of linear and nonlinear random waves using the energy spectrum and morison equation the fatigue has also been of interest in the optimization of offshore structures oest et al 2017 carried out a study on developing and implementing an effective method for gradient based sizing optimization of a support structure for offshore wind turbines in this method the diameter and thickness of the structural

frequencies strength and fatigue lifetime stolpe and sandal 2018 applied a structural optimization method with multiple discrete variables per part to size optimization of the tubular members in an offshore wind turbine jacket support structure a review of the literature revealed that despite various studies on the fatigue and optimization of offshore platforms it is critical to examine whether considering the fatigue as a constraint in the optimization results is effective or not in this study two optimizations were carried out for the spd19a platform located in the south pars field in the persian gulf this real model was positioned in the 100 year storm conditions subjected to the environmental loads at 100 year maximum still water depth concerning all engineering considerations mentioned in the project report spd19a structural design basis 2011 the sacs sacs user s manual 2010 finite element software was used for in place and fatigue analysis of the platform against environmental loads imposed from eight geographical directions the optimization process was conducted by a continuous genetic algorithm programmed in the matlab software 2 optimization problem the goal of the problem in this research was to achieve an optimum design for the geometric properties of the sections of the spd19a platform jacket s structural members by taking the fatigue damage impact into account in the following sections the components of the optimization problem including objective function decision variables constraints and fitness function are discussed individually 2 1 objective function this research was aimed at achieving an optimized design for the jacket structural members leading to the optimum weight of the platform the weight of the jacket structure was considered as the objective function it is a function of the cross sectional geometric properties of its members and varies with the changes in the thickness and diameter of the examined members during the optimization process the weight of the spd19a platform consisted of the weights of the jacket structure plus the topside which the latter was considered constant during the optimization process eq 1 gives the total weight of the platform 1 w p l a t f o r m w t o p s i d e w j a c k e t w t o p s i d e i 1 n γ i l i a i 2 a i π d o i 2 d o i 2 t i 2 4 where γ i denotes the density of steel materials of members and equals to 7 85 ton m3 also l i and a i are the length and cross section area of the jacket s structural members respectively a i for each member is calculated through eq 2 in which d oi and t i are the outer diameter and thickness of the jacket members respectively 2 2 decision variables the outer diameter and thickness of the tubular members of the jacket structure were considered as the decision variables in the optimization process to reduce the number of decision variables the main structural members were divided into 14 groups four groups of the jacket members namely hr1 hr2 hr3 and hr4 were taken for the horizontal tubular members located in the four horizontal frames as shown in fig 1 a three other groups of the jacket members belonged to the lateral braces as illustrated in fig 1 b each of these three groups named lb1 lb2 and lb3 consisted of eight members on four sides between the horizontal frames of the jacket the legs of the jacket structure composed of six other groups three of which named lg1 lg2 and lg3 and shown in fig 1 c included the members in different levels of the two legs each with one battered side besides as indicated in fig 1 d the three other ones called lga lgb and lgc consisted of members in different levels of the two legs whose two orthogonal sides were battered the last group of the structural members of the jacket included the vertical braces named vb1 and shown in fig 1 e 2 3 constraints the constraints of the optimization problem included those associated with the control of stress and buckling in the members displacement and structural adequacy control of connections along with fatigue damage according to the design requirements of api rp 2a code api recommended practice 2000 all members of the platform were subjected to the dead and live gravitational loads as well as environmental loads of winds currents and waves therefore in these members different types of axial shear in plane flexural and out plane flexural stresses or combinations of them were likely to form the api rp 2a wsd api recommended practice 2000 and aisc aisc manual of steel construction 1989 codes were used to calculate the interaction unity check ratios uc for tubular members such that the amounts of stress or buckling existing in the members would not exceed their allowable limits defined by the

1 200 of the platform height relative to the seabed level spd19a structural design basis 2011 the fatigue criterion was also controlled by performing a deterministic fatigue analysis and obtaining the fatigue life in each of the connections generally the constraints related to the stress and buckling in the members platform deflection and punching shear in the joints connections were controlled in such a way that the ratios of their obtained values to their allowable values were lower than one eq 13 shows the general form of constraints in the optimization problem where g i is the calculated stress or fatigue life in a group of members or a connection or the maximum horizontal deflection at the working point ga is the allowable amount of the stress service life of the platform or horizontal deflection and finally nc is the total number of the constraints 13 u c g a g i 1 for fatigue i 1 2 n c u c g i g a 1 for other constraints i 1 2 n c 2 4 fitness function the adopted approach in this study for the infeasible solutions in the genetic algorithm was to impose a penalty on them so that for each unsatisfied constraint a penalty function was added to the objective function the exterior penalty function of the optimization problem which equaled the summation of penalty functions was a function of distance from the feasible decision space as well as the number of unsatisfied constraints so it was remarkably efficient the cost function of the genetic algorithm was obtained by adding an exterior penalty function to the weight objective function of the platform therefore by penalizing the objective function and removing the limitations of the problem an equivalent free function or a cost function was obtained which is called the fitness function eq 14 indicates the relationship between the objective function exterior penalty function and the cost function nasseri et al 2014 14 φ w p l a t f o r m r p i 1 n c max 0 g i g a 1 2 in eq 14 φ indicates

of the exterior penalty function was considered constant equal to 480967 3 kn the greatest weight of the platform for maximum values of outer diameter and thickness of all structural members of the jacket 2 5 genetic algorithm the background of the genetic algorithm goes back to the 1960s in the 50s and 60s numerous researches were pursued to apply the theory of evolution in the optimization of engineering problems independently mitchell 1998 the genetic algorithm is a part of evolutionary computing which is rapidly growing at the moment as a part of artificial intelligence in this study since the decision space of the variables or the chromosome genes was continuous having real values a continuous genetic algorithm was used the primary difference between continuous and binary ga is the fact that in continuous ga variables are no longer represented by bits of zeros and ones but instead by floating point numbers over whatever range is deemed appropriate haupt and haupt 2004 the structure of chromosome or individual which was one of the solutions for the design problem of the jacket consisted of 14 pairs of particular values as a string of bits or genes for the sizes of decision variables including outer diameter and cross sectional thickness of the classified structural members of the jacket therefore each chromosome was considered a 28 bit string or a row matrix with 28 columns eq 15 illustrates the chromosome structure of the problem 15 c h r o m o s o m e d o 1 t 1 d o 2 t 2 d o 14 t 14 the population of the first generation to initiate the optimization process of the problem was determined randomly the population size was assumed constant in all generations during the optimization process in this method the values of the genes associated with the cross sectional outer diameter of the jacket s classified structural members in the first generation s chromosome were chosen continuously based on uniform random distribution from 30 cm to 300 cm with an accuracy of four decimal places given the physical constraints imposed by the api rp 2a wsd code along with the ignorance of thin walled pipes by the sacs software lower and upper boundary values for the outer diameter were determined using eq 16 nasseri et al 2014 16 d o i 300 t i d o i 2 in the next step the values of genes related to the thickness were also selected continuously with accuracy to four decimal places based on uniform random distribution in a way like the procedure adopted for outer diameter according to eq 16 in optimization processes the lack of progress or lack of improvement of the best solution of each generation through 50 generations were considered as the stopping criterion of the genetic algorithm in such conditions if the difference between the chromosomes with the lowest costs or the optimum ones over 50 successive generations were not larger than 0 01 of the initial weight of the platform including the topside and the jacket with an approximate value of 400 kg the optimization process using the genetic algorithm would stop table 1 lists the specifications of the genetic algorithm employed in the study nasseri 2013 3 the platform and environmental specifications 3 1 spd19a platform the jacket platform studied in this paper is spd19a this platform is located in the 19th phase of the south pars field in the persian gulf and has the overall deck dimensions of 32 5 m 27 5 m shown in fig 2 a spd19a structural design basis 2011 various equipment such as piping sources and instrumentation along with mechanical electrical safety and firefighting equipment were included but for simplicity they were not modeled however their weights were added to the simplified model of the platform the spd19a consists of a four leg jacket structure whose legs are continuously extended to the fixity level in the soil of seabed and fixed there the platform has single battered legs on one side by the slope of 1 7 and double battered legs on the other side with the slopes of 1 7 and 1 8 in two orthogonal directions as illustrated in figs 2 b and fig 3 spd19a structural design basis 2011 the dimensions between the legs at the working point elevation are 24 m 13 72 m shown in fig 2 b the platform s foundation consists of four piles which are considered the extension of the legs to the fixity level with a simple tubular cross section as demonstrated in fig 3 the structural elevations of the jacket structure including the working point top of the jacket the first frame the second frame the third frame and the fourth frame aligned with seabed level are at 8 3 7 25 5 75 m above the lowest astronomical tide lat and 13 35 and 64 7 m below the lat respectively spd19a structural design basis 2011 hence the total height of the jacket structure is 73 m moreover the length of the jacket members of the platform model is considered constant equal to the initial value the tubular members of the jacket are made of s355 steel plates 3 2 structural model the platform structure was modeled and analyzed using the finite element structural analysis software sacs version 5 3 1 1 the in place analysis was performed for the jacket platform subjected to dead and live loads along with the environmental loads caused by marine phenomena such as waves currents and winds in the persian gulf moreover in order to investigate the fatigue life of the structure a deterministic fatigue analysis was performed as described in detail in the following section 3 3 environmental information and loads the 1 min mean wind speed at 10 m above mean sea level was considered according to the wind information recorded in the project specifications spd19a structural design basis 2011 the wind force applied to the unit length of a tubular member was calculated by eq 17 chakrabarti 2005 17 f 1 2 ρ c d d o u w 2 where in eq 17 ρ is the water density kg m3 d o m is the outer diameter of tubular member normal to the wind flow u w m s is the mean wind speed and c d is the drag coefficient the water depth at the location of the spd19a platform is 64 7 m relative to lat spd19a structural design basis 2011 the minimum water depth in the in place analysis is the distance between the lat and seabed the maximum still water depth in extreme storm conditions can be obtained by adding the mean highest high water mhhw and 100 year surge to the water depth relative to lat the 100 year maximum still water depth for eight geographical directions was determined according to the information recorded in the project specifications spd19a structural design basis 2011 directional waves were used for in place analysis since the optimization process was conducted based on 100 year extreme storm conditions the information about the wave heights and their periods for eight geographical directions in such conditions were extracted from the related tables in the project specifications spd19a structural design basis 2011 fig 4 demonstrates the eight different directions evaluated under 100 year extreme storm conditions for the optimization of structural members of the platform s jacket wave loads are generated using the environmental criteria together with an applicable wave theory and morison s equation as outlined in api rp 2a api recommended practice 2000 when a current is present the total water particle velocity is modified by adding the wave particle velocity to the current velocity if the current is inline the magnitudes are added to give the total velocity the wave particle velocity is computed based on the apparent wave period in this case the normal wave loading for a unit length of a cylindrical structure is based on the modified morison equation as shown in eq 18 chakrabarti 2005 18 f ρ c m π d o 2 4 u 1 2 ρ c d d o u u u u in this equation ρ stands for fluid density d o m is the outer diameter of the tubular member while u m s and u m s2 are the horizontal velocity and acceleration of the water particle inside the wave respectively the parameters c m and c d also denote the hydrodynamic coefficients of inertia and drag respectively with constant empirical values the current data for 100 year extreme storm conditions were based on the project specifications spd19a structural design basis 2011 3 4 fatigue damage estimation fatigue analyses in offshore structures are performed by different methods divided into time domain and frequency domain groups the latter includes spectral simplified and deterministic methods cui et al 2016 although the spectral method is the most reliable for the fatigue analysis of offshore structures it is considered time consuming due to its complexity xiang chun et al 2006 therefore this research applied the deterministic method for fatigue analysis due to its simplicity the offshore jacket platforms are usually built in the form of welded tubular structures the joints of these tubular members experience fatigue damage mainly due to small defects in welding which act as crack initiators high stress concentrations and the variable and cyclic loads caused by ocean waves gupta and singh 1986 based on the diameter and thickness of tubular members framing into each connection chords and braces are designated sacs user s manual 2010 regarding the geometry of each chord brace combination connections are then classified as t y x k or tk shown in fig 5 api recommended practice 2000 in the deterministic method the seastate energy is simulated using discrete frequencies and wave heights with the corresponding number of occurrences according to the information available in the project specifications for fatigue analysis of the platform spd19a a scatter diagram was used in eight directions of waves each with a definite height period and the number of occurrences in one year spd19a structural design basis 2011 for each discrete wave the structure s response is computed by linear static analysis in order to simulate the dynamic effects of deterministic waves the structure s responses should be modified with a dynamic amplification factor daf the following approximate equation is used to obtain the daf in the major directions of the vibration modes x and y barltrop et al 1991 19 d a f 1 1 t s t w 2 2 2 ξ t s t w 2 in this equation t s is the natural period of the structure t w is the wave period and ξ is the damping ratio which was considered 2 the daf for each wave varies with its period the responses of the structure which includes the amplitude of nominal stresses in the connections are separately converted to hssr s hot spot stress range in the circumferential connection points for each of the waves by multiplying the stress concentration factors scf suitable for each one of the connections 20 s c f hssr at the location range of the nominal stress the key hot spot stress range locations at the tubular joint intersection are termed saddle and crown as shown in fig 6 a minimum of eight stress range locations needs to be considered around each chord brace intersection in order to adequately cover all relevant locations api recommended practice 2000 the hot spot stress at these points is derived by summation of the single stress components from axial in plane and out of plane action as given in eq 21 sacs user s manual 2010 dnvgl rp c203 fatigue design offshore steel structures 21 σ hot spot d a f σ x s c f a c cos 2 θ s c f a s sin 2 θ σ m y s c f m i p sin θ σ m z s c f m o p cos θ in eq 21 σ x σ my and σ mz are the maximum nominal stresses due to axial load bending in plane and out of plane respectively scf as is the stress concentration factor at the saddle for axial load and the scf ac is the stress concentration factor at the crown scf mip is the stress concentration factor for in plane moment and scf mop is the stress concentration factor for out of plane moment moreover θ denotes the angle measured around the brace from the crown scf s were obtained based on the joint geometry load pattern distribution as per the efthymiou s equations according to api code spd19a structural design basis 2011 api recommended practice 2000 then given the number of occurrences of each wave in a definite period according to the wave scatter diagram and by using the palmgren miner s rule the hypothesis of linear cumulative fatigue damage the volume of fatigue damage for each wave was determined according to eq 22 api recommended practice 2000 the summation of fatigue damages due to these discrete wave load cases are then summed up to obtain the total damage during the life of the structure 22 d n n in this equation n is the number of cycles associated with a particular stress range while n is the number of allowable cycles for the intended stress range which is obtained from the suitable s n curve api recommended practice 2000 with respect to the project specifications the api x prime curve with thickness correction was used for fatigue analysis of the spd19a platform spd19a structural design basis 2011 furthermore based on the api rp 2a code the fatigue life should not be less than 2 times the service life of the structure api recommended practice 2000 given the project specifications the service life of the spd19a platform was considered 25 years spd19a structural design basis 2011 according to the information recorded in the project specifications the safety factor for the fatigue analysis of the spd19a platform was considered 2 spd19a structural design basis 2011 it is worth noting that the amounts of fatigue damage were calculated considering the safety factor in the output of the sacs software and the service life reported for each connection should be compared with the base service life 25 years fig 7 demonstrates the joints considered for the fatigue analysis of spd19a platform while fig 8 shows the process of deterministic fatigue analysis 4 design optimization of the jacket platform as fatigue analysis is time consuming considering fatigue damage as a constraint can substantially extend the optimization time therefore it is critical to evaluate whether considering fatigue damage as a constraint is effective in the optimization results or not to evaluate the impact of fatigue damage in the optimization of spd19a two optimizations were performed using a continuous genetic algorithm with the same specifications shown in table 1 the first optimization referred as wcf optimization considered constraints including the stress and buckling control in the members displacement and structural adequacy control of the connections while the second optimization called cf optimization took account all mentioned constraints along with fatigue damage table 2 demonstrates the properties of the designs optimized by two mentioned optimizations given fig 9 a and fig 9 b wcf optimization approached optimum results in 223 generations while in cf optimization the platform was optimized during 311 generations however compared to cf optimization ignoring fatigue constraint in wcf optimization led to reduction of optimization time the great difference in the number of generations in two optimizations is due to the random determination of the first generations populations table 4 shows that wcf optimization reduced the initial weight of platform by the ratio of 15 while by considering fatigue damage the optimization ratio for cf optimization decreased to 13 meanwhile fig 10 and fig 11 reveal that in both optimizations a major part of weight changes in the optimum designs were caused by the thickness reduction of the jacket s structural members performing a fatigue analysis for the designs optimized by wcf and cf optimization the joint s fatigue lives were calculated as shown in table 3 fig 12 indicates the volume of optimized materials in each group of the jacket s structural members while fig 13 shows the contribution percentage of each group in both optimizations the lb1 group had the largest contribution in the optimized weights while there are no weight reductions in lgb and vb1 groups overall as shown in fig 14 the lateral braces of the jacket structure with ratios of 56 and 52 2 made the greatest contribution to the weight reduction of the platform in cf optimization and wcf optimization respectively while the horizontal members and legs had lower contributions to the optimization processes moreover in both optimizations the vertical braces had no effect on the weight reduction of the platform as discussed wcf optimization obtained a design considering the satisfaction of the constraints including stress and buckling control in the members displacement criterion and structural adequacy control of connections to evaluate the impact of fatigue damage in the optimization process regarding the wcf optimization s results shown in table 2 the cost function was recalculated using eq 14 considering fatigue constraint the cost function in this case equaled 135 021 tons much more than the initial weight of the platform which is 3834 tones this considerable difference shows that in the calculation of the cost function the fatigue constraint was exceeded as shown in tables 3 and 4 connections including 191 192 194 and 294 had a fatigue life of less than 25 years the service life of the structure confirming the excess of the fatigue constraint in the wcf optimization meanwhile the fatigue analysis of joints in the design optimized by cf optimization shows all joints had a service life of more than 25 years therefore although ignoring fatigue constraint increased the optimization ratio and reduced the time of optimization it leads to unreliable results regarding the service life of the joints consequently according to the importance of fatigue damage in offshore structures cf optimization provides more reliable results for the spd19a jacket platform 5 conclusion in this research a real jacket type platform namely spd19a located in the south pars field the persian gulf was optimized by two optimizations scenarios using a continuous genetic algorithm the jacket platform was positioned in the extreme storm conditions subjected to environmental forces of the sea the outer diameter and thickness of the jacket s structural members were the two decision variables the first optimization wcf optimization considered constraints including the stress and buckling design requirements in the members maximum deflection at the working point and structural adequacy control of connections while the second cf optimization added fatigue damage to mentioned constraints as fatigue analysis is time consuming ignoring fatigue constraint in wcf optimization led to reduction of optimization time compared to cf optimization by conducting wcf optimization the optimum design showed a weight reduction by a ratio of 15 however by considering fatigue damage the optimization ratio for cf optimization decreased to 13 in both wcf and cf optimizations the lateral braces made the greatest contribution to the weight reduction of the jacket platform by ratios of 52 2 and 56 respectively while vertical braces did not contribute to reducing the weight the investigation of the results obtained from wcf optimization ignoring fatigue constraint revealed that despite the reduction of optimization time and increase of optimization ratio the fatigue lives in 4 connections were not acceptable due to the jacket platform s service life hence it could be concluded that fatigue damage should be considered as significant constraint in the optimization process and cf optimization consequently provided more reliable results for that spd19a jacket platform the simultaneous in place and fatigue analyses in one step in the sacs software was an important innovation of this research in the optimization process the fatigue and in place analyses should be iterated several times in addition in sacs software the fatigue analysis is performed in a number of steps in some of which the information should be entered manually by the user however it is required to perform in place and fatigue analyses continuously in one step in the sacs software this was made possible by creating an interface between the two software matlab and sacs furthermore since the fatigue analysis is time consuming and it should be iterated in each generation the cf optimization applied in this research was also time consuming thus it is suggested to work on reducing the time of the optimization
