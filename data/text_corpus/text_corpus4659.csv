accurate and safe handling of a tunnel element in severe weather 3d physical model tests were conducted under regular and irregular waves with long period to estimate the motions of three floating

to analyze the mooring tensions of the tunnel pontoons assembly under waves and currents during immersion standby and proposed an optimal mooring configuration unfortunately the motions of the sole element and tunnel pontoons assembly in long wave regime has not been addressed and will be investigated in the present study in practice it is important to be aware that many nonlinear phenomena occur along with green water loadings on the small freeboard floating structures in rough waves such as slamming violent impact force wave breaking water air mixing and associated turbulence zhao et al 2014 although some numerical model studies have been developed to investigate the wave induced nonlinear motions of the 2d floating body sueyoshi et al 2008 hu and kashiwagi 2009 zhao et al 2014 in general it is still very challenging to set up a numerical simulation to predict its 6 dof motions accurately therefore in the present study a series of experiments are conducted to examine the

drift forces for t w t roll leading to considerable mean sway and great offshore mooring tension the resonant responses are observed in heave roll and pitch of the floating bodies in long wave regime in addition the hydrodynamic characteristics of the three floating bodies subjected to irregular waves were discussed with measured motions by fft in the following we shall first describe the experiments before discussing the results 2 experiments 2 1 scale of the floaters and mooring lines froude similitude is the most appropriate for physical model tests on floating coastal structures based on the wave model test regulation 2001 the model scale λ 1 80 is recommended for the large floating vessel of 50 100 thousand tons to eliminate the scale effect in the current experiments the model scale was determined as λ 1 60 after considering the dimensions of basin and tunnel element as well as the capacity of the wave maker the tunnel element model was manufactured from acrylic and concrete and the pontoons were made of light wood the sketch of the manufactured model of the tunnel element and pontoon are shown in fig 1 the geometrical and structural characteristics of the tunnel and pontoon are included in table 1 to obtain accurate motion characteristics of the floating bodies the error of the model parameters in manufacture was controlled within 2 the four mooring wires of the moored sole element and the tunnel pontoons assembly are 367 cm in length each while those of the sole pontoon are 533 cm in length each in model scale the mechanical characteristics of the mooring lines are listed in table 2 for each floating body four mooring lines were symmetrically placed along the x axis and form 60 angle with respect to the x axis as recommended by song et al 2016 the pre tension of all mooring lines was set as 1n in model scale to achieve a better constraint on the floating bodies fig 2 shows the photos of the tunnel and tunnel pontoons assembly moored in the wave basin in the experimental setup non elastic ropes combined with clump weights have been utilized to simulate the model wire such that their mass per unit length satisfies the gravity similarity besides the geometric and mass similarities the elasticity scaling was also considered according to wilson equation the tension deformation curve of the simulating lines was calculated as 1 t m c p d

of appropriate linear springs to match the target elastic properties examples of the theoretical and simulated tension deformation curves are presented in fig 3 it can be observed that excellent agreement was achieved 2 2 experiment equipment and measuring instruments the experiment was conducted in an ocean environmental basin of the state key laboratory of coastal and offshore engineering slcoe dalian university of technology china the basin is 40 m long 24 m wide and 1 2 m deep a piston type wave maker system consisting of 40 pieces of paddles was installed at one end of the basin to generate the desired waves a dissipative gravel beach was set up at the opposite end to prevent the reflection of transmitted waves in order to achieve a totally unidirectional incident wave and prevent lateral wave energy exchange two parallel rows of open type guide wall were installed in the wave basin perpendicular to the wave maker the photograph of the wave basin is displayed in fig 4 a prior to the installation of the floating bodies the wave elevations and wave lengths were measured by wave probes of resistance type placed in which the structure was to be installed during the tests one dimensional tensile gauges were used to record the mooring forces as shown in fig 2 b the motion responses of the tunnel pontoon and tunnel pontoons assembly were measured synchronously by an electromagnetic motion system as shown in fig 2 b the transmitter was fixed on the wooden frame without affecting the magnetic field 1 m above the assembly and emitted space magnetic field as the origin of the reference frame meanwhile the receiver was attached at the top center of the assembly to position and track the real time 6 dofs as described in fig 5 of the rigid body by processing the magnetic signal continuously the accuracy is 1 mm for translations and 0 4deg for rotations all the data were sampled in 50 hz 2 3 experimental conditions in the experiments both regular and irregular waves were generated in the wave basin with 60 cm water depth corresponding to 36 m in prototype the wave height and period were checked and the errors were within 5 for the regular waves the wave period t was simulated in a wide range of 0 52s 3 87s with a constant wave height of 3 33 cm the characteristic parameters of the regular waves in the experiment are listed in table 3 a regarding the irregular waves simulation the joint north sea wave project jonswap spectrum was chosen with the peak enhancement factor γ 3 3 sarpkaya and isaacson 1981 the model peak period ranged in 0 77s 2 58s with significant wave height 2 5 cm the detailed wave parameters of irregular waves were listed in table 3 b according to the 17th international towing tank conference in 1984 a record length equal to 100 times the largest expected single wave period is used to obtain proper spectral shapes and statistical values fig 6 shows the comparison between the measured and targeted spectra under wave conditions of h s 2 5 cm t p 0 77s and 2 58s which match well with each other 2 4 free decay tests before generating waves the free decay tests for the sole moored element pontoon and tunnel pontoons assembly were conducted to obtain the natural periods of the rigid body motion the moored structures were set with a small initial displacement then released to return to their equilibrium position gradually by the hydrostatic restoring moment in combination with the spring stiffness of mooring system fig 7 illustrates the time history of the sway and roll of the tunnel in free decay tests the natural periods of 6 dofs of the three floating bodies are presented in table 4 as expected the natural periods of the tunnel pontoons assembly differ from that of the sole element which can be attributed to the large restoring stiffness and additional weight of the two pontoons with the experimental wave parameters in table 3 it is noted that the natural periods of heave roll and pitch are included in experimental scope 3 results and discussion 3 1 motions under regular waves the motion trajectories of the moored pontoon tunnel and tunnel pontoons assembly under the wave condition of h 3 33 m t 0 90s are illustrated in fig 8 it shows that the low frequency response is dominant in sway surge and yaw which depends mainly on the mooring configuration and its stiffness in particular moreover new equilibrium position drifting from the free surface also can be seen clearly in these motions which are excited by the mean drift force on the other hand heave roll and pitch are mainly governed by the wave frequency in particular the heave and roll of the tunnel show strongly nonlinear characteristics on the crests and troughs due to water on deck occurrence and the violent fluid structure interaction i e hu and kashiwagi 2009 also it is interesting to find the equilibrium position offset of the heave and roll towards downward and anticlockwise respectively which could be caused by the green water on the weather side of the body i e sueyoshi et al 2008 in addition the water on deck has strong influence on heave of the tunnel pontoons assembly but has insignificant effect on the roll due to the considerable restoring moment of the pontoons and the wave shielding effects of the seaward floaters the response amplitude operators rao of the three floating bodies were obtained under regular waves with amplitude of 1 67 cm fig 9 depicts the variation of the maxima and minima of their motions with wave period ranging in 0 52s 3 87s it indicates that the sway exhibits an increasing trend with the wave period the mean value of sway is also plotted against various wave periods in fig 10 to estimate the effects of mean drift force when the incident wave period smaller than the resonant roll period t t roll the sway shows a considerable mean value this is related to the fact that in short waves the larger relative motion between the wave elevation and the body leads to greater diffraction effects and larger mean second order horizontal forces i e pinkster 1979 1980 on the other hand under longer wave of t t roll the floating bodies tend to follow the wave elevation and the mean value of sway reduce along with the drift forces i e huang and law 2013 it is also found that the mean sway of the tunnel pontoons assembly is relatively larger than that of the sole tunnel which can be attributed to larger wetted area of the tunnel pontoons assembly causing more reflected and scattered wave i e buchner 1996 the heave of all the three bodies enlarge as the wave period increases before reaching resonance peaks at their natural periods of 0 77s 1 55s 1 81s respectively which are higher than the wave amplitude in beam waves and then tend to the wave amplitude for longer waves i e lewis 1989 the non zero mean heave in downward direction results from the impact pressures of water on deck i e zhao et al 2014 thus fig 11 illustrates the mean heave as a quantitative observation to exhibit the green water effect on the equilibrium position offset of the heave for various wave periods since the water on deck is negligible for the pontoon the mean heave is found to be near zero as expected whereas the small freeboard of the tunnel contributes to the regular occurrence of water on deck resulting in considerable mean heave value also it can be observed clearly that the mean heave value of the tunnel is larger than that of the tunnel pontoons assembly due to the sheltering effects of the seaward floaters reduce the amount of green water interestingly the mean heave value of both the tunnel and the assembly has a significant dependence on wave period which is similar as the roll this implies that the roll plays an essential role in the phase difference between the body motion and free surface which directly affects the amount of water on deck most importantly it suggests that the resonance roll at t t roll incurs the greatest mean heave in downward direction which has not been reported in previous study to the best of the author s knowledge such heave leads to submerge of the tunnel in water and high risk of the tunnel to collide with the seabed during mooring storage and transportation the roll of the three floating bodies all initially increase and then decrease rapidly with the increase of wave period approaching local peaks around wave period 0 90s 1 29s and 1 16s respectively however the resonant periods of heave and roll have small discrepancies with the natural periods found in the free decay tests which could be due to the coupling effects of other modes induced by wave actions and the hydrodynamic forces i e journee 1991 according to the literature for longer waves of wave period larger than roll period t t roll the roll amplitude tends to the wave slope amplitude and decreases slightly with the increase of wavelength moreover a sizable surge amplitude arises in the sole tunnel and tunnel pontoons assembly around roll resonance period region t t roll and longer periods which may be associated with the coupling of resonance roll and the complex fluid surrounding the bluff body tunnel in long waves respectively the pitch and yaw for the sole tunnel and tunnel pontoons assembly are found to be insignificant in the test scope in contrast it is also noted that the resonance pitch of single pontoon occurs at t 0 77s 3 2 motions under irregular waves fig 12 presents the motion trajectories of the absolute 6 dofs of the pontoon tunnel and tunnel pontoons assembly under irregular wave condition of h s 2 5 cm t p 0 77s fig 13 18 depict the spectra of the sway surge heave roll pitch and yaw of the tunnel pontoon and tunnel pontoons system subjected to irregular waves the peak wave periods ranged in 0 77 2 58s with a constant significant wave height h s 2 5 cm corresponding to wave peak frequency of f p 1 24 to 0 39 hz from the analysis it can be found that 1 for wave peak frequency higher than the roll frequency f p f roll the sway of the tunnel and tunnel pontoons assembly is dominated by the second order drift force and spectral peaks appear at the low frequency f 0 06 hz corresponding to the sway natural period 16 5s for the pontoon however the low frequency response is relatively small and the wave frequency response is dominant for f p f roll a predominant wave frequency occurs in sway of all the three bodies and increases with wave period as the slowly varying drift force attenuate its influence on the low frequency response of the floating bodies in addition the low frequency sway of the tunnel pontoons assembly is smaller than that of the sole tunnel which can be attributed to the larger added mass and damping involved in the oscillation of the body with larger submergence huang and law 2013 2 the surge of the tunnel and tunnel pontoons assembly is mainly controlled by the low frequency in contrast wave frequency surge occurs in the pontoon and becomes dominant in long wave actions the low frequency peaks of the surge of three bodies occur at 0 12 hz 0 046 hz and 0 038 hz respectively these generally match the natural periods in the free decay tests which demonstrates again that the mooring system has a direct influence on the translation response 3 for high frequency waves the heave of the pontoon and tunnel present spectral peaks at their heave frequency f heave 1 24 hz and 0 66 hz respectively rather than the wave spectra peak frequency f p this demonstrates that in wave frequency region the frequency component close to resonance which has largest amplification factor as shown in fig 8 is of great importance to the heave with respect to the heave of the tunnel and tunnel pontoons assembly it is found that for short waves of f p 0 93 hz the low frequency peak value is considerable in contrast with the small wave frequency value and becomes insignificant as the wave frequency region grows rapidly for longer waves moreover for all the three floating bodies the spectral area and the spectral peak value of the heave increase first with the decrease of wave frequency and occur maxima at wave peak frequency close to the heave frequency f p f heave after that in longer waves the heave almost keeps constant as the breadth of the body is relatively small compared with wave length and it tends to follow the waves 4 the roll spectra of the three bodies occurs substantial peak value and area at t p 1 03s 1 29s 1 16s respectively close to their resonance periods the roll of the pontoon and tunnel pontoons assembly reveal significant spectra peaks in peak frequency of jonswap spectrum f p for short waves while combined with another spectral peak in resonant frequency f roll 0 93 hz and 0 85 hz respectively for long waves both peak values decrease significantly with the decrease of wave peak frequency for f p f roll which is not unexpected since the amplification factor of f p decreases and the natural frequency energy in incident wave spectra diminishes moreover it is also indicated that the roll of the tunnel concentrates its response energy in its natural frequency f roll 0 62 hz in test scope 5 the pitch of the three bodies are most significant in peak value at f p 1 24 hz 0 10 hz and 0 08 hz respectively corresponding with their natural periods specifically it can be observed that the natural frequency of pitch f nitch 1 16 hz and 0 70 hz causes the dominant peak values in the pitch of the pontoon and tunnel in test scope however the natural frequency has negligible influence on the pitch of the tunnel pontoons assembly and the magnitude of spectral density at f p 0 85 hz is significant due to the coupling of the roll 6 the yaw of the three floating bodies are subjected to the 2nd order drift forces presenting low frequency response in the spectra similar to the sway and surge the yaw is also governed by the mooring system and the spectral peak occurs close to its natural frequency i e 0 12 hz for the yaw of the pontoon corresponding to its natural period 7 36s 3 3 tension responses under regular waves the tension trajectories of the mooring lines were plotted in fig 19 including the moored tunnel pontoon and tunnel pontoons assembly under regular wave of h 3 33 cm t 0 90s both the tunnel and tunnel pontoons assembly exhibit obvious low frequency mooring tension while wave frequency response is dominant in the mooring tension of the pontoon this corresponds to the sway which plays the critical role in mooring dynamics additionally the predominant sway also introduces a phase lag of π between the seaward and leeward tensions the maximum tensions of the seaward and leeward mooring lines of the three bodies are compared in fig 20 it reveals that the mooring tensions of the moored pontoon is significantly lower than those of the tunnel and tunnel pontoons assembly which could be due to its smaller sway and negligible surge as shown in fig 9 comparing to the sole tunnel the maximum mooring tension of the tunnel pontoons assembly increased in short waves but decreased in long waves in accordance with the sway offset in fig 9 interestingly for the tunnel and tunnel pontoons assembly it indicates that the mooring tensions of the seaward lines are evidently larger than those of the leeward lines when wave period is smaller than roll period t t roll which can be attributed to the non zero mean sway driven by the significant mean drift force in addition for tunnel pontoons assembly the magnitude variation between the seaward and leeward tensions is larger than that of the single tunnel due to the larger wave induced drift as reported in fig 10 moreover for t t roll e g 1 16s for the tunnel pontoons assembly and 1 29s for the tunnel the tension variation between the seaward and leeward lines decrease with increasing wave period which is consistent with the decreasing drift offset of sway equilibrium position suggested in fig 10 additionally in longer wave regime the seaward and leeward mooring tensions both increase gradually with wave period due to larger sway it is also revealed that the leeward tension is relatively larger than seaward tension due to the highly peaked crests and shallower flatter troughs of long waves as a result of shallow water effect 3 4 tension responses under irregular waves fig 21 gives the trajectories of the mooring tensions of the pontoon tunnel and tunnel pontoons assembly under wave condition of h s 2 5 cm and t p 0 77s again it indicates that the seaward tensions are more significant than the leeward tensions especially in the tunnel pontoons assembly which is more sensitive to mean drift forces the mooring tension spectra on the pontoon tunnel and tunnel pontoons assembly are included in fig 22 it demonstrates that the mooring tension of the pontoon is dominated by wave frequency response and shows negligible low frequency response corresponding to the sway spectra and exhibits the largest peak value at f 1 16 hz closely linked to the resonant roll for the mooring tension of the tunnel and tunnel pontoons assembly it reveals that the low frequency tension is predominant for incident wave peak frequency higher than the roll resonance frequency f p f roll while for f p f roll the wave frequency tension becomes dominant specifically the mooring lines of the tunnel pontoons assembly suffered smaller low frequency tension than that of the tunnel for waves of f p 0 77 hz these features above are all consistent with the sway reported in fig 13 moreover comparing to sole tunnel element the wave frequency tension of the tunnel pontoons assembly significantly diminishes in leeward lines especially for long waves but changes little in seaward lines additionally the spectral peak in the low frequency region corresponds to the sway and depends on the mooring configuration for example the low frequency peak of the mooring tension of the tunnel pontoons assembly lies at f 0 06 hz which corresponds to the sway natural period 16 5s 4 conclusions in this paper a 3d physical model experiment was conducted the hydrodynamic response characteristics of the sole tunnel element pontoon and the tunnel pontoons assembly in long wave regime were studied to gain insight into the motions of the floaters in harsh weather main conclusions can be summarized as below 1 due to water on deck occurrence the non zero mean heave downward of the sole tunnel and tunnel pontoons assembly has a close correlation with wave period as the roll and the resonance roll at t t roll incurs the largest mean heave in downward direction the corresponding significant downward movement introduces high risk for the tunnel to collide with the seabed during temporary storage and transportation 2 the mean drift force significantly contributes to the mean sway and seaward mooring tension when t t roll but generally diminishes as wave period t t roll compared to the sole tunnel the mean drift motion is more distinct for the tunnel pontoons assembly which can be attributed to larger wetted area of the tunnel pontoons assembly causing more reflected and scattered wave 3 the heave roll and pitch of the three floating bodies initially increase with wave period and reach resonance peaks in the neighborhood of their own natural periods after that the heave follows the wave amplitude while the roll tends to the wave slope amplitude 4 a sizable surge amplitude arises in the sole tunnel and tunnel pontoons assembly around roll resonance period region t t roll and long period regions which might be associated with the coupling of resonance roll and the asymmetric fluid surrounding the bluff body tunnel in long waves respectively 5 based on the spectral analysis the heave roll and pitch of the sole pontoon and tunnel element show peaks at its natural frequency in wave frequency region due to the significant resonance amplification factors moreover the low frequency drift force plays a key role in the horizontal displacements and mooring tensions of the sole tunnel and tunnel pontoons assembly acknowledgements the work is supported by

irregular waves simulation the joint north sea wave project jonswap spectrum was chosen with the peak enhancement factor γ 3 3 sarpkaya and isaacson 1981 the model peak period ranged in 0 77s 2 58s with significant wave height 2 5 cm the detailed wave parameters of irregular waves were listed in table 3 b according to the 17th international towing tank conference in 1984 a record length equal to 100 times the largest expected single wave period is used to obtain proper spectral shapes and statistical values fig 6 shows the comparison between the measured and targeted spectra under wave conditions of h s 2 5 cm t p 0 77s and 2 58s which match well with each other 2 4 free decay tests before generating waves the free decay tests for the sole moored element pontoon and tunnel pontoons assembly were conducted to obtain the natural periods of the rigid body motion the moored structures were set with a small initial displacement then released to return to their equilibrium position gradually by the hydrostatic restoring moment in combination with the spring stiffness of mooring system fig 7 illustrates the time history of the sway and roll of the tunnel in free decay tests the natural periods of 6 dofs of the three floating bodies are presented in table 4 as expected the natural periods of the tunnel pontoons assembly differ from that of the sole element which can be attributed to the large restoring stiffness and additional weight of the two pontoons with the experimental wave parameters in table 3 it is noted that the natural periods of heave roll and pitch are included in experimental scope 3 results and discussion 3 1 motions under regular waves the motion trajectories of the moored pontoon tunnel and tunnel pontoons assembly under the wave condition of h 3 33 m t 0 90s are illustrated in fig 8 it shows that the low frequency response is dominant in sway surge and yaw which depends mainly on the mooring configuration and its stiffness in particular moreover new equilibrium position drifting from the free surface also can be seen clearly in these motions which are excited by the mean drift force on the other hand heave roll and pitch are mainly governed by the wave frequency in particular the heave and roll of the tunnel show strongly nonlinear characteristics on the crests and troughs due to water on deck occurrence and the violent fluid structure interaction i e hu and kashiwagi 2009 also it is interesting to find the equilibrium position offset of the heave and roll towards downward and anticlockwise respectively which could be caused by the green water on the weather side of the body i e sueyoshi et al 2008 in addition the water on deck has strong influence on heave of the tunnel pontoons assembly but has insignificant effect on the roll due to the considerable restoring moment of the pontoons and the wave shielding effects of the seaward floaters the response amplitude operators rao of the three floating bodies were obtained under regular waves with amplitude of 1 67 cm fig 9 depicts the variation of the maxima and minima of their motions with wave period ranging in 0 52s 3 87s it indicates that the sway exhibits an increasing trend with the wave period the mean value of sway is also plotted against various wave periods in fig 10 to estimate the effects of mean drift force when the incident wave period smaller than the resonant roll period t t roll the sway shows a considerable mean value this is related to the fact that in short waves the larger relative motion between the wave elevation and the body leads to greater diffraction effects and larger mean second order horizontal forces i e pinkster 1979 1980 on the other hand under longer wave of t t roll the floating bodies tend to follow the wave elevation and the mean value of sway reduce along with the drift forces i e huang and law 2013 it is also found that the mean sway of the tunnel pontoons assembly is relatively larger than that of the sole tunnel which can be attributed to larger wetted area of the tunnel pontoons assembly causing more reflected and scattered wave i e buchner 1996 the heave of all the three bodies enlarge as the wave period increases before reaching resonance peaks at their natural periods of 0 77s 1 55s 1 81s respectively which are higher than the wave amplitude in beam waves and then tend to the wave amplitude for longer waves i e lewis 1989 the non zero mean heave in downward direction results from the impact pressures of water on deck i e zhao et al 2014 thus fig 11 illustrates the mean heave as a quantitative observation to exhibit the green water effect on the equilibrium position offset of the heave for various wave periods since the water on deck is negligible for the pontoon the mean heave is found to be near zero as expected whereas the small freeboard of the tunnel contributes to the regular occurrence of water on deck resulting in considerable mean heave value also it can be observed clearly that the mean heave value of the tunnel is larger than that of the tunnel pontoons assembly due to the sheltering effects of the seaward floaters reduce the amount of green water interestingly the mean heave value of both the tunnel and the assembly has a significant dependence on wave period which is similar as the roll this implies that the roll plays an essential role in the phase difference between the body motion and free surface which directly affects the amount of water on deck most importantly it suggests that the resonance roll at t t roll incurs the greatest mean heave in downward direction which has not been reported in previous study to the best of the author s knowledge such heave leads to submerge of the tunnel in water and high risk of the tunnel to collide with the seabed during mooring storage and transportation the roll of the three floating bodies all initially increase and then decrease rapidly with the increase of wave period approaching local peaks around wave period 0 90s 1 29s and 1 16s respectively however the resonant periods of heave and roll have small discrepancies with the natural periods found in the free decay tests which could be due to the coupling effects of other modes induced by wave actions and the hydrodynamic forces i e journee 1991 according to the literature for longer waves of wave period larger than roll period t t roll the roll amplitude tends to the wave slope amplitude and decreases slightly with the increase of wavelength moreover a sizable surge amplitude arises in the sole tunnel and tunnel pontoons assembly around roll resonance period region t t roll and longer periods which may be associated with the coupling of resonance roll and the complex fluid surrounding the bluff body tunnel in long waves respectively the pitch and yaw for the sole tunnel and tunnel pontoons assembly are found to be insignificant in the test scope in contrast it is also noted that the resonance pitch of single pontoon occurs at t 0 77s 3 2 motions under irregular waves fig 12 presents the motion trajectories of the absolute 6 dofs of the pontoon tunnel and tunnel pontoons assembly under irregular wave condition of h s 2 5 cm t p 0 77s fig 13 18 depict the spectra of the sway surge heave roll pitch and yaw of the tunnel pontoon and tunnel pontoons system subjected to irregular waves the peak wave periods ranged in 0 77 2 58s with a constant significant wave height h s 2 5 cm corresponding to wave peak frequency of f p 1 24 to 0 39 hz from the analysis it can be found that 1 for wave peak frequency higher than the roll frequency f p f roll the sway of the tunnel and tunnel pontoons assembly is dominated by the second order drift force and spectral peaks appear at the low frequency f 0 06 hz corresponding to the sway natural period 16 5s for the pontoon however the low frequency response is relatively small and the wave frequency response is dominant for f p f roll a predominant wave frequency occurs in sway of all the three bodies and increases with wave period as the slowly varying drift force attenuate its influence on the low frequency response of the floating bodies in addition the low frequency sway of the tunnel pontoons assembly is smaller than that of the sole tunnel which can be attributed to the larger added mass and damping involved in the oscillation of the body with larger submergence huang and law 2013 2 the surge of the tunnel and tunnel pontoons assembly is mainly controlled by the low frequency in contrast wave frequency surge occurs in the pontoon and becomes dominant in long wave actions the low frequency peaks of the surge of three bodies occur at 0 12 hz 0 046 hz and 0 038 hz respectively these generally match the natural periods in the free decay tests which demonstrates again that the mooring system has a direct influence on the translation response 3 for high frequency waves the heave of the pontoon and tunnel present spectral peaks at their heave frequency f heave 1 24 hz and 0 66 hz respectively rather than the wave spectra peak frequency f p this demonstrates that in wave frequency region the frequency component close to resonance which has largest amplification factor as shown in fig 8 is of great importance to the heave with respect to the heave of the tunnel and tunnel pontoons assembly it is found that for short waves of f p 0 93 hz the low frequency peak value is considerable in contrast with the small wave frequency value and becomes insignificant as the wave frequency region grows rapidly for longer waves moreover for all the three floating bodies the spectral area and the spectral peak value of the heave increase first with the decrease of wave frequency and occur maxima at wave peak frequency close to the heave frequency f p f heave after that in longer waves the heave almost keeps constant as the breadth of the body is relatively small compared with wave length and it tends to follow the waves 4 the roll spectra of the three bodies occurs substantial peak value and area at t p 1 03s 1 29s 1 16s respectively close to their resonance periods the roll of the pontoon and tunnel pontoons assembly reveal significant spectra peaks in peak frequency of jonswap spectrum f p for short waves while combined with another spectral peak in resonant frequency f roll 0 93 hz and 0 85 hz respectively for long waves both peak values decrease significantly with the decrease of wave peak frequency for f p f roll which is not unexpected since the amplification factor of f p decreases and the natural frequency energy in incident wave spectra diminishes moreover it is also indicated that the roll of the tunnel concentrates its response energy in its natural frequency f roll 0 62 hz in test scope 5 the pitch of the three bodies are most significant in peak value at f p 1 24 hz 0 10 hz and 0 08 hz respectively corresponding with their natural periods specifically it can be observed that the natural frequency of pitch f nitch 1 16 hz and 0 70 hz causes the dominant peak values in the pitch of the pontoon and tunnel in test scope however the natural frequency has negligible influence on the pitch of the tunnel pontoons assembly and the magnitude of spectral density at f p 0 85 hz is significant due to the coupling of the roll 6 the yaw of the three floating bodies are subjected to the 2nd order drift forces presenting low frequency response in the spectra similar to the sway and surge the yaw is also governed by the mooring system and the spectral peak occurs close to its natural frequency i e 0 12 hz for the yaw of the pontoon corresponding to its natural period 7 36s 3 3 tension responses under regular waves the tension trajectories of the mooring lines were plotted in fig 19 including the moored tunnel pontoon and tunnel pontoons assembly under regular wave of h 3 33 cm t 0 90s both the tunnel and tunnel pontoons assembly exhibit obvious low frequency mooring tension while wave frequency response is dominant in the mooring tension of the pontoon this corresponds to the sway which plays the critical role in mooring dynamics additionally the predominant sway also introduces a phase lag of π between the seaward and leeward tensions the maximum tensions of the seaward and leeward mooring lines of the three bodies are compared in fig 20 it reveals that the mooring tensions of the moored pontoon is significantly lower than those of the tunnel and tunnel pontoons assembly which could be due to its smaller sway and negligible surge as shown in fig 9 comparing to the sole tunnel the maximum mooring tension of the tunnel pontoons assembly increased in short waves but decreased in long waves in accordance with the sway offset in fig 9 interestingly for the tunnel and tunnel pontoons assembly it indicates that the mooring tensions of the seaward lines are evidently larger than those of the leeward lines when wave period is smaller than roll period t t roll which can be attributed to the non zero mean sway driven by the significant mean drift force in addition for tunnel pontoons assembly the magnitude variation between the seaward and leeward tensions is larger than that of the single tunnel due to the larger wave induced drift as reported in fig 10 moreover for t t roll e g 1 16s for the tunnel pontoons assembly and 1 29s for the tunnel the tension variation between the seaward and leeward lines decrease with increasing wave period which is consistent with the decreasing drift offset of sway equilibrium position suggested in fig 10 additionally in longer wave regime the seaward and leeward mooring tensions both increase gradually with wave period due to larger sway it is also revealed that the leeward tension is relatively larger than seaward tension due to the highly peaked crests and shallower flatter troughs of long waves as a result of shallow water effect 3 4 tension responses under irregular waves fig 21 gives the trajectories of the mooring tensions of the pontoon tunnel and tunnel pontoons assembly under wave condition of h s 2 5 cm and t p 0 77s again it indicates that the seaward tensions are more significant than the leeward tensions especially in the tunnel pontoons assembly which is more sensitive to mean drift forces the mooring tension spectra on the pontoon tunnel and tunnel pontoons assembly are included in fig 22 it demonstrates that the mooring tension of the pontoon is dominated by wave frequency response and shows negligible low frequency response corresponding to the sway spectra and exhibits the largest peak value at f 1 16 hz closely linked to the resonant roll for the mooring tension of the tunnel and tunnel pontoons assembly it reveals that the low frequency tension is predominant for incident wave peak frequency higher than the roll resonance frequency f p f roll while for f p f roll the wave frequency tension becomes dominant specifically the mooring lines of the tunnel pontoons assembly suffered smaller low frequency tension than that of the tunnel for waves of f p 0 77 hz these features above are all consistent with the sway reported in fig 13 moreover comparing to sole tunnel element the wave frequency tension of the tunnel pontoons assembly significantly diminishes in leeward lines especially for long waves but changes little in seaward lines additionally the spectral peak in the low frequency region corresponds to the sway and depends on the mooring configuration for example the low frequency peak of the mooring tension of the tunnel pontoons assembly lies at f 0 06 hz which corresponds to the sway natural period 16 5s 4 conclusions in this paper a 3d physical model experiment was conducted the hydrodynamic response characteristics of the sole tunnel element pontoon and the tunnel pontoons assembly in long wave regime were studied to gain insight into the motions of the floaters in harsh weather main conclusions can be summarized as below 1 due to water on deck occurrence the non zero mean heave downward of the sole tunnel and tunnel pontoons assembly has a close correlation with wave period as the roll and the resonance roll at t t roll incurs the largest mean heave in downward direction the corresponding significant downward movement introduces high risk for the tunnel to collide with the seabed during temporary storage and transportation 2 the mean drift force significantly contributes to the mean sway and seaward mooring tension when t t roll but generally diminishes as wave period t t roll compared to the sole tunnel the mean drift motion is more distinct for the tunnel pontoons assembly which can be attributed to larger wetted area of the tunnel pontoons assembly causing more reflected and scattered wave 3 the heave roll and pitch of the three floating bodies initially increase with wave period and reach resonance peaks in the neighborhood of their own natural periods after that the heave follows the wave amplitude while the roll tends to the wave slope amplitude 4 a sizable surge amplitude arises in the sole tunnel and tunnel pontoons assembly around roll resonance period region t t roll and long period regions which might be associated with the coupling of resonance roll and the asymmetric fluid surrounding the bluff body tunnel in long waves respectively 5 based on the spectral analysis the heave roll and pitch of the sole pontoon and tunnel element show peaks at its natural frequency in wave frequency region due to the significant resonance amplification factors moreover the low frequency drift force plays a key role in the horizontal displacements and mooring tensions of the sole tunnel and tunnel pontoons assembly acknowledgements the work is supported by

correspond all the problems arising in nature because of its complexity and nonlinearity as a consequence of this event scientists studied on arbitrary order differentiation and integration thus fractional calculus which is known as arbitrary order differentiation and integration aroused fractional calculus have been widely used to express real world problems by many scientists in recent

wilson has also described the relation between the dsw equation and the affine lie algebra c 2 1 the equation is used to describe nonlinear surface gravity waves propagating over horizontal seabed due to the significant and crucial applications in physical sciences many researchers have done considerable work to obtain exact and approximate solutions of dsw equation an unusual feature of this

a few definition of fractional derivative of order α 0 nearly all of them includes integral form in their definitions the most widely used are the riemann liouville and caputo fractional derivatives

previously a perturbation iteration method has been proposed by aksoy pakdemirli and their co workers aksoy and pakdemirli 2010 in this technique an iterative algorithm is constructed on the

correspond all the problems arising in nature because of its complexity and nonlinearity as a consequence of this event scientists studied on arbitrary order differentiation and integration thus fractional calculus which is known as arbitrary order differentiation and integration aroused fractional calculus have been widely used to express real world problems by many scientists in recent years rezazadeh et al 2018c it has been extensively researched and implemented for many models in various branches of science and engineering such as fluid flow electrical network mathematical physics

wilson has also described the relation between the dsw equation and the affine lie algebra c 2 1 the equation is used to describe nonlinear surface gravity waves propagating over horizontal seabed due to the significant and crucial applications in physical sciences many researchers have done considerable work to obtain exact and approximate solutions of dsw equation an unusual feature of this system is that it offers a new type of solution called static solitons interacting with moving solitons without undergoing deformation later on jimbo and miwa 1983 established a relationship between infinite dimensional lie algebras and soliton equations also hirota et al 1986 presented that the dsw equation could be extracted from a six reduction of the kadomtsev petviashvili hierarchy in this

a few definition of fractional derivative of order α 0 nearly all of them includes integral form in their definitions the most widely used are the riemann liouville and caputo fractional derivatives recently a new definition of a fractional derivative called the conformable fractional derivative has been proposed by r khalil et al 2014 definition 1 1 let f 0 is a function α t h order conformable

23297,with the development of terrestrial networks and satellite constellations vessel movement information can be effectively collected based on automatic identification system ais receivers vessel motion pattern classification using ais plays an important role in maritime monitoring and management however classifying vast amounts of vessel motion information is prohibitive workload the aim of this study is to develop effective methods that can aid in automatic vessel motion pattern classification in inland waterways first the least squares cubic spline curves approximation lcsca technique is used to represent the vessel motion trajectory then a traditional classification model based on lp norm 0 p 1 sparse representation is improved to classify vessel motion patterns and a matching pursuit fletcher reeves mpfr method is developed to find the sparse solutions of the proposed model to validate the performance of the proposed model two ais datasets from the yangtze river are collected and applied in our experiment according to the results we can know that the proposed model can effectively classify vessel motion pattern in inland waterways and the effectiveness of the proposed model is superior to those of other representative classification methods keywords waterway transportation classification model vessel motion pattern sparse reconstruction automatic identification system 1 introduction the automatic identification system ais data can be divided into three different types international maritime organization 2003 static data dynamic data and voyage related data vessel information such as vessel name type speed position and heading can be obtained from ais in recent years advancement in electronic tracking techniques remote sensing techniques and communication techniques has enabled the development and application ais in addition legislations are now mandatory to have ais equipment on board of international voyaging ships with 300 or more gross tonnage and cargo ships of 500 gross tons for the safety of life at sea solas in china inland waterways ships are required to install ais by the maritime safety administration msa therefore due to these legislations and the development of sensor technology ais has been widely applied in the maritime monitoring and management classifying vessel motion patterns is one of the most important aspects of analyzing the ais data and it is useful for enhancing maritime monitoring ship safety and management technology for instance ship accidents may be avoided if the maritime authority can understand and warn against making dangerous ship movements according to historical movements of vessels that had the same class of motion pattern therefore many researchers are increasingly starting to pay attention to analyzing ais data as mentioned above ais can provide many kinds of vessel information in addition more and more vessels are applied in inland waterways in china due to low price and good policy thus vast amounts of ais dataset are collected however the manual analysis of such large volumes of data involves a prohibitively large workload according to the needs of many practical applications extensive scholars focus on the classification model to identify object e g vehicle moving patterns however few studies pay attention to classify vessel motion patterns therefore it is imperative to develop an effective method that can aid in the automatic classification of vessel motion patterns using ais data for improving maritime management techniques and safety awareness in china although inland waterways transportation is fast developing the transportation management develops slowly in order to improve vessel monitoring and management in inland waterways we only focus on inland waterways in this study an object motion characterization can be described using motion trajectory that contain a sequence of position points the motion trajectory has been widely employed to identify object motion patterns action recognition and so on bennewitz 2005 calinon et al 2007 moldenhauer et al 2006 psarrou et al 2002 yang et al 2002 hu et al 2013 thus motion trajectories play an important role in the classification of moving patterns for example schuldt et al calinon et al 2007 use motion trajectories to represent human action such as walking jogging and hand clapping and a radial basis support vector machine svm is employed to classify human actions yang et al 2002 a motion trajectory is used to describe the gesture motion and gesture motion pattern can be classified using svm model yu and barner 2008 based on motion trajectory liao et al 2007 propose a classification model using hierarchically structured conditional random fields to identify human motion patterns sun et al 2015 propose a classification model to identify human motion patterns using beta process hidden markov models bp hmm based on human motion trajectories shao and li cheng et al 2016 propose two representation methods that are fingerlets for static gesture representations and strokelets for trajectory gesture representations based on two representation methods image to class dynamic time warping i2c dtw method is proposed to classify hand gestures based on motion trajectory a dynamic bayesian network dbn model is used by santos et al 2015 to classify human action in order to improve the performance and effectiveness of the model a sliding window approach is applied fielda et al field et al 2015 use motion trajectory to describe human motions then an unsupervised classification method is developed based on a dynamic time alignment of gaussian mixture model clusters using human motion trajectories chen et al 2011 propose cluster method to classify human motion patterns in this method the long term future motion can be also predicted although the object motion patterns can be classified based on motion trajectory and learning methods a large number of training trajectory is needed to training the model for ais dataset labeling vessel motion patterns is a large workload by manually in addition the ais dataset is often missing or incomplete thus it is difficult to obtain sufficient training samples from ais dataset these learning methods introduced above may not achieve satisfactory performance the sparse representation classification src method is a novel idea in the field of classification a good performance using src can be achieved even if the features of training samples are insufficient or incomplete the core problem of src is solve the l0 minimization which is considered as an np hard problem amaldi and kann 1998 to this end many studies change l0 minimization problems into l1 minimization ones thus many convex optimization solvers e g the second order core programming solver can be used to solve the sparse representation models within polynomial time for example the src based on l1 minimization is firstly used to identify human faces by wright et al 2009 li et al 2011 use the src method to classify motion pattern in this study a dictionary of src is generated using the trajectories expected from video surveillance based on convex optimization solvers the sparse coefficients can be obtained according to the dictionary and sparse coefficients object motion pattern can be classified similarly in another study by ahmadi et al 2016 src model based on l1 minimization is developed to classify vehicle motion patterns however the performance of src with l1 minimization cannot achieve satisfactory performance because the sparsity of solutions from l1 minimization is affected from the values of the entries in the norm to this end some researchers propose the src model with an lp minimization 0 p 1 to find sparser solutions the problem of lp minimization is not convex thus the convex optimization solvers cannot be used to solve the sparse representation models in order to address this problem some studies prove that the local optimal solution of lp minimization can replace the global optimal solutions of l1 minimization chartrand 2007a 2007b fan and li 2001 nikolova 2005 the optimization solutions can be obtained even if the global optimal solutions cannot be found for instance chen et al 2017 propose a hybrid algorithm where a quasi newton orthogonal matching pursuit approach is proposed to effectively find the sparse solutions of sparse representation models based on lp minimization in this study a src model based on the lp minimization is proposed to classify vessel motion patterns the distance between the test samples and the training samples is used to improve the sparse representation classification model to solve the proposed model a novel method matching pursuit fletcher reeves mpfr is developed in this study to validate the performance of the proposed method two ais datasets from the yangtze river are used in our experiment the results show that the classification accuracies of the proposed method are superior to those of other representative classification methods including naive bayes classification nbc support vector machine svm k nearest neighbor knn and sparse reconstruction classification with lp norm src lp l1 norm src l1 and l2 norm src l2 the main contributions of this study are as follows 1 the improved sparse reconstruction classification model is developed to classify vessel motion patterns in inland waterways 2 a novel method matching pursuit fletcher reeves mpfr is proposed to solve the proposed sparse reconstruction classification model the rest of this study is structured as follows in section 2 the methodology used in this paper is introduced the experimental dataset and results are described and analyzed in section 3 finally we present the conclusion and discuss future work in section 4 2 methodology 2 1 trajectory representation the motion trajectory which can describe a sequence of moving positions of a tracked object plays an important role in the field of moving patterns classification therefore motion trajectories are applied to classify vessel motion patterns in this study since the motion trajectories of vessels collected by ais are of different lengths they cannot be directly used in src to obtain fixed length vectors of motion trajectories the least squares cubic spline curves approximation lcsca technique is employed sillito and fisher 2010 in this method due to the complexity of the shape of curves can be described by spline curves each motion trajectory can be approximated using a uniform cubic b spline curve a curve often can be generated by a sequence of points which are called control points in this study given a vessel trajectory sequence in x y t space b spline control points can be used to represent both the shape and spatio temporal profiles of a trajectory t x y t 1 t 2 t n x 1 y 1 t 1 x 2 y 2 t 2 x n y n t n in the form of a parametric vector c x y c 1 x c 2 x c 3 x c p x c 1 y c 2 y c 3 y c p y where p is the number of control points n is the length of trajectory c p x is the represented x coordinate of the p th control point and c p y is the represented y coordinate of the p th control point the detail of lcsca technique can be found appendix a fig 1 shows a vessel trajectory being normalized by the lcsca technique 2 2 the proposed classification model according to the src technique any new test sample can be approximated using a linear combination of training samples in this study the sample is the vessel trajectory and each training trajectory can be described as a vector d d r m based on lcsca if there are h classes in the entire training set the dictionary d of src can be described as follows 1 d d 1 d 2 d h d 1 1 d 1 n d h 1 d h n r m n where d i d i 1 d i n 1 i h is a sub set of the training samples from class i and n is the number of the samples in class i according to the theory of sparse representation all of the test samples y y 1 y 2 y η can be represented by the dictionary d as y da where a is the representation coefficient vector of y on d y t 1 t 2 t n fig 2 shows an example of a data sample represented by a dictionary based on sparse representation see fig 2 to find a the following model can be used 2 a ˆ arg min y d a 2 2 λ a 0 where a 0 is the l 0 norm of a according to the residuals and the corresponding training sample in the dictionary the class of test sample can be identified as follow r y d a 2 3 c l a s s i f i c a t i o n y a r g m i n i r i i 1 2 3 h fig 3 shows an example of vessel trajectory classification using src 950 training samples are used to generate the training dictionary of src which consists of 18 classes the test sample can be represented by training samples from different classes according to the calculations of residuals the residual from class 2 has the minimum value thus the class of the test trajectory is class 2 however solving model 2 has the well known np hard in order to find solution many studies often change this nonconvex problem l0 minimization into a convex problem such as l1 minimization and l2 minimization the l1 minimization problem can be formulated as follows min a ˆ a 1 4 s t y d a 2 2 ε the solution of model 4 can be obtained in polynomial time using second order core programming or standard linear programming solvers if the solution of model 4 is sufficiently sparse the solution can be considered as the solution of model 2 in term of the theories of compressed sensing candes and tao 2005 however the solution of model is often insufficiently sparse in practice chen et al 2010 similarly many studies change l0 minimization problem into l2 minimization problem the model 2 can be transformed as follows min a ˆ a 2 5 s t y d a 2 2 ε although the solution of model 4 can be found using some heuristic methods the solution is also far from sparsity in practice recently some studies find that the sparser solution can be obtained based on lp minimization thus l p norm regularized problems is applied in this study the model 2 can be transformed as follow 6 f a ˆ arg min y d a 2 2 λ a p to enhance the effectiveness of src a regularization based on euclidean distance is employed in the src model the model 11 can be rewritten as follows 7 f a ˆ a r g m i n y d a 2 2 λ a p w e y d a where w is a regularization coefficient corresponding to e y d a and e y d a is the euclidean distance between the test trajectory and the selected training dictionary as mentioned above the optimization problem of lp minimization is not convex and convex optimization solvers cannot be applied to solve the sparse representation models to this end a matching pursuit fletcher reeves mpfr algorithm is developed to obtain the solution of model 12 image 1 fig 4 shows the framework of the proposed method first vessel motion trajectories are represented by lcsca and vessel motion trajectories generate a dictionary of src then the dictionary and test trajectory are input into the improved src model based on the l p norm in order to find sparse coefficients a novel method mpfr is proposed finally the class of vessel motion trajectory can be classified in term of the minimizing the residual 3 experiments and results to validate the performance and effectiveness of the proposed method two datasets were used in this study the vessel trajectories are collected using the ais base stations which are installed beside the yangtze river bridge in wuhan and jiangyin bridge in taizhou the researched areas and sensor devices are shown in fig 5 for the collected ais data it is necessary to eliminate data that contain errors or missing parts then 600 trajectories are selected as the dataset in this study for the wuhan dataset there are 5 classes of vessel motion patterns from qingchuange to huanghelou port class 1 c1 from qingchuange to hanyangmen port class 2 c2 from hanshui river to container terminal class 3 c3 from hanshui river to yangtze river class 4 c4 and from upstream to downstream of the yangtze river class 5 c5 for the taizhou dataset 5 classes of vessel motion patterns are also defined fig 6 shows all of the motion patterns of sailing in the yangtze river general information about the dataset is shown in table 1 in this study all the experiments are conducted in matlab the lcsca method is applied to ensure that the vessel trajectories all have the same dimension however the number of control points of lcsca must be selected because the number of control points is considered as a significant factor affecting classification accuracy to find the optimized number of control points the proposed method is conducted under a different number of control points ranging from 6 to 15 in this study and the average classification accuracies for each choice are compared and shown in fig 7 according to fig 7 the choice of 8 control points can achieve the best classification accuracy therefore 8 control points are used to normalize the vessel trajectories in this study to test the performance and effectiveness of the proposed method support vector machine svm k nearest neighbor knn sparse reconstruction classification with l 1 norm src l1 sparse reconstruction classification with l 2 norm src l2 and sparse reconstruction classification with l p norm src lp are applied and compared to measure the performance of the proposed method true positive rate tpr and false positive rate fpr are used tpr is defined as follows tpr t p t p f n where tp is the number of a class of vessel motions correctly classified as a class and fn is the number of a class of vessel motions wrongly identified as other classes tpr can illustrate the rate at which the a class of vessel motions are correctly classified fpr is defined as follows fpr f p f p t n where fp represents the number of other classes incorrectly detected as a class and tn is the number of other classes that have been correctly classified as other classes fpr represents the percentage of members of a class sample detected as belonging to other classes table 2 show the classification accuracy using different classifiers on the wuhan datasets according to the classification accuracy results the proposed method can achieve highest accuracy for each class 91 for c1 91 6 for c2 91 9 for c3 90 5 for c4 and 90 8 for c5 and the proposed method can obtain the best average classification accuracy 91 2 followed by src lp at 89 3 the src l1 at 88 8 the src l2 at 87 4 the knn at 87 1 and the svm at 86 in addition the results of average fpr using six classifies under wuhan datasets are recorded in fig 8 according to the results we can know that the fpr of our method is lower than the other compared methods it can indicate that the number of other classes incorrectly identified as detected class using the proposed method is less than it using compared methods table 3 shows the classification accuracy results using src lp the src l1 the src l2 the knn the svm and the proposed method on the wuhan datasets as can be seen from table 3 the classification accuracy of each class show the proposed method is better than the compared methods according to the average classification accuracy of each class the best one is obtained by the proposed method 89 8 and the worst is by svm 83 9 for further analysis the average fpr results are shown in fig 9 the results shown in fig 9 illustrate that the proposed method achieves better performance compared with the other methods therefore we can know that the proposed method outperforms the compared methods 4 conclusions classification of vessel motion patterns is one of the most important aspects of analyzing ais data and it is useful for improving maritime monitoring ship safety and management technology however manually analyzing such large volumes of data is a prohibitively large workload using machine learning methods vessel motion patterns can be automatically classified however labeling vessel trajectories from the ais dataset is also a prohibitive workload due to the large amounts of data furthermore the ais dataset is often missing or incomplete thus these classification methods such as hmm and svm that need a large number of complete training samples to finish classification model may not achieve a satisfactory performance to classify vessel motion patterns in this study an improved src model based on lp norm is proposed to classify vessel motion patterns in addition the distance between the test samples and the training samples is used to improve the sparse representation classification model in order to find the solution of the

23297,with the development of terrestrial networks and satellite constellations vessel movement information can be effectively collected based on automatic identification system ais receivers vessel motion pattern classification using ais plays an important role in maritime monitoring and management however classifying vast amounts of vessel motion information is prohibitive workload the aim of this study is to develop effective methods that can aid in automatic vessel motion pattern classification in inland waterways first the least squares cubic spline curves approximation lcsca technique is used to represent the vessel motion trajectory then a traditional classification model based on lp norm 0 p 1 sparse representation is improved to classify vessel motion patterns and a matching pursuit fletcher reeves mpfr method is developed to find the sparse solutions of the proposed model to validate the performance of the proposed model two ais datasets from the yangtze river are collected and applied in our experiment according to the results we can know that the proposed model can effectively classify vessel motion pattern in inland waterways and the effectiveness of the proposed model is superior to those of other representative classification methods keywords waterway transportation classification model vessel motion pattern sparse reconstruction automatic identification system 1 introduction the automatic identification system ais data can be divided into three different types international maritime organization 2003 static data dynamic data and voyage related data vessel information such as vessel name type speed position and heading can be obtained from ais in recent years advancement in electronic tracking techniques remote sensing techniques and communication techniques has enabled the development and application ais in addition legislations are now mandatory to have ais equipment on board of international voyaging ships with 300 or more gross tonnage and cargo ships of 500 gross tons for the safety of life at sea solas in china inland waterways ships are required to install ais by the maritime safety administration msa therefore due to these legislations and the development of sensor technology ais has been widely applied in the maritime monitoring and management classifying vessel motion patterns is one of the most important aspects of analyzing the ais data and it is useful for enhancing maritime monitoring ship safety and management technology for instance ship accidents may be avoided if the maritime authority can understand and warn against making dangerous ship movements according to historical movements of vessels that had the same class of motion pattern therefore many researchers are increasingly starting to pay attention to analyzing ais data as mentioned above ais can provide many kinds of vessel information in addition more and more vessels are applied in inland waterways in china due to low price and good policy thus vast amounts of ais dataset are collected however the manual analysis of such large volumes of data involves a prohibitively large workload according to the needs of many practical applications extensive scholars focus on the classification model to identify object e g vehicle moving patterns however few studies pay attention to classify vessel motion patterns therefore it is imperative to develop an effective method that can aid in the automatic classification of vessel motion patterns using ais data for improving maritime management techniques and safety awareness in china although inland waterways transportation is fast developing the transportation management develops slowly in order to improve vessel monitoring and management in inland waterways we only focus on inland waterways in this study an object motion characterization can be described using motion trajectory that contain a sequence of position points the motion trajectory has been widely employed to identify object motion patterns action recognition and so on bennewitz 2005 calinon et al 2007 moldenhauer et al 2006 psarrou et al 2002 yang et al 2002 hu et al 2013 thus motion trajectories play an important role in the classification of moving patterns for example schuldt et al calinon et al 2007 use motion trajectories to represent human action such as walking jogging and hand clapping and a radial basis support vector machine svm is employed to classify human actions yang et al 2002 a motion trajectory is used to describe the gesture motion and gesture motion pattern can be classified using svm model yu and barner 2008 based on motion trajectory liao et al 2007 propose a classification model using hierarchically structured conditional random fields to identify human motion patterns sun et al 2015 propose a classification model to identify human motion patterns using beta process hidden markov models bp hmm based on human motion trajectories shao and li cheng et al 2016 propose two representation methods that are fingerlets for static gesture representations and strokelets for trajectory gesture representations based on two representation methods image to class dynamic time warping i2c dtw method is proposed to classify hand gestures based on motion trajectory a dynamic bayesian network dbn model is used by santos et al 2015 to classify human action in order to improve the performance and effectiveness of the model a sliding window approach is applied fielda et al field et al 2015 use motion trajectory to describe human motions then an unsupervised classification method is developed based on a dynamic time alignment of gaussian mixture model clusters using human motion trajectories chen et al 2011 propose cluster method to classify human motion patterns in this method the long term future motion can be also predicted although the object motion patterns can be classified based on motion trajectory and learning methods a large number of training trajectory is needed to training the model for ais dataset labeling vessel motion patterns is a large workload by manually in addition the ais dataset is often missing or incomplete thus it is difficult to obtain sufficient training samples from ais dataset these learning methods introduced above may not achieve satisfactory performance the sparse representation classification src method is a novel idea in the field of classification a good performance using src can be achieved even if the features of training samples are insufficient or incomplete the core problem of src is solve the l0 minimization which is considered as an np hard problem amaldi and kann 1998 to this end many studies change l0 minimization problems into l1 minimization ones thus many convex optimization solvers e g the second order core programming solver can be used to solve the sparse representation models within polynomial time for example the src based on l1 minimization is firstly used to identify human faces by wright et al 2009 li et al 2011 use the src method to classify motion pattern in this study a dictionary of src is generated using the trajectories expected from video surveillance based on convex optimization solvers the sparse coefficients can be obtained according to the dictionary and sparse coefficients object motion pattern can be classified similarly in another study by ahmadi et al 2016 src model based on l1 minimization is developed to classify vehicle motion patterns however the performance of src with l1 minimization cannot achieve satisfactory performance because the sparsity of solutions from l1 minimization is affected from the values of the entries in the norm to this end some researchers propose the src model with an lp minimization 0 p 1 to find sparser solutions the problem of lp minimization is not convex thus the convex optimization solvers cannot be used to solve the sparse representation models in order to address this problem some studies prove that the local optimal solution of lp minimization can replace the global optimal solutions of l1 minimization chartrand 2007a 2007b fan and li 2001 nikolova 2005 the optimization solutions can be obtained even if the global optimal solutions cannot be found for instance chen et al 2017 propose a hybrid algorithm where a quasi newton orthogonal matching pursuit approach is proposed to effectively find the sparse solutions of sparse representation models based on lp minimization in this study a src model based on the lp minimization is proposed to classify vessel motion patterns the distance between the test samples and the training samples is used to improve the sparse representation classification model to solve the proposed model a novel method matching pursuit fletcher reeves mpfr is developed in this study to validate the performance of the proposed method two ais datasets from the yangtze river are used in our experiment the results show that the classification accuracies of the proposed method are superior to those of other representative classification methods including naive bayes classification nbc support vector machine svm k nearest neighbor knn and sparse reconstruction classification with lp norm src lp l1 norm src l1 and l2 norm src l2 the main contributions of this study are as follows 1 the improved sparse reconstruction classification model is developed to classify vessel motion patterns in inland waterways 2 a novel method matching pursuit fletcher reeves mpfr is proposed to solve the proposed sparse reconstruction classification model the rest of this study is structured as follows in section 2 the methodology used in this paper is introduced the experimental dataset and results are described and analyzed in section 3 finally we present the conclusion and discuss future work in section 4 2 methodology 2 1 trajectory representation the motion trajectory which can describe a sequence of moving positions of a tracked object plays an important role in the field of moving patterns classification therefore motion trajectories are applied to classify vessel motion patterns in this study since the motion trajectories of vessels collected by ais are of different lengths they cannot be directly used in src to obtain fixed length vectors of motion trajectories the least squares cubic spline curves approximation lcsca technique is employed sillito and fisher 2010 in this method due to the complexity of the shape of curves can be described by spline curves each motion trajectory can be approximated using a uniform cubic b spline curve a curve often can be generated by a sequence of points which are called control points in this study given a vessel trajectory sequence in x y t space b spline control points can be used to represent both the shape and spatio temporal profiles of a trajectory t x y t 1 t 2 t n x 1 y 1 t 1 x 2 y 2 t 2 x n y n t n in the form of a parametric vector c

the represented y coordinate of the p th control point the detail of lcsca technique can be found appendix a fig 1 shows a vessel trajectory being normalized by the lcsca technique 2 2 the proposed

represented by a dictionary based on sparse representation see fig 2 to find a the following model can be used 2 a ˆ arg min y d a 2 2 λ a 0 where a 0 is the l 0 norm of a according to the residuals

find that the sparser solution can be obtained based on lp minimization thus l p norm regularized problems is applied in this study the model 2 can be transformed as follow 6 f a ˆ arg min y d a 2 2 λ a p to enhance the effectiveness of src a regularization based on euclidean distance is employed in the src model the model 11 can be rewritten as follows 7 f a ˆ a r g m i n y d a 2 2 λ a p w e y d a where w is a regularization coefficient corresponding to e y d a and e y d a is the euclidean distance between the test trajectory and the selected training dictionary as mentioned above the optimization problem of lp minimization is not convex and convex optimization solvers cannot be applied to solve the sparse representation models to this end a matching pursuit fletcher reeves mpfr algorithm is developed to obtain the solution of model 12 image 1 fig 4 shows the framework of the proposed method first vessel motion trajectories are represented by lcsca and vessel motion

23298,this work develops a method for controlling a robotic fish as it swims in a school by following periodic stimuli generated by a neighboring robot to track the motion of a periodically oscillating neighboring source the hydrodynamic pressure around the body of the robotic fish is measured by a pvdf sensor attached to the robot the pressure induced by the source is obtained by subtracting the predicted pressure generated by the robotic fish from the measured pressure the controlled fish tail mechanism is represented as an oscillator and a moving oscillating sphere is considered to be an external source a dipole model based on the potential flow theory is used to predict the hydrodynamic pressure close to the fish tail the relative phase between the tail and the oscillating source is estimated from the pressure measurements of the pvdf sensor the difference in phase angle between the tail and the oscillating source is used to determine the torque used to drive the tail mechanism the proposed method is demonstrated by the tank experiments that involve a captured model of a robotic fish that swims close to an oscillating source keywords biomimetic pvdf oscillator dipole phase following 1 introduction robotic fish are designed to mimic the motion of real fish given their ability to hover precisely and turn swiftly the robotic fish are also expected to mimic real fish behaviors such as shoaling and schooling fish obtain many benefits from shoaling schooling behavior including time saving in finding prey and defence against predators shaw 1978 hydrodynamic efficiency is also increased as schooling fish swim in a diamond pattern due to fish extracting energy from the kármán vortex street generated by the leading fish weihs 1973 in fish schools the preferred distance between a fish and its nearest neighbor is around one body length partridge 1982 one possible method for a fish staying in the moving school is to employ the lateral line organ distributed from its head to its tail to sense the displacement of water pitcher et al 1976 to understand how the lateral line system can help real fish to school scientists analyzed environmental stimuli to the system under different situations studies show that by calculating the distributions of the pressure difference and pressure gradient of adjacent pores on the surface of a fish body near field information such as location and movement of a source as well as the existence of a plane surface can be encoded hassan 1992 coombs and braun 2003 windsor et al 2010 thus a pressure sensor array is devised to determine the pressure gradient of kármán vortex street venturelli et al 2012 the position of a robotic fish in a kármán vortex street behind an object in a flow was controlled using the feedback of pressure signals measured by the sensor array installed in the robot s head salumäe and kruusmaa 2013 a recent study also utilizes the measured pressure variations in the surrounding of the robotic fish to sense the kinematic conditions of an adjacent robotic fish zheng et al 2018 from the above a robotic fish is expected to have the ability to measure pressure signals that are generated by periodic movements in its nearby environment to enable it to swim properly in a school it has also been found that while swimming in a kármán vortex street real fish alternate their body motions to synchronize with the vortices and to maintain their positions liao et al 2003 similarly robotic fish should adjust their body motion in response to environmental pressure signals obtained using some forms of pressure sensing yen et al 2018 although previous research showed that real fish could guide themselves by sensing the pressure variations of the surrounding flow field to move there are few studies on robotic fish formation using pressure feedback control the present work suggests that the school formation for a robotic fish to follow a neighbor depends on maintaining their relative distance and that relative phase rather than pressure intensity determines the torque command sent from the controller to the tail fin for speed control the speed of a robotic fish can be controlled by adjusting the beating frequency of the tail guo 2009 kopman et al 2015 when two robotic fish swim in parallel and keep the same phase of their tail motions the speed for following can be achieved the speed following strategy presented here is to control the relative phase of the oscillating tail to that of an adjacent neighbor as the distance is close enough to detect the neighbor it is only phase that needs to be controlled this work proposes a controller design for robotic fish to follow an oscillating source an oscillator based method is used to model the fin oscillation another oscillator model is used to represent the oscillating source the objective is to control the phase difference between the tail motion of a robotic fish and the oscillation of the source first the motions of the tail fin and the source are described as nonlinear oscillators with a constant frequency ratio to obtain information about the motion of the source a polyvinylidene fluoride pvdf pressure sensor is placed on the surface of the robot to measure the hydrodynamic pressure generated by the oscillating source in experiments a mechanism drives a small ball to generate the oscillating source and the robotic fish is constrained but not restricted to exhibit yaw motions according to the potential flow theory the hydrodynamic pressure signals generated by the oscillating source are related to its motion and can be used as the phase control input to the tail oscillator control of the tail to follow the oscillating source which moves with different forward velocities is tested to evaluate the effectiveness of the phase control the experimental results reveal that control using the desired phase difference between the tail of the robotic fish and the oscillating source can be achieved presenting the possibility of synchronizing the motions of two robotic fish this paper is organized as follows sections 2 and 3 introduce the modeling and the design of the control system respectively section 4 provides experimental data and section 5 provides concluding remarks 2 modeling of hydrodynamic pressure the dynamic model of the robotic fish is nonlinear and can be derived using euler lagrange equations guo and joeng 2004 to control the tail motion of the robot the tail is assumed to oscillate with small amplitudes and the coupling terms between the tail angle and other state variables are assumed to be relatively small the dynamic model of the tail can thus be decoupled from the whole dynamic model of the robotic fish and represented as follows seo et al 2010 1 i θ 1 β 0 θ 1 β 1 θ 1 θ 1 k s θ 1 τ a δ where θ 1 is the angular motion of the tail relative to the center line of the body as shown in fig 1 i is the moment of inertia which comprises the moments of inertia of the tail and added mass and k s is the stiffness of the tail β 0 β 1 θ 1 is the nonlinear damping term and δ is the small perturbation that arises from errors in the modeling of the mass and damping to provide a stable limit cycle oscillation seo et al 2010 the input torque is set to 2 τ a p θ 1 γ 0 θ 1 γ 1 θ 1 θ 1 g h θ 0 θ h i τ s t where p γ 0 and γ 1 are input parameters g h is the heading control gain θ 0 is the heading angle of the robot in a space fixed coordinate o x 0 y 0 and θ h is the desired heading angle τ s t is the input that generates a torque on the tail that causes it to respond to an environmental stimulus substituting eq 2 into eq 1 yields 3 θ 1 σ 1 θ 1 σ 0 θ 1 ω 0 2 θ 1 g h θ 0 θ h i τ s t where both σ 0 γ 0 β 0 i and σ 1 γ 1 β 1 i affect the amplitude of oscillation and ω 0 k s p i is related to the frequency and amplitude of the oscillation the robotic fish responds to an oscillating source when both are moving parallel to each other the oscillating tail of the robot and the oscillating source are simply modeled as dipoles 1 and 2 respectively oscillating in the y 0 direction of a space fixed coordinate system o x 0 y 0 as presented in fig 2 the center of dipole 1 is located at the driving motor as the motor drives the tail the robotic fish bends its body and the motor is close to the bending point of the arched body spline the pressure sensor on the robot is located at x m y m in the space fixed coordinate system and the angular motion of the sensor due to the rotating body is assumed to be relatively small assuming the flow field to be inviscid incompressible and irrotational and the source functions of dipoles 1 and 2 to vary as μ 1 e j ω 1 t φ 12 and μ 2 e j ω 2 t respectively the velocity potential at x m y m is 4 ϕ m ϕ m 1 ϕ m 2 re μ 1 y m y d 1 e j ω 1 t ϕ 12 4 π x m x d 1 2 y m y d 1 2 3 2 μ 2 y m y d 2 e j ω 2 t 4 π x m x d 2 2 y m y d 2 2 3 2 where x d 1 y d 1 and x d 2 y d 2 are the dipole centers μ 1 and μ 2 are the strengths of the dipoles ω 1 and ω 2 are the frequencies of oscillation of the dipoles j is the imaginary unit for the time variable t

2 and the hydrodynamic pressure is 6 p m p ρ 1 2 u m 2 v m 2 ϕ m t where p is the static pressure and u m and v m are the flow velocities in the x 0 and y 0 directions respectively ignoring the convection term owing to its small value in near body flow the measured pressure at point x m y m is 7 p m p 1 p 2 ρ ϕ m 1 t ϕ m 2 t the hydrodynamic pressure is modeled using the acceleration of a dipole consider for example dipole 2 with strength μ 2 2 π a 3 a s p ω 2 modeled as an oscillating sphere of radius a and amplitude of oscillation a s p such that y s o t a s p sin ω 2 t by the potential flow theory the hydrodynamic pressure field generated by dipole 2 can be expressed as 8 p 2 ρ μ 2 y m y d 2 sin ω 2 t ω 2 4 π x m x d 2 2 y m y d 2 2 3 2 ρ a 3 ω 2 2 a s p 2 δ y 2 sin ω 2 t where δ y y m y d 2 to find the hydrodynamic pressure generated by dipole 2 oscillating source the hydrodynamic pressure generated by dipole 1 robot s tail must be subtracted from p m as predicted by the potential flow theory the hydrodynamic pressure generated by a dipole is proportional to its acceleration of oscillation to model the oscillation of the robotic fish the shape of the body spline can be approximately specified in terms of the heading of the robot θ 0 and θ 1 which indicates the orientation of the tail relative to the main body axis by a body spline equation guo 2009 assuming that the effects of vortices and the convection term are relatively small p 1 can then be simplified as the angular acceleration of the robotic fish 9 p 1 c 0 p θ 0 c 1 p θ 1 where the coefficients c 0 p and c 1 p are calculated by linear regression θ 0 and θ 1 represent the angular accelerations of the body spline and can be measured using orientation sensors on the body spline of the robot as the oscillating source starts from position x d 2 y d 2 and moves forward with velocity u in the x 0 direction it generates hydrodynamic pressure 10 p 2 ρ μ 2 y m y d 2 sin ω 2 t ω 2 x m u t x d 2 2 y

measured pressure controlling the tail fin at a constant flapping frequency and amplitude causes the robot to swim with a nearly constant forward speed guo 2009 kopman et al 2015 under this constant speed condition the coefficients c 0 p and c 1 p can be calculated using a regressing function that is based on the minimum least squares error 3 control to synchronize phase as indicated by eq 8 the hydrodynamic pressure p 2 generated by an oscillating source is out of phase with its motion in the y 0 direction hence the phase of p 2 is used as an indicator of the phase of the source oscillation and is used to derive τ s in eq 2 the torque τ s drives the tail to follow the source oscillation with the desired phase difference when the source moves forward with velocity u in the x 0 direction the observed pressure wave at the measuring point experiences magnitude variations the magnitude of the pressure is inversely proportional to the distance between the two dipoles based on the assumption of the incompressible flow the frequency shift of the pressure signal caused by the doppler effect associated with the moving dipole is neglected the phase difference is defined as 11 ψ g ϕ 2 n ϕ 1 12 ϕ 1 tan 1 θ 1 ω 1 θ 1 13 ϕ 2 tan 1 p 2 ω 2 p 2 where n is a positive integer ϕ 1 and ϕ 2 are the phases of the tail motion and the pressure generated by the source respectively and ψ g is the phase difference between the multi frequency oscillations of the two oscillators we define a vector of the phases 14 ϕ ϕ 1 ϕ 2 t when n 1 the robot s tail moves with the same frequency as the environmental source the need to account for n 1 in the phase following control arises from the need to simulate the cases in which neighboring robots have flapping tails with different frequencies or robots of different sizes follow each other tail flapping is the key mechanism by which a robotic fish controls its forward speed guo 2009 kopman et al 2015 a small robot must flip its tail more frequently than a large robot to move at the same speed an error function based on the work of saltzman and byrd 2000 was used to indicate the difference between the phases of the tail motions of two nearby robots this error function is 15 v ψ g g s cos ψ g ψ g 0 where g s is the gain of the phase error the cosine function that modulates ψ g with respect to the target phase ψ g 0 is used to discount the large error in the phase based on the method of steepest descent the negative gradient of the function is defined as the relative phase velocity 16 ψ g c d v ψ g d ψ g g s sin ψ g ψ g 0 since the acceleration of the tail oscillator with respect to time is 17 θ 1 θ 1 ϕ 1 ϕ 1 an acceleration command to reduce the phase error of the tail can be based on ϕ 1 with a phase velocity in the direction of the negative gradient of the error function saltzman and byrd 2000 18 ϕ 1 c j 1 ψ g c and 19 τ s θ 1 ϕ 1 ϕ 1 c where θ 1 ω 1 a 1 sin ϕ 1 and θ 1 ϕ 1 ω 1 a 1 cos ϕ 1 a 1 θ 1 2 θ 1 ω 1 2 j 1 is an element of the pseudo inverse of a jacobian j where j is calculated by differentiating eq 11 with respect to time 20 ψ g ϕ 2 n ϕ 1 ψ g ϕ 1 ψ g ϕ 2 ϕ 1 ϕ 2 n 1 ϕ 1 ϕ 2 j ϕ 1 c the pseudo inverse of the jacobian j is 21 j j t j j t 1 n 1 t 1 n 2 1 j 1 j 2 t therefore eq 19 is rewritten as 22 τ s ω 1 a 1 cos ϕ 1 j 1 g s sin ψ g ψ g 0 finally the feedback term on the right hand side of eq 2 governs the position and velocity trajectories of the tail oscillators 4 experiments in this section the robotic fish the mechanism and the pvdf sensor used in the experiments are introduced the results of phase control for the robotic fish to follow the oscillating source with different frequencies and forward velocities are also presented 4 1 experimental setup an experimental procedure was performed to confirm the effectiveness of the phase following control using a robotic fish and an oscillating source the used robot has a rigid body segment and a flexible tail the tail joint is driven by a servo motor the tail of the robot comprises a soft skin over an aluminum bone the bone is also controlled by the servo motor when the motor rotates the steel wires are pulled to move the end of the tail bone an orientation sensor measures the heading of the robot body θ 0 another orientation sensor located on the aluminum tail bone measures the orientation of the tail θ 1 as illustrated in fig 3 c the robotic fish is placed to the side of the oscillating source both the robotic fish and the oscillating mechanism are attached to a fixture on a water tank a rotating pivot point is attached to the top of the robot this attachment allows the robot to exhibit yaw rotation while its tail beats an oscillating mechanism that includes a servo motor oscillating the sphere produces a sinusoidal pressure field similar to that generated by a dipole source the rated torque rated speed and power of the motor are 51 mnm 5060 rpm and 45 w respectively the position of the motor is recorded to determine the position of the sphere the oscillating sphere has an amplitude of 0 35 cm and a frequency ranging from 1 hz to 5 hz the diameter of the sphere is 15 cm and its center is 15 cm below the surface of the water the distance between the center of the sphere and the pressure sensor attached to the robot is 9 cm when both the robot and sphere are in their central positions an antenna on top of the robot enables the robot s computer to communicate wirelessly with the other computers fig 4 a c show the pvdf sensor on the side of the fish robot s body the pvdf sensor is flexible light highly resistant to moisture and is mechanically strong the direct piezoelectric effect of the sensor material transforms mechanical energy into electrical energy the sensor generates electric charge in response to the deformation created by an external force paired with a charge amplifier fig 4 d the pvdf sensor obtains the pressure fluctuations generated by the source by measuring the corresponding voltage variation v o u t the charge amplifier is designed to amplify the voltage signals that are converted by the sensor to model the sensor the pvdf film and its amplifier are simplified as a voltage source v p f and a capacitance c p f 6 6 10 10 f the feedback capacitance c and resistance r are 10 10 f and 10 9 ω respectively in order to obtain the characteristics of the pvdf sensor a series of experiments with the source oscillating at different frequencies were performed when the robotic fish was static with the distance between the source and sensor remaining constant at 9 cm for each condition a series of five trials were performed the pressure generated by the oscillating source was converted by the pvdf sensor into a voltage signal fig 5 shows the output voltage v o u t of the pvdf sensor and the scaled negative jerk of the oscillating source the source jerk is the time derivative of the acceleration of the oscillating sphere to filter the signals generated by the oscillation of the source at a frequency of ω 2 fir filters with designated passbands were applied to post process the measurements the nth order fir filter with constant group delay introduces a phase shift ϕ f and a time shift t f 23 t f n 2 f s 0 ϕ f t f ω 2 0 where f s is the sampling frequency of the input data fig 6 shows a the phase response ϕ s ω of the circuit of the pvdf sensor derived using the transfer function and b comparison with that obtained from the experiments the phase response obtained from the experiments is calculated from the phase difference between the output voltage of the pvdf sensor and the acceleration of the source oscillation the obtained values of phase response for different frequencies are listed in table 1 based on fig 6 and table 1 the circuit is a negative differentiator phase response is 1 5 π rad with a phase delay so the amplitude of the output signals is proportional to the negative rate of change of the input signals the input to the pvdf sensor is hydrodynamic pressure and the output voltage is proportional to the negative rate of change of the hydrodynamic pressure with a time delay 24 t s ϕ s ω 2 1 5 π ω 2 0 where 1 5 π accounts for eliminating the phase of the negative differential from ϕ s table 2 shows the characteristics of the pvdf sensor the magnitude of the input pressure is calculated using eq 8 in the simulations and the mean of the magnitude of the output voltage of the sensor for each frequency condition was measured and calculated in the experiments fig 7 presents the oscillatory motion of the tail for various values of the input parameters p γ 0 and γ 1 which are defined in eq 2 the tail model given by eq 3 reveals that increasing p increases the frequency of oscillation while increasing γ 1 reduces the amplitude of oscillation in the experiments the following control input was applied 25 τ a 0 64 θ 1 0 6 θ 1 0 27 θ 1 θ 1 5 θ 0 0 τ s where the frequency and amplitude of oscillation of the tail are 1 hz and 0 21 rad respectively and τ a is given in units of nm the experimental results for n 1 3 from eq 11 and the phase following with a phase difference of 0 and π are presented in the following to find τ s in eq 22 p 2 in eq 13 is replaced by the output of the pvdf sensor the pvdf outputs include the signals generated by the oscillating source and the self motion of the robotic fish for ω 1 ω 2 the components associated with self motion can be removed by the fir filter yielding the signals that are generated by the oscillating source for ω 1 ω 2 a regression model is derived to estimate the voltage generated by the robot s self motion and remove this estimated voltage from the pvdf outputs 26 v r e g c 0 v θ 0 c 1 v θ 1 where c 0 v 0 015 and c 1 v 0 003 are the regression coefficients of the voltage signals generated by the self motion fig 8 presents the self motion signals and the results of their regression the estimated voltage generated by the oscillating source is 27 v s t v o u t f t v r e g t t s t f where v o u t f t is the output voltage of the pvdf sensor filtered by the fir filter which consists of the voltage signals generated by both the self motion of the robot and the oscillation of the source due to the time shifts that are applied by the pvdf sensor t s and the fir filter t f v o u t f t in fact represents the signal generated at time t t s t f therefore the signal generated by the self motion v r e g t t s t f is subtracted and the estimated voltage v s t represents the signal generated by the oscillating source at time t t s t f in order to control the tail to follow the source oscillation the phase of the target is computed from eq 13 using the source generated pressure field since the pressure fluctuations are converted by the pvdf sensor to the voltage signals the phase of the target is derived as 28 ϕ 2 tan 1 v s ω 2 v s ω 1 ω 2 tan 1 v o u t f ω 2 v o u t f ω 1 ω 2 fig 9 presents the signal flow diagram of the phase following control the goal is to maintain the phase difference between the robot s tail and the oscillation of the source we assume ϕ d is the desired phase difference ϕ s o n ϕ 1 where ϕ s o y s o is the phase of the oscillating source considering that the pressure generated by the oscillating source is out of phase with its oscillation and the phase ϕ s ϕ f is introduced by the pvdf sensor and the filter the target phase for ψ g is designed to be 29 ψ g 0 ϕ d π ϕ s ϕ f 2 π n 0 where n 0 is an integer and 2 π n 0 is used to switch ψ g 0 into the range of π table 3 lists the control parameters 4 2 synchronizing the tail to the oscillating source the control input provided above can be used to control the motion of the tail of the robotic fish relative to that of the source the following trials were performed the robot and source began to oscillate at t 5 s and t 15 s respectively at t 25 s the robot began to synchronize the motion of its tail with that of the source fig 10 shows the results of the approximately 1 1 synchronization n 1 with ϕ d 0 fig 10 a shows the oscillation of the source y s o and the tail motion of the robotic fish while fig 10 b shows the instantaneous phase difference between the tail motion of the robot and the oscillation of the source ψ g ϕ 2 ϕ 1 fig 10 c shows the estimated voltage v s defined in eq 27 and the scaled negative source jerk was shifted by time t s t f v s is compared with the negative source jerk shifted by time t s t f because v s represents the negative rate of change of the pressure that is generated by the oscillating source at time t t s t f during the time of 5 15 s the robot starts to oscillate its tail accelerating its body motion the magnitude of the estimated voltage v s is around 0 1 v which shows that the self motion effect is not totally removed this is because the regression model of the self motion effect defined in eq 26 is based on the robot performing stable motion during this 10 s period the source is static and the instantaneous phase difference drops by 18 5 π which is close to the value calculated using eq 11 with ϕ 2 0 ϕ 1 10 2 π and n 1 after the source begins to oscillate the instantaneous phase difference between two motions decreases slowly with time at t 25 s the phase control begins to adjust the tail motion of the robot to lock θ 1 to y s o with the desired phase difference ϕ d 0 2 π n 0 rad where n 0 is an integer at 42 45 s the phase difference varies by π rad because the estimated voltage v s shown in c is not in phase with the negative source jerk with the expected time shift so the phase of the source oscillation that is derived from the estimated voltage is not close to the actual phase of the source oscillation this is because the effect of the self motion was not entirely eliminated by subtracting v r e g as defined in eq 26 in figs 5 a and 8 c the magnitudes of signals generated by the oscillating source and the self motion of the robot are approximately 0 08 v and 0 3 v respectively modeling errors in the regression result for the tail oscillator affected the control after t 45 s v s is nearly in phase with the negative source jerk so the estimated phase of the source is close to its actual phase and the controller locks the phase difference back to 0 rad 22 π rad fig 11 plots the results obtained with ϕ d 0 π and n 1 3 as in the previous case the instantaneous phase difference continuously decreases before the phase control starts at t 25 s the control starts the phase difference is locked around the desired value as ϕ d π 2 π n 0 in fig 11 a ϕ d 0 2 π n 0 in fig 11 b and ϕ d π 2 π n 0 in fig 11 c unlike for n 1 when n 3 the self oscillations of the robot fish can be filtered out to eliminate their effect on the control when ω 1 ω 2 the signals that are generated by the source with frequency ω 2 can be easily derived by subtracting the self motion with frequency ω 1 from the whole measured signals the strength of the source increases with frequency weakening the effect of the self motion on extracting source signals the change in distance between the measuring point and the source as the robot oscillates also affects the magnitude of the source signal that is being measured when the source is strong the effect of this distance on the measured signals becomes weaker akanyeti et al 2016 suggested that the head movements of an undulating fish improve pressure sensing by minimizing the generation of self generated stimuli as it swims coordinated motion of the head and the body can help to reduce the effects of self motion on the measured signals in 1 1 phase control improving sensing and enabling the source signals to be correctly predicted the 1 1 phase control between the tail motion of a robotic fish and the source oscillation has been reported elsewhere yen et al 2015 the present study extends the control to 1 n synchronization when the robot and source oscillate at different frequencies to apply this phase control to a group of robotic fish for which the distance between and relative velocities of the robotic fish vary the effect of forward speed of the oscillating source on the phase control is considered in this paper 4 3 synchronizing the tail to the oscillating source that is moving forward the results for phase control between the tail motion of the robot and the oscillating source that is moving along a track in the x 0 direction are presented fig 12 presents the track apparatus the length of the track is 45 cm the pvdf sensor on the robotic fish is located at the same x 0 coordinate as the center of the track but 20 cm away from it in the y 0 direction the oscillating source moves from the left end of the track to the right end the frequencies of oscillation of the tail and the source are 1 hz and 3 hz respectively first to elucidate the effect of forward motion of the source on synchronization the robotic fish is held in place without tail oscillations and the oscillating source moves with velocities of 1 cm s 2 cm s and 3 cm s using eq 10 variations of the phase difference between the pvdf signals and the negative source jerk in the y 0 direction caused by the forward motion of the source are within 0 02 π rad fig 13 presents experimental data obtained from the static robot that tracks the oscillating source as it passes by in fig 13 a c the magnitudes of the signals measured by the pvdf sensor increase as the oscillating source comes closer to the sensor whereas the instantaneous phase difference between the signals and the negative source jerk in the y 0 direction approaches 0 4 π rad as presented in fig 13 d f from fig 13 d f when the oscillating source moves within 7 5 cm of the pvdf sensor in the x 0 direction 7 5 cm x d 2 u t x m 7 5 cm the phase differences in the three cases are approximately 0 4 π which is close to ϕ s 1 5 π ω 2 6 π therefore in the specified range the phase difference is barely affected by the forward motion and is therefore close to that obtained from fig 6 outside of this range with x d 2 u t x m 7 5 cm or x d 2 u t x m 7 5 cm the phase difference varies drastically but it does not follow a pattern and the signals that are generated by the oscillating source are too weak to be effectively measured by the pvdf sensor based on the above observations the following experiments were performed with 1 3 synchronization and ϕ d 0 between the tail motion and the oscillation of the source with forward velocities of 1 cm s 2 cm s and 3 cm s fig 14 presents the instantaneous phase differences between the tail motion and the source oscillation with the desired phase difference of 0 rad fig 14 reveals that when the oscillating source was within 7 5 cm of the pvdf sensor in the x 0 direction 7 5 cm x d 2 u t x m 7 5 cm phase following was established outside of this range the signals associated with the source were too weak to enable the phase to be correctly obtained so the phase following control was ineffective the sensitivity of the pvdf sensor and the strength of the source limited the range in which phase following control was effective also as the dipole source moved faster the phase following was observed for a shorter period 5 conclusions this work proposes a method for controlling the tail fin of a robotic fish to enable it to follow an oscillating source with a desired phase difference the tail motion of the robotic fish is controlled using an oscillator based model the source an oscillating sphere is modeled as an oscillator based on the potential flow theory the hydrodynamic pressure generated by the source is a function of the source motion and can be used as a control input to the tail oscillator a pvdf sensor attached to the robot is used to measure the pressure fluctuations around the robot these pressure fluctuations comprise a component generated by the self motion of the robot and another component generated by the oscillation of the source the dynamic model for predicting the hydrodynamic pressure generated by the robot s self oscillation is used to obtain the pressure generated by the source oscillation a dipole model is thus demonstrated to be effective for predicting the hydrodynamic pressure the tail motion of a robotic fish close to a stationary or a moving source is proved to maintain a constant phase difference with respect to the source motion since the frequency and amplitude of oscillation of the tail determine the speed and orientation of the robotic fish this method is expected to be effective in making the body of a robotic fish respond to environmental stimuli the method is planned to be utilized in the future to make a free swimming robot maintain a particular distance and phase relative to an oscillating source acknowledgment the authors would like to thank dr gopal r rao and prof chen fen huang for helpful

23298,this work develops a method for controlling a robotic fish as it swims in a school by following periodic stimuli generated by a neighboring robot to track the motion of a periodically oscillating neighboring source the hydrodynamic pressure around the body of the robotic fish is measured by a pvdf sensor attached to the robot the pressure induced by the source is obtained by subtracting the predicted pressure generated by the robotic fish from the measured pressure the controlled fish tail mechanism is represented as an oscillator and a moving oscillating sphere is considered to be an external source a dipole model based on the potential flow theory is used to predict the hydrodynamic pressure close to the fish tail the relative phase between the tail and the oscillating source is estimated from the pressure measurements of the pvdf sensor the difference in phase angle between the tail and the oscillating source is used to determine the torque used to drive the tail mechanism the proposed method is demonstrated by the tank experiments that involve a captured model of a robotic fish that swims close to an oscillating source keywords biomimetic pvdf oscillator dipole phase following 1 introduction robotic fish are designed to mimic the motion of real fish given their ability to hover precisely and turn swiftly the robotic fish are also expected to mimic real fish behaviors such as shoaling and schooling fish obtain many benefits from shoaling schooling behavior including time saving in finding prey and defence against predators shaw 1978 hydrodynamic efficiency is also increased as schooling fish swim in a diamond pattern due to fish extracting energy from the kármán vortex street generated by the leading fish weihs 1973 in fish schools the preferred distance between a fish and its nearest neighbor is around one body length partridge 1982 one possible method for a fish staying in the moving school is to employ the lateral line organ distributed from its head to its tail to sense the displacement of water pitcher et al 1976 to understand how the lateral line system can help real fish to school scientists analyzed environmental stimuli to the system under different situations studies show that by calculating the distributions of the pressure difference and pressure gradient of adjacent pores on the surface of a fish body near field information such as location and movement of a source as well as the existence of a plane surface can be encoded hassan 1992 coombs and braun 2003 windsor et al 2010 thus a pressure sensor array is devised to determine the pressure gradient of kármán vortex street venturelli et al 2012 the position of a robotic fish in a kármán vortex street behind an object in a flow was controlled using the feedback of pressure signals measured by the sensor array installed in the robot s head salumäe and kruusmaa 2013 a recent study also utilizes the measured pressure variations in the surrounding of the robotic fish to sense the kinematic conditions of an adjacent robotic fish zheng et al 2018 from the above a robotic fish is expected to have the ability to measure pressure signals that are generated by periodic movements in its nearby environment to enable it to swim properly in a school it has also been found that while swimming in a kármán vortex street real fish alternate their body motions to synchronize with the vortices and to maintain their positions liao et al 2003 similarly robotic fish should adjust their body motion in response to environmental pressure signals obtained using some forms of pressure sensing yen et al 2018 although previous research showed that real fish could guide themselves by sensing the pressure variations of the surrounding flow field to move there are few studies on robotic fish formation using pressure feedback control the present work suggests that the school formation for a robotic fish to follow a neighbor depends on maintaining their relative distance and that relative phase rather than pressure intensity determines the torque command sent from the controller to the tail fin for speed control the speed of a robotic fish can be controlled by adjusting the beating frequency of the tail guo 2009 kopman et al 2015 when two robotic fish swim in parallel and keep the same phase of their tail motions the speed for following can be achieved the speed following strategy presented here is to control the relative phase of the oscillating tail to that of an adjacent neighbor as the distance is close enough to detect the neighbor it is only phase that needs to be controlled this work proposes a controller design for robotic fish to follow an oscillating source an oscillator based method is used to model the fin oscillation another oscillator model is used to represent the oscillating source the objective is to control the phase difference between the tail motion of a robotic fish and the oscillation of the source first the motions of the tail fin and the source are described as nonlinear oscillators with a constant frequency ratio to obtain information about the motion of the source a polyvinylidene fluoride pvdf pressure sensor is placed on the surface of the robot to measure the hydrodynamic pressure generated by the oscillating source in experiments a mechanism drives a small ball to generate the oscillating source and the robotic fish is constrained but not restricted to exhibit yaw motions according to the potential flow theory the hydrodynamic pressure signals generated by the oscillating source are related to its motion and can be used as the phase control input to the tail oscillator control of the tail to follow the oscillating source which moves with different forward velocities is tested to evaluate the effectiveness of the phase control the experimental results reveal that control using the desired phase difference between the tail of the robotic fish and the oscillating source can be achieved presenting the possibility of synchronizing the motions of two robotic fish this paper is organized as follows sections 2 and 3 introduce the modeling and the design of the control system respectively section 4 provides experimental data and section 5 provides concluding remarks 2 modeling of hydrodynamic pressure the dynamic model of the robotic fish is nonlinear and can be derived using euler lagrange equations guo and joeng 2004 to control the tail motion of the robot the tail is assumed to oscillate with small amplitudes and the coupling terms between the tail angle and other state variables are assumed to be relatively small the dynamic model of the tail can thus be decoupled from the whole dynamic model of the robotic fish and represented as follows seo et al 2010 1 i θ 1 β 0 θ 1 β 1 θ 1 θ 1 k s θ 1 τ a δ where θ 1 is the angular motion of the tail relative to the center line of the body as shown in fig 1 i is the moment of inertia which comprises the moments of inertia of the tail and added mass and k s is the stiffness of the tail β 0 β 1 θ 1 is the nonlinear damping term and δ is the small perturbation that arises from errors in the modeling of the mass and damping to provide a stable limit cycle oscillation seo et al 2010 the input torque is set to 2 τ a p θ 1 γ 0 θ 1 γ 1 θ 1 θ 1 g h θ 0 θ h i τ s t where p γ 0 and γ 1 are input parameters g h is the heading control gain θ 0 is the heading angle of the robot in a space fixed coordinate o x 0 y 0 and θ h is the desired heading angle τ s t is the input that generates a torque on the tail that causes it to respond to an environmental stimulus substituting eq 2 into eq 1 yields 3 θ 1 σ 1 θ 1 σ 0 θ 1 ω 0 2 θ 1 g h θ 0 θ h i τ s t where both σ 0 γ 0 β 0 i and σ 1 γ 1 β 1 i affect the amplitude of oscillation and ω 0 k s p i is related to the frequency and amplitude of the oscillation the robotic fish responds to an oscillating source when both are moving parallel to each other the oscillating tail of the robot and the oscillating source are simply modeled as dipoles 1 and 2 respectively oscillating in the y 0 direction of a space fixed coordinate system o x 0 y 0 as presented in fig 2 the center of dipole 1 is located at the driving motor as the motor drives the tail the robotic fish bends its body and the motor is close to the bending point of the arched body spline the pressure sensor on the robot is located at x m y m in the space fixed coordinate system and the angular motion of the sensor due to the rotating body is assumed to be relatively small assuming the flow field to be inviscid incompressible and irrotational and the source functions of dipoles 1 and 2 to vary as μ 1 e j ω 1 t φ 12 and μ 2 e j ω 2 t respectively the velocity potential at x m y m is 4 ϕ m ϕ m 1 ϕ m 2 re μ 1 y m y d 1 e j ω 1 t ϕ 12 4 π x m x d 1 2 y m y d 1 2 3 2 μ 2 y m y d 2 e j ω 2 t 4 π x m x d 2 2 y m y d 2 2 3 2 where x d 1 y d 1 and x d 2 y d 2 are the dipole centers μ 1 and μ 2 are the strengths of the dipoles ω 1 and ω 2 are the frequencies of oscillation of the dipoles j is the imaginary unit for the time variable t

2 and the hydrodynamic pressure is 6 p m p ρ 1 2 u m 2 v m 2 ϕ m t where p is the static pressure and u m and v m are the flow velocities in the x 0 and y 0 directions respectively ignoring the convection term owing to its small value in near body flow the measured pressure at point x m y m is 7 p m p 1 p 2 ρ ϕ m 1 t ϕ m 2 t the hydrodynamic pressure is modeled using the acceleration of a dipole consider for example dipole 2 with strength μ 2 2 π a 3 a s p ω 2 modeled as an oscillating sphere of radius a and amplitude of oscillation a s p such that y s o t a s p sin ω 2 t by the potential flow theory the hydrodynamic pressure field generated by dipole 2 can be expressed as 8 p 2 ρ μ 2 y m y d 2 sin ω 2 t ω 2 4 π x m x d 2 2 y m y d 2 2 3 2 ρ a 3 ω 2 2 a s p 2 δ y 2 sin ω 2 t where δ y y m y d 2 to find the hydrodynamic pressure generated by dipole 2 oscillating source the hydrodynamic pressure generated by dipole 1 robot s tail must be subtracted from p m as predicted by the potential flow theory the hydrodynamic pressure generated by a dipole is proportional to its acceleration of oscillation to model the oscillation of the robotic fish the shape of the body spline can be approximately specified in terms of the heading of the robot θ 0 and θ 1 which indicates the orientation of the tail relative to the main body axis by a body spline equation guo 2009 assuming that the effects of vortices and the convection term are relatively small p 1 can then be simplified as the angular acceleration of the robotic fish 9 p 1 c 0 p θ 0 c 1 p θ 1 where the coefficients c 0 p and c 1 p are calculated by linear regression θ 0 and θ 1 represent the angular accelerations of the body spline and can be measured using orientation sensors on the body spline of the robot as the oscillating source starts from position x d 2 y d 2 and moves forward with velocity u in the x 0 direction it generates hydrodynamic pressure 10 p 2 ρ μ 2 y m y d 2 sin ω 2 t ω 2 x m u t x d 2 2 y

measured pressure controlling the tail fin at a constant flapping frequency and amplitude causes the robot to swim with a nearly constant forward speed guo 2009 kopman et al 2015 under this constant speed condition the coefficients c 0 p and c 1 p can be calculated using a regressing function that is based on the minimum least squares error 3 control to synchronize phase as indicated by eq 8 the hydrodynamic pressure p 2 generated by an oscillating source is out of phase with its motion in the y 0 direction hence the phase of p 2 is used as an indicator of the phase of the source oscillation and is used to derive τ s in eq 2 the torque τ s drives the tail to follow the source oscillation with the desired phase difference when the source moves forward with velocity u in the x 0 direction the observed pressure wave at the measuring point experiences magnitude variations the magnitude of the pressure is inversely proportional to the distance between the two dipoles based on the assumption of the incompressible flow the frequency shift of the pressure signal caused by the doppler effect associated with the moving dipole is neglected the phase difference is defined as 11 ψ g ϕ 2 n ϕ 1 12 ϕ 1 tan 1 θ 1 ω 1 θ 1 13 ϕ 2 tan 1 p 2 ω 2 p 2 where n is a positive integer ϕ 1 and ϕ 2 are the phases of the tail motion and the pressure generated by the source respectively and ψ g is the phase difference between the multi frequency oscillations of the two oscillators we define a vector of the phases 14 ϕ ϕ 1 ϕ 2 t when n 1 the robot s tail moves with the same frequency as the environmental source the need to account for n 1 in the phase following control arises from the need to simulate the cases in which neighboring robots have flapping tails with different frequencies or robots of different sizes follow each other tail flapping is the key mechanism by which a robotic fish controls its forward speed guo 2009 kopman et al 2015 a small robot must flip its tail more frequently than a large robot to move at the same speed an error function based on the work of saltzman and byrd 2000 was used to indicate the difference between the phases of the tail motions of two nearby robots this error function is 15 v ψ g g s cos ψ g ψ g 0 where g s is the gain of the phase error the cosine function that modulates ψ g with respect to the target phase ψ g 0 is used to discount the large error in the phase based on the method of steepest descent the negative gradient of the function is defined as the relative phase velocity 16 ψ g c d v ψ g d ψ g g s sin ψ g ψ g 0 since the acceleration of the tail oscillator with respect to time is 17 θ 1 θ 1 ϕ 1 ϕ 1 an acceleration command to reduce the phase error of the tail can be based on ϕ 1 with a phase velocity in the direction of the negative gradient of the error function saltzman and byrd 2000 18 ϕ 1 c j 1 ψ g c and 19 τ s θ 1 ϕ 1 ϕ 1 c where θ 1 ω 1 a 1 sin ϕ 1 and θ 1 ϕ 1 ω 1 a 1 cos ϕ 1 a 1 θ 1 2 θ 1 ω 1 2 j 1 is an element of the pseudo inverse of a jacobian j where j is calculated by differentiating eq 11 with respect to time 20 ψ g ϕ 2 n ϕ 1 ψ g ϕ 1 ψ g ϕ 2 ϕ 1 ϕ 2 n 1 ϕ 1 ϕ 2 j ϕ 1 c the pseudo inverse of the jacobian j is 21 j j t j j t 1 n 1 t 1 n 2 1 j 1 j 2 t therefore eq 19 is rewritten as 22 τ s ω 1 a 1 cos ϕ 1 j 1 g s sin ψ g ψ g 0 finally the feedback term on the right hand side of eq 2 governs the position and velocity trajectories of the tail oscillators 4 experiments in this section the robotic fish the mechanism and the pvdf sensor used in the experiments are introduced the results of phase control for the robotic fish to follow the oscillating source with different frequencies and forward velocities are also presented 4 1 experimental setup an experimental procedure was performed to confirm the effectiveness of the phase following control using a robotic fish and an oscillating source the used robot has a rigid body segment and a flexible tail the tail joint is driven by a servo motor the tail of the robot comprises a soft skin over an aluminum bone the bone is also controlled by the servo motor when the motor rotates the steel wires are pulled to move the end of the tail bone an orientation sensor measures the heading of the robot body θ 0 another orientation sensor located on the aluminum tail bone measures the orientation of the tail θ 1 as illustrated in fig 3 c the robotic fish is placed to the side of the oscillating source both the robotic fish and the oscillating mechanism are attached to a fixture on a water tank a rotating pivot point is attached to the top of the robot this attachment allows the robot to exhibit yaw rotation while its tail beats an oscillating mechanism that includes a servo motor oscillating the sphere produces a sinusoidal pressure field similar to that generated by a dipole source the rated torque rated speed and power of the motor are 51 mnm 5060 rpm and 45 w respectively the position of the motor is recorded to determine the position of the sphere the oscillating sphere has an amplitude of 0 35 cm and a frequency ranging from 1 hz to 5 hz the diameter of the sphere is 15 cm and its center is 15 cm below the surface of the water the distance between the center of the sphere and the pressure sensor attached to the robot is 9 cm when both the robot and sphere are in their central positions an antenna on top of the robot enables the robot s computer to communicate wirelessly with the other computers fig 4 a c show the pvdf sensor on the side of the fish robot s body the pvdf sensor is flexible light highly resistant to moisture and is mechanically strong the direct piezoelectric effect of the sensor material transforms mechanical energy into electrical energy the sensor generates electric charge in response to the deformation created by an external force paired with a charge amplifier fig 4 d the pvdf sensor obtains the pressure fluctuations generated by the source by measuring the corresponding voltage variation v o u t the charge amplifier is designed to amplify the voltage signals that are converted by the sensor to model the sensor the pvdf film and its amplifier are simplified as a voltage source v p f and a capacitance c p f 6 6 10 10 f the feedback capacitance c and resistance r are 10 10 f and 10 9 ω respectively in order to obtain the characteristics of the pvdf sensor a series of experiments with the source oscillating at different frequencies were performed when the robotic fish was static with the distance between the source and sensor remaining constant at 9 cm for each condition a series of five trials were performed the pressure generated by the oscillating source was converted by the pvdf sensor into a voltage signal fig 5 shows the output voltage v o u t of the pvdf sensor and the scaled negative jerk of the oscillating source the source jerk is the time derivative of the acceleration of the oscillating sphere to filter the signals generated by the oscillation of the source at a frequency of ω 2 fir filters with designated passbands were applied to post process the measurements the nth order fir filter with constant group delay introduces a phase shift ϕ f and a time shift t f 23 t f n 2 f s 0 ϕ f t f ω 2 0 where f s is the sampling frequency of the input data fig 6 shows a the phase response ϕ s ω of the circuit of the pvdf sensor derived using the transfer function and b comparison with that obtained from the experiments the phase response obtained from the experiments is calculated from the phase difference between the output voltage of the pvdf sensor and the acceleration of the source oscillation the obtained values of phase response for different frequencies are listed in table 1 based on fig 6 and table 1 the circuit is a negative differentiator phase response is 1 5 π rad with a phase delay so the amplitude of the output signals is proportional to the negative rate of change of the input signals the input to the pvdf sensor is hydrodynamic pressure and the output voltage is proportional to the negative rate of change of the hydrodynamic pressure with a time delay 24 t s ϕ s ω 2 1 5 π ω 2 0 where 1 5 π accounts for eliminating the phase of the negative differential from ϕ s table 2 shows the characteristics of the pvdf sensor the magnitude of the input pressure is calculated using eq 8 in the simulations and the mean of the magnitude of the output voltage of the sensor for each frequency condition was measured and calculated in the experiments fig 7 presents the oscillatory motion of the tail for various values of the input parameters p γ 0 and γ 1 which are defined in eq 2 the tail model given by eq 3 reveals that increasing p increases the frequency of oscillation while increasing γ 1 reduces the amplitude of oscillation in the experiments the following control input was applied 25 τ a 0 64 θ 1 0 6 θ 1 0 27 θ 1 θ 1 5 θ 0 0 τ s where the frequency and amplitude of oscillation of the tail are 1 hz and 0 21 rad respectively and τ a is given in units of nm the experimental results for n 1 3 from eq 11 and the phase following with a phase difference of 0 and π are presented in the following to find τ s in eq 22 p 2 in eq 13 is replaced by the output of the pvdf sensor the pvdf outputs include the signals generated by the oscillating source and the self motion of the robotic fish for ω 1 ω 2 the components associated with self motion can be removed by the fir filter yielding the signals that are generated by the oscillating source for ω 1 ω 2 a regression model is derived to estimate the voltage generated by the robot s self motion and remove this estimated voltage from the pvdf outputs 26 v r e g c 0 v θ 0 c 1 v θ 1 where c 0 v 0 015 and c 1 v 0 003 are the regression coefficients of the voltage signals generated by the self motion fig 8 presents the self motion signals and the results of their regression the estimated voltage generated by the oscillating source is 27 v s t v o u t f t v r e g t t s t f where v o u t f t is the output voltage of the pvdf sensor filtered by the fir filter which consists of the voltage signals generated by both the self motion of the robot and the oscillation of the source due to the time shifts that are applied by the pvdf sensor t s and the fir filter t f v o u t f t in fact represents the signal generated at time t t s t f therefore the signal generated by the self motion v r e g t t s t f is subtracted and the estimated voltage v s t represents the signal generated by the oscillating source at time t t s t f in order to control the tail to follow the source oscillation the phase of the target is computed from eq 13 using the source generated pressure field since the pressure fluctuations are converted by the pvdf sensor to the voltage signals the phase of the target is derived as 28 ϕ 2 tan 1 v s ω 2 v s ω 1 ω 2 tan 1 v o u t f ω 2 v o u t f ω 1 ω 2 fig 9 presents the signal flow diagram of the phase following control the goal is to maintain the phase difference between the robot s tail and the oscillation of the source we assume ϕ d is the desired phase difference ϕ s o n ϕ 1 where ϕ s o y s o is the phase of the oscillating source considering that the pressure generated by the oscillating source is out of phase with its oscillation and the phase ϕ s ϕ f is introduced by the pvdf sensor and the filter the target phase for ψ g is designed to be 29 ψ g 0 ϕ d π ϕ s ϕ f 2 π n 0 where n 0 is an integer and 2 π n 0 is used to switch ψ g 0 into the range of π table 3 lists the control parameters 4 2 synchronizing the tail to the oscillating source the control input provided above can be used to control the motion of the tail of the robotic fish relative to that of the source the following trials were performed the robot and source began to oscillate at t 5 s and t 15 s respectively at t 25 s the robot began to synchronize the motion of its tail with that of the source fig 10 shows the results of the approximately 1 1 synchronization n 1 with ϕ d 0 fig 10 a shows the oscillation of the source y s o and the tail motion of the robotic fish while fig 10 b shows the instantaneous phase difference between the tail motion of the robot and the oscillation of the source ψ g ϕ 2 ϕ 1 fig 10 c shows the estimated voltage v s defined in eq 27 and the scaled negative source jerk was shifted by time t s t f v s is compared with the negative source jerk shifted by time t s t f because v s represents the negative rate of change of the pressure that is generated by the oscillating source at time t t s t f during the time of 5 15 s the robot starts to oscillate its tail accelerating its body motion the magnitude of the estimated voltage v s is around 0 1 v which shows that the self motion effect is not totally removed this is because the regression model of the self motion effect defined in eq 26 is based on the robot performing stable motion during this 10 s period the source is static and the instantaneous phase difference drops by 18 5 π which is close to the value calculated using eq 11 with ϕ 2 0 ϕ 1 10 2 π and n 1 after the source begins to oscillate the instantaneous phase difference between two motions decreases slowly with time at t 25 s the phase control begins to adjust the tail motion of the robot to lock θ 1 to y s o with the desired phase difference ϕ d 0 2 π n 0 rad where n 0 is an integer at 42 45 s the phase difference varies by π rad because the estimated voltage v s shown in c is not in phase with the negative source jerk with the expected time shift so the phase of the source oscillation that is derived from the estimated voltage is not close to the actual phase of the source oscillation this is because the effect of the self motion was not entirely eliminated by subtracting v r e g as defined in eq 26 in figs 5 a and 8 c the magnitudes of signals generated by the oscillating source and the self motion of the robot are approximately 0 08 v and 0 3 v respectively modeling errors in the regression result for the tail oscillator affected the control after t 45 s v s is nearly in phase with the negative source jerk so the estimated phase of the source is close to its actual phase and the controller locks the phase difference back to 0 rad 22 π rad fig 11 plots the results obtained with ϕ d 0 π and n 1 3 as in the previous case the instantaneous phase difference continuously decreases before the phase control starts at t 25 s the control starts the phase difference is locked around the desired value as ϕ d π 2 π n 0 in fig 11 a ϕ d 0 2 π n 0 in fig 11 b and ϕ d π 2 π n 0 in fig 11 c unlike for n 1 when n 3 the self oscillations of the robot fish can be filtered out to eliminate their effect on the control when ω 1 ω 2 the signals that are generated by the source with frequency ω 2 can be easily derived by subtracting the self motion with frequency ω 1 from the whole measured signals the strength of the source increases with frequency weakening the effect of the self motion on extracting source signals the change in distance between the measuring point and the source as the robot oscillates also affects the magnitude of the source signal that is being measured when the source is strong the effect of this distance on the measured signals becomes weaker akanyeti et al 2016 suggested that the head movements of an undulating fish improve pressure sensing by minimizing the generation of self generated stimuli as it swims coordinated motion of the head and the body can help to reduce the effects of self motion on the measured signals in 1 1 phase control improving sensing and enabling the source signals to be correctly predicted the 1 1 phase control between the tail motion of a robotic fish and the source oscillation has been reported elsewhere yen et al 2015 the present study extends the control to 1 n synchronization when the robot and source oscillate at different frequencies to apply this phase control to a group of robotic fish for which the distance between and relative velocities of the robotic fish vary the effect of forward speed of the oscillating source on the phase control is considered in this paper 4 3 synchronizing the tail to the oscillating source that is moving forward the results for phase control between the tail motion of the robot and the oscillating source that is moving along a track in the x 0 direction are presented fig 12 presents the track apparatus the length of the track is 45 cm the pvdf sensor on the robotic fish is located at the same x 0 coordinate as the center of the track but 20 cm away from it in the y 0 direction the oscillating source moves from the left end of the track to the right end the frequencies of oscillation of the tail and the source are 1 hz and 3 hz respectively first to elucidate the effect of forward motion of the source on synchronization the robotic fish is held in place without tail oscillations and the oscillating source moves with velocities of 1 cm s 2 cm s and 3 cm s using eq 10 variations of the phase difference between the pvdf signals and the negative source jerk in the y 0 direction caused by the forward motion of the source are within 0 02 π rad fig 13 presents experimental data obtained from the static robot that tracks the oscillating source as it passes by in fig 13 a c the magnitudes of the signals measured by the pvdf sensor increase as the oscillating source comes closer to the sensor whereas the instantaneous phase difference between the signals and the negative source jerk in the y 0 direction approaches 0 4 π rad as presented in fig 13 d f from fig 13 d f when the oscillating source moves within 7 5 cm of the pvdf sensor in the x 0 direction 7 5 cm x d 2 u t x m 7 5 cm the phase differences in the three cases are approximately 0 4 π which is close to ϕ s 1 5 π ω 2 6 π therefore in the specified range the phase difference is barely affected by the forward motion and is therefore close to that obtained from fig 6 outside of this range with x d 2 u t x m 7 5 cm or x d 2 u t x m 7 5 cm the phase difference varies drastically but it does not follow a pattern and the signals that are generated by the oscillating source are too weak to be effectively measured by the pvdf sensor based on the above observations the following experiments were performed with 1 3 synchronization and ϕ d 0 between the tail motion and the oscillation of the source with forward velocities of 1 cm s 2 cm s and 3 cm s fig 14 presents the instantaneous phase differences between the tail motion and the source oscillation with the desired phase difference of 0 rad fig 14 reveals that when the oscillating source was within 7 5 cm of the pvdf sensor in the x 0 direction 7 5 cm x d 2 u t x m 7 5 cm phase following was established outside of this range the signals associated with the source were too weak to enable the phase to be correctly obtained so the phase following control was ineffective the sensitivity of the pvdf sensor and the strength of the source limited the range in which phase following control was effective also as the dipole source moved faster the phase following was observed for a shorter period 5 conclusions this work proposes a method for controlling the tail fin of a robotic fish to enable it to follow an oscillating source with a desired phase difference the tail motion of the robotic fish is controlled using an oscillator based model the source an oscillating sphere is modeled as an oscillator based on the potential flow theory the hydrodynamic pressure generated by the source is a function of the source motion and can be used as a control input to the tail oscillator a pvdf sensor attached to the robot is used to measure the pressure fluctuations around the robot these pressure fluctuations comprise a component generated by the self motion of the robot and another component generated by the oscillation of the source the dynamic model for predicting the hydrodynamic pressure generated by the robot s self oscillation is used to obtain the pressure generated by the source oscillation a dipole model is thus demonstrated to be effective for predicting the hydrodynamic pressure the tail motion of a robotic fish close to a stationary or a moving source is proved to maintain a constant phase difference with respect to the source motion since the frequency and amplitude of oscillation of the tail determine the speed and orientation of the robotic fish this method is expected to be effective in making the body of a robotic fish respond to environmental stimuli the method is planned to be utilized in the future to make a free swimming robot maintain a particular distance and phase relative to an oscillating source acknowledgment the authors would like to thank dr gopal r rao and prof chen fen huang for helpful

23299,in order to assess the damage detectability of the structural health monitoring method using diffuse fields a laboratory experiment is conducted on an aluminum plate where two accelerometers are mounted as receivers two types of damages a nonlinear material attachment and a punctuated hole are considered a hand held impact hammer is used for the excitation whereby the hammer is moved over grid points drawn on the aluminum plate and thus the diffuse fields are generated by superposing the wave fields by many excitations randomly sampled from the cross correlation of diffuse fields between two receivers we extract the coherent wave field in cases with and without damages to detect the damage a novel damage detection algorithm using a support vector machine is suggested based on the reduced features transformed from several statistical parameters of damaged and undamaged noise cross correlation functions aided by the principal component analysis the performance of the proposed algorithm is analyzed for the number of sources and damage types keywords structural health monitoring cross correlation diffuse field damage index support vector machine 1 introduction structural health monitoring shm is imperative for safe operation of large structures such as ships offshore structures and bridges traditionally the shm is classified into two groups active and passive method the active shm method detects damages using signals generated by active sources and the passive method only uses ambient signals received by passive sensors to find damages davis and brockhurst 2015 farrar and worden 2007 jamalkia et al 2016 liu et al 2017 yi 2016 recently a series of studies on ambient noise interferometry have demonstrated that the time domain green s function tdgf between two receiving points can be reconstructed from the ensemble average of the cross correlation of ambient diffuse fields lobkis and weaver 2001 roux and kuperman 2004 sabra et al 2005 snieder 2002 wapenaar 2004 weaver and lobkis 2004 these interesting studies have two implications for the application to the shm in the plate structure first active sensors are not needed for shm and a pair of passive sensors is sufficient for the recovery of tdgf if the inspected plate creates sufficient diffuse field second in the ambient noise interferometry the plate structure causing multiple reflections is no longer a hindrance to the shm since the complexity of the structure rather promotes the diffuseness and randomness of the wave field applications of the ambient noise interferometry to the shm of the plate structure were first investigated by sabra et al 2007 they performed an experiment for a flat plate and a hydrofoil in a cavitation tunnel and reconstructed the tdgf from ambient vibrations induced by turbulent flows successively sabra et al 2008 extracted the tdgf in an aluminum plate from the diffuse field generated by random excitations of a garnet pulsed laser and observed the change of tdgf with and without a hole damage duroux et al 2010 performed similar experimental work on an aluminum plate with two piezoelectric actuators and a scanning laser doppler vibrometer they synthesized the diffuse field with multiple measurements based on the source receiver reciprocity and conducted several theoretical and experimental analyses recently experimental studies were investigated to detect a nonlinear material attachment on the plate tippmann et al 2014 tippmann and lanza di scalea 2015 the diffuse field needed to obtain the tdgf is artificially made from multiple excitations by the shaker over 576 grid points on the plate they defined several damage indices dis describing the similarity of forward and backward tdgf that are expected to be sensitive to the damage with nonlinear behavior sohn et al 2004 tippmann and lanza di scalea 2015 these dis were used for the k nearest neighbor knn algorithm with the principal component analysis pca to detect the damage and showed good damage detectability in this paper we perform an experimental study on the passive shm from a diffuse field on an aluminum plate and propose a novel damage detection algorithm using statistical parameters of damaged and undamaged noise cross correlation functions ncfs the experimental procedure of tippmann and lanza di scalea 2015 is adopted in this paper however the approach in this paper differs from that by tippmann and lanza di scalea 2015 in a number of ways as follows 1 instead of the random noise shaker a hand held impact hammer is used as the source actually our source generation technique is closer to the active source interferometry than the ambient noise interferometry in practice while the use of natural random noise may be more cost effective it renders the stable control of the shm difficult the active source interferometry can be suitable for marine system or offshore system which is usually exposed to wave impact loading e g slamming in this paper the effects of number of the active sources on the damage detection are studied 2 in addition to nonlinear material attachment considered in tippmann and lanza di scalea 2015 a punctuated hole damage is used 3 new feature vectors characterizing the elastic behavior of the plate are presented based on the statistics of the damaged and undamaged data of the ncf these feature vectors differ from current feature vectors using the reciprocity of tdgf and are applicable to all types of damages the pca is used to reduce the dimension of the feature vectors and the support vector machine svm is then applied for damage detection this paper is organized as follows section 2 summarizes the theoretical background of the extraction of the coherent fields from the cross correlation of the diffuse field in addition a few statistical parameters using the ncf are given for damage detection section 3 describes the laboratory experiment for the active source interferometry in two cases of nonlinear attachment and hole damage and measurement data the damage detection using the svm with the pca is given in section 4 section 5 is a summary and conclusions 2

i 1 n c 12 i t where the operator n refers to the ensemble averaging of n cross correlation functions it has been demonstrated that when the n sources are uniformly distributed in space and time and the resultant field is fully diffused the tdgf is reconstructed from the time derivative of eq 2 however the real environment is not ideal since many of the noise sources have a band limited spectrum and their distribution is not always uniform in space and time the loss is always present in the structure and the receivers have their own transducer response characteristics considering such factors the averaged ncf can be theoretically stated as roux et al 2005 3 c 12 t n q t g 12 t g 21 t where g 12 t is the tdgf from sensor 1 to sensor 2 in the positive time domain while g 21 t is the tdgf

distribution the kurtosis value is 3 the distribution which has a kurtosis greater than three has a higher peak and longer tail than the standard normal distribution on the contrary a distribution with kurtosis less than three has a lower peak and shorter tail than the standard normal distribution these five indices constitute a feature vector for damaged or undamaged cases which are used as input data of the damage detection algorithm these five statistics are listed in table 1 3 experiment and data processing 3 1 experimental setup the experiment is conducted on a square aluminum plate with a length of 40 cm and a thickness of 2 mm as shown in fig 2 two accelerometers b k type 4383 measuring the out of plane accelerations of the plate are installed at x y 27 cm 13 cm and 13 cm 27 cm for the plane coordinate shown on the left side of fig 2 and are connected to the charge amplifier b k nexus 118 square grids are drawn on the plate and then a hand held impulse hammer dytran 5800b4 is struck at each grid to excite the plate the impulse signal generated by the hammer is not exactly the same at every excitation since it is conducted manually fig 3 shows the histogram of a thousand zero delay cross correlation coefficients each of which is calculated with two impulses randomly sampled from the total impulses of 472 used for the experiment and computed by eq 4 in which c 12 t n 1 and c 12 t n 2 are replaced by the hammer impulses here those hammer impulses are records of impulses at the moment of hammering acquired by the hammer s own sensor in fig 3 it is shown that most of the values are over 0 6 and the mode is 0 76 fig 4 represents a typical hammer impulse spectrum acquired from the impulse hammer black solid line and the noise spectrum in case of no excitation blue dotted line the energy of the impulse dominates below 2 khz and is distinguishable from the background noise up to the frequency range of 7 khz as described in the introduction two damage scenarios are tested in the experiment one damage scenario is a 25 mm diameter punctured hole located at the center of the plate while the other is an attached square clay with a length of 25 mm and a thickness of 10 mm for these two damaged conditions and corresponding undamaged conditions four experiments were carried out two experiments for the attached clay case are performed in a complete square plate with or without the attached square clay in the case of the punctuated hole two plates of one complete square plate and one square plate with a punctuated hole are respectively used for undamaged and damaged scenarios we mention that two plates used in the punctuated hole case have the same size and material property except that one of two has a punctuated hole consequently 472 118 grid points excitation 4 time signals are collected at each accelerometer for each scenario the measured data are processed by matlab software the configuration of the experiment is depicted in fig 5 3 2 data processing the sampling frequency is 200 khz and the time segments to the first 0 5 s are taken for the data analysis using eq 2 the averaged ncf for n excitations is calculated after normalization of each cross correlation function other normalization methods such as clipping and one bit normalization that are directly applied to the received time signal are not used for the analysis although such techniques slightly increase the snr of the coherent fields its benefit in damage detection is small in comparison with the increased additional processing costs fig 6 shows an averaged ncf for 118 excitations for the undamaged plate for a fully diffused field the averaged ncf is symmetric in time while the tdgf is an antisymmetric function in fig 6 the zero delay cross correlation coefficient

observed as the number of sources is less than 10 this is because the reduced number of sources is insufficient to generate the diffuse field coincident with several previous studies duroux et al 2010 weaver and lobkis 2005 fig 7 b shows the mean curve of the cross correlation coefficients it is verified that the mean value rapidly converges to 1 as n increases 4 damage detection 4 1 statistics of the averaged ncf by the damage type and the number of sources to explore the characteristics of the five features listed in table 1 the experimental data are examined for the damage type and the number of sources assuming that the n sources are excited on a plate 1000 sets of source locations are randomly sampled and applied to evaluate the averaged ncf for each of the undamaged clay attached and hole punctuated plates the statistics are computed using the formulas given in table 1 for the time interval of 0 0 5 fig 8 represents a plot of the expected value of 1000 samples of statistics as a function of the number of sources the lines with circle star and square markers represent the undamaged plate the hole punctuated plate and the clay attached plate respectively as the number of sources increases all statistics show a trend of converging to a constant value because a more stable ncf is generated in the more diffuse field with large sources it is interesting that most of the features are distinguishable from each other for small n in fig 8 the mean and variance of the hole punctuated plate are smaller than those of the undamaged and clay attached plate this is related to the shape of f t in the hole punctuated plate most of the wave energy is concentrated on the early arrivals because of reflections at the hole boundary on the contrary early arrivals in the clay attached plate undergo damping due to the clay so the shape of f t becomes flatter this explains the small mean and variance of the hole punctuated plate similar trends can be observed in the skewness and kurtosis since the f t of the hole punctuated plate has focused energy on the early arrivals the skewness kurtosis and rms are highest among the three cases on the other hand the skewness and kurtosis of the clay attached plate are the lowest the rmss of the clay attached plate and undamaged plate are slightly distinguishable but the former is higher than the latter this difference is the consequence of the area normalization applied to the averaged ncf fig 9 plots the f t and its cumulative distribution function cdf of the undamaged plate black solid line the hole punctuated plate red dash dot line and the clay attached plate magenta dashed line for the 118 sources in fig 9 b it is clear that the hole punctuated plate shows more energy concentrations on the early arrivals figs 10 and 11 plot the histograms of 1000 samples comparing the undamaged and hole punctuated plates where n is 100 in fig 10 and 50 in fig 11 the white histograms with black lines are obtained from the undamaged plate while the red histograms are obtained from the hole punctuated plate the histograms of the mean and variance for the undamaged plate are on the right side of those for the hole punctuated plate and histograms of the other three statistics for the intact condition are on the left side of those for the hole punctuated plate figs 12 and 13 compare the histograms of the undamaged plate white histograms and the clay attached plate red histograms where n is 100 in fig 12 and 50 in fig 13 contrary to figs 10 and 11 the histograms of mean and variance for the undamaged plate are on the left side of those for the clay attached plate while the histograms of skewness and kurtosis for the intact plate are on the right side of those for the clay attached plate fig 10 13 demonstrate that the histograms of the undamaged and damaged plate become more separate for a larger number of sources which generate a more accurate ncf 4 2 damage classification using support vector machine for damage classification with five statistics denoted by the damage index di in this study the simple linear support vector machine svm was performed for each number of sources and type of damage the svm is operated on 2000 di samples half of which are calculated from the undamaged plate and the rest are calculated from the damaged plate one di sample is generated with the n sources chosen randomly from the 118 exciting noise sources for each plate di samples are partitioned into the training data 1600 samples for learning validation data 200 samples to decide the parameter of the classifier and test data 200 samples to adequately assess the performance of the classifier adequ ately the parameter of the svm is determined by comparing the validation set error and the test error is analyzed in the test data using the established classifier from the validation set before using the svm the principal component analysis pca is applied on the projected training data in order to obtain more important bases and reduce redundancy the pca is a statistical process which searches new axes on principal components pc that represent the original data appropriately firstly the pca computes the first pc having the largest variance which minimizes the sum of the squared error between the original data and the projected data on to the pc next the pca finds the second pc orthogonal to the first pc with the second largest variance and the subsequent pcs are analyzed in the same way morrison et al 1998 all pcs are searched using the singular value decomposition svd where the eigenvectors correspond to pcs the first pc has the largest eigenvalue and the following pcs have succeeding largest eigenvalues to reduce the dimension of the data the number of pcs is determined considering the cumulative percentage of total variation t m jolliffe 2002 7 t m 100 i 1 m λ i i 1 p λ i λ i is the ith largest eigenvalue where p and m are the total number of eigenvalues and the number of selected eigenvalues respectively the t m indicates the number of m largest pcs that can explain the total variation of the original data and is defined by the user s desire such as 80 or 90 in this study the t m is decided as 90 and the corresponding m is 2 accordingly the original training set composed of 1600 samples of five dimensional 5 d space are projected to the two dimensional 2 d space constructed from the first two pcs the svm is applied to these projected training data to learn the linear classifier the svm is a binary classifier which maximizes the margin defined as the smallest distance between the decision line and any of the data bishop 2006 the svm produces sparse solutions which can make predictions using a subset of the training data known as support vectors in this study the linear decision line was computed as the data were separable and the box constraint c of the linear decision line was calculated by analyzing the validation data bottou et al 2007 the box constraint c can control the strictness of separation for example if c increases it allows fewer support vectors with stricter separation the box constraint is tested on 11 values 1 10 100 and is determined to minimize the validation error to calculate the validation error the validation set needs to be projected onto the same 2 d space generated in the training set and the error is then computed using the linear hyperplane learned from the projected training data for each 10 cases of the number of sources n 10 20 100 the box constraint is estimated as c 1 1 100 100 1 1 100 100 100 100 for the hole punctuated plate and as c 1 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 for the clay attached plate using these box constraints the linear decision line can be determined third the test data projected onto the same pcs of the training data are examined to evaluate the performance of the constructed classifier fig 14 plots the projected data comparing the undamaged and hole punctuated plates where the number of sources is 5 50 and 100 fig 15 compares the projected data of the undamaged and clay attached plate while the other plot settings are the same as those in fig 14 in both figs 14 and 15 the x axis is the first pc while the y axis is the second pc the left plot represents the projected training data and the right plot shows projected test data in each subplot in the figure the circle and square markers represent the undamaged plate and the cross and star markers correspond to the damaged plate as the distance of histograms between the undamaged and damaged plate increases for the increased number of sources in the original data the projected data are naturally also more separate for an increased number of sources when the number of sources is smaller than 10 the data are nearly non separable as the field is not diffuse enough to make a clear difference between the undamaged and damaged conditions as shown in figs 14 a and 15 a if the number of sources is over 50 the data between the undamaged and damaged plate for both damage types become almost distinguishable as shown in figs 14 c and 15 c interestingly when the number of sources is 50 as shown in fig 15 b the data for the clay attached case are more separate than the hole punctuated case in fig 14 b this is because the damage by clay attachment is more sensitive in this study because of its nonlinear behavior fig 16 shows the classification result for 50 sources for the hole punctuated plate and the clay attached plate in each subplot the left plot displays projected training data and the right plot represents projected test data the black line represents the decision line generated from the training data the triangle markers in the projected test data represent misclassified data such as test errors and other markers are same as those of fig 15 the test errors can be divided into two groups type 1 and type 2 errors which represent a false alarm and a miss respectively fassois and sakellariou 2007 in the projected test plots in fig 16 a the errors triangle markers on the right side of the decision line correspond to type 1 errors while the errors on the left side of the hyper plane correspond to type 2 errors in fig 16 b for the clay attached plate no misclassified data appear because the projected data are perfectly separate which again signifies larger change of waveform in the clay attached plate finally the test error is analyzed as a function of the number of sources as shown in fig 17 the figure displays type 1 error magenta line and type 2 error red dashed line rates in percentage for the hole punctuated and the clay attached plates when the number of sources is less than 70 the test error for the clay attached plate tends to be smaller than that of the hole punctuated plate hence the test error for the clay attached plate is generally smaller than that for the hole punctuated plate this is because the features of the mean and variance in the clay attached plate are clearly distinct from those of the undamaged plate as shown in figs 12 and 13 in both damage types the error decreases monotonically according to the increment of the number of sources since an accurate ncf can be achieved in a more diffuse field which eventually generates more distinct data between the damaged and undamaged plate 5 summary and conclusions in this paper a damage detection algorithm using diffuse elastic fields is proposed this algorithm has three stages first the averaged ncf for each of the undamaged hole punctuated and clay attached plates is computed from the two point cross correlation of diffuse acceleration fields which are generated by random excitations of the plate second the time domain statistics of mean variance skewness kurtosis and rms values are extracted from the obtained ncf consisting of feature vectors for damage detection for redundancy reduction the 5 d vector is projected onto two principal components using pca considering the cumulative percentage of total variations is 90 finally the linear svm is used for damage detection the linear hyperplane is learned from the projected training set and the parameters of the classifier that minimize the validation set error are determined the proposed algorithm is applied to the experimental data acquired in the aluminum plate our classifier shows good performance in both damaged cases but is slightly more sensitive to the clay attached case this is because the decaying of early paths by the clay has more influence on the shape of ncf than the scattered paths created by the hole in the fully diffuse field with large n the data sets of the undamaged and damaged plates are perfectly separable in both cases of punctuated hole and clay attachments although its performance is degenerated in a less diffuse field the error is not high even for small n this implies that the error resulting from the incomplete construction of the averaged ncf can be mitigated by the ability of the classifier therefore the use of a more intellectual classifier may further improve the detection performance and reduce the cost of the monitoring system using the diffuse field

23299,in order to assess the damage detectability of the structural health monitoring method using diffuse fields a laboratory experiment is conducted on an aluminum plate where two accelerometers are mounted as receivers two types of damages a nonlinear material attachment and a punctuated hole are considered a hand held impact hammer is used for the excitation whereby the hammer is moved over grid points drawn on the aluminum plate and thus the diffuse fields are generated by superposing the wave fields by many excitations randomly sampled from the cross correlation of diffuse fields between two receivers we extract the coherent wave field in cases with and without damages to detect the damage a novel damage detection algorithm using a support vector machine is suggested based on the reduced features transformed from several statistical parameters of damaged and undamaged noise cross correlation functions aided by the principal component analysis the performance of the proposed algorithm is analyzed for the number of sources and damage types keywords structural health monitoring cross correlation diffuse field damage index support vector machine 1 introduction structural health monitoring shm is imperative for safe operation of large structures such as ships offshore structures and bridges traditionally the shm is classified into two groups active and passive method the active shm method detects damages using signals generated by active sources and the passive method only uses ambient signals received by passive sensors to find damages davis and brockhurst 2015 farrar and worden 2007 jamalkia et al 2016 liu et al 2017 yi 2016 recently a series of studies on ambient noise interferometry have demonstrated that the time domain green s function tdgf between two receiving points can be reconstructed from the ensemble average of the cross correlation of ambient diffuse fields lobkis and weaver 2001 roux and kuperman 2004 sabra et al 2005 snieder 2002 wapenaar 2004 weaver and lobkis 2004 these interesting studies have two implications for the application to the shm in the plate structure first active sensors are not needed for shm and a pair of passive sensors is sufficient for the recovery of tdgf if the inspected plate creates sufficient diffuse field second in the ambient noise interferometry the plate structure causing multiple reflections is no longer a hindrance to the shm since the complexity of the structure rather promotes the diffuseness and randomness of the wave field applications of the ambient noise interferometry to the shm of the plate structure were first investigated by sabra et al 2007 they performed an experiment for a flat plate and a hydrofoil in a cavitation tunnel and reconstructed the tdgf from ambient vibrations induced by turbulent flows successively sabra et al 2008 extracted the tdgf in an aluminum plate from the diffuse field generated by random excitations of a garnet pulsed laser and observed the change of tdgf with and without a hole damage duroux et al 2010 performed similar experimental work on an aluminum plate with two piezoelectric actuators and a scanning laser doppler vibrometer they synthesized the diffuse field with multiple measurements based on the source receiver reciprocity and conducted several theoretical and experimental analyses recently experimental studies were investigated to detect a nonlinear material attachment on the plate tippmann et al 2014 tippmann and lanza di scalea 2015 the diffuse field needed to obtain the tdgf is artificially made from multiple excitations by the shaker over 576 grid points on the plate they defined several damage indices dis describing the similarity of forward and backward tdgf that are expected to be sensitive to the damage with nonlinear behavior sohn et al 2004 tippmann and lanza di scalea 2015 these dis were used for the k nearest neighbor knn algorithm with the principal component analysis pca to detect the damage and showed good damage detectability in this paper we perform an experimental study on the passive shm from a diffuse field on an aluminum plate and propose a novel damage detection algorithm using statistical parameters of damaged and undamaged noise cross correlation functions ncfs the experimental procedure of tippmann and lanza di scalea 2015 is adopted in this paper however the approach in this paper differs from that by tippmann and lanza di scalea 2015 in a number of ways as follows 1 instead of the random noise shaker a hand held impact hammer is used as the source actually our source generation technique is closer to the active source interferometry than the ambient noise interferometry in practice while the use of natural random noise may be more cost effective it renders the stable control of the shm difficult the active source interferometry can be suitable for marine system or offshore system which is usually exposed to wave impact loading e g slamming in this paper the effects of number of the active sources on the damage detection are studied 2 in addition to nonlinear material attachment considered in tippmann and lanza di scalea 2015 a punctuated hole damage is used 3 new feature vectors characterizing the elastic behavior of the plate are presented based on the statistics of the damaged and undamaged data of the ncf these feature vectors differ from current feature vectors using the reciprocity of tdgf and are applicable to all types of damages the pca is used to reduce the dimension of the feature vectors and the support vector machine svm is then applied for damage detection this paper is organized as follows section 2 summarizes the theoretical background of the extraction of the coherent fields from the cross correlation of the diffuse field in addition a few statistical parameters using the ncf are given for damage detection section 3 describes the laboratory experiment for the active source interferometry in two cases of nonlinear attachment and hole damage and measurement data the damage detection using the svm with the pca is given in section 4 section 5 is a summary and conclusions 2 theoretical background 2 1 extraction of coherent fields from the diffuse field generated by a number of sources as shown in fig 1 consider the elastic field generated by a source arbitrarily located

features are distinguishable from each other for small n in fig 8 the mean and variance of the hole punctuated plate are smaller than those of the undamaged and clay attached plate this is related to the shape of f t in the hole punctuated plate most of the wave energy is concentrated on the early arrivals because of reflections at the hole boundary on the contrary early arrivals in the clay attached plate undergo damping due to the clay so the shape of f t becomes flatter this explains the small mean and variance of the hole punctuated plate similar trends can be observed in the skewness and kurtosis since the f t of the hole punctuated plate has focused energy on the early arrivals the skewness kurtosis and rms are highest among the three cases on the other hand the skewness and kurtosis of the clay attached plate are the lowest the rmss of the clay attached plate and undamaged plate are slightly distinguishable but the former is higher than the latter this difference is the consequence of the area normalization applied to the averaged ncf fig 9 plots the f t and its cumulative distribution function cdf of the undamaged plate black solid line the hole punctuated plate red dash dot line and the clay attached plate magenta dashed line for the 118 sources in fig 9 b it is clear that the hole punctuated plate shows more energy concentrations on the early arrivals figs 10 and 11 plot the histograms of 1000 samples comparing the undamaged and hole punctuated plates where n is 100 in fig 10 and 50 in fig 11 the white histograms with black lines are obtained from the undamaged plate while the red histograms are obtained from the hole punctuated plate the histograms of the mean and variance for the undamaged plate are on the right side of those for the hole punctuated plate and histograms of the other three statistics for the intact condition are on the left side of those for the hole punctuated plate figs 12 and 13 compare the histograms of the undamaged plate white histograms and the clay attached plate red histograms where n is 100 in fig 12 and 50 in fig 13 contrary to figs 10 and 11 the histograms of mean and variance for the undamaged plate are on the left side of those for the clay attached plate while the histograms of skewness and kurtosis for the intact plate are on the right side of those for the clay attached plate fig 10 13 demonstrate that the histograms of the undamaged and damaged plate become more separate for a larger number of sources which generate a more accurate ncf 4 2 damage classification using support vector machine for damage classification with five statistics denoted by the damage index di in this study the simple linear support vector machine svm was performed for each number of sources and type of damage the svm is operated on 2000 di samples half of which are calculated from the undamaged plate and the rest are calculated from the damaged plate one di sample is generated with the n sources chosen randomly from the 118 exciting noise sources for each plate di samples are partitioned into the training data 1600 samples for learning validation data 200 samples to decide the parameter of the classifier and test data 200 samples to adequately assess the performance of the classifier adequ ately the parameter of the svm is determined by comparing the validation set error and the test error is analyzed in the test data using the established classifier from the validation set before using the svm the principal component analysis pca is applied on the projected training data in order to obtain more important bases and reduce redundancy the pca is a statistical process which searches new axes on principal components pc that represent the original data appropriately firstly the pca computes the first pc having the largest variance which minimizes the sum of the squared error between the original data and the projected data on to the pc next the pca finds the second pc orthogonal to the first pc with the second largest variance and the subsequent pcs are analyzed in the same way morrison et al 1998 all pcs are searched using the singular value decomposition svd where the eigenvectors correspond to pcs the first pc has the largest eigenvalue and the following pcs have succeeding largest eigenvalues to reduce the dimension of the data the number of pcs is determined considering the cumulative percentage of total variation t m jolliffe 2002 7 t m 100 i 1 m λ i i 1 p λ i λ i is the ith largest eigenvalue where p and m are the total number of eigenvalues and the number of selected eigenvalues respectively the t m indicates the number of m largest pcs that can explain the total variation of the original data and is defined by the user s desire such as 80 or 90 in this study the t m is decided as 90 and the corresponding m is 2 accordingly the original training set composed of 1600 samples of five dimensional 5 d space are projected to the two dimensional 2 d space constructed from the first two pcs the svm is applied to these projected training data to learn the linear classifier the svm is a binary classifier which maximizes the margin defined as the smallest distance between the decision line and any of the data bishop 2006 the svm produces sparse solutions which can make predictions using a subset of the training data known as support vectors in this study the linear decision line was computed as the data were separable and the box constraint c of the linear decision line was calculated by analyzing the validation data bottou et al 2007 the box constraint c can control the strictness of separation for example if c increases it allows fewer support vectors with stricter separation the box constraint is tested on 11 values 1 10 100 and is determined to minimize the validation error to calculate the validation error the validation set needs to be projected onto the same 2 d space generated in the training set and the error is then computed using the linear hyperplane learned from the projected training data for each 10 cases of the number of sources n 10 20 100 the box constraint is estimated as c 1 1 100 100 1 1 100 100 100 100 for the hole punctuated plate and as c 1 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 for the clay attached plate using these box constraints the linear decision line can be determined third the test data projected onto the same pcs of the training data are examined to evaluate the performance of the constructed classifier fig 14 plots the projected data comparing the undamaged and hole punctuated plates where the number of sources is 5 50 and 100 fig 15 compares the projected data of the undamaged and clay attached plate while the other plot settings are the same as those in fig 14 in both figs 14 and 15 the x axis is the first pc while the y axis is the second pc the left plot represents the projected training data and the right plot shows projected test data in each subplot in the figure the circle and square markers represent the undamaged plate and the cross and star markers correspond to the damaged plate as the distance of histograms between the undamaged and damaged plate increases for the increased number of sources in the original data the projected data are naturally also more separate for an increased number of sources when the number of sources is smaller than 10 the data are nearly non separable as the field is not diffuse enough to make a clear difference between the undamaged and damaged conditions as shown in figs 14 a and 15 a if the number of sources is over 50 the data between the undamaged and damaged plate for both damage types become almost distinguishable as shown in figs 14 c and 15 c interestingly when the number of sources is 50 as shown in fig 15 b the data for the clay attached case are more separate than the hole punctuated case in fig 14 b this is because the damage by clay attachment is more sensitive in this study because of its nonlinear behavior fig 16 shows the classification result for 50 sources for the hole punctuated plate and the clay attached plate in each subplot the left plot displays projected training data and the right plot represents projected test data the black line represents the decision line generated from the training data the triangle markers in the projected test data represent misclassified data such as test errors and other markers are same as those of fig 15 the test errors can be divided into two groups type 1 and type 2 errors which represent a false alarm and a miss respectively fassois and sakellariou 2007 in the projected test plots in fig 16 a the errors triangle markers on the right side of the decision line correspond to type 1 errors while the errors on the left side of the hyper plane correspond to type 2 errors in fig 16 b for the clay attached plate no misclassified data appear because the projected data are perfectly separate which again signifies larger change of waveform in the clay attached plate finally the test error is analyzed as a function of the number of sources as shown in fig 17 the figure displays type 1 error magenta line and type 2 error red dashed line rates in percentage for the hole punctuated and the clay attached plates when the number of sources is less than 70 the test error for the clay attached plate tends to be smaller than that of the hole punctuated plate hence the test error for the clay attached plate is generally smaller than that for the hole punctuated plate this is because the features of the mean and variance in the clay attached plate are clearly distinct from those of the undamaged plate as shown in figs 12 and 13 in both damage types the error decreases monotonically according to the increment of the number of sources since an accurate ncf can be achieved in a more diffuse field which eventually generates more distinct data between the damaged and undamaged plate 5 summary and conclusions in this paper a damage detection algorithm using diffuse elastic fields is proposed this algorithm has three stages first the averaged ncf for each of the undamaged hole punctuated and clay attached plates is computed from the two point cross correlation of diffuse acceleration fields which are generated by random excitations of the plate second the time domain statistics of mean variance skewness kurtosis and rms values are extracted from the obtained ncf consisting of feature vectors for damage detection for redundancy reduction the 5 d vector is projected onto two principal components using pca considering the cumulative percentage of total variations is 90 finally the linear svm is used for damage detection the linear hyperplane is learned from the projected training set and the parameters of the classifier that minimize the validation set error are determined the proposed algorithm is applied to the experimental data acquired in the aluminum plate our classifier shows good performance in both damaged cases but is slightly more sensitive to the clay attached case this is because the decaying of early paths by the clay has more influence on the shape of ncf than the scattered paths created by the hole in the fully diffuse field with large n the data sets of the undamaged and damaged plates are perfectly separable in both cases of punctuated hole and clay attachments although its performance is degenerated in a less diffuse field the error is not high even for small n this implies that the error resulting from the incomplete construction of the averaged ncf can be mitigated by the ability of the classifier therefore the use of a more intellectual classifier may further improve the detection performance and reduce the cost of the monitoring system using the diffuse field
