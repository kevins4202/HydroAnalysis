4215,the zambezi river basin is among many basins in southern african region with inadequate low resolution poorly maintained and distributed network of hydrometeorological stations this scenario entails scarcity of hydrological data in the basin and subsequently leads to poor assessment of water resources this paper investigates alternative technologies in the assessment of the hydrology and water resources in the basin the high resolution gridded climate data together with land use and soil data were used as inputs into swat model to simulate hydrological processes calibration and validation of model were performed using swat cup comparison of average monthly rainfall data for gridded and observed shows 97 correlation the statistics show ns to be 0 73 while r2 was 0 73 the uncertainty analysis was determined with a p factor at 0 75 while the r factor was 0 75 therefore use of gridded climate data for hydrological modelling in data scarce regions could be a useful tool to estimate the main hydrological parameters and water resources of an area with satisfactory accuracy keywords gridded climate data hydrology modelling swat water resources 1 introduction water resources assessments are key to planning and development of water resources in any given river basin world bank group 2018 zhang et al 2018 the assessment of water resources is achieved through a well maintained hydrometeorological observational network in a given river basin however many river basins in southern african region have inadequate poorly maintained hydrometeorological observation networks resulting in poor data collection botai et al 2015 euroconsult 2008 hughes 2006 this leads to a challenge of inaccurate estimation of water resources tan et al 2017 kabompo river basin krb located within the zambezi river basin zrb is one such a basin with data scarcity of river discharge water quality rainfall and temperature many previous studies have typically analysed satellite data sources as alternative to gauged rainfall to simulate runoff in the sparsely gauged zambezi river basin botai et al 2015 boillat et al 2012 meier and fr 2011 hughes 2006 satellite based rainfall data has a tendency of under estimating rainfall due to indirect measurements which are normally captured with a large scale of inconsistencies more studies have also shown that satellite based products have in general challenges to depict precipitation in regions characterised by complicated landscape where precipitation is a function of the orography with spacio temporally variability sun et al 2017 derin and yilmaz 2014 in view of data scarcity there is need to consider other new technologies of capturing the much needed hydrometeorological data that largely enables accurate water resources assessments for effective integrated water resources management in the basin tan et al 2017 this paper explores the use of global reanalysis climate data for hydrological simulation in the kabompo river basin to overcome challenges of data paucity tolera et al 2018 hu et al 2017 lu et al 2015 as a new technique global reanalysis climate data is gridded climate data gcd developed from simulated and satellite remotely sensed data sources it is a source of extensive data in space and time covering longer periods and have been utilised for research on different climatological aspects malakar et al 2020 the data has potential to be an alternative of the observed climate data conventional climate data for streamflow simulation and other applications tan et al 2017 it is also defined as a multiple year global gridded representations known as reanalysis datasets tomy and sumam 2016 consecutive production of reanalysis outputs produced by various institutions have improved their quality with better models input data and assimilation methods sun et al 2017 in the recent past many studies have been made with gridded climate data sets as input data for hydrological modelling with different degrees of success for instance nkiaka et al 2017 applied wfdel and cfsr gridded climate data sets as input data for hydrological modelling using soil water assessment tool swat model in data scarce areas of logone catchment in the lake chad basin where acceptable results were obtained and concluded that in the absence of gauged hydro meteorological data wfdei and cfsr could be used for hydrological modelling in data scarce areas alemayehu et al 2018 applied cfsr and watch gridded climate datasets to simulate the observed streamflow on monthly scale using the swat model in mara basin of kenya tanzania had an improved skill and recommended the data to be a useful substitute of gauge rainfall data for hydrologic application in the basin dile and srinivasan 2014 utilised cfsr gridded climate data set to simulate the hydrology of lake tana basin in the upper blue nile using swat model and obtained results that were satisfactory and that the data could be a valuable alternative for hydrological prediction in data scarce areas of the blue nile where conventional gauges were not available fuka et al 2014 applied cfsr gridded climate data and conventional weather data for hydrological modelling in five different catchments in the us and ethiopia surprisingly found that the results from cfsr data showed good or better streamflow prediction than the best conventional weather stations this was a demonstration that cfsr data could be reliably used for catchment hydrological simulation in different hydroclimate regimes and watersheds the gridded climate data used in this study is from national centers for environmental prediction climate forecast system reanalysis ncep cfsr the cfsr is the latest dataset from ncep that span from 1979 to the current and the period 2001 02 is used for this analysis the cfsr is the third generation reanalysis data that can be accessed at https globalweather tamu edu the analysis utilises the global forecast system gfs as its atmospheric model with a horizontal resolution of t382 38 km that has 64 vertical layers saha et al 2010 the use of gridded climate data for hydrological modelling is the first of its kind in the basin as this technology has not been investigated in the zrb the study has produced new knowledge in hydrological modelling for the basin that has data paucity the hydrological model produced can be applied in other catchments with similar characteristics the technique of using cfsr gridded climate data in data scarce regions such as the zambezi will now be a solution to data scarcity in view of the above the study is therefore considered to be a novelty the climate forecast reanalysis system cfsr gridded climate data with a high resolution was used as an alternative to the conventional ground observed data sets the data was analysed using swat model swat is a complex physically based model efficient in performing long term simulations and is able to describe water and sediment circulation vegetation growth and nutrients circulation with hourly daily and monthly time resolution guzman et al 2015 arnold et al 2012 neitsch et al 2005 the model is well recommended and most widely used in the world in the field of hydrology and water resources management abbaspour et al 2019 wang et al 2019 mehan et al 2017 the swat model is considered user friendly and easy to access as it is readily available habte et al 2013 in addition geographical information system gis was used to explore the temporal and spatial variability of water resources in the basin the results of the hydrological modelling showed nash sutcliffe efficiency ns at 0 73 while coefficient of determination r2 was 0 73 the uncertainty analysis showed the 95 prediction uncertainty p factor at 0 75 and the band representing observed data including its error r factor at 0 75 the simulation results also indicate that there is adequate water yield at present across the krb with potential to harness and utilise more than half of the water yield that is distributed across the basin the objective of the study was to determine the suitability of cfsr gridded climate data in data scarce regions for hydrological modelling and estimation of water resources of the krb 2 materials and methods 2 1 location of study area the krb is located between 14o 15 07 29 s 23o 08 27 44 e and 17o 36 17 21 s 25o 48 28 39 e it is one of the 13 basins in the zrb which has deep well drained kalahari sands covering the entire region beilfuss 2012 the basin has wooded savannahs as the predominant land use and has mean annual precipitation map of 1200 mm fig 1 indicates the location of the study area krb in the zrb of southern africa 2 2 data sets the datasets used include daily gridded climate data gcd global land use and land cover processed from remotely sensed imagery global soil classification data these data sets were used as input into swat hydrological model in conjunction with geographical information system gis 2 3 the cfsr gridded climate data soil and land cover data are more reliable and accessible because of modem technological advancement in remote sensing however hydrometeorological network are still rarely available and inconsistent in data capturing the cfsr data is increasingly being used as input data for hydrological modelling as an alternative to the use of conventional observed data in regions with scarcity of data hu et al 2017 the cfsr is a high resolution dataset which covers the entire basin and was downloaded from texas a m university global weather database https globalweather tamu edu cfsr gridded climate data is based on both historical and operational records of observations and newly reprocessed sets of observations produced at meteorological research centres around the world saha et al 2010 cfsr assimilates observations from upper air balloon observations aircraft observations and satellite observations saha et al 2010 since 1978 a number of records were combined for cfsr assimilation from national centres for environmental prediction ncep and european centre for medium climate data https www ecmwf int cfsr reanalyses have an improved method acquiring geopotential height field compared to other reanalyses and have smaller biases and root mean square errors rmse hua et al 2019 cfsr use gridded observational data to eradicate biases which are important and can be utilised to fill gaps in historical observations and may also be a basis for generation of future climate scenarios navarro racines et al 2015 ruane et al 2015 cfsr simulates the precipitation mean and variability for regional pattern and the local details reasonably well due to its high resolution data sets and in addition the coupled ocean atmosphere assimilation in the models sun et al 2017 zhang et al 2012 the cfsr daily data included precipitation mm temperature c relative humidity fraction solar radiation mj m2 and wind speed m s which was all used as input data into swat model for hydrological modelling 2 4 observed hydrometeorological data the precipitation monthly data was obtained from zambia meteorological department zmd an institution responsible for capturing rainfall from all the meteorological stations in zambia the captured rainfall data covered a period of 30 years 1982 2013 and obtained from five existing meteorological stations that have influence on the krb the data from two stations out of five stations were found with few missing values and filled by interpolation using normal ratio method chow et al 1988 de silva et al 2007 the data is recommended to be of acceptable quality mudenda 2007 may et al 2013 the monthly flow data measured in m3 s from watopa gauge station was obtained from water resources management authority warma http www warma org zm an institution responsible for river flows and water resources management in zambia the flow data is recommended to be of acceptable quality sadc 2011 the data covered a period of 1982 to 2005 and is used for calibration and validation of the swat model results 2 5 landuse and land cover land use types and various vegetation affect the overland flow of water in different ways evapotranspiration et and runoff are mainly affected by vegetation while land use types for different slopes with varying crop types result in varying runoff volumes woyessa et al 2011 the activities of land use land cover and water resources management are co dependent land erosion in a catchment leads to sedimentation in water resources and on site nutrient loss and nutrient enrichment of water resources rahul et al 2012 the catchment is divided into sub basins which are further split into hrus in order to classify watershed conditions swat model reflects differences in evapotranspiration for various crops and soils based on the subdivision of the watersheds the land use is therefore an important data input into swat model data sets with land use types that account for more than 20 of the area in hru are included to help address differences between the resolution of data sets coutu and vega 2007 the basin land use data was obtained from usgs https www usgs gov centers eros science usgs eros archive land cover products global land cover characterization glcc which is moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer modis land cover type with a resolution of 500 m 500 m modis based global land cover types are widely used in hydrometeorological modelling the collection 5 1 mcd12q1 product is found to have a substantial amount of inter annual variability with 40 of land pixels showing land cover change one or more times during 2001 2010 https landcover usgs gov the major land use of krb is woody savannahs with more than 90 coverage area based on 2001 2010 landuse land cover data set 2 6 the basin soils the basin soil map was prepared in arcgis based on the united nations food and agriculture organisation fao soils obtained from ministry of lands government of the republic of zambia the soil identification for the basin was performed using the fao soil scientific description based on the pixels the soils may be accessed from the website http www fao org soils portal soil survey soil maps and databases en the basin has four major soil types of which arenosols are predominant with 30 followed by gleysols at 27 farrasol at 24 and acrisols at 15 basin coverage the arenosols commonly known as kalahari sands are extending up to one metre depth with sand content of more than 70 clay and silt content of less than 10 low nutrient content and low water retention capacity 2 7 the dem the dem was obtained from the shuttle radar topographical mission srtm with a resolution of 30 m https earthexplorer usgs gov which is also the most widely used elevation data in the world the catchment which was masked from the pro mosaic dem has the highest elevation of 1568 m while the lowest point is 1020 m above sea level fig 2 shows the delineated krb with an area of 72 082 km2 the inputs to swat hydrological model were dem soil type land use and cfsr data set gridded climate data the swat model was further subjected to calibration and validation using the monthly observed flow data from watopa gauge station watopa gs shown in fig 2 2 8 model set up the arc swat model version 2012 was set up and parameterised within arcgis interface the dem was overlaid with soil and land use data producing 102 sub basins and 255 hydrological response units hrus the hrus are not spatially continuous but are considered homogenous units with similar slope range soil and land use types and are the basic units for hydrological simulations the model simulations were undertaken for a period of 1979 to 2013 the first three years of simulations were used for initialising the model observed streamflow data was obtained from watopa gauge station that had sufficient and reliable measured data for a limited period about two thirds of monthly observed dataset from 1982 to 1997 was used for calibration and the remaining one third from 1998 to 2005 was used for validation of the model 2 9 swat hydrological modelling the swat model is a semi distributed physically based and deterministic model with a high computational efficiency to simulate the hydrological processes in large and small river basins it has been used extensively at a local and regional level to simulate surface runoff interception storage groundwater flows tile drainage percolation and water quality neitsch et al 2005 the swat model is a continuous and process based which was developed to assess the impacts of management decisions on water resources and nonpoint source pollution in river basins arnold et al 2012 swat model is considered user friendly and easy to access as it is readily available habte et al 2013 the prevailing philosophy of modelling demands that models be described in a transparent manner that show the routine performance of calibration validation sensitivity and uncertainty analysis calibration is conditioned on the model structure model inputs analysts assumptions calibration algorithm and calibration data while uncertainty analysis is used to evaluate the strength of the calibrated model abbaspour et al 2015 in swat model surface runoff volume is estimated with the modified soil conservation service scs curve number cn method while kinematic storage model is used to simulate lateral flow and the return flow is approximated by creating the shallow aquifer arnold et al 1998 muskingum method is used to predict channel flood routing the water balance neitsch et al 2005 equation that comprises the hydrological components in swat model is described in eq 1 1 sw t sw 0 i 1 t r day q surf e a w seep q gw where sw t final soil water content mm sw 0 initial soil water content on day i mm r day amount of precipitation on day i mm q surf amount of surface runoff on day i mm whilst ea amount of evapotranspiration et on day i mm w seep amount of water entering the vadose zone from the soil profile on day i mm qgw amount of return flow on day i mm water yield is one of the most important parameters used in the evaluation of water resources management in the basin under study it is the summation of water leaving the hru and entering the main channel during a time step arnold et al 2011 water yield of a sub basin is evaluated by swat model using the following eq 2 2 wyld qsurf qgw qlat qloss where wyld is the measure of the water yield mm qsurf is the surface runoff mm qgw is the groundwater contribution to streamflow mm qlat is the lateral flow contribution to stream mm and qloss is the transmission losses mm from the tributary in hru by means of transmission through the bed frederick an manoj 2018 2 10 calibration uncertainty and sensitivity analysis calibration and uncertainty analysis are conducted using different methods which include parameter solution parasol adaptive clustering covering acco general algorithm ga multi start m simplex swat cup includes glue sufi2 mcmc parasol and pso the most widely used statistics in calibration and validation are r2 and ns r2 ranges from 0 to 1 where 0 shows non correlation while 1 shows perfect correlation and provides an estimate of how well the variance of observed values are replicated by the model predictions krause et al 2005 the regression slope and intercept are equal to 1 and 0 respectively although most of the published swat studies do not show the slope and intercept as perfect fit the ns values range from to 1 and provide a measure of how well the simulated output matches the observed data along a 1 1 line regression line with slope equal to 1 the ns value of 1 shows a perfect fit between observed and simulated data ns values 0 indicate that the observed data mean is a more accurate predictor than the simulated output both ns and r2 are biased towards high flows arnold et al 2012 the uncertainty analysis is based on local error and clustering calibration of models brings about some uncertainty in predictions which can be categorised as conceptual model uncertainty input uncertainty and parameter uncertainty abbaspour 2015 the most widely used method of the uncertainty estimation is the sequential uncertainty fitting 2 sufi 2 together with swat calibration uncertainty programme swat cup abbaspour et al 2004 the method is used to carry out parametrisation sensitivity analysis uncertainty analysis calibration and validation of hydrological variables on daily and monthly time steps calibration process is made easier in sufi 2 because it is semi automated and can be done within a short period of time mehan et al 2017 the results of swat cup has been found to be useful in calibrating the model and estimating uncertainties and related assumptions in water resources modelling narsimlu et al 2015 the algorithm calculates all the uncertainties of the parameters conceptual model and other inputs in the form of a graph expressed as uniform distributions or ranges much of the observed data is captured within a threshold of 95 prediction uncertainty 95ppu through the model iteration process latin hypercube sampling is used to calculate the 95ppu at 2 5 and 97 5 levels of cumulative distributions of an output variable the performance of the model for simulating stream flow based on monthly and daily measured flows has been classified into four categories depending on the threshold of modified nash sutcliffe efficiency mne and percent bias pbias values moriasi et al 2007 table 1 shows the general performance ratings and recommended statistics besides the quantitative statistics in table 1 hydrographs for observed and simulated flows are plotted to compare and help understand the base flow recession and other hydrograph characteristics daggupati et al 2015 2 11 performance indices two indices referred to as p factor and r factor abbaspour et al 2004 were calculated to determine the goodness of fit the p factor represents the 95ppu for model simulation and r factor is the band representing observed data including its error the fraction of the observed data error bracketed by the 95ppu band is the p factor which ranges from 0 to 1 where 1 is 100 bracketing of the observed data within the prediction uncertainty and also shows that the model simulation is perfect a p factor value of 0 7 is often recommended to be adequate for simulation purpose but the recommended values are largely dependent on the quality of the input parameters calibration and validation data whilst the r factor is simply the ratio of the mean width of the 95ppu band and standard deviation of the measured variable the preferred value is less than 1 5 based on the scale of the study abbaspour et al 2015 the p factor and r factor indices indicate the strength and performance of the calibration and validation a bigger value of p factor can be obtained at the expense of a bigger value of r factor and therefore there must be a balance between the two when acceptable r factor and p factor values are reached through iteration the parameter ranges are considered calibrated parameters four performance indices are normally used to evaluate the model performance and these are p factor r factor r2 and ns the r2 and ns is a likelihood measure for the rainfall runoff model swat model in sufi 2 approach between the simulated and observed stream flow the ns was calculated using the following eq 3 3 n s 1 i 1 n y i x i 2 i 1 n x i x 2 where xi is the ground based measurements yi is the model predicted data and x is the mean of the ground based measurements the p factor which is the percentage of measured data bracketed by the 95 prediction boundary also called 95ppu was used to quantify all the uncertainties associated with swat model the p factor and r factor are linked to each other such that a larger p factor can only be obtained at the expense of a higher r factor as alluded to above the r factor is calculated by the following eq 4 4 r f a c t o r 1 n i 1 n y ti 97 5 m y i ti 2 5 m σ obs where y ti 97 5 m is the upper boundary of the 95ub y ti 2 5 m is the lower boundary of the 95lb and σ obs is the standard deviation of the observed data 3 results and discussion 3 1 comparison of observed and gridded rainfall data long term gridded climate data are reliable data sets that can be used in the assessment of impact of climate change and adaptation and mitigation strategies in a river basin tan et al 2017 recent investigations revealed that the use of gridded data in swat model produced stream flow simulations that are comparable to results obtained from the use of traditional weather stations fuka et al 2014 grusson 2017 in addition dile and srinivasan 2014 found that the application of gridded climate data produces sound and reliable results the model results from cfsr gridded climate data covered the entire basin with a ground resolution of 37 km fig 3 shows the distribution of the cfsr precipitation locations ground weather stations and watopa gauge station where observed flows were recorded fig 3 shows 55 cfsr weather stations represented by pink triangles and five ground weather stations represented by green circles with a ground resolution of approximately 150 km the cfsr dataset from 55 stations in the basin covered a period of 34 years 1979 to 2013 the cfsr dataset was then compared with ground observed rainfall data from five stations for the same period to determine their relationship fig 4 a and b show the spatial distribution of average annual rainfall based on the period 1982 2013 for cfsr and ground observed rainfall the spatial distribution of cfsr rainfall in fig 4 a clearly illustrates that more rainfall is received in the northern part of the basin and less is received in the southern part which is confirmed by the observed spatial distribution of annual rainfall in fig 4 b during the same period the observed spatial distribution of annual rainfall was derived from five meteorological stations both fig 4 a and b were produced using inverse distance weighting method idw to estimate the distribution of annual rainfall the cfsr dataset was further subjected to a trend analysis to determine its suitability for use in swat model a correlation coefficient was determined between the observed average monthly rainfall data obtained from zmd for the catchment area and the cfsr average monthly rainfall data for the same period the results shown in fig 5 indicate a correlation efficiency of 97 which confirmed the reliability of the cfsr for use in hydrological modelling the mean annual rainfall for both datasets is shown in fig 6 with a similar pattern and trend with minor differences between the two curves there is however a considerable difference between 2007 and 2013 probably due to some inherent errors in the observed data that is always not perfect due to some missing values or change in rainfall regime data from two ground observation stations had some missing values from 2007 to 2013 the values used were interpolated using a normal ratio method fig 6 illustrates the comparisons of mean annual rainfall furthermore the coefficient of variation cv was calculated for each period of analysis to measure the relative variability of datasets on a ratio scale and was used to study quality assurance by measuring the dispersion of rainfall data of a frequency distribution table 2 shows the calculated coefficient of variation the calculated annual monthly and seasonal cv for cfsr and observed rainfall are comparable as seen in table 2 the year is divided into four seasons namely december january and february djf march april and may mam june july and august jja and september october and november son djf and mam are typical rainy seasons in the basin that have matched well the highest rainfall is recorded in djf followed by mam when rain season gradually ends 3 2 the sensitivity analysis the sensitivity analysis was performed for 18 input parameters for krb in swat model the large number of input parameters representing various processes in the objective function of sufi 2 improves enveloping of the observations in the model habte et al 2013 mehan et al 2017 the parameters were selected and ranked through the global and local sensitivity analysis abbaspour et al 2015 global sensitivity analysis was determined by calculating the multiple regression of the latin hypercube generated parameters against the objective function values the assessment of sensitivity of parameters in sufi 2 was measured with the t stat values and p values the parameters with larger absolute t stat values are more sensitive while the p values are used to determine the significance of the sensitivity and when the p value is close to zero the parameters are classified to have significance of the sensitivity the sensitivity of parameters in sufi 2 is the estimate of the average changes in the objective function resulting from changes in each parameter when all other parameters are changing khalid et al 2016 table 3 shows the sensitivity of parameters based on global sensitivity analysis 3 3 calibration and validation sufi 2 has ten different objective functions some of which include mean square error mse nash sutcliff ns r2 and br2 in this paper ns was used as the objective function for discharge the swat model outputs were subjected to calibration using swat cup with sufi2 the model calibration was performed with monthly observed flow data for a period 1982 1997 which was two thirds of the total data while one third was used for validation and covered the period 1998 2005 liu et al 2018 the performance of the model calibration was found to be good with ns at 0 73 and r2 at 0 73 while ns for validated results was 0 64 and r2 was 0 70 fig 7 shows the graph with 95ppu for the calibration and validation respectively monthly time step data were used to determine the performance indices for the model parameters the calibration and validation results in fig 7 revealed that there was consistency and a close match between observed and simulated flows between 1982 and 1997 while the validated results also showed consistency in simulation of the stream flows between 1998 and 2005 the observed and simulated peak flow showed some mismatches probably due to the large area 72 082 km2 of the basin with only one gauging station and could also be occurrences of extreme events not experienced in the calibration period model errors may also not be ruled out as every model is not perfect fig 7 also show that the 95ppu was well bracketed during calibration and validation period with acceptable values of p factor and r factor respectively 3 4 uncertainty analysis the p factor of 0 75 obtained during calibration and 0 73 during validation indicate that most of the observed and simulated data were bracketed with 95ppu the slight decrease in p factor from 0 75 to 0 73 during validation indicates the level of uncertainties in input variables such as rainfall the measured data used for calibration and validation of model predictions is widely accepted with uncertainty inherent however the model performance evaluation seldom includes the measurement uncertainty inherent due to data paucity on uncertainty inherent on measured input data harmel and smith 2007 3 5 goodness of fit goodness of fit was measured using r2 and ns nash and sutcliffe 1970 between observed and simulated flow the ns values after calibration and validation were found to be 0 73 and 0 64 respectively which indicate that the results are good a value of 0 6 is considered to be good for hydrologic evaluations performed on a monthly time step the coefficient of determination r2 after calibration and validation were found to be 0 73 and 0 70 respectively which indicate that the results were good since it exceeds the 0 6 moriasi et al 2007 arnold et al 2012 tan et al 2017 the statistics used to determine goodness of fit are summarised in table 4 the statistics in table 4 indicate good model performance at calibration with ns of 0 73 and r2 of 0 73 while for validation the parameter values were 0 64 and 0 70 respectively sensitivity analysis also shows that most of the observed and simulated data were bracketed by the 95ppu p factor at 0 75 during calibration good results were also obtained for calibration with r factor of 0 75 and for validation with r factor of 0 55 this shows that the thickness of uncertainty band was reduced and provided more confidence of the produced results more statistical values including ratio of the root mean square error to the standard deviation of observed data rsr singh et al 2005 and the percent bias pbias gupta et al 1998 were used to evaluate the monthly model performances as shown in table 4 the rsr guide standardizes the root mean square error using the observations standard deviation varying from 0 to a positive value the pbias indicates the extent to which the modelled data departs from the observed data the results in table 4 with 0 73 ns compares well with the findings of dile and srinivasan 2014 who concluded that cfsr weather data produced satisfactory results nse 0 5 in predicting the measured streamflows for some river gauge stations of the basin the results also show that the use of cfsr data in data scarce regions could be reliable and effective in agreement with the findings of dile and srinivasan 2014 who further suggested that in data scarce regions cfsr weather data may be a valuable option for hydrological simulations 3 6 simulation of stream flow and water yield simulation of streamflow for any river basin is an important result in hydrological modelling as it is used in water resources management the simulated flows in krb were graphically compared with cfsr rainfall and observed flow during and after the calibration period to determine their suitability for use in water resources management the graphical comparisons are shown in fig 8 the simulated flows compare well with observed flows as indicated in fig 8 the trend and streamflow regime are the same for monthly and seasonal time scales the simulated peak and low flows agree well with observed peak and low flows however variations exist in flow magnitude at the peak and low flows even though the simulated flows under predicted the peak and low flows in some months the simulated flows are well accepted and reliable based on the graphical comparisons and the statistics obtained in table 4 further comparisons were done with simulated and observed flows against average monthly rainfall the comparisons in fig 8 also reveal that the rainfall peaks for each month also corresponds well with the simulated and observed peak flows while periods of lowest and or no rainfall also correspond to low simulated and observed flows for instance in 1992 the krb had experienced the worst drought where there was insignificant rainfall translating into low streamflow which is also well simulated by the model fig 8 also shows a decreasing trend of rainfall streamflow and simulated streamflow this decreasing trend could be attributed to climate variability change in the krb which has not been spared from its effects the matching of the rainfall and simulated peaks further show the rainfall runoff relationship and the krb response time to a rainfall input event the simulated flows are therefore useful to enhance integrated water resources management further analysis on water yield was performed for the period of 1982 2013 to determine its relationship with mean monthly rainfall runoff and evapotranspiration the results show a clear relationship of the monthly water yield and runoff variability with corresponding monthly rainfall in the basin fig 9 illustrates cfsr mean monthly rainfall runoff water yield and et relationship the mean monthly water yield shown in fig 9 follows also the rainfall trend which is high between january and march recedes between april to june and followed by a dry season between june and september the rainfall begins to rise sharply from october to december which is a rainy season in the basin the water yield and runoff have a delayed response to rainfall input in the basin and from january to may and november to december there is adequate water yield while runoff is only available from january to about march and from november to december however from the winter and spring season of june to september there is almost zero water yield and completely no runoff and this is also the time when river flow in the basin is at its lowest and there are mostly base flows the et is a function of temperatures and varies throughout the year the et begins high from january to april when temperatures are relatively high with considerable evapotranspiration and falls from may to september and at the beginning of summer hottest period in the basin et starts to rise from october to december in order to show the water yield spatial variability in the krb gis was used to generate a variability map based on the sub basins fig 10 illustrates water yield variability across the krb fig 10 shows spatial variability of mean annual water yield mawyld across the entire basin the northern part of the krb has the highest water yield ranging from 820 to 1011 mm while the lowest is found in the southern part of the krb ranging from 363 to 413 mm the estimated water yield and the deep aquifer recharge is also known as the blue water while green water storage is soil moisture which has been broadly identified to be very important for water resources management schuol et al 2008 rockstrom and falkenmark 2006 water resources are analysed in the context of blue and green water flows in a sub basin and its spatial variability across the basin the green water can better be used to boost agricultural production in the basin because all the seasons have sufficient green water apart from winter and spring seasons july september fig 10 also shows that there is good rainfall in the sub basin that is normally converted to runoff and can further be harnessed through construction of water conservation structures that can serve as source of water for winter and spring farming the discussed hydrological results from use of the cfsr data agrees well with fuka et al 2014 who found that cfsr data could reliably be used for catchment hydrological modelling across different climates and catchments in addition cfsr data resulted in reasonable and in some cases better streamflow predictions than the best weather stations furthermore dile and srinivasan 2014 suggests that in data scarce regions cfsr weather data might be a useful option for hydrological simulations 4 conclusion the use of gridded climate data cfsr could be reliable and perhaps appropriate alternative in data scarce regions automatic calibration and validation with swat cup sufi 2 has proved to be effective in producing calibrated parameters southern african region has particularly been a data scarce region which has hampered research on a large scale but with the use of alternative technology water resources would be well assessed and effective management can be envisaged the simulated results with ns as the objective function showed that calibrated result were good at 0 73 and r2 at 0 73 while the uncertainty analysis was obtained with a p factor 95ppu at 0 75 and the r factor of 0 75 values which were very good within the accepted standard the quantitative statistics show that the model results are satisfactory and may be used in catchments with similar characteristics the spatial distribution of water yield showed uneven distribution with some areas of the basin appearing to be under water stress while other areas have excess water which tends to flow out of the basin due to underutilisation and limited water conservation structures the estimated water resources provide an insight into the water balance of the krb and can be a basis for water allocation for various water demands from different water use sectors the mean annual water yield ranging from 362 to 1011 mm across the sub basin forms part of the green water that can be used to enhance agricultural productivity the study concludes that the basin has the potential to be harnessed in terms of water resources where more than half of the generated runoff appears to leave the basin furthermore these water resources could be used to boost irrigated agriculture which can improve the livelihood and reduce poverty levels credit

4215,the zambezi river basin is among many basins in southern african region with inadequate low resolution poorly maintained and distributed network of hydrometeorological stations this scenario entails scarcity of hydrological data in the basin and subsequently leads to poor assessment of water resources this paper investigates alternative technologies in the assessment of the hydrology and water resources in the basin the high resolution gridded climate data together with land use and soil data were used as inputs into swat model to simulate hydrological processes calibration and validation of model were performed using swat cup comparison of average monthly rainfall data for gridded and observed shows 97 correlation the statistics show ns to be 0 73 while r2 was 0 73 the uncertainty analysis was determined with a p factor at 0 75 while the r factor was 0 75 therefore use of gridded climate data for hydrological modelling in data scarce regions could be a useful tool to estimate the main hydrological parameters and water resources of an area with satisfactory accuracy keywords gridded climate data hydrology modelling swat water resources 1 introduction water resources assessments are key to planning and development of water resources in any given river basin world bank group 2018 zhang et al 2018 the assessment of water resources is achieved through a well maintained hydrometeorological observational network in a given river basin however many river basins in southern african region have inadequate poorly maintained hydrometeorological observation networks resulting in poor data collection botai et al 2015 euroconsult 2008 hughes 2006 this leads to a challenge of inaccurate estimation of water resources tan et al 2017 kabompo river basin krb located within the zambezi river basin zrb is one such a basin with data scarcity of river discharge water quality rainfall and temperature many previous studies have typically analysed satellite data sources as alternative to gauged rainfall to simulate runoff in the sparsely gauged zambezi river basin botai et al 2015 boillat et al 2012 meier and fr 2011 hughes 2006 satellite based rainfall data has a tendency of under estimating rainfall due to indirect measurements which are normally captured with a large scale of inconsistencies more studies have also shown that satellite based products have in general challenges to depict precipitation in regions characterised by complicated landscape where precipitation is a function of the orography with spacio temporally variability sun et al 2017 derin and yilmaz 2014 in view of data scarcity there is need to consider other new technologies of capturing the much needed hydrometeorological data that largely enables accurate water resources assessments for effective integrated water resources management in the basin tan et al 2017 this paper explores the use of global reanalysis climate data for hydrological simulation in the kabompo river basin to overcome challenges of data paucity tolera et al 2018 hu et al 2017 lu et al 2015 as a new technique global reanalysis climate data is gridded climate data gcd developed from simulated and satellite remotely sensed data sources it is a source of extensive data in space and time covering longer periods and have been utilised for research on different climatological aspects malakar et al 2020 the data has potential to be an alternative of the observed climate data conventional climate data for streamflow simulation and other applications tan et al 2017 it is also defined as a multiple year global gridded representations known as reanalysis datasets tomy and sumam 2016 consecutive production of reanalysis outputs produced by various institutions have improved their quality with better models input data and assimilation methods sun et al 2017 in the recent past many studies have been made with gridded climate data sets as input data for hydrological modelling with different degrees of success for instance nkiaka et al 2017 applied wfdel and cfsr gridded climate data sets as input data for hydrological modelling using soil water assessment tool swat model in data scarce areas of logone catchment in the lake chad basin where acceptable results were obtained and concluded that in the absence of gauged hydro meteorological data wfdei and cfsr could be used for hydrological modelling in data scarce areas alemayehu et al 2018 applied cfsr and watch gridded climate datasets to simulate the observed streamflow on monthly scale using the swat model in mara basin of kenya tanzania had an improved skill and recommended the data to be a useful substitute of gauge rainfall data for hydrologic application in the basin dile and srinivasan 2014 utilised cfsr gridded climate data set to simulate the hydrology of lake tana basin in the upper blue nile using swat model and obtained results that were satisfactory and that the data could be a valuable alternative for hydrological prediction in data scarce areas of the blue nile where conventional gauges were not available fuka et al 2014 applied cfsr gridded climate data and conventional weather data for hydrological modelling in five different catchments in the us and ethiopia surprisingly found that the results from cfsr data showed good or better streamflow prediction than the best conventional weather stations this was a demonstration that cfsr data could be reliably used for catchment hydrological simulation in different hydroclimate regimes and watersheds the gridded climate data used in this study is from national centers for environmental prediction climate forecast system reanalysis ncep cfsr the cfsr is the latest dataset from ncep that span from 1979 to the current and the period 2001 02 is used for this analysis the cfsr is the third generation reanalysis data that can be accessed at https globalweather tamu edu the analysis utilises the global forecast system gfs as its atmospheric model with a horizontal resolution of t382 38 km that has 64 vertical layers saha et al 2010 the use of gridded climate data for hydrological modelling is the first of its kind in the basin as this technology has not been investigated in the zrb the study has produced new knowledge in hydrological modelling for the basin that has data paucity the hydrological model produced can be applied in other catchments with similar characteristics the technique of using cfsr gridded climate data in data scarce regions such as the zambezi will now be a solution to data scarcity in view of the above the study is therefore considered to be a novelty the climate forecast reanalysis system cfsr gridded climate data with a high resolution was used as an alternative to the conventional ground observed data sets the data was analysed using swat model swat is a complex physically based model efficient in performing long term simulations and is able to describe water and sediment circulation vegetation growth and nutrients circulation with hourly daily and monthly time resolution guzman et al 2015 arnold et al 2012 neitsch et al 2005 the model is well recommended and most widely used in the world in the field of hydrology and water resources management abbaspour et al 2019 wang et al 2019 mehan et al 2017 the swat model is considered user friendly and easy to access as it is readily available habte et al 2013 in addition geographical information system gis was used to explore the temporal and spatial variability of water resources in the basin the results of the hydrological modelling showed nash sutcliffe efficiency ns at 0 73 while coefficient of determination r2 was 0 73 the uncertainty analysis showed the 95 prediction uncertainty p factor at 0 75 and the band representing observed data including its error r factor at 0 75 the simulation results also indicate that there is adequate water yield at present across the krb with potential to harness and utilise more than half of the water yield that is distributed across the basin the objective of the study was to determine the suitability of cfsr gridded climate data in data scarce regions for hydrological modelling and estimation of water resources of the krb 2 materials and methods 2 1 location of study area the krb is located between 14o 15 07 29 s 23o 08 27 44 e and 17o 36 17 21 s 25o 48 28 39 e it is one of the 13 basins in the zrb which has deep well drained kalahari sands covering the entire region beilfuss 2012 the basin has wooded savannahs as the predominant land use and has mean annual precipitation map of 1200 mm fig 1 indicates the location of the study area krb in the zrb of southern africa 2 2 data sets the datasets used include daily gridded climate data gcd global land use and land cover processed from remotely sensed imagery global soil classification data these data sets were used as input into swat hydrological model in conjunction with geographical information system gis 2 3 the cfsr gridded climate data soil and land cover data are more reliable and accessible because of modem technological advancement in remote sensing however hydrometeorological network are still rarely available and inconsistent in data capturing the cfsr data is increasingly being used as input data for hydrological modelling as an alternative to the use of conventional observed data in regions with scarcity of data hu et al 2017 the cfsr is a high resolution dataset which covers the entire basin and was downloaded from texas a m university global weather database https globalweather tamu edu cfsr gridded climate data is based on both historical and operational records of observations and newly reprocessed sets of observations produced at meteorological research centres around the world saha et al 2010 cfsr assimilates observations from upper air balloon observations aircraft observations and satellite observations saha et al 2010 since 1978 a number of records were combined for cfsr assimilation from national centres for environmental prediction ncep and european centre for medium climate data https www ecmwf int cfsr reanalyses have an improved method acquiring geopotential height field compared to other reanalyses and have smaller biases and root mean square errors rmse hua et al 2019 cfsr use gridded observational data to eradicate biases which are important and can be utilised to fill gaps in historical observations and may also be a basis for generation of future climate scenarios navarro racines et al 2015 ruane et al 2015 cfsr simulates the precipitation mean and variability for regional pattern and the local details reasonably well due to its high resolution data sets and in addition the coupled ocean atmosphere assimilation in the models sun et al 2017 zhang et al 2012 the cfsr daily data included precipitation mm temperature c relative humidity fraction solar radiation mj m2 and wind speed m s which was all used as input data into swat model for hydrological modelling 2 4 observed hydrometeorological data the precipitation monthly data was obtained from zambia meteorological department zmd an institution responsible for capturing rainfall from all the meteorological stations in zambia the captured rainfall data covered a period of 30 years 1982 2013 and obtained from five existing meteorological stations that have influence on the krb the data from two stations out of five stations were found with few missing values and filled by interpolation using normal ratio method chow et al 1988 de silva et al 2007 the data is recommended to be of acceptable quality mudenda 2007 may et al 2013 the monthly flow data measured in m3 s from watopa gauge station was obtained from water resources management authority warma http www warma org zm an institution responsible for river flows and water resources management in zambia the flow data is recommended to be of acceptable quality sadc 2011 the data covered a period of 1982 to 2005 and is used for calibration and validation of the swat model results 2 5 landuse and land cover land use types and various vegetation affect the overland flow of water in different ways evapotranspiration et and runoff are mainly affected by vegetation while land use types for different slopes with varying crop types result in varying runoff volumes woyessa et al 2011 the activities of land use land cover and water resources management are co dependent land erosion in a catchment leads to sedimentation in water resources and on site nutrient loss and nutrient enrichment of water resources rahul et al 2012 the catchment is divided into sub basins which are further split into hrus in order to classify watershed conditions swat model reflects differences in evapotranspiration for various crops and soils based on the subdivision of the watersheds the land use is therefore an important data input into swat model data sets with land use types that account for more than 20 of the area in hru are included to help address differences between the resolution of data sets coutu and vega 2007 the basin land use data was obtained from usgs https www usgs gov centers eros science usgs eros archive land cover products global land cover characterization glcc which is moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer modis land cover type with a resolution of 500 m 500 m modis based global land cover types are widely used in hydrometeorological modelling the collection 5 1 mcd12q1 product is found to have a substantial amount of inter annual variability with 40 of land pixels showing land cover change one or more times during 2001 2010 https landcover usgs gov the major land use of krb is woody savannahs with more than 90 coverage area based on 2001 2010 landuse land cover data set 2 6 the basin soils the basin soil map was prepared in arcgis based on the united nations food and agriculture organisation fao soils obtained from ministry of lands government of the republic of zambia the soil identification for the basin was performed using the fao soil scientific description based on the pixels the soils may be accessed from the website http www fao org soils portal soil survey soil maps and databases en the basin has four major soil types of which arenosols are predominant with 30 followed by gleysols at 27 farrasol at 24 and acrisols at 15 basin coverage the arenosols commonly known as kalahari sands are extending up to one metre depth with sand content of more than 70 clay and silt content of less than 10 low nutrient content and low water retention capacity 2 7 the dem the dem was obtained from the shuttle radar topographical mission srtm with a resolution of 30 m https earthexplorer usgs gov which is also the most widely used elevation data in the world the catchment which was masked from the pro mosaic dem has the highest elevation of 1568 m while the lowest point is 1020 m above sea level fig 2 shows the delineated krb with an area of 72 082 km2 the inputs to swat hydrological model were dem soil type land use and cfsr data set gridded climate data the swat model was further subjected to calibration and validation using the monthly observed flow data from watopa gauge station watopa gs shown in fig 2 2 8 model set up the arc swat model version 2012 was set up and parameterised within arcgis interface the dem was overlaid with soil and land use data producing 102 sub basins and 255 hydrological response units hrus the hrus are not spatially continuous but are considered homogenous units with similar slope range soil and land use types and are the basic units for hydrological simulations the model simulations were undertaken for a period of 1979 to 2013 the first three years of simulations were used for initialising the model observed streamflow data was obtained from watopa gauge station that had sufficient and reliable measured data for a limited period about two thirds of monthly observed dataset from 1982 to 1997 was used for calibration and the remaining one third from 1998 to 2005 was used for validation of the model 2 9 swat hydrological modelling the swat model is a semi distributed physically based and deterministic model with a high computational efficiency to simulate the hydrological processes in large and small river basins it has been used extensively at a local and regional level to simulate surface runoff interception storage groundwater flows tile drainage percolation and water quality neitsch et al 2005 the swat model is a continuous and process based which was developed to assess the impacts of management decisions on water resources and nonpoint source pollution in river basins arnold et al 2012 swat model is considered user friendly and easy to access as it is readily available habte et al 2013 the prevailing philosophy of modelling demands that models be described in a transparent manner that show the routine performance of calibration validation sensitivity and uncertainty analysis calibration is conditioned on the model structure model inputs analysts assumptions calibration algorithm and calibration data while uncertainty analysis is used to evaluate the strength of the calibrated model abbaspour et al 2015 in swat model surface runoff volume is estimated with the modified soil conservation service scs curve number cn method while kinematic storage model is used to simulate lateral flow and the return flow is approximated by creating the shallow aquifer arnold et al 1998 muskingum method is used to predict channel flood routing the water balance neitsch et al 2005 equation that comprises the hydrological components in swat model is described in eq 1 1 sw t sw 0 i 1 t r day q surf e a w seep q gw where sw t final soil water content mm sw 0 initial soil water content on day i mm r day amount of precipitation on day i mm q surf amount of surface runoff on day i mm whilst ea amount of evapotranspiration et on day i mm w seep amount of water entering the vadose zone from the soil profile on day i mm qgw amount of return flow on day i mm water yield is one of the most important parameters used in the evaluation of water resources management in the basin under study it is the summation of water leaving the hru and entering the main channel during a time step arnold et al 2011 water yield of a sub basin is evaluated by swat model using the following eq 2 2 wyld qsurf qgw qlat qloss where wyld is the measure of the water yield mm qsurf is the surface runoff mm qgw is the groundwater contribution to streamflow mm qlat is the lateral flow contribution to stream mm and qloss is the transmission losses mm from the tributary in hru by means of transmission through the bed frederick an manoj 2018 2 10 calibration uncertainty and sensitivity analysis calibration and uncertainty analysis are conducted using different methods which include parameter solution parasol adaptive clustering covering acco general algorithm ga multi start m simplex swat cup includes glue sufi2 mcmc parasol and pso the most widely used statistics in calibration and validation are r2 and ns r2 ranges from 0 to 1 where 0 shows non correlation while 1 shows perfect correlation and provides an estimate of how well the variance of observed values are replicated by the model predictions krause et al 2005 the regression slope and intercept are equal to 1 and 0 respectively although most of the published swat studies do not show the slope and intercept as perfect fit the ns values range from to 1 and provide a measure of how well the simulated output matches the observed data along a 1 1 line regression line with slope equal to 1 the ns value of 1 shows a perfect fit between observed and simulated data ns values 0 indicate that the observed data mean is a more accurate predictor than the simulated output both ns and r2 are biased towards high flows arnold et al 2012 the uncertainty analysis is based on local error and clustering calibration of models brings about some uncertainty in predictions which can be categorised as conceptual model uncertainty input uncertainty and parameter uncertainty abbaspour 2015 the most widely used method of the uncertainty estimation is the sequential uncertainty fitting 2 sufi 2 together with swat calibration uncertainty programme swat cup abbaspour et al 2004 the method is used to carry out parametrisation sensitivity analysis uncertainty analysis calibration and validation of hydrological variables on daily and monthly time steps calibration process is made easier in sufi 2 because it is semi automated and can be done within a short period of time mehan et al 2017 the results of swat cup has been found to be useful in calibrating the model and estimating uncertainties and related assumptions in water resources modelling narsimlu et al 2015 the algorithm calculates all the uncertainties of the parameters conceptual model and other inputs in the form of a graph expressed as uniform distributions or ranges much of the observed data is captured within a threshold of 95 prediction uncertainty 95ppu through the model iteration process latin hypercube sampling is used to calculate the 95ppu at 2 5 and 97 5 levels of cumulative distributions of an output variable the performance of the model for simulating stream flow based on monthly and daily measured flows has been classified into four categories depending on the threshold of modified nash sutcliffe efficiency mne and percent bias pbias values moriasi et al 2007 table 1 shows the general performance ratings and recommended statistics besides the quantitative statistics in table 1 hydrographs for observed and simulated flows are plotted to compare and help understand the base flow recession and other hydrograph characteristics daggupati et al 2015 2 11 performance indices two indices referred to as p factor and r factor abbaspour et al 2004 were calculated to determine the goodness of fit the p factor represents the 95ppu for model simulation and r factor is the band representing observed data including its error the fraction of the observed data error bracketed by the 95ppu band is the p factor which ranges from 0 to 1 where 1 is 100 bracketing of the observed data within the prediction uncertainty and also shows that the model simulation is perfect a p factor value of 0 7 is often recommended to be adequate for simulation purpose but the recommended values are largely dependent on the quality of the input parameters calibration and validation data whilst the r factor is simply the ratio of the mean width of the 95ppu band and standard deviation of the measured variable the preferred value is less than 1 5 based on the scale of the study abbaspour et al 2015 the p factor and r factor indices indicate the strength and performance of the calibration and validation a bigger value of p factor can be obtained at the expense of a bigger value of r factor and therefore there must be a balance between the two when acceptable r factor and p factor values are reached through iteration the parameter ranges are considered calibrated parameters four performance indices are normally used to evaluate the model performance and these are p factor r factor r2 and ns the r2 and ns is a likelihood measure for the rainfall runoff model swat model in sufi 2 approach between the simulated and observed stream flow the ns was calculated using the following eq 3 3 n s 1 i 1 n y i x i 2 i 1 n x i x 2 where xi is the ground based measurements yi is the model predicted data and x is the mean of the ground based measurements the p factor which is the percentage of measured data bracketed by the 95 prediction boundary also called 95ppu was used to quantify all the uncertainties associated with swat model the p factor and r factor are linked to each other such that a larger p factor can only be obtained at the expense of a higher r factor as alluded to above the r factor is calculated by the following eq 4 4 r f a c t o r 1 n i 1 n y ti 97 5 m y i ti 2 5 m σ obs where y ti 97 5 m is the upper boundary of the 95ub y ti 2 5 m is the lower boundary of the 95lb and σ obs is the standard deviation of the observed data 3 results and discussion 3 1 comparison of observed and gridded rainfall data long term gridded climate data are reliable data sets that can be used in the assessment of impact of climate change and adaptation and mitigation strategies in a river basin tan et al 2017 recent investigations revealed that the use of gridded data in swat model produced stream flow simulations that are comparable to results obtained from the use of traditional weather stations fuka et al 2014 grusson 2017 in addition dile and srinivasan 2014 found that the application of gridded climate data produces sound and reliable results the model results from cfsr gridded climate data covered the entire basin with a ground resolution of 37 km fig 3 shows the distribution of the cfsr precipitation locations ground weather stations and watopa gauge station where observed flows were recorded fig 3 shows 55 cfsr weather stations represented by pink triangles and five ground weather stations represented by green circles with a ground resolution of approximately 150 km the cfsr dataset from 55 stations in the basin covered a period of 34 years 1979 to 2013 the cfsr dataset was then compared with ground observed rainfall data from five stations for the same period to determine their relationship fig 4 a and b show the spatial distribution of average annual rainfall based on the period 1982 2013 for cfsr and ground observed rainfall the spatial distribution of cfsr rainfall in fig 4 a clearly illustrates that more rainfall is received in the northern part of the basin and less is received in the southern part which is confirmed by the observed spatial distribution of annual rainfall in fig 4 b during the same period the observed spatial distribution of annual rainfall was derived from five meteorological stations both fig 4 a and b were produced using inverse distance weighting method idw to estimate the distribution of annual rainfall the cfsr dataset was further subjected to a trend analysis to determine its suitability for use in swat model a correlation coefficient was determined between the observed average monthly rainfall data obtained from zmd for the catchment area and the cfsr average monthly rainfall data for the same period the results shown in fig 5 indicate a correlation efficiency of 97 which confirmed the reliability of the cfsr for use in hydrological modelling the mean annual rainfall for both datasets is shown in fig 6 with a similar pattern and trend with minor differences between the two curves there is however a considerable difference between 2007 and 2013 probably due to some inherent errors in the observed data that is always not perfect due to some missing values or change in rainfall regime data from two ground observation stations had some missing values from 2007 to 2013 the values used were interpolated using a normal ratio method fig 6 illustrates the comparisons of mean annual rainfall furthermore the coefficient of variation cv was calculated for each period of analysis to measure the relative variability of datasets on a ratio scale and was used to study quality assurance by measuring the dispersion of rainfall data of a frequency distribution table 2 shows the calculated coefficient of variation the calculated annual monthly and seasonal cv for cfsr and observed rainfall are comparable as seen in table 2 the year is divided into four seasons namely december january and february djf march april and may mam june july and august jja and september october and november son djf and mam are typical rainy seasons in the basin that have matched well the highest rainfall is recorded in djf followed by mam when rain season gradually ends 3 2 the sensitivity analysis the sensitivity analysis was performed for 18 input parameters for krb in swat model the large number of input parameters representing various processes in the objective function of sufi 2 improves enveloping of the observations in the model habte et al 2013 mehan et al 2017 the parameters were selected and ranked through the global and local sensitivity analysis abbaspour et al 2015 global sensitivity analysis was determined by calculating the multiple regression of the latin hypercube generated parameters against the objective function values the assessment of sensitivity of parameters in sufi 2 was measured with the t stat values and p values the parameters with larger absolute t stat values are more sensitive while the p values are used to determine the significance of the sensitivity and when the p value is close to zero the parameters are classified to have significance of the sensitivity the sensitivity of parameters in sufi 2 is the estimate of the average changes in the objective function resulting from changes in each parameter when all other parameters are changing khalid et al 2016 table 3 shows the sensitivity of parameters based on global sensitivity analysis 3 3 calibration and validation sufi 2 has ten different objective functions some of which include mean square error mse nash sutcliff ns r2 and br2 in this paper ns was used as the objective function for discharge the swat model outputs were subjected to calibration using swat cup with sufi2 the model calibration was performed with monthly observed flow data for a period 1982 1997 which was two thirds of the total data while one third was used for validation and covered the period 1998 2005 liu et al 2018 the performance of the model calibration was found to be good with ns at 0 73 and r2 at 0 73 while ns for validated results was 0 64 and r2 was 0 70 fig 7 shows the graph with 95ppu for the calibration and validation respectively monthly time step data were used to determine the performance indices for the model parameters the calibration and validation results in fig 7 revealed that there was consistency and a close match between observed and simulated flows between 1982 and 1997 while the validated results also showed consistency in simulation of the stream flows between 1998 and 2005 the observed and simulated peak flow showed some mismatches probably due to the large area 72 082 km2 of the basin with only one gauging station and could also be occurrences of extreme events not experienced in the calibration period model errors may also not be ruled out as every model is not perfect fig 7 also show that the 95ppu was well bracketed during calibration and validation period with acceptable values of p factor and r factor respectively 3 4 uncertainty analysis the p factor of 0 75 obtained during calibration and 0 73 during validation indicate that most of the observed and simulated data were bracketed with 95ppu the slight decrease in p factor from 0 75 to 0 73 during validation indicates the level of uncertainties in input variables such as rainfall the measured data used for calibration and validation of model predictions is widely accepted with uncertainty inherent however the model performance evaluation seldom includes the measurement uncertainty inherent due to data paucity on uncertainty inherent on measured input data harmel and smith 2007 3 5 goodness of fit goodness of fit was measured using r2 and ns nash and sutcliffe 1970 between observed and simulated flow the ns values after calibration and validation were found to be 0 73 and 0 64 respectively which indicate that the results are good a value of 0 6 is considered to be good for hydrologic evaluations performed on a monthly time step the coefficient of determination r2 after calibration and validation were found to be 0 73 and 0 70 respectively which indicate that the results were good since it exceeds the 0 6 moriasi et al 2007 arnold et al 2012 tan et al 2017 the statistics used to determine goodness of fit are summarised in table 4 the statistics in table 4 indicate good model performance at calibration with ns of 0 73 and r2 of 0 73 while for validation the parameter values were 0 64 and 0 70 respectively sensitivity analysis also shows that most of the observed and simulated data were bracketed by the 95ppu p factor at 0 75 during calibration good results were also obtained for calibration with r factor of 0 75 and for validation with r factor of 0 55 this shows that the thickness of uncertainty band was reduced and provided more confidence of the produced results more statistical values including ratio of the root mean square error to the standard deviation of observed data rsr singh et al 2005 and the percent bias pbias gupta et al 1998 were used to evaluate the monthly model performances as shown in table 4 the rsr guide standardizes the root mean square error using the observations standard deviation varying from 0 to a positive value the pbias indicates the extent to which the modelled data departs from the observed data the results in table 4 with 0 73 ns compares well with the findings of dile and srinivasan 2014 who concluded that cfsr weather data produced satisfactory results nse 0 5 in predicting the measured streamflows for some river gauge stations of the basin the results also show that the use of cfsr data in data scarce regions could be reliable and effective in agreement with the findings of dile and srinivasan 2014 who further suggested that in data scarce regions cfsr weather data may be a valuable option for hydrological simulations 3 6 simulation of stream flow and water yield simulation of streamflow for any river basin is an important result in hydrological modelling as it is used in water resources management the simulated flows in krb were graphically compared with cfsr rainfall and observed flow during and after the calibration period to determine their suitability for use in water resources management the graphical comparisons are shown in fig 8 the simulated flows compare well with observed flows as indicated in fig 8 the trend and streamflow regime are the same for monthly and seasonal time scales the simulated peak and low flows agree well with observed peak and low flows however variations exist in flow magnitude at the peak and low flows even though the simulated flows under predicted the peak and low flows in some months the simulated flows are well accepted and reliable based on the graphical comparisons and the statistics obtained in table 4 further comparisons were done with simulated and observed flows against average monthly rainfall the comparisons in fig 8 also reveal that the rainfall peaks for each month also corresponds well with the simulated and observed peak flows while periods of lowest and or no rainfall also correspond to low simulated and observed flows for instance in 1992 the krb had experienced the worst drought where there was insignificant rainfall translating into low streamflow which is also well simulated by the model fig 8 also shows a decreasing trend of rainfall streamflow and simulated streamflow this decreasing trend could be attributed to climate variability change in the krb which has not been spared from its effects the matching of the rainfall and simulated peaks further show the rainfall runoff relationship and the krb response time to a rainfall input event the simulated flows are therefore useful to enhance integrated water resources management further analysis on water yield was performed for the period of 1982 2013 to determine its relationship with mean monthly rainfall runoff and evapotranspiration the results show a clear relationship of the monthly water yield and runoff variability with corresponding monthly rainfall in the basin fig 9 illustrates cfsr mean monthly rainfall runoff water yield and et relationship the mean monthly water yield shown in fig 9 follows also the rainfall trend which is high between january and march recedes between april to june and followed by a dry season between june and september the rainfall begins to rise sharply from october to december which is a rainy season in the basin the water yield and runoff have a delayed response to rainfall input in the basin and from january to may and november to december there is adequate water yield while runoff is only available from january to about march and from november to december however from the winter and spring season of june to september there is almost zero water yield and completely no runoff and this is also the time when river flow in the basin is at its lowest and there are mostly base flows the et is a function of temperatures and varies throughout the year the et begins high from january to april when temperatures are relatively high with considerable evapotranspiration and falls from may to september and at the beginning of summer hottest period in the basin et starts to rise from october to december in order to show the water yield spatial variability in the krb gis was used to generate a variability map based on the sub basins fig 10 illustrates water yield variability across the krb fig 10 shows spatial variability of mean annual water yield mawyld across the entire basin the northern part of the krb has the highest water yield ranging from 820 to 1011 mm while the lowest is found in the southern part of the krb ranging from 363 to 413 mm the estimated water yield and the deep aquifer recharge is also known as the blue water while green water storage is soil moisture which has been broadly identified to be very important for water resources management schuol et al 2008 rockstrom and falkenmark 2006 water resources are analysed in the context of blue and green water flows in a sub basin and its spatial variability across the basin the green water can better be used to boost agricultural production in the basin because all the seasons have sufficient green water apart from winter and spring seasons july september fig 10 also shows that there is good rainfall in the sub basin that is normally converted to runoff and can further be harnessed through construction of water conservation structures that can serve as source of water for winter and spring farming the discussed hydrological results from use of the cfsr data agrees well with fuka et al 2014 who found that cfsr data could reliably be used for catchment hydrological modelling across different climates and catchments in addition cfsr data resulted in reasonable and in some cases better streamflow predictions than the best weather stations furthermore dile and srinivasan 2014 suggests that in data scarce regions cfsr weather data might be a useful option for hydrological simulations 4 conclusion the use of gridded climate data cfsr could be reliable and perhaps appropriate alternative in data scarce regions automatic calibration and validation with swat cup sufi 2 has proved to be effective in producing calibrated parameters southern african region has particularly been a data scarce region which has hampered research on a large scale but with the use of alternative technology water resources would be well assessed and effective management can be envisaged the simulated results with ns as the objective function showed that calibrated result were good at 0 73 and r2 at 0 73 while the uncertainty analysis was obtained with a p factor 95ppu at 0 75 and the r factor of 0 75 values which were very good within the accepted standard the quantitative statistics show that the model results are satisfactory and may be used in catchments with similar characteristics the spatial distribution of water yield showed uneven distribution with some areas of the basin appearing to be under water stress while other areas have excess water which tends to flow out of the basin due to underutilisation and limited water conservation structures the estimated water resources provide an insight into the water balance of the krb and can be a basis for water allocation for various water demands from different water use sectors the mean annual water yield ranging from 362 to 1011 mm across the sub basin forms part of the green water that can be used to enhance agricultural productivity the study concludes that the basin has the potential to be harnessed in terms of water resources where more than half of the generated runoff appears to leave the basin furthermore these water resources could be used to boost irrigated agriculture which can improve the livelihood and reduce poverty levels credit

that baseflow discharge can be regionalized to estimate diffuse groundwater recharge over large geographical areas baseflow is considered a proxy for diffuse groundwater recharge in watersheds with gaining streams healy 2010 risser et al 2009 a simple water balance equation can be written for the groundwater system in the watershed 1 r bf qp δsg where r is recharge to groundwater bf is baseflow qp is well pumping and δsg is the change in the groundwater volume assuming negligible well pumping and change in groundwater storage over the long term r bf scanlon et al 2002 noted that pumping et and underflow to deeper aquifers should be considered when equating bf to r but in many regions characterized by fine textured surficial deposits there is little pumping of the water table aquifer and underflow to deeper aquifers is negligible these conditions are met in the u s midwestern state of iowa where multiple glacial advances across iowa during the pleistocene draped a low permeable glacial till barrier between deeper unconsolidated sediments and underlying bedrock aquifers shallow groundwater flow is concentrated in the upper loess alluvium and oxidized till units typically less than 15 m prior et al 2003 these upper units are less utilized for water supplies than deeper confined bedrock aquifers and are not impacted by pumping demands within an iowa watershed temporal patterns of baseflow at monthly and annual scales were well correlated with water table fluctuations and watershed scale recharge schilling 2009 however researchers have noted that the baseflow method only provides a single recharge value per watershed so it cannot distinguish spatial variations of recharge within a basin or larger geographical area niazi et al 2017 halford and mayer 2000 healy 2010 others have utilized the baseflow method to investigate differences in recharge properties among different catchments hellwig and stahl 2018 barker et al 2016 but when there is a need for a seamless estimate for regional groundwater recharge researchers have often utilized a groundwater flow model e g hellwig et al 2020 niazi et al 2017 however in the united states the united state geological survey usgs operates a network of more than 10 000 stream gages that monitor continuous streamflow and report daily mean values www usgs gov calculating watershed scale baseflow across the network of usgs stream gages may provide for regionalization of spatial and temporal patterns of groundwater recharge provided the network of gages is dense enough in an area in the central u s ayers et al 2018 utilized 458 gages in an 11 state region where flow records extended back more than 50 years to analyze baseflow trends in the midwestern state of iowa the usgs operates approximately 132 streamflow gages from which baseflow can be estimated from daily records that are more than 20 years long in this study we posit that by calculating annual and monthly baseflow from these iowa gaging stations we can regionalize spatial and temporal patterns of groundwater recharge across the state combining baseflow recharge estimates from 132 watersheds in the state allows us to develop a seamless estimate of groundwater recharge across a large geographical region hence our approach expands the use of the popular baseflow recharge method from a single catchment to larger geographical areas where differences in recharge can be investigated without the use of a groundwater flow model improved understanding of diffuse groundwater recharge is important in rain fed agricultural areas under the threat of a variable climate within the u s agricultural productivity is particularly concentrated in iowa which is the largest producer of corn and soybeans as well as the leading producer of eggs and pork and the fourth largest producer of feeder cattle jones et al 2019 this immense productivity is threatened by a future where climate variability is expected to amplify mallakpour and villarini 2015 with more intense precipitation and longer drier periods between events ukkola et al 2020 wuebbles and hayhoe 2004 drought periods are particularly damaging to agricultural productivity at regional scales zipper et al 2016 for example the 2012 drought in the u s is considered by some to be among the most expensive and widespread natural disasters in the u s mallya et al 2013 based on long term patterns zipper et al 2016 reported that drought was responsible for an average of 13 of the variability in u s corn and soybean yields in iowa drought losses comprised nearly 38 of total indemnity payments between 1991 and 2018 exceeding the payments from excess moisture and precipitation by nearly 10 https www rma usda gov information tools summary of business cause of loss hence improving the ability to quantify the emergence and severity of drought in agricultural regions may increase accuracy in federal reporting and compensation for drought losses and ultimately lead to improved resilience for agricultural production systems although drought events are large scale phenomena hellwig et al 2020 groundwater drought is often measured at a site specific scale and then scaled up to watersheds kumar et al 2016 using statistical metrics and indices palmer 1965 bloomfield and marchant 2013 loon et al 2017 hellwig and stahl 2018 analyzed baseflow time series collected from central european gages to characterize catchment response times and predict baseflow drought in watersheds across the region herein we make further use of the network of usgs streamflow gages in iowa to investigate how trends in groundwater recharge estimated from baseflow may serve as an indicator of the development and severity of drought conditions and could be used to better clarify usdm drought declarations in iowa the goal of this study was to investigate how watershed scale baseflow calculated from a network of streamflow gages in iowa can be used to 1 quantify spatial and temporal patterns of groundwater recharge across a region and 2 assess how trends in groundwater recharge characterize the emergence expansion and severity of drought conditions at regional scales 2 data and methods streamflow records from 132 usgs gaging locations across iowa were analyzed for the 2000 to 2017 period fig 1 the year 2000 was selected for the beginning year because this year corresponded to the publication of the first u s drought monitor and with it the availability of gis records for drought designations criteria for selection of gages included their length of record continuous since 2000 and their location on a free flowing interior river not influenced by a reservoir or located on a border river no iowa gages were located near large alluvial aquifer pumping centers where streamflow could be influenced by well pumping baseflow separation calculations were performed for the 132 gages using purdue university s what web based hydrograph analysis tool lim et al 2005 we used what to import usgs flow data for selected iowa gaging stations containing multiple years of continuous streamflow data we used the one parameter digital filter method proposed by lyne and hollick 1979 1 q t α q t 1 1 α 2 q t q t 1 where q t is the filtered quick response at the t time step q t 1 is the response at the t 1 time step q t is the original streamflow at the t time step q t 1 is the total streamflow at the t 1 time step and α is the recession constant which defines the rate of streamflow decay in this study we set α 0 925 because that is what is recommended by nathan and mcmahon 1990 and other studies have shown high correlation between baseflow estimates using α 0 925 and tracer based observations e g partington et al 2012 the one parameter digital filter method has been validated in other studies arnold and allen 1999 xie et al 2020 zhang et al 2017 ayers et al 2019 although there are different analytical methods available for baseflow separation arnold and allen 1999 eckhardt 2008 lyne and hollick 1979 nathan and mcmahon 1990 sloto and crouse 1996 we utilized the digital filter method because of its appropriateness for midwestern watersheds ayers et al 2019 schilling and jones 2019 and the ease of operation through the website converting the monthly mean baseflow using published usgs drainage areas usgs nwis resulted in the millimeters of baseflow for each site periods of missing data may exist within the usgs streamflow record for a specific site and these were excluded from this analysis monthly and annual baseflow values were assigned to their watershed and these were mapped across the state of iowa to quantify recharge in nested watersheds distinctions were made between headwater basins where a single stream gage measured flows from a discrete area and those downstream gages where locations integrated flows from several gages in the case of the downstream gages the contributions measured at the upstream gages were subtracted from downstream gages to estimate the flow contributions from the lower portion of the watershed the values of monthly and annual baseflow from watersheds were area weighted and averaged to estimate statewide recharge statewide patterns in monthly and annual recharge were evaluated by mapping the distribution of watershed scale baseflow values using the esri arcmap geographic information system

gis shapefiles of the areal extent of different classifications are available for download through the web site https droughtmonitor unl edu data gisdata aspx for this study we downloaded the weekly shapefiles of the drought designations in iowa for the 2000 to 2017 study period and compared the drought designated areas with the monthly and annual watershed baseflow data for this comparison we only utilized baseflow recharge data from headwater basins and compared the baseflow discharge to the drought designation if the centroid of the basin was within a specific drought classification 3 results and discussion 3 1 spatial and temporal patterns of groundwater recharge we used the watershed scale 18 year average annual baseflow calculated for the 132 different stream gages to quantify average annual groundwater recharge in the state table 1 results showed annual groundwater recharge increasing across the state from the northwest to southeast consistent with annual precipitation trends fig 2 from all the records mean annual groundwater recharge was estimated to be 220 mm but this varied considerably across the 18 year study period annual recharge was observed to vary from a low 73 mm in 2012 to 467 mm in 2010 with a wetter 2007 2011 period suddenly ending with dry conditions in 2012 followed by an increasingly wetter period to 2017 four of the 18 years had statewide groundwater recharge 103 mm whereas five years had annual recharge 300 mm overall regional groundwater recharge in iowa is highly variable and difficult to characterize with a single mean value large variations in annual recharge can be expected because of the state s location in the central u s where large air masses collide with regularity producing short and long term climate fluctuations mallakpour and villarini 2015 simply put recharge is much greater in wet years and much less in dry years although the relation is not perfect due to the timing and amount and intensity of precipitation as well as antecedent soil moisture conditions fig 2 for the 18 year period annual groundwater recharge averaged approximately 24 5 of precipitation but the ratio ranged from 11 7 in 2012 drought year to 42 7 in 2010 wet year table 1 regionally we explored how average annual recharge varies across iowa by geologic landform regions table 2 major land resource areas mlras are geographically associated land resource areas delineated by the natural resources conservation service to characterize regions based on soils landscape precipitation and temperature usda 2006 iowa is part of 10 mlras and these regions were used to differentiate agricultural systems and reduction practices across the state for the iowa nutrient reduction strategy inrs 2014 mlras in iowa are similar to iowa landform regions prior 1991 and ecoregions griffith et al 1994 in this study we used the largest eight mlras to distinguish recharge differences fig 3 mean annual recharge was highest in eastern and northeast iowa mlras 104 and 105 where the glacial sediments are sandy loam and the underlying bedrock is dominated by carbonate rocks and karst in contrast less groundwater recharge occurs in southern and western iowa mlras 108d and 109 where thin loess overlies dense and fine textured glacial till table 2 in thick loess region mlra 107 less groundwater recharge occurs on steeply sloping lands where surface runoff dominates watershed hydrology these regional mlra patterns are consistent with previous work by schilling and walter 2005 who modeled annual baseflow in 33 iowa watersheds as a function of precipitation mean percent sand in watershed soils row crop land cover percentage mean soil permeability and the fraction of the watershed with alluvial soils surrogate for floodplain area with these factors the authors were able to account for approximately 89 of the variation in mean annual baseflow across the state it is likely that similar soil land cover and topographic factors contribute to the regional groundwater recharge patterns across the state on a monthly basis groundwater recharge is concentrated in the months of march to july which accounts for 66 of the average annual recharge fig 4 may and june alone account for approximately 32 of the annual recharge and maximum contributions for these two months can account for half of the annual recharge in a year total recharge during the fall and winter months in iowa is typically 10 mm or less but based on the range of minimum to maximum values for monthly recharge it is evident that like annual values average monthly recharge varies considerably fig 4 monthly variability is also manifested during a typical calendar year as regions within iowa experience different degrees of wet and dry conditions fig 5 for example in 2017 the state appears to wet up through june and then unevenly dry out in central iowa during july to october but remaining wetter in southwest and northeast iowa through the late fall this uneven distribution of recharge within the state is typical and attests to the spatial and temporal variability embedded within typical average values 3 2 relation of groundwater recharge to u s drought designations droughts emerge in response to below normal water availability in the hydrologic system but the effects on groundwater can be very diverse at small and large scales hellwig et al 2021 the baseflow response to drought integrates these different spatial scales across a basin over a longer time frame and generally reflects the importance of subsurface hydrogeology hellwig et al 2021 determining the threshold for drought in a watershed focuses on determining fixed limits for defining streamflow droughts threshold approach hellwig and stahl 2018 tallaksen et al 2009 herein we posit that a threshold approach to baseflow recharge can be applied to iowa that utilizes the usdm drought categories as relevant cut off points drought declarations and severity classifications made by the usdm can be improved if an objective and quantitative link between watershed baseflow and usdm classifications can be established drought classifications carry enormous weight in u s farm policy and disaster payments to producers during the 2000 2017 period the u s drought monitor identified regions of the state periodically experiencing d0 abnormally dry to d3 extreme drought conditions one period of exceptional drought d4 was observed in 2012 in far northwestern iowa during the 18 year period we intersected the spatial extent of drought designations reported during the last week of every month with the monthly baseflow measured in headwater basins contained within the drought designated areas and observed a significant relation between monthly baseflow and usdm declarations fig 6 across the headwater basins within iowa mean monthly baseflow was measured to be approximately 6 45 3 41 mm during d0 conditions 3 84 2 26 mm during d1 1 98 mm 1 49 mm during d2 and 1 84 1 70 mm during d3 fig 6 the same pattern was observed when considering median baseflow values from headwater basins with the relation varying from d0 4 41 2 57 mm d1 3 07 1 93 mm d2 1 72 1 49 mm and d3 1 13 0 96 mm in both cases mean or median the relation of decreasing baseflow with drought severity decreases asymptotically fig 6 hence there appears to be a high degree of correlation between usdm designations in iowa and the quantity of baseflow discharged from the drought impacted headwater basins the relation of baseflow to official usdm drought designations suggests that monitoring baseflow conditions in watersheds can provide an objective measure to characterize drought occurrence and severity in this study we analyzed the relation using accumulated basins across the state but determining the baseflow thresholds for a specific drought category in individual basins or smaller regions could allow for baseflow measurements to more quantitatively assess drought conditions currently among other data the usdm utilizes streamflow percentiles to help identify drought categories for example d3 conditions are generally signaled by a streamflow percentile ranging from 3 to 5 of the usgs weekly streamflow because the percentile is determined on the length of the available record it could be different for basins depending on the available data in our study we note that the drought designations could become more quantitative based on measured baseflow low flow conditions in some watersheds in headwater basins where there is little contribution from regional aquifers to streamflow and where little groundwater is withdrawn from pumping a numeric quantity of baseflow discharge could be identified that correlates with officially sanctioned usdm categories with these levels identified trends in the development of drought conditions could be monitored wherever there was a usgs streamflow gage we further explored how the threshold limit of drought varies across iowa by mlra regions in the fractured bedrock in northeast iowa mlra 105 baseflow drought thresholds are much higher because baseflows are augmented by groundwater discharge from permeable carbonate aquifers likewise in mlra 105 baseflows during drought are slightly higher than other regions because thin sandy soils overlie carbonate bedrock at the other end of the spectrum in southern iowa mlra 109 there is little groundwater storage in the thin loess and largely impermeable glacial till sediments and the baseflow thresholds for drought are much lower table 2 over the 18 year record the number of drought designations made per mlra was higher for more common d0 conditions n 47 to 85 for all monthly designations among the ecoregions and d1 27 to 54 categories than infrequent d2 15 to 36 and d3 3 to 13 classifications hence while the results of the mlra analysis point to regional differences in drought baseflow thresholds more data is needed to calibrate and validate the baseflows corresponding to officially declared droughts 3 3 relation of groundwater recharge to economic loss drought losses are the largest category of usda crop insurance payments made to iowa agricultural producers and it is important to improve the ability to characterize and monitor the emergence of drought to increase potential for resilience moreover usdm categories are used to determine eligibility and disaster payment amounts based on the amount of time a grower or owner has had their land physically located in a county designated as having a drought of a certain intensity e g d1 to d5 for example an eligible grower may receive assistance in the amount of five monthly payments if the county has been in a d4 drought for four weeks or more https www fsa usda gov assets usda fsa public usdafiles factsheets livestock forage program lfp fact sheet pdf the assistance may be on equal to one month payment if the drought was designated as d2 hence improved quantification of drought conditions has direct financial implications for growers land owners and the government and it is important to develop objective and quantifiable metrics however it is important to note that the usdm is not a forecast because authors look at the previous two weeks of information before making drought determinations likewise groundwater recharge also looks backward in time but study methodology can be used to monitor the emergence and severity of drought across a region as baseflow thresholds are surpassed economic damages and payments to farmers increase substantially as drought severity increases and it is important to track development of regional drought conditions for forecasting potential economic consequences we evaluated the relation of economic damages to drought severity by downloading information on indemnity payments from the usda risk management agency website https www rma usda gov summaryofbusiness causeofloss we aggregated county level data to calculate statewide totals without adjusting for inflation for all the individual damage cause descriptions available e g drought hail flood tornado etc data show that in iowa between 1991 and 2018 drought triggered approximately 3 6b in payments which represents approximately 30 of the total amount paid in 2012 alone drought related payments reached 1 9b we plotted drought payments in dollars and the percentage of total indemnity payments made to iowa from drought against the annual statewide groundwater recharge fig 7 drought payments to iowa farmers were found to increase linearly as annual groundwater recharge decreased fig 7a further the percentage of indemnity due to drought also increased with decreasing statewide recharge with the indemnity percentage at or above 60 when statewide groundwater recharge was less than about 130 mm fig 7b this suggests that when statewide groundwater recharge is trending toward a total annual amount less than approximately 130 mm there will be economic consequences for agricultural yields that require federal government crop insurance payments in drought assessments of alluvial aquifers in iowa an annual recharge of approximately 102 mm has been utilized in groundwater models e g gannon and vogelgesang 2015 during the 18 year study period there were six years when groundwater recharge was less than 130 mm during these six drought years the difference in monthly recharge for september through february period compared to the 18 year average was less than 7 8 mm in contrast the difference during the six month march to august growing season was more than approximately 11 mm and the departure from average during june and july was more than 17 mm hence below normal groundwater recharge during june and july in iowa appears to be mainly responsible for below normal average annual recharge for the year leading to substantial federal crop insurance payments to farmers 4 conclusions and next steps although determining groundwater recharge is vitally important in water resource management recharge is difficult to measure with much certainty over large geographical areas however the u s has made a large commitment to installing and monitoring continuous streamflow at more than 10 000 stream gauges across the country in this study we investigated how watershed scale baseflow measured at a network of streamflow gages can be used to characterize groundwater recharge across a region with a specific focus on iowa we report the following major conclusions 1 regional groundwater recharge in iowa can be estimated by area weighting annual and monthly baseflow from a network of 132 stream gages we found that over the 2000 2017 study period mean annual groundwater recharge was approximately 220 mm across iowa but it varied considerably in any given year ranging from 73 to 467 mm based on precipitation inputs 2 on a monthly basis groundwater recharge was found to be particularly concentrated in the months of march to july which accounted for 66 of the average annual recharge however monthly groundwater recharge was observed to vary across years seasons and months and we showed in an example from 2017 how recharge during a typical calendar year can transition from wet to dry conditions 3 baseflow decreases during the onset and expansion of drought and we observed a significant relation between monthly baseflow and usdm classification determinations in iowa the trend of decreasing baseflow with drought severity decreases asymptotically suggesting that the quantity of baseflow discharged from the drought impacted headwater basins is highly correlated with usdm designations in iowa the relation appeared to be different among iowa mlra regions based on landscape differences in soils and hydrology but more work is needed to fully calibrate these patterns 4 drought losses are the largest category of usda crop insurance payments made to iowa agricultural producers and payments were found to substantially increase when annual groundwater recharge was less than approximately 130 mm yr 1 more work is needed to identify specific economic thresholds for drought but the analysis shows promise for forecasting potential economic consequences for an uncertain future climate that will likely include periods of short and long term drought credit authorship contribution statement kes

gaining streams healy 2010 risser et al 2009 a simple water balance equation can be written for the groundwater system in the watershed 1 r bf qp δsg where r is recharge to groundwater bf is baseflow qp is well pumping and δsg is the change in the groundwater volume assuming negligible well pumping and change in groundwater storage over the long term r bf scanlon et al 2002 noted that pumping et and underflow to deeper aquifers should be considered when equating bf to r but in many regions characterized by fine textured surficial deposits there is little pumping of the water table aquifer and underflow to deeper aquifers is negligible these conditions are met in the u s midwestern state of iowa where multiple glacial advances across iowa during the pleistocene draped a low permeable glacial till barrier between deeper unconsolidated sediments and underlying bedrock aquifers shallow groundwater flow is concentrated in the upper loess alluvium and oxidized till units typically less than 15 m prior et al 2003 these upper units are less utilized for water supplies than deeper confined bedrock aquifers and are not impacted by pumping demands within an iowa watershed temporal patterns of baseflow at monthly and annual scales were well correlated with water table fluctuations and watershed scale recharge schilling 2009 however researchers have noted that the baseflow method only provides a single recharge value per watershed so it cannot distinguish spatial variations of recharge within a basin or larger geographical area niazi et al 2017 halford and mayer 2000 healy 2010 others have utilized the baseflow method to investigate differences in recharge properties among different catchments hellwig and stahl 2018 barker et al 2016 but when there is a need for a seamless estimate for regional groundwater recharge researchers have often utilized a groundwater flow model e g hellwig et al 2020 niazi et al 2017 however in the united states the united state geological survey usgs operates a network of more than 10 000 stream gages that monitor continuous streamflow and report daily mean values www usgs gov calculating watershed scale baseflow across the network of usgs stream gages may provide for regionalization of spatial and temporal patterns of groundwater recharge provided the network of gages is dense enough in an area in the central u s ayers et al 2018 utilized 458 gages in an 11 state region where flow records extended back more than 50 years to analyze baseflow trends in the midwestern state of iowa the usgs operates approximately 132 streamflow gages from which baseflow can be estimated from daily records that are more than 20 years long in this study we posit that by calculating annual and monthly baseflow from these iowa gaging stations we can regionalize spatial and temporal patterns of groundwater recharge across the state combining baseflow recharge estimates from 132 watersheds in the state allows us to develop a seamless estimate of groundwater recharge across a large geographical region hence our approach expands the use of the popular baseflow recharge method from a single catchment to larger geographical areas where differences in recharge can be investigated without the use of a groundwater flow model improved understanding of diffuse groundwater recharge is important in rain fed agricultural areas under the threat of a variable climate within the u s agricultural productivity is particularly concentrated in iowa which is the largest producer of corn and soybeans as well as the leading producer of eggs and pork and the fourth largest producer of feeder cattle jones et al 2019 this immense productivity is threatened by a future where climate variability is expected to amplify mallakpour and villarini 2015 with more intense precipitation and longer drier periods between events ukkola et al 2020 wuebbles and hayhoe 2004 drought periods are particularly damaging to agricultural productivity at regional scales zipper et al 2016 for example the 2012 drought in the u s is considered by some to be among the most expensive and widespread natural disasters in the u s mallya et al 2013 based on long term patterns zipper et al 2016 reported that drought was responsible for an average of 13 of the variability in u s corn and soybean yields in iowa drought losses comprised nearly 38 of total indemnity payments between 1991 and 2018 exceeding the payments from excess moisture and precipitation by nearly 10 https www rma usda gov information tools summary of business cause of loss hence improving the ability to quantify the emergence and severity of drought in agricultural regions may increase accuracy in federal reporting and compensation for drought losses and ultimately lead to improved resilience for agricultural production systems although drought events are large scale phenomena hellwig et al 2020 groundwater drought is often measured at a site specific scale and then scaled up to watersheds kumar et al 2016 using statistical metrics and indices palmer 1965 bloomfield and marchant 2013 loon et al 2017 hellwig and stahl 2018 analyzed baseflow time series collected from central european gages to characterize catchment response times and predict baseflow drought in watersheds across the region herein we make further use of the network of usgs streamflow gages in iowa to investigate how trends in groundwater recharge estimated from baseflow may serve as an indicator of the development and severity of drought conditions and could be used to better clarify usdm drought declarations in iowa the goal of this study was to investigate how watershed scale baseflow calculated from a network of streamflow gages in iowa can be used to 1 quantify spatial and temporal patterns of groundwater recharge across a region and 2 assess how trends in groundwater recharge characterize the emergence expansion and severity of drought conditions at regional scales 2 data and methods streamflow records from 132 usgs gaging locations across iowa were analyzed for the 2000 to 2017 period fig 1 the year 2000 was selected for the beginning year because this year corresponded to the publication of the first u s drought monitor and with it the availability of gis records for drought designations criteria for selection of gages included their length of record continuous since 2000 and their location on a free flowing interior river not influenced by a reservoir or located on a border river no iowa gages were located near large alluvial aquifer pumping centers where streamflow could be influenced by well pumping baseflow separation calculations were performed for the 132 gages using purdue university s what web based hydrograph analysis tool lim et al 2005 we used what to import usgs flow data for selected iowa gaging stations containing multiple years of continuous streamflow data we used the one parameter digital filter method proposed by lyne and hollick 1979 1 q t α q t 1 1 α 2 q t q t 1 where q t is the filtered quick response at the t time step q t 1 is the response at the t 1 time step q t is the original streamflow at the t time step q t 1 is the total streamflow at the t 1 time step and α is the recession constant which defines the rate of streamflow decay in this study we set α 0 925 because that is what is recommended by nathan and mcmahon 1990 and other studies have shown high correlation between baseflow estimates using α 0 925 and tracer based observations e g partington et al 2012 the one parameter digital filter method has been validated in other studies arnold and allen 1999 xie et al 2020 zhang et al 2017 ayers et al 2019 although there are different analytical methods available for baseflow separation arnold and allen 1999 eckhardt 2008 lyne and hollick 1979 nathan and mcmahon 1990 sloto and crouse 1996 we utilized the digital filter method because of its appropriateness for midwestern watersheds ayers et al 2019 schilling and jones 2019 and the ease of operation through the website converting the monthly mean baseflow using published usgs drainage areas usgs nwis resulted in the millimeters of baseflow for each site periods of missing data may exist within the usgs streamflow record for a specific site and these were excluded from this analysis monthly and annual baseflow values were assigned to their watershed and these were mapped across the state of iowa to quantify recharge in nested watersheds distinctions were made between headwater basins where a single stream gage measured flows from a discrete area and those downstream gages where locations integrated flows from several gages in the case of the downstream gages the contributions measured at the upstream gages were subtracted from downstream gages to estimate the flow contributions from the lower portion of the watershed the values of monthly and annual baseflow from watersheds were area weighted and averaged to estimate statewide recharge statewide patterns in monthly and annual recharge were evaluated by mapping the distribution of watershed scale baseflow values using the esri arcmap geographic information system gis the u s drought monitor usdm is produced jointly by the national drought mitigation center ndmc at the university of nebraska lincoln the national oceanic and atmospheric administration noaa and the u s department of agriculture usda the ndmc hosts the web site of the drought monitor and the associated data and provides the map and data freely to the public at droughtmonitor unl edu the usdm relies on the opinions of experts from udmc noaa and usda to synthesize the best available data to estimate the extent and severity of drought in the u s relying on numeric inputs such as palmer drought severity index pdsi the standardized precipitation index spi and other climatological inputs the keech byram drought index for fire satellite based assessments of vegetation health and other indicators of soil moisture https droughtmonitor unl edu droughts are classified according to severity ranging from d0 abnormally dry d1 moderate drought d2 severe drought d3 extreme drought and d4

gis shapefiles of the areal extent of different classifications are available for download through the web site https droughtmonitor unl edu data gisdata aspx for this study we downloaded the weekly shapefiles of the drought designations in iowa for the 2000 to 2017 study period and compared the drought designated areas with the monthly and annual watershed baseflow data for this comparison we only utilized baseflow recharge data from headwater basins and compared the baseflow discharge to the drought designation if the centroid of the basin was within a specific drought classification 3 results and discussion 3 1 spatial and temporal patterns of groundwater recharge we used the watershed scale 18 year average annual baseflow calculated for the 132 different stream gages to quantify average annual groundwater recharge in the state table 1 results showed annual groundwater recharge increasing across the state from the northwest to southeast consistent with annual precipitation trends fig 2 from all the records mean annual groundwater recharge was estimated to be 220 mm but this varied considerably across the 18 year study period annual recharge was observed to vary from a low 73 mm in 2012 to 467 mm in 2010 with a wetter 2007 2011 period suddenly ending with dry conditions in 2012 followed by an increasingly wetter period to 2017 four of the 18 years had statewide groundwater recharge 103 mm whereas five years had annual recharge 300 mm overall regional groundwater recharge in iowa is highly variable and difficult to characterize with a single mean value large variations in annual recharge can be expected because of the state s location in the central u s where large air masses collide with regularity producing short and long term climate fluctuations mallakpour and villarini 2015 simply put recharge is much greater in wet years and much less in dry years although the relation is not perfect due to the timing and amount and intensity of precipitation as well as antecedent soil moisture conditions fig 2 for the 18 year period annual groundwater recharge averaged approximately 24 5 of precipitation but the ratio ranged from 11 7 in 2012 drought year to 42 7 in 2010 wet year table 1 regionally we explored how average annual recharge varies across iowa by geologic landform regions table 2 major land resource areas mlras are geographically associated land resource areas delineated by the natural resources conservation service to characterize regions based on soils landscape precipitation and temperature usda 2006 iowa is part of 10 mlras and these regions were used to differentiate agricultural systems and reduction practices across the state for the iowa nutrient reduction strategy inrs 2014 mlras in iowa are similar to iowa landform regions prior 1991 and ecoregions griffith et al 1994 in this study we used the largest eight mlras to distinguish recharge differences fig 3 mean annual recharge was highest in eastern and northeast iowa mlras 104 and 105 where the glacial sediments are sandy loam and the underlying bedrock is dominated by carbonate rocks and karst in contrast less groundwater recharge occurs in southern and western iowa mlras 108d and 109 where thin loess overlies dense and fine textured glacial till table 2 in thick loess region mlra 107 less groundwater recharge occurs on steeply sloping lands where surface runoff dominates watershed hydrology these regional mlra patterns are consistent with previous work by schilling and walter 2005 who modeled annual baseflow in 33 iowa watersheds as a function of precipitation mean percent sand in watershed soils row crop land cover percentage mean soil permeability and the fraction of the watershed with alluvial soils surrogate for floodplain area with these factors the authors were able to account for approximately 89 of the variation in mean annual baseflow across the state it is likely that similar soil land cover and topographic factors contribute to the regional groundwater recharge patterns across the state on a monthly basis groundwater recharge is concentrated in the months of march to july which accounts for 66 of the average annual recharge fig 4 may and june alone account for approximately 32 of the annual recharge and maximum contributions for these two months can account for half of the annual recharge in a year total recharge during the fall and winter months in iowa is typically 10 mm or less but based on the range of minimum to maximum values for monthly recharge it is evident that like annual values average monthly recharge varies considerably fig 4 monthly variability is also manifested during a typical calendar year as regions within iowa experience different degrees of wet and dry conditions fig 5 for example in 2017 the state appears to wet up through june and then unevenly dry out in central iowa during july to october but remaining wetter in southwest and northeast iowa through the late fall this uneven distribution of recharge within the state is typical and attests to the spatial and temporal variability embedded within typical average values 3 2 relation of groundwater recharge to u s drought designations droughts emerge in response to below normal water availability in the hydrologic system but the effects on groundwater can be very diverse at small and large scales hellwig et al 2021 the baseflow response to drought integrates these different spatial scales across a basin over a longer time frame and generally reflects the importance of subsurface hydrogeology hellwig et al 2021 determining the threshold for drought in a watershed focuses on determining fixed limits for defining streamflow droughts threshold approach hellwig and stahl 2018 tallaksen et al 2009 herein we posit that a threshold approach to baseflow recharge can be applied to iowa that utilizes the usdm drought categories as relevant cut off points drought declarations and severity classifications made by the usdm can be improved if an objective and quantitative link between watershed baseflow and usdm classifications can be established drought classifications carry enormous weight in u s farm policy and disaster payments to producers during the 2000 2017 period the u s drought monitor identified regions of the state periodically experiencing d0 abnormally dry to d3 extreme drought conditions one period of exceptional drought d4 was observed in 2012 in far northwestern iowa during the 18 year period we intersected the spatial extent of drought designations reported during the last week of every month with the monthly baseflow measured in headwater basins contained within the drought designated areas and observed a significant relation between monthly baseflow and usdm declarations fig 6 across the headwater basins within iowa mean monthly baseflow was measured to be approximately 6 45 3 41 mm during d0 conditions 3 84 2 26 mm during d1 1 98 mm 1 49 mm during d2 and 1 84 1 70 mm during d3 fig 6 the same pattern was observed when considering median baseflow values from headwater basins with the relation varying from d0 4 41 2 57 mm d1 3 07 1 93 mm d2 1 72 1 49 mm and d3 1 13 0 96 mm in both cases mean or median the relation of decreasing baseflow with drought severity decreases asymptotically fig 6 hence there appears to be a high degree of correlation between usdm designations in iowa and the quantity of baseflow discharged from the drought impacted headwater basins the relation of baseflow to official usdm drought designations suggests that monitoring baseflow conditions in watersheds can provide an objective measure to characterize drought occurrence and severity in this study we analyzed the relation using accumulated basins across the state but determining the baseflow thresholds for a specific drought category in individual basins or smaller regions could allow for baseflow measurements to more quantitatively assess drought conditions currently among other data the usdm utilizes streamflow percentiles to help identify drought categories for example d3 conditions are generally signaled by a streamflow percentile ranging from 3 to 5 of the usgs weekly streamflow because the percentile is determined on the length of the available record it could be different for basins depending on the available data in our study we note that the drought designations could become more quantitative based on measured baseflow low flow conditions in some watersheds in headwater basins where there is little contribution from regional aquifers to streamflow and where little groundwater is withdrawn from pumping a numeric quantity of baseflow discharge could be identified that correlates with officially sanctioned usdm categories with these levels identified trends in the development of drought conditions could be monitored wherever there was a usgs streamflow gage we further explored how the threshold limit of drought varies across iowa by mlra regions in the fractured bedrock in northeast iowa mlra 105 baseflow drought thresholds are much higher because baseflows are augmented by groundwater discharge from permeable carbonate aquifers likewise in mlra 105 baseflows during drought are slightly higher than other regions because thin sandy soils overlie carbonate bedrock at the other end of the spectrum in southern iowa mlra 109 there is little groundwater storage in the thin loess and largely impermeable glacial till sediments and the baseflow thresholds for drought are much lower table 2 over the 18 year record the number of drought designations made per mlra was higher for more common d0 conditions n 47 to 85 for all monthly designations among the ecoregions and d1 27 to 54 categories than infrequent d2 15 to 36 and d3 3 to 13 classifications hence while the results of the mlra analysis point to regional differences in drought baseflow thresholds more data is needed to calibrate and validate the baseflows corresponding to officially declared droughts 3 3 relation of groundwater recharge to economic loss drought losses are the largest category of usda crop insurance payments made to iowa agricultural producers and it is important to improve the ability to characterize and monitor the emergence of drought to increase potential for resilience moreover usdm categories are used to determine eligibility and disaster payment amounts based on the amount of time a grower or owner has had their land physically located in a county designated as having a drought of a certain intensity e g d1 to d5 for example an eligible grower may receive assistance in the amount of five monthly payments if the county has been in a d4 drought for four weeks or more https www fsa usda gov assets usda fsa public usdafiles factsheets livestock forage program lfp fact sheet pdf the assistance may be on equal to one month payment if the drought was designated as d2 hence improved quantification of drought conditions has direct financial implications for growers land owners and the government and it is important to develop objective and quantifiable metrics however it is important to note that the usdm is not a forecast because authors look at the previous two weeks of information before making drought determinations likewise groundwater recharge also looks backward in time but study methodology can be used to monitor the emergence and severity of drought across a region as baseflow thresholds are surpassed economic damages and payments to farmers increase substantially as drought severity increases and it is important to track development of regional drought conditions for forecasting potential economic consequences we evaluated the relation of economic damages to drought severity by downloading information on indemnity payments from the usda risk management agency website https www rma usda gov summaryofbusiness causeofloss we aggregated county level data to calculate statewide totals without adjusting for inflation for all the individual damage cause descriptions available e g drought hail flood tornado etc data show that in iowa between 1991 and 2018 drought triggered approximately 3 6b in payments which represents approximately 30 of the total amount paid in 2012 alone drought related payments reached 1 9b we plotted drought payments in dollars and the percentage of total indemnity payments made to iowa from drought against the annual statewide groundwater recharge fig 7 drought payments to iowa farmers were found to increase linearly as annual groundwater recharge decreased fig 7a further the percentage of indemnity due to drought also increased with decreasing statewide recharge with the indemnity percentage at or above 60 when statewide groundwater recharge was less than about 130 mm fig 7b this suggests that when statewide groundwater recharge is trending toward a total annual amount less than approximately 130 mm there will be economic consequences for agricultural yields that require federal government crop insurance payments in drought assessments of alluvial aquifers in iowa an annual recharge of approximately 102 mm has been utilized in groundwater models e g gannon and vogelgesang 2015 during the 18 year study period there were six years when groundwater recharge was less than 130 mm during these six drought years the difference in monthly recharge for september through february period compared to the 18 year average was less than 7 8 mm in contrast the difference during the six month march to august growing season was more than approximately 11 mm and the departure from average during june and july was more than 17 mm hence below normal groundwater recharge during june and july in iowa appears to be mainly responsible for below normal average annual recharge for the year leading to substantial federal crop insurance payments to farmers 4 conclusions and next steps although determining groundwater recharge is vitally important in water resource management recharge is difficult to measure with much certainty over large geographical areas however the u s has made a large commitment to installing and monitoring continuous streamflow at more than 10 000 stream gauges across the country in this study we investigated how watershed scale baseflow measured at a network of streamflow gages can be used to characterize groundwater recharge across a region with a specific focus on iowa we report the following major conclusions 1 regional groundwater recharge in iowa can be estimated by area weighting annual and monthly baseflow from a network of 132 stream gages we found that over the 2000 2017 study period mean annual groundwater recharge was approximately 220 mm across iowa but it varied considerably in any given year ranging from 73 to 467 mm based on precipitation inputs 2 on a monthly basis groundwater recharge was found to be particularly concentrated in the months of march to july which accounted for 66 of the average annual recharge however monthly groundwater recharge was observed to vary across years seasons and months and we showed in an example from 2017 how recharge during a typical calendar year can transition from wet to dry conditions 3 baseflow decreases during the onset and expansion of drought and we observed a significant relation between monthly baseflow and usdm classification determinations in iowa the trend of decreasing baseflow with drought severity decreases asymptotically suggesting that the quantity of baseflow discharged from the drought impacted headwater basins is highly correlated with usdm designations in iowa the relation appeared to be different among iowa mlra regions based on landscape differences in soils and hydrology but more work is needed to fully calibrate these patterns 4 drought losses are the largest category of usda crop insurance payments made to iowa agricultural producers and payments were found to substantially increase when annual groundwater recharge was less than approximately 130 mm yr 1 more work is needed to identify specific economic thresholds for drought but the analysis shows promise for forecasting potential economic consequences for an uncertain future climate that will likely include periods of short and long term drought credit authorship contribution statement kes

4217,extreme low and high precipitation can cause natural disasters e g drought and flood events which have devastatingeffects on natural environment and the human society in this study we present a framework for assessing the stability of spatial dependence of extreme precipitation and their concurrence probability in a nested catchment the pearl river basin was used as a case study to test the applicability of the framework this framework is threefold this first part involves modeling spatial dependence of both summer maxima and winter minima precipitation between pairs of scattered gauges over the basin by employing the pair copula constructions as a baseline model the second part of this framework aims to identify the variability of spatial dependence as a result of the effects of external drivers specifically variations in the spatial dependence of extreme precipitation in the pearl river basin over different periods associated with the influence of large scale climate signals were examined the final part quantifies the probability of occurring extreme precipitation related events simultaneously over broader areas related to a specific event at a given gauge and the possible spatial extents being affected the results indicate that the presented framework is able to capture the large scale spatial dependence structures of both summer maxima and winter minima precipitation it also allows for explicitly estimating the pairwise concurrence probability of extreme high and low precipitation events and event impacted areas across the basin keywords dependence stability concurrence probability precipitation nested basin 1 introduction precipitation related disasters such as droughts and floods are common natural phenomena and their co existence poses a threat on natural environment and human society precipitation deficits or droughts are generally associated with the shortage of precipitation causing deficiencies in water supply for human consumption and irrigation in farms and exerting server impacts on ecosystems cauvy fraunié et al 2016 chen et al 2020 khaliq et al 2009 van loon 2015 by contrast extreme high precipitation can lead to high surface runoff and subsequently result in floods that cause significant and immediate impacts on both individuals and communities such as loss of human life and property mass migration destruction of crops and deterioration of health conditions owing to waterborne diseases alderman et al 2012 brunner et al 2018 schaller et al 2016 investigating the variation and pattern of extreme precipitation is thus of particular interest for adequate management of droughts and floods in water resources planning mitigation and insurance industries also advances in water resources management techniques or approaches would provide new tools and ideas for supporting decision making on potential measures which can be taken extreme low and high precipitation generally occurs not only at a single location but also in a broad spatial extent such as the entire or certain parts of nested drainage catchments regional frequency analysis has been widely applied to estimate the probability of widespread extreme events smith et al 2015 a traditional way in regional riskanalysis is to assume that the information from gauged areas of the catchment can be transferred to the entire catchment indicating that the catchment is defined as being broadly homogenous lan et al 2018 merz and blöschl 2008 merz and blöschl 2009 zaman et al 2012 however extreme precipitation related events are heterogeneous in both space and time particularly in the basins with complex orographic terrain there is thus a need to consider the spatial variability of extreme precipitation for better understanding the variation of drought or flood risk across spatial temporal scales to achieve the goal it is important to model the spatial dependence of extreme precipitation over different locations or channel networks of catchments a few studies have made pioneering efforts in this regard for instance several multivariate methods e g the semi parametric conditional exceedance model max stable model hierarchical bayesian models and fisher copula model have been applied to generate synthetic hydrological events mainly floods and model the spatial dependence structure of hydrological extreme events brunner et al 2019 kabluchko et al 2009 ribatet and sedki 2013 segers 2012 a key component of such analysis is to involve the estimation of the spatial dependence of events yet an important question remains unclear whether the spatial dependence structure of these extreme events is stable over time in addition to the regional variation in extreme precipitation external climate factors such as global temperature and large scale climate signals may also play a role in the variability of precipitation some climate signals are widely recognized as an important factor to be related with rainfall and streamflow variations at regional or global scales such as el niño southern oscillation enso emerton et al 2017 mcphaden et al 2006 rice and emanuel 2017 ward et al 2014 it is a periodical ocean and atmospheric phenomenon with significant impacts on global and regional climate in particular the potential connections between enso events and precipitation patterns at the pearl river basin has received considerable concerns in previous studies for instance wei and cai et al 2020 found that enso events may induce large precipitation variations over the pearl river basin based on the reanalysis data set huang et al 2017 documented that enso has remarkable impact on low precipitation at the pearl river basin this triggers another question that is how the spatial dependence structure of precipitation responds to the effect of enso events here we will examine the conditional effect of enso on precipitation spatial dependence within the pearl river basin in addition to examining the stability of spatial dependence of extreme precipitation this study aims to identify the concurrence probability of extreme precipitation related events at different locations and the areal extent of being impacted in other words if an extreme event e g extreme high or low precipitation events had been observed at one gauged site what is the likelihood that nearby gauges or sites locations would record the same extreme event simultaneously furthermore how large is the areal extent being affected by this extreme event whether a specific extreme event will impact the entire or parts of the watershed identification of concurrent probability of extreme precipitation related events and event impacted areas could greatly benefit the hydrological practice e g water resources management and planning mitigation suitable preparation for potential drought flood hazards for this reason we will explore these questions in the current study this study outlines a framework to examine the extreme precipitation in both space and time and their concurrent risk the pearl river basin in southern china is used to illustrate the proposed framework the framework consists of three major components 1 to model the spatial dependence of extreme precipitation e g summer maxima and winter minima precipitation over a nested drainage system by using pair copula construction as a baseline model 2 to explore the variability of spatial dependence of extreme precipitation as a result of the effects of external drivers i e enso 3 to quantify the occurrence probability of extreme precipitation related events over a spatial domain and potential areal extents being affected 2 data and methodology 2 1 data we demonstrate the applicability of the presented framework by using the precipitation data over the period of 1961 2019 for 49 gauges at the nested pearl river basin prb that were obtained from national meteorological information center of the china meteorological administration http data cma cn china surface climatic data daily data set v3 0 fig 1 the pearl river basin 97 39 e 117 18 e 3 41 n 29 15 n has a drainage area of 4 42 105 km2 originating from the yunnan guizhou plateau and flowing into the south china sea the basin is located in the tropical and sub tropical climate zoneswhich is heavily affected by the monsoon climate the basin has a distinct wet season from april to september it accounts for 72 88 of the annual total precipitation between 1000 and 2000 mm higher in the eastern coastal area and lower in the western mountainous areas annual mean temperature varies from 14 to 22 c liu et al 2013 we focus on the maxima precipitation during the summer season june august and the minima precipitation during the winter season december february to represent the high and low precipitation for each gauge over the prb respectively the oceanic niño index oni which is a 3 month running average of sea surface temperature sst over the same region 5 n 5 s 120 w 170 w as the niño 3 4 index is used to define the enso event kousky and higgins 2007 we used the oni data of the period from 1961 to 2019 available at https origin cpc ncep noaa gov products analysis monitoring ensostuff oni v5 php the averaged summer enso values were extracted for examining the effect of external climate signals on spatial dependence of high precipitation between pairs of scattered gauges over the study domain 2 2 framework development in this section we present how to examine the spatial stability of extreme precipitation herein summer maxima and winter minima precipitation in both space and time and concurrent risk with the proposed framework it involves three main components spatial dependence modeling effect of external drivers on the stability of spatial dependence and concurrence probabilities over the impacted area 2 2 1 spatial dependence modeling a multivariate approach is promising to model the spatial dependence structure of extreme precipitation over different gauged locations by considering the complex network structure of a basin such multivariate approaches should have strong mathematical foundations and also be easy for implementation in hydrology a promising approach for modeling extreme precipitation and their dependence structure is the copula function proposed by sklar et al 1959 the copula based models have been mainly applied in the fields including hydrological frequency analysis precipitation prediction and drought identification cheng et al 2019 favre et al 2004 hao and singh 2013 khedun et al 2014 laux et al 2011 li et al 2013a li et al 2013b liu et al 2016 it can be easily extended to simulate the spatial dependence of extreme precipitation events or capture the multivariate nature of these events bárdossy 2006 brunner et al 2019 gräler 2014 liu et al 2016 however regular copula functions have limitations in multivariate modeling at higher dimensions because of parameter restrictions and computationally intensive formulations joe 2014 pair copula constructions pccs were proposed to overcome this drawback aas et al 2009 brechmann et al 2013 the pccs are a hierarchical graphical model that describe multivariate copulas using many bivariate copulas as building blocks which allow to model the multivariate dependencies with high flexibility the basic idea of pccs is to decompose an n dimensional multivariate density into n n 1 2 bivariate copula densities aas et al 2009 min and czado 2010 ren et al 2014 which can model multivariate distributions of any dimension regular pccs include two simple sub classes c vine and d vine here we used the c vine to establish the high dimensional dependence structure of extreme precipitation between pairs of gauges the density of the n dimensional c vine is written as aas et al 2009 1 f x 1 x n k 1 n f k x k i 1 n 1 j 1 n i c i i j 1 i 1 f x i x 1 x i 1 f x i j x 1 x i 1 where f x 1 x n denotes the joint density function of n dimensional random variables herein the variables are the time series of summer maxima and winter minima precipitation at 49 gauges f k x k k 1 n denotes the n marginal densities and c i i j 1 i 1 represents the bivariate copula densities more details about pccs can be found in many existing studies aas et al 2009 bedford and cooke 2002 schepsmeier et al 2015 before constructing the pccs to model in the joint distribution we need to fit a proper marginal probability distribution for each variable in this study three theoretical probability distributions i e gamma lognormal and weibull are involved in comparison and the best fitted theoretical probability distributions is determined according to the chi square goodness of fit test the smallest statistics regarding the construction of high dimensional pccs a variety of potential bivariate copula families examined in the study include gaussian student s t gumbel joe bb1 bb6 bb7 bb8 copulas as well as the corresponding survival copulas rotated by 180 of the clayton gumbel joe bb1 bb6 bb7 and bb8 we determined the best fitted bivariate copula for each pair of variables according to the akaike information criterion the r package vinecopula schepsmeier et al 2015 is used to accomplish this estimation 2 2 2 stability of spatial dependence and the effect of external drivers in geostatistics the variogram approach is commonly used to assess the spatial dependence between variables it represents a spatial and stationary process with a well defined covariance function however this approach is not well adapted to working with extremes and is challenging to interpret inside the framework of extreme value theory instead of the traditional variogram approach the f madogram method which was originally used in the max stable processes is particularly suited for extremes and provides a meaningful measurement to assess the degree of spatial dependence brunner et al 2019 the f madogram as a summary statistic for the spatial dependence structure is defined as follows with h distance 2 υ h 1 2 e f z x h f z x where f z e x p 1 z is the fréchet distribution z x is a stationary process here the original or simulated time series of summer maxima and winter minima precipitation and h is the distance between pairs of meteorological gauges cooley et al 2006 f madogram estimates of the generations of the fitted pccs model were compared with the f madogram estimates of observations between 49 gauges which enables us to quantitatively assess whether the dependence related to the distance between pairs of sites is captured by the pccs model to analyze the time stability of the spatial dependence of both summer maxima and winter minima precipitation we established spatial dependence model for two sub periods and the respective f madogram estimates were calculated the temporal variability of the spatial dependence was then described using box whisker plots the student s t test is used to determine the significance of the difference between the f madogram estimates for each sub period we further explored the variability of spatial dependence of both high rainfall here only summer maxima precipitation is used as an illustration under the effect of enso we define oni values more than one standard deviation above below the long term mean as positive negative enso events as an example we only focus on the effect of enso events on summer maxima precipitation in the prb 2 2 3 pairwise concurrence probabilities and impacted area the third component of the framework is to estimate the pairwise concurrence probabilities related to certain extreme precipitation related events when an extreme high or low precipitation event was recorded at a gauge the pairwise concurrence probability herein refers to the co occurring probability of the same event at other gauges dombry et al 2018 a technical expression is that given n dimensional random variables x 1 x n here the variables are the summer maxima or winter minima precipitation at 49 meteorological gauges we first calculated the corresponding cumulative probability distribution cdf u 1 u n respectively the pairwise concurrence probability at any locations x i i 1 n denoted by u given an extreme event recorded at a certain location x j j 1 n a n d j m denoted by v can be written for extreme high events summer maxima precipitation as 3 pr u u i v u j c u i u j 1 u j regarding extreme low events for winter minima precipitation the pairwise concurrence probability is given as 4 pr u u i v u j c u i u j u j here the c is the joint survival function aghakouchak et al 2014 c 1 u i u j c u i u j c indicates the bivariate copula again a variety of potential bivariate copula families used in the study include gaussian student s t gumbel joe bb1 bb6 bb7 bb8 copulas as well as the corresponding survival copulas rotated by 180 of the clayton gumbel joe bb1 bb6 bb7 and bb8 we achieved best fitted one using the bicopselect function in r program generally an event could be deemed extreme or dangerous if the variable is above or below a defined threshold salvadori and de michele 2004 as an illustration we use the 0 8 and 0 2 quantile threshold of summer maxima and winter minima precipitation respectively to define extreme low winter precipitation events u winter 0 2 and extreme high summer precipitation events in summer u summer 0 8 respectively i e the extreme events with a 5 year return level but note that any thresholds of interest could be examined based on the above pairwise concurrence probability expressions however the above approach can only estimate the bivariate concurrence probability centered at a given location our objective is to plot a map showing the concurrence probability at other gauges around the centered one regarding the same event one thus needs to apply the bivariate approach for every choice of a centered location another question is to estimate the areal extent subjective to the concurrence probability in the neighborhood of the centered conditioned gauges to achieve this we provide a simple method which allows to interpolate the pointwise bivariate concurrence probability map at a given location to a spatial surface i e within the domain of the basin this is based on an interpolation method the kriging method used with that we can calculate the area of grids with bivariate concurrence probability above a pre defined threshold e g 0 4 consequently we could obtain the spatial patterns of impacted area under that concurrence probability with the copula based approach we are able to plot pairwise concurrence probabilities as a function of distance between pairs of gauges in this regard it is possible to illustrate the general patterns about how the concurrence probability varies among different distance sections the analysis of spatial correlations between rainfall gauges against distance may also present similar patterns ha et al 2007 mandapaka and qin 2013 which however indicates the strength of association between rainfall gauges and the direction of the relationship instead of the pairwise concurrence probability related to certain extreme precipitation related events moreover the copula based concurrence probabilities enable to further estimate spatial patterns of impacted area for certain concurrence probabilities as mentioned above 3 results 3 1 spatial dependence structure identification and validation the modeling of spatial dependence of summer maxima or winter minima precipitation between the scattered gauges of the prb starts with modeling the marginal distributions for each station here we considered a set of copula functions to construct the 49 demensional pccs model according to the aic value as mentioned in the methodology section once the dependence model is determined we are able to generate random samples of pseudo characteristics that need to be back transformed to the real space with each individual marginal distribution fig 2 indicates the comparison of the f madogram estimates from the fitted pccs model against the observations between 49 gauges which enables us to quantitatively assess the dependence determined by the distance between pairs of sites for both summer maxima and winter minima precipitation over the period 1961 2019 to test the agreement of simulated samples with the observed ones the student t test was performed the null hypothesis of student t test is no effective difference between the means of observations and simulations as presented the random generations with respect to individual site provide good coverage of the observations including the pairs of sites with quite long distances according to the student t test the p values for both summer maxima p value 0 4576 and winter minima precipitation p value 0 2608 are greater than a pre defined significance level of α α 0 05 which indicates the observations and simulations are largely consistent the greater f madogram estimates indicate weaker spatial dependence since the spatial dependence declines with the increasing distance this in turn reflects that the presented model is able to characterize the realistic spatial dependence between gauges in the domain the robustness of the approach enables us to make a further detection of the stability of spatial dependence for both summer and winter rainfalls between gauges 3 2 the stability of spatial dependence over time we applied the similar procedure to examine the spatial dependence of summer maxima precipitation and the stability or variation of the dependence over time again simulations of summer maxima precipitation for each site have been generated over two sub periods 1961 1990 and 1991 2019 the f madogram estimates were computed for simulations of the pccs model over the two sub periods between pairs of sites to illustrate the spatial dependence structure we classified the distance into three categories the distribution of these f madogram estimates was then displayed via box whisker plots in fig 3 a and the variations between sub periods were tested using the student s t test it is clear to see the spatial dependence structure is quite unstable over the two sub periods for different distance categories according to the median values of the box whisker plots the spatial dependence seems to be much stronger indicated by the smaller f madogram estimates in the first sub period with less anthropogenic impacts compared to the second period for all distance categories specifically in the category of 0 200 km there was a nonsignificant increase in f madogram estimates between periods of 1961 1990 and 1991 2019 while the f madogram estimates show a significant increasing trend in the second sub period regarding the category of 200 400 km such pattern can also be found for longer distances fig 3a with greater f madogram estimates in addition to the stability of spatial dependence of summer maxima precipitation one may also be interested in the variation in the winter minima precipitation fig 3b maps similar diagnosis but for the winter minima precipitation in the prb as seen the magnitudes in identifying the spatial dependence vary significantly over different distance ranges and sub periods a different pattern can be identified when compared to the box whisker plots of the summer maxima precipitation the spatial dependence of winter minima precipitation between pairs of sites is much stronger indicated by the smaller f madogram estimates compared to that of summer in detail for the distance category of 0 200 km the f madogram estimates show a significant decreasing trend in the second period comparing with the first period such shifts in the box whisker shapes between sub periods can also be found in the distance category above 400 km while the change is not that pronounced in distance of 200 400 km compared to other distances but the distribution of f madogram estimates in the second period is much lower than that in the first period this indicates in the second sub period the spatial dependence of winter minima precipitation between pairs of sites is generally more stable than the first period in the wintertime for most distance ranges the declining trend in the spatial dependence of summer precipitation could be partially related to the impact of climate change in the context of global warming extreme precipitation events are becoming more concentrated in the prb which likely lead to less spatial dependence in summer 3 3 the effect of external drivers on the spatial dependence the proposed framework allows to provide insights on how the external factors affect the spatial dependence of precipitation between pairs of gauges to illustrate this applicability we take the positive enso events as an example large scale climate signals have been widely reported with strong effect on the climate variations particularly in summer in southern china and thus the stability of spatial dependence deng et al 2019 niu et al 2017 xiao et al 2016 in this regard we examined the spatial dependence of summer rainfalls between 49 gauges under the respective effect of positive enso events by integrating the pccs and f madogram approach fig 4 shows box whisker plots of f madogram estimates of summer maxima precipitation generated by the pccs model during positive enso years the results for negative enso events are given in figures s1 of the supplementary material and the entire period 1961 2019 involved as a reference during positive enso years the spatial dependence is much stronger as compared to that calculated over the entire period by a visual comparison the box whisker f madogram estimates are consistently increasing with longer distance when the distance is less than 400 km while an opposite trend can be found for the range of above 400 km 3 4 concurrence probabilities of extreme precipitation related events and impacted area it is natural to understand that hydrometeorological extremes could affect multiple regions i e multiple gauges of the basin being recorded extreme high or low precipitation events simultaneously the third part of the proposed framework attempts to address this issue see section 2 2 3 by focusing on extreme high summer precipitation events and extreme low winter precipitation events fig 5 displays the spatial patterns of estimated pairwise concurrence probabilities at a randomly selected reference gauge i e conditioned on the occurrence of an extreme event at the gauge for an extreme high precipitation event with the 5 year return period located in the outlet of the entire basin for a given gauge the map shows estimate of the pairwise concurrence probabilities over the rest of gauges it is expected that the gauges near to the reference gauges should have a higher concurrence probability than those separated by longer distances other gauges in the upstream and mountainous areas generally have low concurrence probability the occurrence risk map relies on a reference gauge we thus examine a concurrence matrix which consists of pairwise concurrence probabilities mapped against the distance between pairs of gauges fig 6 in general there is a relatively high possibility for the nearby gauges in the nested basin and the concurrence probability declines with longer distance it might be interesting to know the potential grid areas of concurrence probabilities for all gauges by using the approached introduced in section 2 2 3 it is possible to find impacted areas of the extreme high precipitation events the impacted areas are shown in fig 7 which presents the spatial patterns of concurrence area with pairwise concurrence probability higher than 0 4 over the entire period it is clear to see that the impacted areas of the gauges in the upper pearl river basin is profoundly smaller than the middle and the pearl river delta region of the pearl river basin for the gauges in middle and the plain pearl river delta region impacted areas are generally above 5 104 km2 one can examine the spatial patterns for other concurrence probability thresholds of interest instead of the fixed 0 4 here the spatial pattern could be different if other thresholds are applied in addition to the extreme high precipitation event we also plotted the pairwise concurrence probabilities of the extreme low precipitation event 5 year return level against the distance between pairs of gauges in fig 8 the scatter map of concurrence probabilities of extreme low precipitation events presents a different pattern as compared with those of extreme high precipitation events and much higher pairwise concurrence probabilities can be seen for most distance ranges it should also be mentioned that there are some pairs of gauges for which the concurrence probability is 0 2 irrespective of distance in both figs 6 and 8 this could be a computational issue related to the effect of threshold selections herein we simply selected a fixed threshold to illustrate the applicability of the proposed method which also suggests that one may need test different thresholds for specific applications in order to find a more natural one fig 9 maps the estimated spatial distribution of concurrence area with pairwise concurrence probability higher than a defined threshold i e 0 4 it seems that the extreme low precipitation event may affect much larger areas as compared to the extreme high precipitation event this indicates that widespread area particularly in the middle of the basin could be influenced by the extreme low precipitation events which could also lead to low flows in the rivers deficient moisture in the soil and water stress for vegetation and agriculture 4 discussion and conclusions this study presents a simple framework for assessing the stability of spatial dependence of extreme precipitation and their concurrent probability associated with spatial patterns over the pearl river basin prb by employing the pccs as the baseline model to model multivariate dependencies we first estimated spatial dependence structures of both summer maxima and winter minima precipitation between pairs of scattered gauges within the basin the framework allows for large scale spatial dependence structures to be included by employing the f madogram the validation shows that the spatial dependence generated by the pccs approach is generally consistent with both observed high summer and low winter precipitation in general it is expected that the spatial dependence declines with the increasing distance according to the f madogram analysis we also found that f madogram estimate is around 0 15 for the distance greater than 200 km indicating a relatively strong spatial dependence between gauges even with long distances this can be partially explained by the fact that the spatiotemporal patterns of precipitation over most of the prb is strongly governed by the asian monsoon systems including both summer and winter monsoons ronghui et al 2004 yang et al 2010 zhao et al 2014 the variability in asian monsoon systems will significantly affect the precipitation patterns in the study area for instance the weakened east asian summer monsoon may not beneficial for the moisture transport further to the northern part of china and result in heavier precipitation in south china particularly in the prb ronghui et al 2004 in addition our results regarding the case study area show that the spatial dependence between gauges is quite strong for the summer precipitation during the period 1961 1990 as compared to the period 1991 2019 yet the opposite pattern was identified for the winter minima precipitation meanwhile this framework can examine the stability of spatial dependence of high and low precipitation under the effects of external forcing to illustrate this point we examined how the spatial dependence of summer maxima precipitation alters under the effect of enso which is widely recognized to affect the climate variability in prb moreover extreme precipitation related events often occur over a spatial extent instead of a certain point location it is thus beneficial to make an overall assessment by identifying the concurrent risk of extreme events in surrounding areas the presented framework enables to identify the spatial areas characterized with similar hydrological regimes e g impacted areas of the pearl river basin by taking into account the spatial connections between locations moreover it provides a detailed estimation of impacted domains related to a specific event this joint framework would be a valuable tool to identify possible regions where risk and water managers should adopt to mitigate and prevent the risks of concurrent hydrometeorological events it may have the promising potential to be applied in other basins worldwide the presented framework mainly makes use of the pccs as a baseline technique to model the multivariate dependence over 49 meteorological gauges as the pccs based model is flexible in modelling high dimensional dependence structures bevacqua et al 2017 vernieuwe et al 2015 other alternative multivariate models can be incorporated in this framework to replace the pccs based models for instance the max stable process also received popularity in modeling the spatial dependence because of its flexible structure to reproduce the dependence structure of variables gaume et al 2013 thibaud et al 2013 the main difference is that max stable models describe the marginal distribution and the dependence structure simultaneously while pccs based approach generally models the dependence and margins separately genest and favre 2007 it should be mentioned that the spatial distribution and the density of rainfall gauges have inevitable impact on the accuracy of modelling spatial dependence structures of precipitation for instance the extreme convective storms generally lead to the most intense rainfalls at short time and small spatial scales which may be not well detected by a coarse network of ground gauges existing studies have also documented that sparse gauge density may cause uncertainty in the estimated areal extreme precipitation by comparing different gauge densities and the extreme precipitation could be underestimated with a sparser gauge network in addition to the precipitation events quinn et al 2019 demonstrated that the spatial dependence of flood events was strongly affected by the spatial variations in gauge density given a much denser precipitation gauge network in the prb it could be expected to achieve a better capture of spatial dependence structure of extreme precipitation in the current framework we use the kriging method to obtain the interpolated surface of pairwise concurrence probability many alternatives could be considered e g inverse distance weighting interpolator spline interpolator and cokriging with the involvement of elevation information as a covariate teegavarapu 2007 this could be further explored by extending the applicability of the presented framework credit authorship contribution statement zhiyong liu conceptualization methodology software writing original draft yuying

4217,extreme low and high precipitation can cause natural disasters e g drought and flood events which have devastatingeffects on natural environment and the human society in this study we present a framework for assessing the stability of spatial dependence of extreme precipitation and their concurrence probability in a nested catchment the pearl river basin was used as a case study to test the applicability of the framework this framework is threefold this first part involves modeling spatial dependence of both summer maxima and winter minima precipitation between pairs of scattered gauges over the basin by employing the pair copula constructions as a baseline model the second part of this framework aims to identify the variability of spatial dependence as a result of the effects of external drivers specifically variations in the spatial dependence of extreme precipitation in the pearl river basin over different periods associated with the influence of large scale climate signals were examined the final part quantifies the probability of occurring extreme precipitation related events simultaneously over broader areas related to a specific event at a given gauge and the possible spatial extents being affected the results indicate that the presented framework is able to capture the large scale spatial dependence structures of both summer maxima and winter minima precipitation it also allows for explicitly estimating the pairwise concurrence probability of extreme high and low precipitation events and event impacted areas across the basin keywords dependence stability concurrence probability precipitation nested basin 1 introduction precipitation related disasters such as droughts and floods are common natural phenomena and their co existence poses a threat on natural environment and human society precipitation deficits or droughts are generally associated with the shortage of precipitation causing deficiencies in water supply for human consumption and irrigation in farms and exerting server impacts on ecosystems cauvy fraunié et al 2016 chen et al 2020 khaliq et al 2009 van loon 2015 by contrast extreme high precipitation can lead to high surface runoff and subsequently result in floods that cause significant and immediate impacts on both individuals and communities such as loss of human life and property mass migration destruction of crops and deterioration of health conditions owing to waterborne diseases alderman et al 2012 brunner et al 2018 schaller et al 2016 investigating the variation and pattern of extreme precipitation is thus of particular interest for adequate management of droughts and floods in water resources planning mitigation and insurance industries also advances in water resources management techniques or approaches would provide new tools and ideas for supporting decision making on potential measures which can be taken extreme low and high precipitation generally occurs not only at a single location but also in a broad spatial extent such as the entire or certain parts of nested drainage catchments regional frequency analysis has been widely applied to estimate the probability of widespread extreme events smith et al 2015 a traditional way in regional riskanalysis is to assume that the information from gauged areas of the catchment can be transferred to the entire catchment indicating that the catchment is defined as being broadly homogenous lan et al 2018 merz and blöschl 2008 merz and blöschl 2009 zaman et al 2012 however extreme precipitation related events are heterogeneous in both space and time particularly in the basins with complex orographic terrain there is thus a need to consider the spatial variability of extreme precipitation for better understanding the variation of drought or flood risk across spatial temporal scales to achieve the goal it is important to model the spatial dependence of extreme precipitation over different locations or channel networks of catchments a few studies have made pioneering efforts in this regard for instance several multivariate methods e g the semi parametric conditional exceedance model max stable model hierarchical bayesian models and fisher copula model have been applied to generate synthetic hydrological events mainly floods and model the spatial dependence structure of hydrological extreme events brunner et al 2019 kabluchko et al 2009 ribatet and sedki 2013 segers 2012 a key component of such analysis is to involve the estimation of the spatial dependence of events yet an important question remains unclear whether the spatial dependence structure of these extreme events is stable over time in addition to the regional variation in extreme precipitation external climate factors such as global temperature and large scale climate signals may also play a role in the variability of precipitation some climate signals are widely recognized as an important factor to be related with rainfall and streamflow variations at regional or global scales such as el niño southern oscillation enso emerton et al 2017 mcphaden et al 2006 rice and emanuel 2017 ward et al 2014 it is a periodical ocean and atmospheric phenomenon with significant impacts on global and regional climate in particular the potential connections between enso events and precipitation patterns at the pearl river basin has received considerable concerns in previous studies for instance wei and cai et al 2020 found that enso events may induce large precipitation variations over the pearl river basin based on the reanalysis data set huang et al 2017 documented that enso has remarkable impact on low precipitation at the pearl river basin this triggers another question that is how the spatial dependence structure of precipitation responds to the effect of enso events here we will examine the conditional effect of enso on precipitation spatial dependence within the pearl river basin in addition to examining the stability of spatial dependence of extreme precipitation this study aims to identify the concurrence probability of extreme precipitation related events at different locations and the areal extent of being impacted in other words if an extreme event e g extreme high or low precipitation events had been observed at one gauged site what is the likelihood that nearby gauges or sites locations would record the same extreme event simultaneously furthermore how large is the areal extent being affected by this extreme event whether a specific extreme event will impact the entire or parts of the watershed identification of concurrent probability of extreme precipitation related events and event impacted areas could greatly benefit the hydrological practice e g water resources management and planning mitigation suitable preparation for potential drought flood hazards for this reason we will explore these questions in the current study this study outlines a framework to examine the extreme precipitation in both space and time and their concurrent risk the pearl river basin in southern china is used to illustrate the proposed framework the framework consists of three major components 1 to model the spatial dependence of extreme precipitation e g summer maxima and winter minima precipitation over a nested drainage system by using pair copula construction as a baseline model 2 to explore the variability of spatial dependence of extreme precipitation as a result of the effects of external drivers i e enso 3 to quantify the occurrence probability of extreme precipitation related events over a spatial domain and potential areal extents being affected 2 data and methodology 2 1 data we demonstrate the applicability of the presented framework by using the precipitation data over the period of 1961 2019 for 49 gauges at the nested pearl river basin prb that were obtained from national meteorological information center of the china meteorological administration http data cma cn china surface climatic data daily data set v3 0 fig 1 the pearl river basin 97 39 e 117 18 e 3 41 n 29 15 n has a drainage area of 4 42 105 km2 originating from the yunnan guizhou plateau and flowing into the south china sea the basin is located in the tropical and sub tropical climate zoneswhich is heavily affected by the monsoon climate the basin has a distinct wet season from april to september it accounts for 72 88 of the annual total precipitation between 1000 and 2000 mm higher in the eastern coastal area and lower in the western mountainous areas annual mean temperature varies from 14 to 22 c liu et al 2013 we focus on the maxima precipitation during the summer season june august and the minima precipitation during the winter season december february to represent the high and low precipitation for each gauge over the prb respectively the oceanic niño index oni which is a 3 month running average of sea surface temperature sst over the same region 5 n 5 s 120 w 170 w as the niño 3 4 index is used to define the enso event kousky and higgins 2007 we used the oni data of the period from 1961 to 2019 available at https origin cpc ncep noaa gov products analysis monitoring ensostuff oni v5 php the averaged summer enso values were extracted for examining the effect of external climate signals on spatial dependence of high precipitation between pairs of scattered gauges over the study domain 2 2 framework development in this section we present how to examine the spatial stability of extreme precipitation herein summer maxima and winter minima precipitation in both space and time and concurrent risk with the proposed framework it involves three main components spatial dependence modeling effect of external drivers on the stability of spatial dependence and concurrence probabilities over the impacted area 2 2 1 spatial dependence modeling a multivariate approach is promising to model the spatial dependence structure of extreme precipitation over different gauged locations by considering the complex network structure of a basin such multivariate approaches should have strong mathematical foundations and also be easy for implementation in hydrology a promising approach for modeling extreme precipitation and their dependence structure is the copula function proposed by sklar et al 1959 the copula based models have been mainly applied in the fields including hydrological frequency analysis precipitation prediction and drought identification cheng et al 2019 favre et al 2004 hao and singh 2013 khedun et al 2014 laux et al 2011 li et al 2013a li et al 2013b liu et al 2016 it can be easily extended to simulate the spatial dependence of extreme precipitation events or capture the multivariate nature of these events bárdossy 2006 brunner et al 2019 gräler 2014 liu et al 2016 however regular copula functions have limitations in multivariate modeling at higher dimensions because of parameter restrictions and computationally intensive formulations joe 2014 pair copula constructions pccs were proposed to overcome this drawback aas et al 2009 brechmann et al 2013 the pccs are a hierarchical graphical model that describe multivariate copulas using many bivariate copulas as building blocks which allow to model the multivariate dependencies with high flexibility the basic idea of pccs is to decompose an n dimensional multivariate density into n n 1 2 bivariate copula densities aas et al 2009 min and czado 2010 ren et al 2014 which can model multivariate distributions of any dimension regular pccs include two simple sub classes c vine and d vine here we used the c vine to establish the high dimensional dependence structure of extreme precipitation between pairs of gauges the density of the n dimensional c vine is written as aas et al 2009 1 f x 1 x n k 1 n f k x k i 1 n 1 j 1 n i c i i j 1 i 1 f x i x 1 x i 1 f x i j x 1 x i 1 where f x 1 x n denotes the joint density function of n dimensional random variables herein the variables are the time series of summer maxima and winter minima precipitation at 49 gauges f k x k k 1 n denotes the n marginal densities and c i i j 1 i 1 represents the bivariate copula densities more details about pccs can be found in many existing studies aas et al 2009 bedford and cooke 2002 schepsmeier et al 2015 before constructing the pccs to model in the joint distribution we need to fit a proper marginal probability distribution for each variable in this study three theoretical probability distributions i e gamma lognormal and weibull are involved in comparison and the best fitted theoretical probability distributions is determined according to the chi square goodness of fit test the smallest statistics regarding the construction of high dimensional pccs a variety of potential bivariate copula families examined in the study include gaussian student s t gumbel joe bb1 bb6 bb7 bb8 copulas as well as the corresponding survival copulas rotated by 180 of the clayton gumbel joe bb1 bb6 bb7 and bb8 we determined the best fitted bivariate copula for each pair of variables according to the akaike information criterion the r package vinecopula schepsmeier et al 2015 is used to accomplish this estimation 2 2 2 stability of spatial dependence and the effect of external drivers in geostatistics the variogram approach is commonly used to assess the spatial dependence between variables it represents a spatial and stationary process with a well defined covariance function however this approach is not well adapted to working with extremes and is challenging to interpret inside the framework of extreme value theory instead of the traditional variogram approach the f madogram method which was originally used in the max stable processes is particularly suited for extremes and provides a meaningful measurement to assess the degree of spatial dependence brunner et al 2019 the f madogram as a summary statistic for the spatial dependence structure is defined as follows with h distance 2 υ h 1 2 e f z x h f z x where f z e x p 1 z is the fréchet distribution z x is a stationary process here the original or simulated time series of summer maxima and winter minima precipitation and h is the distance between pairs of meteorological gauges cooley et al 2006 f madogram estimates of the generations of the fitted pccs model were compared with the f madogram estimates of observations between 49 gauges which enables us to quantitatively assess whether the dependence related to the distance between pairs of sites is captured by the pccs model to analyze the time stability of the spatial dependence of both summer maxima and winter minima precipitation we established spatial dependence model for two sub periods and the respective f madogram estimates were calculated the temporal variability of the spatial dependence was then described using box whisker plots the student s t test is used to determine the significance of the difference between the f madogram estimates for each sub period we further explored the variability of spatial dependence of both high rainfall here only summer maxima precipitation is used as an illustration under the effect of enso we define oni values more than one standard deviation above below the long term mean as positive negative enso events as an example we only focus on the effect of enso events on summer maxima precipitation in the prb 2 2 3 pairwise concurrence probabilities and impacted area the third component of the framework is to estimate the pairwise concurrence probabilities related to certain extreme precipitation related events when an extreme high or low precipitation event was recorded at a gauge the pairwise concurrence probability herein refers to the co occurring probability of the same event at other gauges dombry et al 2018 a technical expression is that given n dimensional random variables x 1 x n here the variables are the summer maxima or winter minima precipitation at 49 meteorological gauges we first calculated the corresponding cumulative probability distribution cdf u 1 u n respectively the pairwise concurrence probability at any locations x i i 1 n denoted by u given an extreme event recorded at a certain location x j j 1 n a n d j m denoted by v can be written for extreme high events summer maxima precipitation as 3 pr u u i v u j c u i u j 1 u j regarding extreme low events for winter minima precipitation the pairwise concurrence probability is given as 4 pr u u i v u j c u i u j u j here the c is the joint survival function aghakouchak et al 2014 c 1 u i u j c u i u j c indicates the bivariate copula again a variety of potential bivariate copula families used in the study include gaussian student s t gumbel joe bb1 bb6 bb7 bb8 copulas as well as the corresponding survival copulas rotated by 180 of the clayton gumbel joe bb1 bb6 bb7 and bb8 we achieved best fitted one using the bicopselect function in r program generally an event could be deemed extreme or dangerous if the variable is above or below a defined threshold salvadori and de michele 2004 as an illustration we use the 0 8 and 0 2 quantile threshold of summer maxima and winter minima precipitation respectively to define extreme low winter precipitation events u winter 0 2 and extreme high summer precipitation events in summer u summer 0 8 respectively i e the extreme events with a 5 year return level but note that any thresholds of interest could be examined based on the above pairwise concurrence probability expressions however the above approach can only estimate the bivariate concurrence probability centered at a given location our objective is to plot a map showing the concurrence probability at other gauges around the centered one regarding the same event one thus needs to apply the bivariate approach for every choice of a centered location another question is to estimate the areal extent subjective to the concurrence probability in the neighborhood of the centered conditioned gauges to achieve this we provide a simple method which allows to interpolate the pointwise bivariate concurrence probability map at a given location to a spatial surface i e within the domain of the basin this is based on an interpolation method the kriging method used with that we can calculate the area of grids with bivariate concurrence probability above a pre defined threshold e g 0 4 consequently we could obtain the spatial patterns of impacted area under that concurrence probability with the copula based approach we are able to plot pairwise concurrence probabilities as a function of distance between pairs of gauges in this regard it is possible to illustrate the general patterns about how the concurrence probability varies among different distance sections the analysis of spatial correlations between rainfall gauges against distance may also present similar patterns ha et al 2007 mandapaka and qin 2013 which however indicates the strength of association between rainfall gauges and the direction of the relationship instead of the pairwise concurrence probability related to certain extreme precipitation related events moreover the copula based concurrence probabilities enable to further estimate spatial patterns of impacted area for certain concurrence probabilities as mentioned above 3 results 3 1 spatial dependence structure identification and validation the modeling of spatial dependence of summer maxima or winter minima precipitation between the scattered gauges of the prb starts with modeling the marginal distributions for each station here we considered a set of copula functions to construct the 49 demensional pccs model according to the aic value as mentioned in the methodology section once the dependence model is determined we are able to generate random samples of pseudo characteristics that need to be back transformed to the real space with each individual marginal distribution fig 2 indicates the comparison of the f madogram estimates from the fitted pccs model against the observations between 49 gauges which enables us to quantitatively assess the dependence determined by the distance between pairs of sites for both summer maxima and winter minima precipitation over the period 1961 2019 to test the agreement of simulated samples with the observed ones the student t test was performed the null hypothesis of student t test is no effective difference between the means of observations and simulations as presented the random generations with respect to individual site provide good coverage of the observations including the pairs of sites with quite long distances according to the student t test the p values for both summer maxima p value 0 4576 and winter minima precipitation p value 0 2608 are greater than a pre defined significance level of α α 0 05 which indicates the observations and simulations are largely consistent the greater f madogram estimates indicate weaker spatial dependence since the spatial dependence declines with the increasing distance this in turn reflects that the presented model is able to characterize the realistic spatial dependence between gauges in the domain the robustness of the approach enables us to make a further detection of the stability of spatial dependence for both summer and winter rainfalls between gauges 3 2 the stability of spatial dependence over time we applied the similar procedure to examine the spatial dependence of summer maxima precipitation and the stability or variation of the dependence over time again simulations of summer maxima precipitation for each site have been generated over two sub periods 1961 1990 and 1991 2019 the f madogram estimates were computed for simulations of the pccs model over the two sub periods between pairs of sites to illustrate the spatial dependence structure we classified the distance into three categories the distribution of these f madogram estimates was then displayed via box whisker plots in fig 3 a and the variations between sub periods were tested using the student s t test it is clear to see the spatial dependence structure is quite unstable over the two sub periods for different distance categories according to the median values of the box whisker plots the spatial dependence seems to be much stronger indicated by the smaller f madogram estimates in the first sub period with less anthropogenic impacts compared to the second period for all distance categories specifically in the category of 0 200 km there was a nonsignificant increase in f madogram estimates between periods of 1961 1990 and 1991 2019 while the f madogram estimates show a significant increasing trend in the second sub period regarding the category of 200 400 km such pattern can also be found for longer distances fig 3a with greater f madogram estimates in addition to the stability of spatial dependence of summer maxima precipitation one may also be interested in the variation in the winter minima precipitation fig 3b maps similar diagnosis but for the winter minima precipitation in the prb as seen the magnitudes in identifying the spatial dependence vary significantly over different distance ranges and sub periods a different pattern can be identified when compared to the box whisker plots of the summer maxima precipitation the spatial dependence of winter minima precipitation between pairs of sites is much stronger indicated by the smaller f madogram estimates compared to that of summer in detail for the distance category of 0 200 km the f madogram estimates show a significant decreasing trend in the second period comparing with the first period such shifts in the box whisker shapes between sub periods can also be found in the distance category above 400 km while the change is not that pronounced in distance of 200 400 km compared to other distances but the distribution of f madogram estimates in the second period is much lower than that in the first period this indicates in the second sub period the spatial dependence of winter minima precipitation between pairs of sites is generally more stable than the first period in the wintertime for most distance ranges the declining trend in the spatial dependence of summer precipitation could be partially related to the impact of climate change in the context of global warming extreme precipitation events are becoming more concentrated in the prb which likely lead to less spatial dependence in summer 3 3 the effect of external drivers on the spatial dependence the proposed framework allows to provide insights on how the external factors affect the spatial dependence of precipitation between pairs of gauges to illustrate this applicability we take the positive enso events as an example large scale climate signals have been widely reported with strong effect on the climate variations particularly in summer in southern china and thus the stability of spatial dependence deng et al 2019 niu et al 2017 xiao et al 2016 in this regard we examined the spatial dependence of summer rainfalls between 49 gauges under the respective effect of positive enso events by integrating the pccs and f madogram approach fig 4 shows box whisker plots of f madogram estimates of summer maxima precipitation generated by the pccs model during positive enso years the results for negative enso events are given in figures s1 of the supplementary material and the entire period 1961 2019 involved as a reference during positive enso years the spatial dependence is much stronger as compared to that calculated over the entire period by a visual comparison the box whisker f madogram estimates are consistently increasing with longer distance when the distance is less than 400 km while an opposite trend can be found for the range of above 400 km 3 4 concurrence probabilities of extreme precipitation related events and impacted area it is natural to understand that hydrometeorological extremes could affect multiple regions i e multiple gauges of the basin being recorded extreme high or low precipitation events simultaneously the third part of the proposed framework attempts to address this issue see section 2 2 3 by focusing on extreme high summer precipitation events and extreme low winter precipitation events fig 5 displays the spatial patterns of estimated pairwise concurrence probabilities at a randomly selected reference gauge i e conditioned on the occurrence of an extreme event at the gauge for an extreme high precipitation event with the 5 year return period located in the outlet of the entire basin for a given gauge the map shows estimate of the pairwise concurrence probabilities over the rest of gauges it is expected that the gauges near to the reference gauges should have a higher concurrence probability than those separated by longer distances other gauges in the upstream and mountainous areas generally have low concurrence probability the occurrence risk map relies on a reference gauge we thus examine a concurrence matrix which consists of pairwise concurrence probabilities mapped against the distance between pairs of gauges fig 6 in general there is a relatively high possibility for the nearby gauges in the nested basin and the concurrence probability declines with longer distance it might be interesting to know the potential grid areas of concurrence probabilities for all gauges by using the approached introduced in section 2 2 3 it is possible to find impacted areas of the extreme high precipitation events the impacted areas are shown in fig 7 which presents the spatial patterns of concurrence area with pairwise concurrence probability higher than 0 4 over the entire period it is clear to see that the impacted areas of the gauges in the upper pearl river basin is profoundly smaller than the middle and the pearl river delta region of the pearl river basin for the gauges in middle and the plain pearl river delta region impacted areas are generally above 5 104 km2 one can examine the spatial patterns for other concurrence probability thresholds of interest instead of the fixed 0 4 here the spatial pattern could be different if other thresholds are applied in addition to the extreme high precipitation event we also plotted the pairwise concurrence probabilities of the extreme low precipitation event 5 year return level against the distance between pairs of gauges in fig 8 the scatter map of concurrence probabilities of extreme low precipitation events presents a different pattern as compared with those of extreme high precipitation events and much higher pairwise concurrence probabilities can be seen for most distance ranges it should also be mentioned that there are some pairs of gauges for which the concurrence probability is 0 2 irrespective of distance in both figs 6 and 8 this could be a computational issue related to the effect of threshold selections herein we simply selected a fixed threshold to illustrate the applicability of the proposed method which also suggests that one may need test different thresholds for specific applications in order to find a more natural one fig 9 maps the estimated spatial distribution of concurrence area with pairwise concurrence probability higher than a defined threshold i e 0 4 it seems that the extreme low precipitation event may affect much larger areas as compared to the extreme high precipitation event this indicates that widespread area particularly in the middle of the basin could be influenced by the extreme low precipitation events which could also lead to low flows in the rivers deficient moisture in the soil and water stress for vegetation and agriculture 4 discussion and conclusions this study presents a simple framework for assessing the stability of spatial dependence of extreme precipitation and their concurrent probability associated with spatial patterns over the pearl river basin prb by employing the pccs as the baseline model to model multivariate dependencies we first estimated spatial dependence structures of both summer maxima and winter minima precipitation between pairs of scattered gauges within the basin the framework allows for large scale spatial dependence structures to be included by employing the f madogram the validation shows that the spatial dependence generated by the pccs approach is generally consistent with both observed high summer and low winter precipitation in general it is expected that the spatial dependence declines with the increasing distance according to the f madogram analysis we also found that f madogram estimate is around 0 15 for the distance greater than 200 km indicating a relatively strong spatial dependence between gauges even with long distances this can be partially explained by the fact that the spatiotemporal patterns of precipitation over most of the prb is strongly governed by the asian monsoon systems including both summer and winter monsoons ronghui et al 2004 yang et al 2010 zhao et al 2014 the variability in asian monsoon systems will significantly affect the precipitation patterns in the study area for instance the weakened east asian summer monsoon may not beneficial for the moisture transport further to the northern part of china and result in heavier precipitation in south china particularly in the prb ronghui et al 2004 in addition our results regarding the case study area show that the spatial dependence between gauges is quite strong for the summer precipitation during the period 1961 1990 as compared to the period 1991 2019 yet the opposite pattern was identified for the winter minima precipitation meanwhile this framework can examine the stability of spatial dependence of high and low precipitation under the effects of external forcing to illustrate this point we examined how the spatial dependence of summer maxima precipitation alters under the effect of enso which is widely recognized to affect the climate variability in prb moreover extreme precipitation related events often occur over a spatial extent instead of a certain point location it is thus beneficial to make an overall assessment by identifying the concurrent risk of extreme events in surrounding areas the presented framework enables to identify the spatial areas characterized with similar hydrological regimes e g impacted areas of the pearl river basin by taking into account the spatial connections between locations moreover it provides a detailed estimation of impacted domains related to a specific event this joint framework would be a valuable tool to identify possible regions where risk and water managers should adopt to mitigate and prevent the risks of concurrent hydrometeorological events it may have the promising potential to be applied in other basins worldwide the presented framework mainly makes use of the pccs as a baseline technique to model the multivariate dependence over 49 meteorological gauges as the pccs based model is flexible in modelling high dimensional dependence structures bevacqua et al 2017 vernieuwe et al 2015 other alternative multivariate models can be incorporated in this framework to replace the pccs based models for instance the max stable process also received popularity in modeling the spatial dependence because of its flexible structure to reproduce the dependence structure of variables gaume et al 2013 thibaud et al 2013 the main difference is that max stable models describe the marginal distribution and the dependence structure simultaneously while pccs based approach generally models the dependence and margins separately genest and favre 2007 it should be mentioned that the spatial distribution and the density of rainfall gauges have inevitable impact on the accuracy of modelling spatial dependence structures of precipitation for instance the extreme convective storms generally lead to the most intense rainfalls at short time and small spatial scales which may be not well detected by a coarse network of ground gauges existing studies have also documented that sparse gauge density may cause uncertainty in the estimated areal extreme precipitation by comparing different gauge densities and the extreme precipitation could be underestimated with a sparser gauge network in addition to the precipitation events quinn et al 2019 demonstrated that the spatial dependence of flood events was strongly affected by the spatial variations in gauge density given a much denser precipitation gauge network in the prb it could be expected to achieve a better capture of spatial dependence structure of extreme precipitation in the current framework we use the kriging method to obtain the interpolated surface of pairwise concurrence probability many alternatives could be considered e g inverse distance weighting interpolator spline interpolator and cokriging with the involvement of elevation information as a covariate teegavarapu 2007 this could be further explored by extending the applicability of the presented framework credit authorship contribution statement zhiyong liu conceptualization methodology software writing original draft yuying

4218,the budyko curve relating a catchment s water and energy balance provides a useful tool to analyse how physio climatic and socio economic characteristics may impact long term runoff often a parametric form of the curve the tixeront fu s equation is used to represent the catchment s long term water partitioning behaviour tixeront fu s parameter ω typically derived from observed climate and runoff data can further be related to catchments physio climatic characteristics to enable understanding the main drivers of their water balance at times prior analyses have reported potentially conflicting controls of characteristics on ω based on the rationale that several hydrological processes act across varying spatio temporal scales we hypothesize that the impact of a physio climatic factor on ω is driven by its broader regional setting we test our hypothesis by developing relationships between ω and a curated database of 33 physio climatic and socio economic characteristics for 520 regional divisions of india we employ two related data space splitting algorithms classification and regression trees cart and random forest rf to study the effects of potential controlling factors within their regional context the algorithms diagnose a hierarchy of representative vegetation climate soil land use land cover topography and anthropogenic controls the most important characteristics controlling ω were found to be correlation between monthly time series of p and pet long term temperature long term precipitation and the synchronicity of p and pet human influences quantified in terms of population density and the extent of cultivated area were found to be important factors influencing sub regional scale hydrological processes these anthropogenic factors displayed predictive importance similar to vegetation and topographic factors our results indicate the dominant influence of climate and its seasonality on long term water partitioning across indian landmasses with landscape features including human influences playing a secondary but important role keywords budyko india tixeront fu s parameter classification and regression trees random forest human impact 1 introduction the budyko 1958 1974 framework provides a simple conceptual approach to quantify regional long term water balance donohue et al 2007 greve et al 2015 padrón et al 2017 porporato et al 2004 it is based on the premise that long term actual evapotranspiration aet is governed by a trade off between available energy often represented by mean annual potential evapotranspiration pet and available water mean annual precipitation p pet is often calculated from mean annual temperature t and other climatic variables the budyko curve maintains a firm physical basis and has a comparatively simple formulation relating a catchment s long term evaporative ratio aet p to its aridity index pet p fig 1 this has resulted in its application to a variety of analyses ranging from diagnosis to prediction of surface water partitioning at regional to global scales donohue et al 2007 gunkel and lange 2017 li et al 2013 padrón et al 2017 wang and hejazi 2011 xing et al 2018 it has also been used to calibrate or validate more complex hydrologic models when studying the impact of climate change on hydrology greve et al 2020 singh and kumar 2019 budyko s original non parametric relationship has been found to be applicable only over large temporal and spatial scales 1 year 10 000 km2 donohue et al 2007 several studies noted that catchments often deviated from the original budyko curve and inclusion of additional physio climatic factors in the framework could improve predictability donohue et al 2007 milly 1994 porporato et al 2004 potter et al 2005 thus budyko based parametric relationships were developed choudhury 1999 fu 1981 porporato et al 2004 tixeront 1964 wang and tang 2014 yang et al 2008 zhang et al 2001 notable among these is the tixeront fu fu 1981 tixeront 1964 equation that has found widespread application equation 1 greve et al 2020 li et al 2013 shao et al 2012 singh and kumar 2019 xu et al 2013 yang et al 2007 the adjustable parameter ω in this equation cumulates the net effects of all additional factors affecting the long term energy and water partitioning of catchments 1 aet p 1 p e t p 1 pet p ω 1 ω analysing the effect of various physio climatic factors on ω has revealed interesting insights into dominant hydrological processes determining catchment response fig 1 li et al 2013 shao et al 2012 xu et al 2013 yang et al 2007 zhang et al 2004 calibrated ω values have been frequently associated with climatic jiang et al 2015 milly 1994 padrón et al 2017 williams et al 2012 vegetation li et al 2013 milly 1994 sinha et al 2019 williams et al 2012 xu et al 2013 zhang et al 2004 topographic choudhury 1999 sinha et al 2019 xu et al 2013 yang et al 2007 zhang et al 2004 and soil bai et al 2020 feng et al 2012 padrón et al 2017 yang et al 2007 characteristics this indicates that a variety of processes acting across spatio temporal scales can impact the long term water partitioning a detailed description of different factors controlling ω in literature and their observed effects is provided in section 1 1 although a substantial amount of work focuses on understanding the impact of natural hydrological processes fewer studies have considered the role of anthropogenic drivers jiang et al 2015 padrón et al 2017 wang and hejazi 2011 xing et al 2018 zhang et al 2019 anthropogenic activities modify surface water balance either through direct alterations or by causing changes in hydro climatic variables wang and hejazi 2011 direct effects of human activities may manifest due to land use change gao et al 2016 schilling et al 2010 xing et al 2018 dam construction rossi et al 2009 irrigation jiang et al 2015 etc most analyses apply a comparative hydrology perspective to understand the factors affecting ω across a large number of catchments this approach allows the consideration of several physio climatic and human factors and their relative importance can be determined prior efforts in relating ω to physio climatic factors have revealed conflicting results related to factor influence and importance a higher frequency of precipitation events has been associated with both larger and smaller ω values feng et al 2012 padrón et al 2017 feng et al 2012 noted that this reduced ω and hence aet by saturating soil and promoting runoff q in wetter climates with precipitation seasonality on the other hand padrón et al 2017 suggested that frequent precipitation events promoted aet in arid regions by satisfying greater evaporative demands similarly while some studies have related out of phase seasonal cycles of p and pet to lower ω values due to greater accumulation of precipitation causing runoff feng et al 2012 shao et al 2012 observations by potter et al 2005 indicated the contrary they observed that in phase p and pet cycles led to smaller ω values through an infiltration excess runoff mechanism studies into the comparative effects of tree and grass cover have also yielded interesting results zhang et al 2004 noted higher ω values in forested catchments compared to predominantly grassed catchments ascribed to trees with deeper roots exploiting water at greater depths during dry seasons however williams et al 2012 found comparatively greater evaporative ratios from grass than trees attributed to its less conservative use of water in mesic environments a larger basin size has also been found to influence ω negatively by some but insignificant in controlling ω by others choudhury 1999 padrón et al 2017 xu et al 2013 yang et al 2007 while seemingly contradictory these inconsistencies are likely a result of multiple interacting hydrological processes acting across varying spatial scales compensatory effects between interacting factors use of non representative data samples and regional variations in dominant controls have been identified as possible reasons behind contradictions bai et al 2020 feng et al 2012 padrón et al 2017 sinha et al 2019 xing et al 2018 xu et al 2013 zhang et al 2004 to deal with regional variations in governing factors explicitly grouping catchments based on climate types padrón et al 2017 or bio geographic classes sinha et al 2019 prior to data analysis has been proposed however this involves a subjective step of identifying relevant variables to group the catchments in this study we propose a methodology to identify factors that affect ω along with their nested regional controls our proposed method aims to address two recurring issues in prior analyses first the need for a consistent data based approach to estimate the degree of influence that various factors exert on ω without requiring any subjective prior grouping of catchments the method should be able to identify the hierarchy of dominant controls automatically along with any regional differences in factor importance second factors that may have compensatory influence on ω should be explicitly recognized we achieve this by employing algorithms capable of recognizing conditional controls classification and regression tree cart and random forest rf we use these algorithms to disentangle the effects of vegetation climate soil topography and anthropogenic factors on ω across more than 500 regions across india cart presents its results in an interactive visual format allowing the interpretation of hierarchical controls on ω using this method we test the following hypotheses 1 anthropogenic factors have a dominant influence on ω across india and 2 factor influences on ω are dictated by the broader physio climatic setting resulting in a nesting of dominant controls 1 1 factors influencing tixeront fu s ω a review factors affecting ω in literature have been divided into two broad groups climate based and landscape based controls padrón et al 2017 climate based factors represent those that the aridity index does not capture such as rainfall seasonality landscape controls represent all other factors such as vegetation topography human and geology climate based factors such as average storm depth asd and storm arrival rate sar may affect partitioning as heavier and more frequent storms may promote runoff milly 1994 studies have shown that the nature of influence on ω is generally dependent upon the regional context seasonality has also been found to be a significant predictor bai et al 2020 de lavenne andréassian 2018 padrón et al 2017 xing et al 2018 de lavenne and andréassian 2018 successfully parameterized three forms of the budyko curve using an index which captured the synchronicity of p and pet si padrón et al 2017 showed that the relative amplitude of the seasonal cycle of p seasp led to greater runoff in warm temperate climates the effect of the phase difference between seasonal cycles of p and pet has been quantified in terms of the phase shift of the seasonal cycle of p and pet pspandpet maximum accumulation of monthly surplus mams and seasonal surplus index ssi padrón et al 2017 williams et al 2012 finally p and t also influence ω via a multitude of mechanisms in addition to directly influencing pet q and aet jiang et al 2015 padrón et al 2017 the effect of vegetation on ω have been explored using factors such as normalized difference vegetation index ndvi plant extractable soil water capacity peswc tree cover and grass cover most studies suggest that ndvi promoted aet thus increasing ω li et al 2013 sinha et al 2019 xu et al 2013 however bai et al 2020 observed that in small sized chinese basins the patterns may be different in part due to relatively complex hydrological response of smaller basins and also regionally different landscape and climate characteristics of studied catchments shao et al 2012 found that a greater tree cover promoted aet while padrón et al 2017 noted greater associated runoff in snow climates attributing this inconsistency to cross correlations with slope padrón et al 2017 observed a positive effect of grass cover on ω in arid and warm temperate climates peswc which considers both plant and soil characteristics has been found to conditionally promote aet feng et al 2012 milly 1994 padrón et al 2017 yang et al 2007 zhang et al 2001 zhang et al 2004 feng et al 2012 found that greater peswc promoted aet in drier regions which had seasonal precipitation cycles aet in similar seasonal but wetter climates was unaffected by greater peswc in such regions saturation of soil led to greater runoff despite the increased storage topographic factors like catchment slope size aspect and elevation have been also been proposed as likely influencers on ω absolute mean slope padrón et al 2017 xu et al 2013 tangent of the mean slope yang et al 2007 and relief ratio shao et al 2012 have shown negative correlation with ω padrón et al 2017 report a distinct impact of slope aspect on ω but xu et al 2013 found aspect to be insignificant in their analysis of catchments across india sinha et al 2019 observed that average watershed elevation was a significant driver of ω in during low ndvi periods 2 materials and methods we test the hypotheses proposed in section 1 by developing classification and regression tree cart and random forest rf based ω prediction models employing these data mining algorithms allows us to identify a hierarchy of factors controlling ω this is by virtue of both algorithms generating decision tree based outputs decision trees can capture non linear and non monotonic influences of coupled factors that are not evident from correlation or multiple linear regression based analyses our approach thus incorporates recommendations made by padrón et al 2017 with regard to accounting for ω s possible non monotonic relationship with its controls rfs have demonstrated better performance when compared to linear regression in applications related to bio informatics li et al 2014 remote sensing noi et al 2017 hydrogeology ouedraogo et al 2019 to name a few while their inferences depend upon the nature of the input datasets cart and rfs also allow a better understanding of underlying factors controlling the response variable we interpret the generated cart and rf outputs to identify factors prominently controlling ω 2 1 methodology we follow a comparative hydrology approach by analysing the possible factors governing ω across a spatial gradient we begin by applying equation 1 to estimate ω values for each indian landmass using long term averaged values of historically observed p pet and aet values for a common time window fig 2 these ω values are categorized into various classes as described in section 2 1 1 we also identify a list of governing factors from literature using the procedure in section 2 1 2 then cart and rf algorithms are trained on this dataset of predictor and response variables sections 2 1 3 and 2 1 4 we interpret the trained model outputs from cart to infer dominant factors controlling ω classification the rf algorithm on the other hand provides a ranking of factors that are important in predicting ω classes section 2 1 5 we also assess the sensitivity of algorithmic outputs to the choice of ω class definitions 2 1 1 categorization of tixeront fu s ω considerable uncertainty may exist in calibrated ω estimates as a consequence of using hydro climatic records of limited temporal length guo et al 2019 these uncertainties could lead to significant errors in water availability estimates especially in transitional climates having aridity indices close to unity greve et al 2015 gudmundsson et al 2016 furthermore additional uncertainties may be introduced by using a satellite based aet product for ω calibration to account for uncertainties in calibrated ω estimates and to prevent fitting data mining algorithms to marginal errors we divide calibrated ω into classes based on their values following a quantile based classification approach we explore 10 different ω class definitions that vary the number of classes from 2 to 11 for example class definition 1 divides ω into two classes based on the median value the goal is to develop a flexible framework that can explore possible controls on ω while accounting for uncertainties 2 1 2 identification of representative factors we determined possible factors that may affect ω based on past literature while also including additional factors that have emerged in recent literature or are based on the authors judgement table 1 and section 1 1 we consider all the factors considered by padrón et al 2017 except compound topographic index due to the different scale of analysis adopted to account for soil moisture storage and texture we define factors directly dependent on soil composition we surmise that soil composition is likely to play a crucial role in both moisture storage and infiltration thereby controlling the partitioning of surface water into runoff and evapotranspiration soil promoting infiltration making greater quantities of water available to plants may cause greater evapotranspiration considering the role of soil properties while developing hydrological models has also been advocated in literature nayak et al 2007 though soil related properties such as relative infiltration capacity yang et al 2007 soil moisture padron et al 2017 saturated hydraulic conductivity k bai et al 2020 have been suggested in the past these factors do not adequately represent the relative composition of sand silt and clay we hypothesize that including the ratio of sand and clay to silt provides additional information regarding water partitioning particularly when considering a large dataset where comparative values are of more interest than the absolute compositions secondly we speculate that greater average monsoon precipitation intensity may promote infiltration excess runoff and consider it a potential controlling factor we also employ the non parametric sychronicity index si proposed by de lavenne and andréassian 2018 table 1 defines all factors considered for analysis note that previous studies caution against associating tixeront fu s parameter directly with multiple factors if they may have underlying cross correlations padrón et al 2017 we employ a correlation analysis to select representative factors from the developed dataset of literature based potential ω governing factors to prevent misidentification and removal of important predictors we identify correlations between factor within specific categories such as climate topography anthropogenic etc we calculate pearson s correlation coefficients between all potential factors within individual categories of table 1 following this we eliminate internally correlated factors assuming that shortlisted factors are adequately capable of representing excluded factors while eliminating correlated factors we prefer easily obtainable ones wherever possible 2 1 3 classification and regression trees to study hierarchical controls cart is an algorithm based on recursive binary splitting of a data space into mutually exclusive subspaces each corresponding to a predicted output de ath and fabricius 2000 splits are defined by logical expressions regarding input explanatory variables and results can be presented graphically in the form of a decision tree cart s easy visual interpretability and its ability to identify conditional controls make it ideal for diagnostic studies in our analysis ω is the predicted output and different physio climatic factors constitute the explanatory variables we apply cart in classification mode i e we categorize ω into classes low medium high very high the input to cart includes a table of ω classes and corresponding factor values cart outputs a hierarchy of factors as well as quantifies the range of values of each factor that lead to a certain class of ω values classification imperfections can also be accounted for by computing the probabilities of all classes at each split singh et al 2014 recursive splits could lead to overlarge trees as the algorithm starts fitting outliers these large trees are generally pruned using v fold cross validation breiman et al 1984 this implies the division of the data into v exclusive subsets followed by the construction of v trees iteratively using v 1 subsets for training and the excluded subsets for testing prediction error estimates computed for each excluded subset are recorded to facilitate best tree selection the tree having the least error is selected as the best tree increasing splits typically reduces classification training error relative error for the best tree but could also lead to overfitting in the remaining trees mean cross validated errors calculated across the remaining trees serve as indicators of overfitting these can be used in combination with their respective standard deviations to prune the best tree appropriately we use r s rpart package therneau and atkinson 2010 along with ten fold cross validation to develop pruned cart trees predicting ω classes trees are pruned based on the 1 se rule suggested by breiman et al 1984 to obtain optimal sized trees without overfitting according to this rule we choose the number of splits such that the corresponding mean cross validated error xerror is within one standard error xstd of the lowest mean cross validated error i e xerror min xerror xstd we use circos plots generated using the online tool provided on http mkweb bcgsc ca tableviewer visualize to enable simultaneous visualization of different cart trees this is done to test the sensitivity of ω class definition on observed results 2 1 4 random forests for ω class prediction random forests rf attempt to resolve a noted cart limitation of being highly susceptible to changes in training data using an ensemble of trees de ath and fabricius 2000 trees are grown using bootstrapped samples of the original data and each split in these trees is based on a randomly picked predictor subset díaz uriarte and de andres 2006 bootstrapping attempts to reduce uncertainties by generating samples through intensive resampling with replacement kant et al 2013 using random predictor subsets to determine each split allows moderately strong predictors to demonstrate their effect in case of few very strong predictors in the dataset results are obtained by aggregating outputs of all trees by either choosing the most voted class for classification or taking an algebraic average for regression breiman 2001 james et al 2013 the optimal number of trees required and the ideal number of predictors needed for determining each split are obtained minimizing out of bag oob errors these are computed over the roughly 1 3rd samples left out as a consequence of bootstrapping biau and scornet 2016 using a combination of bootstrapping and aggregation bagging makes the random forest algorithm a highly flexible supervised learning algorithm james et al 2013 we develop a random forest in classification mode with a 70 30 ratio for model training and testing using the r package randomforest liaw and wiener 2002 the number of trees grown were fixed at 1000 while the model was optimized to identify the number of factors to be used for each split 2 1 5 using cart and rf to identify dominant and important controls on ω here we quantify the relative influence of a factor on ω classes in two ways factor dominance is provided by cart output and factor s predictive importance is identified by rf as mentioned earlier cart provides a tree like output starting with a single node where a factor and its threshold value divide the data into two groups this process is iterated with each of the grouped data as we traverse additional nodes of the tree the algorithm is such that the factor that provides the most information gain quantified as the distance between groupings of the response variable appears first in the tree thus the position of a factor in the cart output is indicative of its relative importance in categorizing the response variable into distinct groups this is inferred as its dominance in this study note also that the value of a factor located at a higher tree level influences subsequent factors controlling the response variable ω classes in this case we define a factor s predictive importance by ranking factors based on their contribution to rf prediction accuracy to this end we employ the permutation variable importance approach hastie et al 2009 strobl et al 2007 the rationale behind this approach is that permuting a predictor while leaving all the other predictors intact breaks predictor outcome association strobl et al 2007 thus larger average deviations in errors before and after permuting a predictor in the oob sample implies greater importance of said predictor the randomforest package we employ computes permutation factor importance in the form of scaled mean decrease in accuracy scaling is done by normalizing the mean error differences post permutation by the standard deviation of these differences liaw et al 2015 note that cart based dominance and rf based predictive importance highlight fundamentally different information predictive importance quantifies the increase in error caused by randomly shuffling a particular factor s values hence this error acts as a proxy for overall importance of a factor across all levels of all 1000 trees generated by the rf algorithm on the other hand dominance interpreted from the cart based circos plot relates to the level generally occupied by a factor across all trees considered 2 2 data sources we performed the analysis on an all india dataset constituted of 637 administrative units a majority of which 94 have areas larger than 1000 km2 daily gridded precipitation and temperature data was obtained from india meteorological department pune gridded precipitation temperature data was available at a spatial resolution of 1 x 1 1 x 1 for the time period 1901 2015 1951 2013 gridded pet values were estimated using hargreaves and samani s 1985 temperature based method the ω values for each region were calibrated based on a satellite based aet product produced by zhang et al 2010 for the time period 1983 2000 after considering availability of p pet and aet data it is worth mentioning that the aet product we employ has been recently validated against ground based observations of streamflow from india wris for the indian subcontinent by sinha et al 2019 noting a significant strong relationship between the aet product and aet calculated by subtracting observed discharge from observed precipitation r 0 62 p 0 01 they justify the use of said aet product the same aet product has also been applied for calibrating tixeront fu s parameter by xu et al 2013 and sinha et al 2019 the physio climatic and anthropogenic factors for each region were determined using data sources detailed in table 2 we consider 520 regions for further analysis excluding regions which violate physical constraints on water and energy availability i e have aet p or aet pet and regions with unavailable data for landmasses where daily temperature data was unavailable for 10 days temperature and pet values were linearly interpolated over time using observations of preceding and succeeding days such landmasses have been highlighted in this paper s associated dataset vora and singh 2021 3 results and discussion 3 1 identifying representative physio climatic and anthropogenic factors we found that 16 of the 33 initially identified potential influencing factors could justifiably represent all remaining factors using a correlation driven intra and inter category factor selection process supplementary information figures s1 s6 table 3 details the intra category correlations and final choice of representative factors notably a majority of the correlations identified explain similar characteristics for example we find a strong correlation between ndvi and percentage tree cover table 3 group 5 ndvi was favoured as it is easily quantifiable and has been calculated as a long term temporal average similarly within the anthropogenic category we select a representative characteristic from irrigated agriculture and cultivated area we chose pspandpet from group 2 as it directly quantifies the temporal difference between energy and water availability surface slope may directly influence runoff and hence slopetan was chosen from group 6 inter category correlation analysis between shortlisted factors from all categories revealed significant correlations between slopetan organicavg map and ndvi appreciable vegetation cover can be a cause and effect of greater precipitation justifying the correlation between map and ndvi additionally greater vegetation may also be the cause for higher soil organic content considering these arguments we eliminate ndvi and organicave in favour of map for the subsequent analysis we preferred map due to its relatively easy availability even in ungauged regions fig 3 displays a correlation matrix of the final shortlisted factors for cart and random forest analysis we note that although cultivated was correlated with slopetan and shortrooted a justifiable reason to eliminate one in favour of the other was not found the correlation between mat and slopetan supplementary information figure s7 may also be only a regionally valid correlation hence none of the aforementioned factors were disregarded 3 2 performance evaluation of cart and rf models the parameter ω displays significant spatial variation with a median of 1 49 and inter quartile range of 0 30 fig 4 we employ a split sample test to check the performance of ω calibration we calibrated ω on long term hydro climatic means for 1983 1993 and used these calibrated values to predict long term aet for 1994 2000 for each landmass our results indicate a reasonable performance of this calibration in the validation period with a 5 1 median prediction bias of aet across all landmasses considered the inter quartile range of the prediction bias was 6 3 the ω values calibrated for the total available record were then divided into different number of classes 2 to 11 using appropriate quantiles as class boundaries supplementary information table s1 cart and rf models developed using the ten quantile based class definitions are further tested on their ability to reproduce aet across different landmasses table 4 to predict aet using cart or rf the mean of the predicted class s bounding ω values is substituted in eq 1 for cart the increase in root mean square error rmse after tree number 5 suggests that further categorization may lead to overfitting as well as reduction in ω class prediction accuracy table 4 hence we use cart tree number 5 to draw major inferences regarding hierarchical controls on ω rf models invariably outperform cart models and continually show improvements in aet prediction performance with increasing number of classes however performance improvements plateau after rf number 5 when considering both rmse and percent bias aet prediction accuracy improves despite a reduction in classification accuracy with increasing number of classes as the classification errors are typically constrained within one adjacent class of the observed class supplementary information figures s8 s17 all developed cart and rf models are analysed to evaluate the robustness of our conclusions 3 3 hierarchical controls on surface water partitioning employing cart to discover relationship between shortlisted factors and ω highlighted that vegetation cover followed by climate and soil dominantly influence ω fig 5 factors representing vegetation shortrooted climate along with its seasonality mat map si and pspandpet and soil claytosilt were found on the top three tree levels it is evident from the classification tree that factors related to vegetation and climate in the form of shortrooted mat and si act as dominant controls governing ω in surfaces with negligible short rooted vegetation mat acted as the subsequent key control governing ω variability shortrooted node at 1st level regions with greater coverage of short rooted vegetation tend to have higher probabilities of lower ω values suggesting lower evaporative ratios there within these regions greater si was found to support evapotranspiration by positively influencing ω consequent upon the magnitude of si map and pspandpet were found to play key roles in governing precipitation partitioning si node at 2nd level in regions with lower si map promotes runoff by negatively influencing ω map nodes at 3rd and 4th levels we attribute this to greater soil saturation under increased precipitation when the supply of water and energy is asynchronous subsequent splits following mat in regions with negligible short rooted vegetation depend on claytosilt we observe a non linear response of claytosilt on ω classes in such regions claytosilt values between 0 76 and 1 1 result in class 5 claytosilt nodes at 3rd and 4th levels however values smaller than 0 76 and larger than 1 1 predict class 6 in predominantly clayey soil claytosilt greater than 1 1 we attribute the higher ω class to clay s higher water holding capacity making larger quantities of water available to plants for evapotranspiration however in regions with lesser proportions of clay the relative proportions of silt and sand may influence ω sand s higher infiltration capacity can also promote evapotranspiration by making water available to deeper soil layers to investigate the role of each additional influencing factor in determining ω classes we visualize the hierarchical output by cart in the budyko space fig 6 and geographic space fig 7 adding factors at progressively lower levels improves ω class allocation figs 6 and 7 for example to arrive at the ω class prediction in fig 6d the factors shortrooted at level 1 followed by si and mat on level 2 and finally map pspandpet and claytosilt on level 3 are used fig 6 also illustrates the dominance of factors such as shortrooted in governing subsequent controlling factors the upper most level of the cart output is only able to distinguish two classes 2 and 5 using the factor shortrooted fig 6b landmasses belonging to 2 green on level 1 get further classified into classes 1 yellow and 6 grey on level 2 based on si at the same time mat splits class5 black landmasses on level 1 into classes 4 red and 5 black on level 2 the role of either si or mat in influencing ω class allocation is consequent upon the magnitude of the factor shortrooted indicating its dominance the cart output segregates india into increasingly smaller regions where varying factors dominate surface water partitioning fig 7 in doing so it demonstrates how factors controlling sub regional scale hydrological processes depend on the broader physio climatic characteristics at an all india scale at level 1 cart separates the northern indian plains in the north and coastal southern plains from the rest of india class 5 black precipitation partitioning in these regions is governed by long term temperature fig 5 mat node at 2nd level on the other hand long term surface water balance in the remaining major portion of india is controlled by the seasonality based factor si fig 5 si node at 2nd level si delineates central and western india by assigning it class 1 yellow this region is further divided into classes 1 yellow and 3 blue on level 3 based on map note that we do not observe a role of factors such as si and map in influencing surface water partitioning in the himalayan plains that were segregated at level 1 this highlights the importance of accurately identifying dominant upper level factors governing major regional segregation on testing the accuracy of obtained factor dominance to the choice of the number of classes used to subdivide ω we do not find any major irregularities in dominant factors fig 8 the circos plot shows the summary of dominant factors obtained across ten cart trees grown considering altered ω class definitions supplementary information figures s18 s26 each tree produced a spatially consistent ω classification tree across india as well as in the budyko space supplementary information figures s27 s44 the factors shortrooted mat map and claytosilt maintain the positions they held in tree number 5 across all trees seasonality based factors si and pspandpet also always occupy a position on level 2 across all models notably the human influence based factor cultivated appears in 7 of the 10 trees with a position on level 4 in trees 4 6 9 and 10 fig 8 in order to extract a summary of factors that most importantly influence ω in india we compare ranks allotted to factors based on their permutation importance across all rf models fig 9 supplementary information figures s45 s54 for each rf model if the permutation importance of two factors differs by 5 units of scaled mean decrease in accuracy we consider both factors equivalently important supplementary information figure s55 such factors are allotted tied ranks to maintain an equal number of ranks across all models ranks following a series of tied ranks are skipped by a number equal to the number of factors allotted the same rank we note that every rf model invariably assigns greater importance to climatic factors pspandpet mat map and si fig 9 this is in line with observation made using cart which showed a dominant influence of climatic factors across all class definitions fig 8 seasonality pspandpet is always found to be the most important predictor of ω while soil claytosilt demonstrates increasing predictive importance with increasing number of ω classes and hence aet prediction accuracy fig 9 table 4 claytosilt s predictive importance often equals climate based factors mat map and si for rf fits with better aet prediction accuracy but never exceeds pspandpet as we move from rf number 5 to rf models with better aet prediction accuracy human influence based factors including popdens and cultivated emerge as factors that are as important as natural vegetation shortrooted and topographic factors slopetan in their influence on ω interestingly human influence based factors were not found to hold dominant positions in cart analyses the fact that cultivated held lower level positions in 7 cart models and was found important by high performing rf models suggests that human influences may control sub regional hydrological processes in india however they do not play as dominant a role as climate figs 8 and 9 corroborating cart based observations rf also showed that dam capacity aspect ratio watershed size and percentage waterbodies have the lowest impact on ω and thereby on aet at long time scales fig 9 3 4 discussion our results highlight the need for an approach that can hierarchically identify conditional controls governing tixeront fu s ω without explicitly grouping catchments prior to data driven analyses this helps us disentangle regionally varying influences of factors on ω the need to discern nested controls governing hydrological processes has been highlighted in the past patnaik et al 2018 found that the power law exponent governing recession flows was controlled by varying factors in different regions singh et al 2016 showed that the sensitivity of model parameters representing different water balance components varied in topographically different catchments evidence of hierarchical factor significance also exists in literature studying prediction in ungauged basins specifically singh et al 2014 found that a hierarchy of factors dominated by climate and topographical characteristics governed successful hydrological model parameter transfers from gauged to ungauged basins our results also indicate a similar dominance of climate in governing long term surface water budget hierarchical controls on the budyko curve have also been hinted at by previous studies de lavenne and andréassian 2018 feng et al 2012 padrón et al 2017 feng et al 2012 found that plant rooting depth only influenced evapotranspiration in the case of seasonally dry climates for wetter climates having seasonal precipitation soil moisture storage gained either by virtue of deeper roots or greater soil porosity is ineffective in controlling aet this is attributed to more rainfall quickly saturating the soil in a short duration of time and consequently promoting runoff decreasing ω feng et al 2012 cart also indicates a compounded effect of rooting depth surface wetness and seasonality fig 5 specifically fig 5 demonstrates that in regions with greater short rooted vegetation and asynchronous seasonal cycles of p and pet long term precipitation governs ω classification and promotes runoff for higher magnitudes of precipitation in recognition of hierarchical controls especially climate padrón et al 2017 divided their study region based on koeppen geiger climate types prior to analysing factor influence on ω it is interesting to note that despite not forming climate based sub regions for analyses cart and rf automatically identified climate based factors as the most dominant and important influences on ω figs 8 and 9 cart could also automatically delineate the gangetic plain northeast and trans himalayan and himalayan bio geographic classes which had to be manually defined before the regression analysis by sinha et al 2019 the dominant influence of climate map and mat on ω as indicated in our results has scarcely been considered in literature often ω has been assumed to encapsulate terrestrial controls on long term water budget climate controls on the same are believed to be entirely captured by the aridity index sinha et al 2019 xu et al 2013 notable exceptions to this assumption include kumar et al 2016 and saha et al 2020 kumar et al 2016 find a decrease in global ω values under warming and note that not accounting for aridity index driven changes in ω led to differences between cmip5 based and budyko based estimates of runoff ratio q p response to aridity index alteration saha et al 2020 used simulations from the vic model forced by downscaled and bias corrected community earth system model climate projections to show that assuming stationarity of the budyko type model parameter was invalid over the ganga basin they suggest a relationship between the aridity index and the budyko type model parameter we examine the role of aridity index on ω by repeating our methodology through three experiments a replace aridity index as a predictor in favour of map and mat b replace aridity index as a predictor in favour of map c adding the aridity index to our originally chosen predictors note that experiment b was based on an observed correlation between the aridity index and map over india supplementary information figure s56 the aridity index emerged as an important predictor of ω in each rf experiment however its importance was lower than the individual importance of map and mat for experiments b and c supplementary information figures s57 s59 nevertheless we find a strong indication of long term climate influencing ω this result is crucial for using budyko based models to predict water availability under climate change in order to further investigate human impacts on evapotranspiration we traverse the 7 cart outputs that find percentage cultivated area an influential factor in determining ω class five of these trees tree numbers 3 4 6 9 and 10 find percentage cultivated area a key ω control in india s hilly northern and north eastern states due to their broader vegetation and climate dependent regional setting i e significant short rooted vegetation cover shortrooted 1 not greatly out of phase seasonal precipitation and potential evapotranspiration cycles pspandpet 0 23 and relatively cool climate mat 24 c supplementary information figure s60 within these regions if the percentage cultivated area is greater than 10 we find a higher probability of lower ω values on the other hand greater cultivation corresponded to higher ω values in the gangetic plains where regional cultivation exceeds 80 tree numbers 2 5 6 10 evidence supporting non monotonic regional context dependent effects of cultivation on terrestrial aet exists in literature sterling et al 2013 landscapes dominated by evergreen vegetation like india s north eastern states have been found to demonstrate a cultivation driven preference of runoff over evapotranspiration roy and joshi 2002 schilling et al 2008 based on a study in the american midwest schilling et al 2008 attributed this to perennial vegetation transpiring throughout the year unlike seasonally varying aet contributions from annual crops on the other hand extensive irrigated agriculture has also been found to promote aet in regions with a less dominant forest cover sterling et al 2013 wang and hejazi 2011 our results regarding factor influence conditionally supported previous observations from literature fig 5 affirming observations by zhang et al 2004 short rooted vegetation was found to lower ω values corroborating results obtained by de lavenne and andréassian 2018 greater si favoured evapotranspiration over runoff mat s effect on ω was in contrast to observations by jiang et al 2015 they found that the factor promoted evapotranspiration we note that mat s influence in india was restricted to regions receiving snowfall greater mat here may induce snowmelt driven runoff this reasoning supports our hypothesis that the broader physio climatic setting dictates factor influence on ω size was found to have only a low level influence on ω figs 8 and 9 aspect was found to be an insignificant predictor of ω for indian landmasses supporting observations by sinha et al 2019 this may be due to the observed predominant southward aspect of considered indian land surfaces in agreement with padrón et al 2017 damcap was found to be insignificant predictors of ω aet prediction performance from rf models also remain in line with those noted in literature xu et al 2013 found an aet prediction rmse of 73 mm when using multi linear regression to predict ω for 32 large global basins and 224 small us mopex basins shao et al 2012 noted an rmse ranging 68 mm 79 mm depending on the approach used to model ω for 241 australian catchments using a parametrized regression equation to estimate ω li et al 2013 predicted aet for 26 large global basins greater than300000 km2 with an rmse of 45 mm despite using a classification based approach our rf models predict aet with a median rmse of 82 mm across class definitions the best performing rf model rf 10 even achieves an rmse of 60 mm table 4 rf s strong predictive performance provides support to conclusions drawn from the cart models which demonstrate comparatively lower aet prediction performance a significant overlap is noted between factors found dominant by cart and those found important through rf analysis figs 8 and 9 4 conclusions in this study we used algorithms accounting for conditional factor influence to disentangle regional variations in dominant controls on tixeront fu s parameter and quantify anthropogenic effects on it our method overcomes the two main limitations of prior approaches need for predefining regional classes to improve regression performance and accounting for compensatory effects from different factors the nesting of controls as illustrated by our approach indicates that factor impacts on tixeront fu s parameter depend on the physio climatic setting of the region we found that climate pspandpet mat map and si vegetation shortrooted and soil claytosilt based factors were dominant factors influencing surface precipitation partitioning behaviour the rf models were able to predict actual evapotranspiration with a median root mean square error of 82 mm supporting the use of this dataset for applications in data scarce regions and a priori ω estimation in data scarce region rf corroborated results obtained from cart by assigning greater predictive importance to previously identified dominant controls additionally rf identified popdens and cultivated as important predictors of ω over india by assigning both factors ranks comparable with vegetation and topography based factors shortrooted slopetan this suggests that humans may play an important role in influencing sub regional scale hydrological processes further investigations can overcome some limitations of the present framework we assume that factors considered for analysis remain temporally invariant in reality factors such as population density land cover and even climate are subject to gradual changes over the time period considered for analysis future studies can investigate whether the observed hierarchy of factors is sensitive to the choice of time period of analysis we remain constrained by the temporal length and resolution of data available for analysis and acknowledge that identified factors and their effects could be inherently dependent on the study area chosen we also acknowledge the underlying subjective choices involved in factor selection and subsequent correlation analysis to this end we followed a systematic review of literature to consolidate the initial list of factors and generally removed only those factors from correlation analysis that have an underlying physical basis for a statistical relationship in doing so we recognize that factor based conclusions noted for representative factors may reflect effects of removed factors describing similar processes our proposed methodology can be easily replicated using readily available global datasets used here to get an a priori estimate of ω and aid global

4218,the budyko curve relating a catchment s water and energy balance provides a useful tool to analyse how physio climatic and socio economic characteristics may impact long term runoff often a parametric form of the curve the tixeront fu s equation is used to represent the catchment s long term water partitioning behaviour tixeront fu s parameter ω typically derived from observed climate and runoff data can further be related to catchments physio climatic characteristics to enable understanding the main drivers of their water balance at times prior analyses have reported potentially conflicting controls of characteristics on ω based on the rationale that several hydrological processes act across varying spatio temporal scales we hypothesize that the impact of a physio climatic factor on ω is driven by its broader regional setting we test our hypothesis by developing relationships between ω and a curated database of 33 physio climatic and socio economic characteristics for 520 regional divisions of india we employ two related data space splitting algorithms classification and regression trees cart and random forest rf to study the effects of potential controlling factors within their regional context the algorithms diagnose a hierarchy of representative vegetation climate soil land use land cover topography and anthropogenic controls the most important characteristics controlling ω were found to be correlation between monthly time series of p and pet long term temperature long term precipitation and the synchronicity of p and pet human influences quantified in terms of population density and the extent of cultivated area were found to be important factors influencing sub regional scale hydrological processes these anthropogenic factors displayed predictive importance similar to vegetation and topographic factors our results indicate the dominant influence of climate and its seasonality on long term water partitioning across indian landmasses with landscape features including human influences playing a secondary but important role keywords budyko india tixeront fu s parameter classification and regression trees random forest human impact 1 introduction the budyko 1958 1974 framework provides a simple conceptual approach to quantify regional long term water balance donohue et al 2007 greve et al 2015 padrón et al 2017 porporato et al 2004 it is based on the premise that long term actual evapotranspiration aet is governed by a trade off between available energy often represented by mean annual potential evapotranspiration pet and available water mean annual precipitation p pet is often calculated from mean annual temperature t and other climatic variables the budyko curve maintains a firm physical basis and has a comparatively simple formulation relating a catchment s long term evaporative ratio aet p to its aridity index pet p fig 1 this has resulted in its application to a variety of analyses ranging from diagnosis to prediction of surface water partitioning at regional to global scales donohue et al 2007 gunkel and lange 2017 li et al 2013 padrón et al 2017 wang and hejazi 2011 xing et al 2018 it has also been used to calibrate or validate more complex hydrologic models when studying the impact of climate change on hydrology greve et al 2020 singh and kumar 2019 budyko s original non parametric relationship has been found to be applicable only over large temporal and spatial scales 1 year 10 000 km2 donohue et al 2007 several studies noted that catchments often deviated from the original budyko curve and inclusion of additional physio climatic factors in the framework could improve predictability donohue et al 2007 milly 1994 porporato et al 2004 potter et al 2005 thus budyko based parametric relationships were developed choudhury 1999 fu 1981 porporato et al 2004 tixeront 1964 wang and tang 2014 yang et al 2008 zhang et al 2001 notable among these is the tixeront fu fu 1981 tixeront 1964 equation that has found widespread application equation 1 greve et al 2020 li et al 2013 shao et al 2012 singh and kumar 2019 xu et al 2013 yang et al 2007 the adjustable parameter ω in this equation cumulates the net effects of all additional factors affecting the long term energy and water partitioning of catchments 1 aet p 1 p e t p 1 pet p ω 1 ω analysing the effect of various physio climatic factors on ω has revealed interesting insights into dominant hydrological processes determining catchment response fig 1 li et al 2013 shao et al 2012 xu et al 2013 yang et al 2007 zhang et al 2004 calibrated ω values have been frequently associated with climatic jiang et al 2015 milly 1994 padrón et al 2017 williams et al 2012 vegetation li et al 2013 milly 1994 sinha et al 2019 williams et al 2012 xu et al 2013 zhang et al 2004 topographic choudhury 1999 sinha et al 2019 xu et al 2013 yang et al 2007 zhang et al 2004 and soil bai et al 2020 feng et al 2012 padrón et al 2017 yang et al 2007 characteristics this indicates that a variety of processes acting across spatio temporal scales can impact the long term water partitioning a detailed description of different factors controlling ω in literature and their observed effects is provided in section 1 1 although a substantial amount of work focuses on understanding the impact of natural hydrological processes fewer studies have considered the role of anthropogenic drivers jiang et al 2015 padrón et al 2017 wang and hejazi 2011 xing et al 2018 zhang et al 2019 anthropogenic activities modify surface water balance either through direct alterations or by causing changes in hydro climatic variables wang and hejazi 2011 direct effects of human activities may manifest due to land use change gao et al 2016 schilling et al 2010 xing et al 2018 dam construction rossi et al 2009 irrigation jiang et al 2015 etc most analyses apply a comparative hydrology perspective to understand the factors affecting ω across a large number of catchments this approach allows the consideration of several physio climatic and human factors and their relative importance can be determined prior efforts in relating ω to physio climatic factors have revealed conflicting results related to factor influence and importance a higher frequency of precipitation events has been associated with both larger and smaller ω values feng et al 2012 padrón et al 2017 feng et al 2012 noted that this reduced ω and hence aet by saturating soil and promoting runoff q in wetter climates with precipitation seasonality on the other hand padrón et al 2017 suggested that frequent precipitation events promoted aet in arid regions by satisfying greater evaporative demands similarly while some studies have related out of phase seasonal cycles of p and pet to lower ω values due to greater accumulation of precipitation causing runoff feng et al 2012 shao et al 2012 observations by potter et al 2005 indicated the contrary they observed that in phase p and pet cycles led to smaller ω values through an infiltration excess runoff mechanism studies into the comparative effects of tree and grass cover have also yielded interesting results zhang et al 2004 noted higher ω values in forested catchments compared to predominantly grassed catchments ascribed to trees with deeper roots exploiting water at greater depths during dry seasons however williams et al 2012 found comparatively greater evaporative ratios from grass than trees attributed to its less conservative use of water in mesic environments a larger basin size has also been found to influence ω negatively by some but insignificant in controlling ω by others choudhury 1999 padrón et al 2017 xu et al 2013 yang et al 2007 while seemingly contradictory these inconsistencies are likely a result of multiple interacting hydrological processes acting across varying spatial scales compensatory effects between interacting factors use of non representative data samples and regional variations in dominant controls have been identified as possible reasons behind contradictions bai et al 2020 feng et al 2012 padrón et al 2017 sinha et al 2019 xing et al 2018 xu et al 2013 zhang et al 2004 to deal with regional variations in governing factors explicitly grouping catchments based on climate types padrón et al 2017 or bio geographic classes sinha et al 2019 prior to data analysis has been proposed however this involves a subjective step of identifying relevant variables to group the catchments in this study we propose a methodology to identify factors that affect ω along with their nested regional controls our proposed method aims to address two recurring issues in prior analyses first the need for a consistent data based approach to estimate the degree of influence that various factors exert on ω without requiring any subjective prior grouping of catchments the method should be able to identify the hierarchy of dominant controls automatically along with any regional differences in factor importance second factors that may have compensatory influence on ω should be explicitly recognized we achieve this by employing algorithms capable of recognizing conditional controls classification and regression tree cart and random forest rf we use these algorithms to disentangle the effects of vegetation climate soil topography and anthropogenic factors on ω across more than 500 regions across india cart presents its results in an interactive visual format allowing the interpretation of hierarchical controls on ω using this method we test the following hypotheses 1 anthropogenic factors have a dominant influence on ω across india and 2 factor influences on ω are dictated by the broader physio climatic setting resulting in a nesting of dominant controls 1 1 factors influencing tixeront fu s ω a review factors affecting ω in literature have been divided into two broad groups climate based and landscape based controls padrón et al 2017 climate based factors represent those that the aridity index does not capture such as rainfall seasonality landscape controls represent all other factors such as vegetation topography human and geology climate based factors such as average storm depth asd and storm arrival rate sar may affect partitioning as heavier and more frequent storms may promote runoff milly 1994 studies have shown that the nature of influence on ω is generally dependent upon the regional context seasonality has also been found to be a significant predictor bai et al 2020 de lavenne andréassian 2018 padrón et al 2017 xing et al 2018 de lavenne and andréassian 2018 successfully parameterized three forms of the budyko curve using an index which captured the synchronicity of p and pet si padrón et al 2017 showed that the relative amplitude of the seasonal cycle of p seasp led to greater runoff in warm temperate climates the effect of the phase difference between seasonal cycles of p and pet has been quantified in terms of the phase shift of the seasonal cycle of p and pet pspandpet maximum accumulation of monthly surplus mams and seasonal surplus index ssi padrón et al 2017 williams et al 2012 finally p and t also influence ω via a multitude of mechanisms in addition to directly influencing pet q and aet jiang et al 2015 padrón et al 2017 the effect of vegetation on ω have been explored using factors such as normalized difference vegetation index ndvi plant extractable soil water capacity peswc tree cover and grass cover most studies suggest that ndvi promoted aet thus increasing ω li et al 2013 sinha et al 2019 xu et al 2013 however bai et al 2020 observed that in small sized chinese basins the patterns may be different in part due to relatively complex hydrological response of smaller basins and also regionally different landscape and climate characteristics of studied catchments shao et al 2012 found that a greater tree cover promoted aet while padrón et al 2017 noted greater associated runoff in snow climates attributing this inconsistency to cross correlations with slope padrón et al 2017 observed a positive effect of grass cover on ω in arid and warm temperate climates peswc which considers both plant and soil characteristics has been found to conditionally promote aet feng et al 2012 milly 1994 padrón et al 2017 yang et al 2007 zhang et al 2001 zhang et al 2004 feng et al 2012 found that greater peswc promoted aet in drier regions which had seasonal precipitation cycles aet in similar seasonal but wetter climates was unaffected by greater peswc in such regions saturation of soil led to greater runoff despite the increased storage topographic factors like catchment slope size aspect and elevation have been also been proposed as likely influencers on ω absolute mean slope padrón et al 2017 xu et al 2013 tangent of the mean slope yang et al 2007 and relief ratio shao et al 2012 have shown negative correlation with ω padrón et al 2017 report a distinct impact of slope aspect on ω but xu et al 2013 found aspect to be insignificant in their analysis of catchments across india sinha et al 2019 observed that average watershed elevation was a significant driver of ω in during low ndvi periods 2 materials and methods we test the hypotheses proposed in section 1 by developing classification and regression tree cart and random forest rf based ω prediction models employing these data mining algorithms allows us to identify a hierarchy of factors controlling ω this is by virtue of both algorithms generating decision tree based outputs decision trees can capture non linear and non monotonic influences of coupled factors that are not evident from correlation or multiple linear regression based analyses our approach thus incorporates recommendations made by padrón et al 2017 with regard to accounting for ω s possible non monotonic relationship with its controls rfs have demonstrated better performance when compared to linear regression in applications related to bio informatics li et al 2014 remote sensing noi et al 2017 hydrogeology ouedraogo et al 2019 to name a few while their inferences depend upon the nature of the input datasets cart and rfs also allow a better understanding of underlying factors controlling the response variable we interpret the generated cart and rf outputs to identify factors prominently controlling ω 2 1 methodology we follow a comparative hydrology approach by analysing the possible factors governing ω across a spatial gradient we begin by applying equation 1 to estimate ω values for each indian landmass using long term averaged values of historically observed p pet and aet values for a common time window fig 2 these ω values are categorized into various classes as described in section 2 1 1 we also identify a list of governing factors from literature using the procedure in section 2 1 2 then cart and rf algorithms are trained on this dataset of predictor and response variables sections 2 1 3 and 2 1 4 we interpret the trained model outputs from cart to infer dominant factors controlling ω classification the rf algorithm on the other hand provides a ranking of factors that are important in predicting ω classes section 2 1 5 we also assess the sensitivity of algorithmic outputs to the choice of ω class definitions 2 1 1 categorization of tixeront fu s ω considerable uncertainty may exist in calibrated ω estimates as a consequence of using hydro climatic records of limited temporal length guo et al 2019 these uncertainties could lead to significant errors in water availability estimates especially in transitional climates having aridity indices close to unity greve et al 2015 gudmundsson et al 2016 furthermore additional uncertainties may be introduced by using a satellite based aet product for ω calibration to account for uncertainties in calibrated ω estimates and to prevent fitting data mining algorithms to marginal errors we divide calibrated ω into classes based on their values following a quantile based classification approach we explore 10 different ω class definitions that vary the number of classes from 2 to 11 for example class definition 1 divides ω into two classes based on the median value the goal is to develop a flexible framework that can explore possible controls on ω while accounting for uncertainties 2 1 2 identification of representative factors we determined possible factors that may affect ω based on past literature while also including additional factors that have emerged in recent literature or are based on the authors judgement table 1 and section 1 1 we consider all the factors considered by padrón et al 2017 except compound topographic index due to the different scale of analysis adopted to account for soil moisture storage and texture we define factors directly dependent on soil composition we surmise that soil composition is likely to play a crucial role in both moisture storage and infiltration thereby controlling the partitioning of surface water into runoff and evapotranspiration soil promoting infiltration making greater quantities of water available to plants may cause greater evapotranspiration considering the role of soil properties while developing hydrological models has also been advocated in literature nayak et al 2007 though soil related properties such as relative infiltration capacity yang et al 2007 soil moisture padron et al 2017 saturated hydraulic conductivity k bai et al 2020 have been suggested in the past these factors do not adequately represent the relative composition of sand silt and clay we hypothesize that including the ratio of sand and clay to silt provides additional information regarding water partitioning particularly when considering a large dataset where comparative values are of more interest than the absolute compositions secondly we speculate that greater average monsoon precipitation intensity may promote infiltration excess runoff and consider it a potential controlling factor we also employ the non parametric sychronicity index si proposed by de lavenne and andréassian 2018 table 1 defines all factors considered for analysis note that previous studies caution against associating tixeront fu s parameter directly with multiple factors if they may have underlying cross correlations padrón et al 2017 we employ a correlation analysis to select representative factors from the developed dataset of literature based potential ω governing factors to prevent misidentification and removal of important predictors we identify correlations between factor within specific categories such as climate topography anthropogenic etc we calculate pearson s correlation coefficients between all potential factors within individual categories of table 1 following this we eliminate internally correlated factors assuming that shortlisted factors are adequately capable of representing excluded factors while eliminating correlated factors we prefer easily obtainable ones wherever possible 2 1 3 classification and regression trees to study hierarchical controls cart is an algorithm based on recursive binary splitting of a data space into mutually exclusive subspaces each corresponding to a predicted output de ath and fabricius 2000 splits are defined by logical expressions regarding input explanatory variables and results can be presented graphically in the form of a decision tree cart s easy visual interpretability and its ability to identify conditional controls make it ideal for diagnostic studies in our analysis ω is the predicted output and different physio climatic factors constitute the explanatory variables we apply cart in classification mode i e we categorize ω into classes low medium high very high the input to cart includes a table of ω classes and corresponding factor values cart outputs a hierarchy of factors as well as quantifies the range of values of each factor that lead to a certain class of ω values classification imperfections can also be accounted for by computing the probabilities of all classes at each split singh et al 2014 recursive splits could lead to overlarge trees as the algorithm starts fitting outliers these large trees are generally pruned using v fold cross validation breiman et al 1984 this implies the division of the data into v exclusive subsets followed by the construction of v trees iteratively using v 1 subsets for training and the excluded subsets for testing prediction error estimates computed for each excluded subset are recorded to facilitate best tree selection the tree having the least error is selected as the best tree increasing splits typically reduces classification training error relative error for the best tree but could also lead to overfitting in the remaining trees mean cross validated errors calculated across the remaining trees serve as indicators of overfitting these can be used in combination with their respective standard deviations to prune the best tree appropriately we use r s rpart package therneau and atkinson 2010 along with ten fold cross validation to develop pruned cart trees predicting ω classes trees are pruned based on the 1 se rule suggested by breiman et al 1984 to obtain optimal sized trees without overfitting according to this rule we choose the number of splits such that the corresponding mean cross validated error xerror is within one standard error xstd of the lowest mean cross validated error i e xerror min xerror xstd we use circos plots generated using the online tool provided on http mkweb bcgsc ca tableviewer visualize to enable simultaneous visualization of different cart trees this is done to test the sensitivity of ω class definition on observed results 2 1 4 random forests for ω class prediction random forests rf attempt to resolve a noted cart limitation of being highly susceptible to changes in training data using an ensemble of trees de ath and fabricius 2000 trees are grown using bootstrapped samples of the original data and each split in these trees is based on a randomly picked predictor subset díaz uriarte and de andres 2006 bootstrapping attempts to reduce uncertainties by generating samples through intensive resampling with replacement kant et al 2013 using random predictor subsets to determine each split allows moderately strong predictors to demonstrate their effect in case of few very strong predictors in the dataset results are obtained by aggregating outputs of all trees by either choosing the most voted class for classification or taking an algebraic average for regression breiman 2001 james et al 2013 the optimal number of trees required and the ideal number of predictors needed for determining each split are obtained minimizing out of bag oob errors these are computed over the roughly 1 3rd samples left out as a consequence of bootstrapping biau and scornet 2016 using a combination of bootstrapping and aggregation bagging makes the random forest algorithm a highly flexible supervised learning algorithm james et al 2013 we develop a random forest in classification mode with a 70 30 ratio for model training and testing using the r package randomforest liaw and wiener 2002 the number of trees grown were fixed at 1000 while the model was optimized to identify the number of factors to be used for each split 2 1 5 using cart and rf to identify dominant and important controls on ω here we quantify the relative influence of a factor on ω classes in two ways factor dominance is provided by cart output and factor s predictive importance is identified by rf as mentioned earlier cart provides a tree like output starting with a single node where a factor and its threshold value divide the data into two groups this process is iterated with each of the grouped data as we traverse additional nodes of the tree the algorithm is such that the factor that provides the most information gain quantified as the distance between groupings of the response variable appears first in the tree thus the position of a factor in the cart output is indicative of its relative importance in categorizing the response variable into distinct groups this is inferred as its dominance in this study note also that the value of a factor located at a higher tree level influences subsequent factors controlling the response variable ω classes in this case we define a factor s predictive importance by ranking factors based on their contribution to rf prediction accuracy to this end we employ the permutation variable importance approach hastie et al 2009 strobl et al 2007 the rationale behind this approach is that permuting a predictor while leaving all the other predictors intact breaks predictor outcome association strobl et al 2007 thus larger average deviations in errors before and after permuting a predictor in the oob sample implies greater importance of said predictor the randomforest package we employ computes permutation factor importance in the form of scaled mean decrease in accuracy scaling is done by normalizing the mean error differences post permutation by the standard deviation of these differences liaw et al 2015 note that cart based dominance and rf based predictive importance highlight fundamentally different information predictive importance quantifies the increase in error caused by randomly shuffling a particular factor s values hence this error acts as a proxy for overall importance of a factor across all levels of all 1000 trees generated by the rf algorithm on the other hand dominance interpreted from the cart based circos plot relates to the level generally occupied by a factor across all trees considered 2 2 data sources we performed the analysis on an all india dataset constituted of 637 administrative units a majority of which 94 have areas larger than 1000 km2 daily gridded precipitation and temperature data was obtained from india meteorological department pune gridded precipitation temperature data was available at a spatial resolution of 1 x 1 1 x 1 for the time period 1901 2015 1951 2013 gridded pet values were estimated using hargreaves and samani s 1985 temperature based method the ω values for each region were calibrated based on a satellite based aet product produced by zhang et al 2010 for the time period 1983 2000 after considering availability of p pet and aet data it is worth mentioning that the aet product we employ has been recently validated against ground based observations of streamflow from india wris for the indian subcontinent by sinha et al 2019 noting a significant strong relationship between the aet product and aet calculated by subtracting observed discharge from observed precipitation r 0 62 p 0 01 they justify the use of said aet product the same aet product has also been applied for calibrating tixeront fu s parameter by xu et al 2013 and sinha et al 2019 the physio climatic and anthropogenic factors for each region were determined using data sources detailed in table 2 we consider 520 regions for further analysis excluding regions which violate physical constraints on water and energy availability i e have aet p or aet pet and regions with unavailable data for landmasses where daily temperature data was unavailable for 10 days temperature and pet values were linearly interpolated over time using observations of preceding and succeeding days such landmasses have been highlighted in this paper s associated dataset vora and singh 2021 3 results and discussion 3 1 identifying representative physio climatic and anthropogenic factors we found that 16 of the 33 initially identified potential influencing factors could justifiably represent all remaining factors using a correlation driven intra and inter category factor selection process supplementary information figures s1 s6 table 3 details the intra category correlations and final choice of representative factors notably a majority of the correlations identified explain similar characteristics for example we find a strong correlation between ndvi and percentage tree cover table 3 group 5 ndvi was favoured as it is easily quantifiable and has been calculated as a long term temporal average similarly within the anthropogenic category we select a representative characteristic from irrigated agriculture and cultivated area we chose pspandpet from group 2 as it directly quantifies the temporal difference between energy and water availability surface slope may directly influence runoff and hence slopetan was chosen from group 6 inter category correlation analysis between shortlisted factors from all categories revealed significant correlations between slopetan organicavg map and ndvi appreciable vegetation cover can be a cause and effect of greater precipitation justifying the correlation between map and ndvi additionally greater vegetation may also be the cause for higher soil organic content considering these arguments we eliminate ndvi and organicave in favour of map for the subsequent analysis we preferred map due to its relatively easy availability even in ungauged regions fig 3 displays a correlation matrix of the final shortlisted factors for cart and random forest analysis we note that although cultivated was correlated with slopetan and shortrooted a justifiable reason to eliminate one in favour of the other was not found the correlation between mat and slopetan supplementary information figure s7 may also be only a regionally valid correlation hence none of the aforementioned factors were disregarded 3 2 performance evaluation of cart and rf models the parameter ω displays significant spatial variation with a median of 1 49 and inter quartile range of 0 30 fig 4 we employ a split sample test to check the performance of ω calibration we calibrated ω on long term hydro climatic means for 1983 1993 and used these calibrated values to predict long term aet for 1994 2000 for each landmass our results indicate a reasonable performance of this calibration in the validation period with a 5 1 median prediction bias of aet across all landmasses considered the inter quartile range of the prediction bias was 6 3 the ω values calibrated for the total available record were then divided into different number of classes 2 to 11 using appropriate quantiles as class boundaries supplementary information table s1 cart and rf models developed using the ten quantile based class definitions are further tested on their ability to reproduce aet across different landmasses table 4 to predict aet using cart or rf the mean of the predicted class s bounding ω values is substituted in eq 1 for cart the increase in root mean square error rmse after tree number 5 suggests that further categorization may lead to overfitting as well as reduction in ω class prediction accuracy table 4 hence we use cart tree number 5 to draw major inferences regarding hierarchical controls on ω rf models invariably outperform cart models and continually show improvements in aet prediction performance with increasing number of classes however performance improvements plateau after rf number 5 when considering both rmse and percent bias aet prediction accuracy improves despite a reduction in classification accuracy with increasing number of classes as the classification errors are typically constrained within one adjacent class of the observed class supplementary information figures s8 s17 all developed cart and rf models are analysed to evaluate the robustness of our conclusions 3 3 hierarchical controls on surface water partitioning employing cart to discover relationship between shortlisted factors and ω highlighted that vegetation cover followed by climate and soil dominantly influence ω fig 5 factors representing vegetation shortrooted climate along with its seasonality mat map si and pspandpet and soil claytosilt were found on the top three tree levels it is evident from the classification tree that factors related to vegetation and climate in the form of shortrooted mat and si act as dominant controls governing ω in surfaces with negligible short rooted vegetation mat acted as the subsequent key control governing ω variability shortrooted node at 1st level regions with greater coverage of short rooted vegetation tend to have higher probabilities of lower ω values suggesting lower evaporative ratios there within these regions greater si was found to support evapotranspiration by positively influencing ω consequent upon the magnitude of si map and pspandpet were found to play key roles in governing precipitation partitioning si node at 2nd level in regions with lower si map promotes runoff by negatively influencing ω map nodes at 3rd and 4th levels we attribute this to greater soil saturation under increased precipitation when the supply of water and energy is asynchronous subsequent splits following mat in regions with negligible short rooted vegetation depend on claytosilt we observe a non linear response of claytosilt on ω classes in such regions claytosilt values between 0 76 and 1 1 result in class 5 claytosilt nodes at 3rd and 4th levels however values smaller than 0 76 and larger than 1 1 predict class 6 in predominantly clayey soil claytosilt greater than 1 1 we attribute the higher ω class to clay s higher water holding capacity making larger quantities of water available to plants for evapotranspiration however in regions with lesser proportions of clay the relative proportions of silt and sand may influence ω sand s higher infiltration capacity can also promote evapotranspiration by making water available to deeper soil layers to investigate the role of each additional influencing factor in determining ω classes we visualize the hierarchical output by cart in the budyko space fig 6 and geographic space fig 7 adding factors at progressively lower levels improves ω class allocation figs 6 and 7 for example to arrive at the ω class prediction in fig 6d the factors shortrooted at level 1 followed by si and mat on level 2 and finally map pspandpet and claytosilt on level 3 are used fig 6 also illustrates the dominance of factors such as shortrooted in governing subsequent controlling factors the upper most level of the cart output is only able to distinguish two classes 2 and 5 using the factor shortrooted fig 6b landmasses belonging to 2 green on level 1 get further classified into classes 1 yellow and 6 grey on level 2 based on si at the same time mat splits class5 black landmasses on level 1 into classes 4 red and 5 black on level 2 the role of either si or mat in influencing ω class allocation is consequent upon the magnitude of the factor shortrooted indicating its dominance the cart output segregates india into increasingly smaller regions where varying factors dominate surface water partitioning fig 7 in doing so it demonstrates how factors controlling sub regional scale hydrological processes depend on the broader physio climatic characteristics at an all india scale at level 1 cart separates the northern indian plains in the north and coastal southern plains from the rest of india class 5 black precipitation partitioning in these regions is governed by long term temperature fig 5 mat node at 2nd level on the other hand long term surface water balance in the remaining major portion of india is controlled by the seasonality based factor si fig 5 si node at 2nd level si delineates central and western india by assigning it class 1 yellow this region is further divided into classes 1 yellow and 3 blue on level 3 based on map note that we do not observe a role of factors such as si and map in influencing surface water partitioning in the himalayan plains that were segregated at level 1 this highlights the importance of accurately identifying dominant upper level factors governing major regional segregation on testing the accuracy of obtained factor dominance to the choice of the number of classes used to subdivide ω we do not find any major irregularities in dominant factors fig 8 the circos plot shows the summary of dominant factors obtained across ten cart trees grown considering altered ω class definitions supplementary information figures s18 s26 each tree produced a spatially consistent ω classification tree across india as well as in the budyko space supplementary information figures s27 s44 the factors shortrooted mat map and claytosilt maintain the positions they held in tree number 5 across all trees seasonality based factors si and pspandpet also always occupy a position on level 2 across all models notably the human influence based factor cultivated appears in 7 of the 10 trees with a position on level 4 in trees 4 6 9 and 10 fig 8 in order to extract a summary of factors that most importantly influence ω in india we compare ranks allotted to factors based on their permutation importance across all rf models fig 9 supplementary information figures s45 s54 for each rf model if the permutation importance of two factors differs by 5 units of scaled mean decrease in accuracy we consider both factors equivalently important supplementary information figure s55 such factors are allotted tied ranks to maintain an equal number of ranks across all models ranks following a series of tied ranks are skipped by a number equal to the number of factors allotted the same rank we note that every rf model invariably assigns greater importance to climatic factors pspandpet mat map and si fig 9 this is in line with observation made using cart which showed a dominant influence of climatic factors across all class definitions fig 8 seasonality pspandpet is always found to be the most important predictor of ω while soil claytosilt demonstrates increasing predictive importance with increasing number of ω classes and hence aet prediction accuracy fig 9 table 4 claytosilt s predictive importance often equals climate based factors mat map and si for rf fits with better aet prediction accuracy but never exceeds pspandpet as we move from rf number 5 to rf models with better aet prediction accuracy human influence based factors including popdens and cultivated emerge as factors that are as important as natural vegetation shortrooted and topographic factors slopetan in their influence on ω interestingly human influence based factors were not found to hold dominant positions in cart analyses the fact that cultivated held lower level positions in 7 cart models and was found important by high performing rf models suggests that human influences may control sub regional hydrological processes in india however they do not play as dominant a role as climate figs 8 and 9 corroborating cart based observations rf also showed that dam capacity aspect ratio watershed size and percentage waterbodies have the lowest impact on ω and thereby on aet at long time scales fig 9 3 4 discussion our results highlight the need for an approach that can hierarchically identify conditional controls governing tixeront fu s ω without explicitly grouping catchments prior to data driven analyses this helps us disentangle regionally varying influences of factors on ω the need to discern nested controls governing hydrological processes has been highlighted in the past patnaik et al 2018 found that the power law exponent governing recession flows was controlled by varying factors in different regions singh et al 2016 showed that the sensitivity of model parameters representing different water balance components varied in topographically different catchments evidence of hierarchical factor significance also exists in literature studying prediction in ungauged basins specifically singh et al 2014 found that a hierarchy of factors dominated by climate and topographical characteristics governed successful hydrological model parameter transfers from gauged to ungauged basins our results also indicate a similar dominance of climate in governing long term surface water budget hierarchical controls on the budyko curve have also been hinted at by previous studies de lavenne and andréassian 2018 feng et al 2012 padrón et al 2017 feng et al 2012 found that plant rooting depth only influenced evapotranspiration in the case of seasonally dry climates for wetter climates having seasonal precipitation soil moisture storage gained either by virtue of deeper roots or greater soil porosity is ineffective in controlling aet this is attributed to more rainfall quickly saturating the soil in a short duration of time and consequently promoting runoff decreasing ω feng et al 2012 cart also indicates a compounded effect of rooting depth surface wetness and seasonality fig 5 specifically fig 5 demonstrates that in regions with greater short rooted vegetation and asynchronous seasonal cycles of p and pet long term precipitation governs ω classification and promotes runoff for higher magnitudes of precipitation in recognition of hierarchical controls especially climate padrón et al 2017 divided their study region based on koeppen geiger climate types prior to analysing factor influence on ω it is interesting to note that despite not forming climate based sub regions for analyses cart and rf automatically identified climate based factors as the most dominant and important influences on ω figs 8 and 9 cart could also automatically delineate the gangetic plain northeast and trans himalayan and himalayan bio geographic classes which had to be manually defined before the regression analysis by sinha et al 2019 the dominant influence of climate map and mat on ω as indicated in our results has scarcely been considered in literature often ω has been assumed to encapsulate terrestrial controls on long term water budget climate controls on the same are believed to be entirely captured by the aridity index sinha et al 2019 xu et al 2013 notable exceptions to this assumption include kumar et al 2016 and saha et al 2020 kumar et al 2016 find a decrease in global ω values under warming and note that not accounting for aridity index driven changes in ω led to differences between cmip5 based and budyko based estimates of runoff ratio q p response to aridity index alteration saha et al 2020 used simulations from the vic model forced by downscaled and bias corrected community earth system model climate projections to show that assuming stationarity of the budyko type model parameter was invalid over the ganga basin they suggest a relationship between the aridity index and the budyko type model parameter we examine the role of aridity index on ω by repeating our methodology through three experiments a replace aridity index as a predictor in favour of map and mat b replace aridity index as a predictor in favour of map c adding the aridity index to our originally chosen predictors note that experiment b was based on an observed correlation between the aridity index and map over india supplementary information figure s56 the aridity index emerged as an important predictor of ω in each rf experiment however its importance was lower than the individual importance of map and mat for experiments b and c supplementary information figures s57 s59 nevertheless we find a strong indication of long term climate influencing ω this result is crucial for using budyko based models to predict water availability under climate change in order to further investigate human impacts on evapotranspiration we traverse the 7 cart outputs that find percentage cultivated area an influential factor in determining ω class five of these trees tree numbers 3 4 6 9 and 10 find percentage cultivated area a key ω control in india s hilly northern and north eastern states due to their broader vegetation and climate dependent regional setting i e significant short rooted vegetation cover shortrooted 1 not greatly out of phase seasonal precipitation and potential evapotranspiration cycles pspandpet 0 23 and relatively cool climate mat 24 c supplementary information figure s60 within these regions if the percentage cultivated area is greater than 10 we find a higher probability of lower ω values on the other hand greater cultivation corresponded to higher ω values in the gangetic plains where regional cultivation exceeds 80 tree numbers 2 5 6 10 evidence supporting non monotonic regional context dependent effects of cultivation on terrestrial aet exists in literature sterling et al 2013 landscapes dominated by evergreen vegetation like india s north eastern states have been found to demonstrate a cultivation driven preference of runoff over evapotranspiration roy and joshi 2002 schilling et al 2008 based on a study in the american midwest schilling et al 2008 attributed this to perennial vegetation transpiring throughout the year unlike seasonally varying aet contributions from annual crops on the other hand extensive irrigated agriculture has also been found to promote aet in regions with a less dominant forest cover sterling et al 2013 wang and hejazi 2011 our results regarding factor influence conditionally supported previous observations from literature fig 5 affirming observations by zhang et al 2004 short rooted vegetation was found to lower ω values corroborating results obtained by de lavenne and andréassian 2018 greater si favoured evapotranspiration over runoff mat s effect on ω was in contrast to observations by jiang et al 2015 they found that the factor promoted evapotranspiration we note that mat s influence in india was restricted to regions receiving snowfall greater mat here may induce snowmelt driven runoff this reasoning supports our hypothesis that the broader physio climatic setting dictates factor influence on ω size was found to have only a low level influence on ω figs 8 and 9 aspect was found to be an insignificant predictor of ω for indian landmasses supporting observations by sinha et al 2019 this may be due to the observed predominant southward aspect of considered indian land surfaces in agreement with padrón et al 2017 damcap was found to be insignificant predictors of ω aet prediction performance from rf models also remain in line with those noted in literature xu et al 2013 found an aet prediction rmse of 73 mm when using multi linear regression to predict ω for 32 large global basins and 224 small us mopex basins shao et al 2012 noted an rmse ranging 68 mm 79 mm depending on the approach used to model ω for 241 australian catchments using a parametrized regression equation to estimate ω li et al 2013 predicted aet for 26 large global basins greater than300000 km2 with an rmse of 45 mm despite using a classification based approach our rf models predict aet with a median rmse of 82 mm across class definitions the best performing rf model rf 10 even achieves an rmse of 60 mm table 4 rf s strong predictive performance provides support to conclusions drawn from the cart models which demonstrate comparatively lower aet prediction performance a significant overlap is noted between factors found dominant by cart and those found important through rf analysis figs 8 and 9 4 conclusions in this study we used algorithms accounting for conditional factor influence to disentangle regional variations in dominant controls on tixeront fu s parameter and quantify anthropogenic effects on it our method overcomes the two main limitations of prior approaches need for predefining regional classes to improve regression performance and accounting for compensatory effects from different factors the nesting of controls as illustrated by our approach indicates that factor impacts on tixeront fu s parameter depend on the physio climatic setting of the region we found that climate pspandpet mat map and si vegetation shortrooted and soil claytosilt based factors were dominant factors influencing surface precipitation partitioning behaviour the rf models were able to predict actual evapotranspiration with a median root mean square error of 82 mm supporting the use of this dataset for applications in data scarce regions and a priori ω estimation in data scarce region rf corroborated results obtained from cart by assigning greater predictive importance to previously identified dominant controls additionally rf identified popdens and cultivated as important predictors of ω over india by assigning both factors ranks comparable with vegetation and topography based factors shortrooted slopetan this suggests that humans may play an important role in influencing sub regional scale hydrological processes further investigations can overcome some limitations of the present framework we assume that factors considered for analysis remain temporally invariant in reality factors such as population density land cover and even climate are subject to gradual changes over the time period considered for analysis future studies can investigate whether the observed hierarchy of factors is sensitive to the choice of time period of analysis we remain constrained by the temporal length and resolution of data available for analysis and acknowledge that identified factors and their effects could be inherently dependent on the study area chosen we also acknowledge the underlying subjective choices involved in factor selection and subsequent correlation analysis to this end we followed a systematic review of literature to consolidate the initial list of factors and generally removed only those factors from correlation analysis that have an underlying physical basis for a statistical relationship in doing so we recognize that factor based conclusions noted for representative factors may reflect effects of removed factors describing similar processes our proposed methodology can be easily replicated using readily available global datasets used here to get an a priori estimate of ω and aid global

4219,climate projected continuous rain series are required for urban drainage design and analysis outputs from regional climate models are yet insufficient in quality and resolution for this purpose here we introduce a novel method climacs climate projection of measured precipitation series for stochastic climate projection of point rain series for urban drainage design it is developed and evaluated to represent current climate conditions as well as projections for the period 2071 2100 with rcp scenarios 4 5 and 8 5 climacs includes seasonal stochastic resampling of individual rain events and rainfall intermittency as well as climate scaling fifteen climate variables representing multiple changes in the future rainfall are selected and projected to target future conditions realizations of the resampled and stochastically generated rain series are ranked and selected according to the minimum relative error between realization and target to give an insight into the uncertainty of the climate projection as well as year to year variability of precipitation climate variables an ensemble of the top 100 realizations for each climate scenario is selected for further analysis it is concluded that the ensembles represent the future conditions well however with a large variability due to the uncertainties in climate projection with the aim of showing the impact in urban drainage system design a stormwater detention pond design with multiple design parameters and climate scenarios is demonstrated the pond design results show a significant difference in required pond volume depending on the design parameters and the choice of climate scenario which emphasizes the need for climate projected continuous rain series for urban design purposes as an alternative to design storms keywords urban drainage design climate projection stochastic rainfall generation continuous rain series storm detention water pond ensemble modelling 1 introduction in design and planning of urban drainage systems it is crucial to be able to give an estimate of the future loading of the drainage system in order to certify a long lifetime of the designed systems the impacts of how global warming changes precipitation patterns therefore have to be taken into account in the projection of climate change for northern europe it is well known that the most high intensity rainfall will increase and that the average annual precipitation will increase this is the case for all rcp scenarios kovats et al 2014 the climate changes might also cause a shift in the annual precipitation patterns one example for denmark is that the summer precipitation is expected to decrease or remain at the same level in 2071 2100 as in the current climate conditions 1981 2010 at the same time the heavy rain events are expected to increase by some 30 40 resulting in longer drought periods between events thejll et al 2020 small or upstream parts of drainage systems are most commonly designed with idf curves or design storms where rain intensities for a given short duration with a given return period are multiplied by a contributing area to assess a maximum flow corresponding to the specified return period cf the rational method kuichling 1889 the design rainfall can easily be climate projected by multiplying the rainfall intensity with a climate factor that represents the increase in rainfall intensity for short heavy rain events for larger systems or downstream parts where branches confluence and flow are regulated by pumps detention ponds weirs etc flow patterns become more complex the assumption of unity between the return period of the rain and the return period of the flow is therefore not necessarily in agreement rather than using design storms design and impact analysis of complex drainage systems are therefore often done with numerical models that simulate flow with inputs from continuous rain series schaarup jensen et al 2009 thorndahl 2009 thorndahl et al 2008 the return periods of flow or water levels exceeding specified thresholds can hereby be estimated as part of the design process where the design does not only depend on the peak rainfall intensity of the rain over a specified duration but on multiple combinations of rain intensities with different durations as well as regulated flows the linear scaling with regard to climate change also falls short it is necessary to produce continuous rain series that represent the future rain patterns e g by scaling the extremes and less intensive rain differently from each other moreover it is important to represent how the dry periods between events change with changing climate conditions this applies in situations where runoff peak flows etc dependent on the antecedent soil moisture conditions nielsen et al 2019 pathiraja et al 2012 or the design of stormwater detention ponds where the emptying time between rain events is crucial for required volumes in a broader urban drainage context it is essential to be able to calculate loads on receiving waters either from combined or separate sewer systems to do this correctly the yearly and seasonal precipitation amounts also have to match future climate conditions this can only be achieved by developing climate projected continuous rain series global circulation models with different forcings of climate gas concentrations can represent future global warming and thereby changes in climate by deriving relevant boundary conditions from the global models regional climate models can be applied to simulate the impacts of climate change on regional scales this includes the projection of the changes in precipitation in comparison with the observations or rainfall statistics used for urban drainage design or impact analysis the regional climate models are however biased and in course temporal and spatial resolutions it is therefore widely recognized to apply outputs from regional climate models to statistically downscale climate changes to sufficient scales willems et al 2012 there are different approaches to statistical downscaling e g weather typing van uytven et al 2020a willems and vrac 2011 stochastic rainfall generation burton et al 2008 chen et al 2021 haberlandt et al 2015 kim and olivera 2011 park et al 2021 or methods that modify or perturbate time series often referred as change factor based methods e g ntegeka et al 2014 olsson et al 2009 sørup et al 2017 sunyer et al 2015 van uytven et al 2020b argued that the change factor based methods have advantages over rainfall stochastic rainfall generators since they do not contain stochastic elements and therefore can produce one single perturbation of a rain series rather than a stochastic ensemble in this paper we argue for the opposite namely those stochastic rainfall generators have the advantage to simulate an ensemble that can represent the uncertainty in the climate projections of rain series and due to the stochastic features they can be targeted through specific applications in urban drainage design and impact analyses we present a stochastic rainfall generator procedure climacs climate projection of measured precipitation series that can generate a continuous climate projected rain series for urban drainage design and impact analyses a former version is presented in the hess publication event based stochastic point rainfall resampling for statistical replication and climate projection of historical rainfall series by thorndahl et al 2017 and has been evaluated along with other methods in sørup et al 2018 and de niel et al 2019 compared to thorndahl et al 2017 the procedure is further developed and improved with regards to simulating yearly variability implementation of uncertainties in climate projections as well as new stochastic generation and evaluation procedures that make the stochastic procedure faster and more consistent in addition to the targeting of rain series to statistically represent climate variables relevant for precipitation climacs also features validation on the dry weather periods between rainfall events climacs applies new processing of climate model ensembles from the eurocordex database for both rcp 4 5 and 8 5 here we aim to present and evaluate the new features of the improved procedure climacs produces ensembles of stochastically sampled rain events the idea is not to produce rain series that match the true climate and precipitation pattern for a given period but to create rain series that statistically represent rainfall for a given period and which can be used for the design of hydrological systems e g urban drainage systems climacs can provide rain series representing current climate conditions as well as future conditions projected by different climate scenarios the former is considered as a validation of the procedure when the reference rain series and a resampled rain series statistically are in agreement it is important to emphasize that each stochastic realization of a rain series is different the objective of this paper is therefore also to investigate the ensemble variability between generated rain series and to assess how large an ensemble is required in a given design process to investigate and compare the generated rain series under different hydrological design conditions and climate conditions we apply a simple stormwater detention pond design routine that estimates the required pond volume for a given unit area and return period by varying the outlet flow rate from the detention pond the design volume becomes differently dependent on the continuity of the rain series and thus the time between rain events the difference in detention pond design volume is investigated and compared for both current and future climate conditions other applications of climacs rain series as inputs to urban hydrological models of integrated systems e g to simulate flooding surcharge combined sewer overflow is also tested as part of the evaluation of climacs but not reported here the paper is structured as follows in section 2 1 the stochastic procedure and the novel features are presented in section 2 2 the method for evaluating the generated time series in detention pond design is presented the rainfall data and climate model projections applied to exemplify the procedure are presented in section 3 results of the evaluation of both rainfall statistics and detention pond design are presented in section 4 section 5 features a discussion of the ensemble size related to urban drainage design conclusions are provided in section 6 2 methods 2 1 stochastic generation and evaluation of rain series the procedure for generating both resampled rain series representing the current climate and climate projected rain series representing a given future climate scenario is presented in the following section for specific details on the procedure you can refer to thorndahl et al 2017 and the explanations are limited here to present a general understanding of the procedure s steps fig 1 as well as emphasize and detail the improvements of the method climacs can run in two modes single station mode where rain events are sampled from a single historical rain series referred as the reference rain series from hereon and fitted to the statistics or projections of the same rain series or in a multiple station mode thorndahl and andersen 2021 where events are resampled from multiple historical rain series and fitted to regional rainfall statistics and climate projections where the single station mode will generate a rain series representative for the location of the reference rain series the multiple station mode can generate a rain series to represent a random location as long as the regional rainfall statistics and climate projections are available as targets in this paper we limit the description to the single station mode the stochastic generation procedure therefore exclusively samples rain events from the original reference rain series it is a key feature in climacs that the stochastic sampling and climate scaling are split into individual seasons winter spring summer and autumn which allows for different climate projections depending on the season we apply brute force sampling of rain events interevent time and climate scaling which is stochastic and unconditional on the past climacs will generate numerous rain series and the concept is that the posterior evaluation procedure determines if each individual realization should be accepted or rejected based on the statistics of a number of target climate variables these target climate variables are solely related to precipitation and serve as evaluation indicators throughout the paper due to the brute force randomization the greater majority of series are rejected due to too large errors on one or more of the target variables the evaluation and accept reject procedure is based on relative errors between realization and targets related to both annual and seasonal statistics as well as extreme statistics this ensures that the minority of the generated series that in fact comply with the acceptance criteria has low errors on multiple statistical parameters and therefore can represent real rainfall statistics for either the current climate or projections of the future climate 2 2 alternating stochastic sampling of single rain event and interevent time rainfall intermittency interevent time is stochastically sampled from a two component mixed exponential probability density function for each season thorndahl et al 2017 the probability distribution has three parameters for each of the four seasons for replicating the current climate the parameters are assessed by fitting the reference rain series in order for the climate projected rain series to include different interevent time distributions the three parameters for each season are sampled randomly from a uniform distribution with fixed upper and lower boundaries this allows for a shift in interevent times e g to accommodate for longer drought periods or periods with an increased frequency of event occurrences in the future climate rain events are sampled randomly from the pool of seasonally grouped historical events from the reference rain series and each event is treated as an independent event other studies have applied markovian processes e g basinger et al 2010 fowler et al 2005 or even more complex weather generators e g kim and onof 2020 peleg et al 2017 to introduce or simulate interevent dependency since the objective of climacs is to produce continuous rain series which are statistically valid for urban drainage design and not to reproduce real rainfall the interevent dependency is neglected and the continuity of the individual rain events and interevent times are evaluated seasonally by the target climate variables the discrete stochastic sampling of individual rain events to produce continuous rain series is stochastic and unconditional on the past and can thus be described as a non markovian process therefore it is crucial to statistically evaluate the generated series and to reject realizations that do not comply with the acceptance criteria for each climate variable we allow for random sampling of the same event multiple times unlike other studies e g sørup et al 2017 there is no grouping by rainfall intensity or total rain depth of the individual events prior to the random sampling this makes the method flexible in terms of sampling from the complete distribution of events without introducing assumptions on the grouping the disadvantage of this approach is that many generated rain series have to be rejected due to low performance scores or high relative errors on one or more target climate variables this is elaborated in section 4 1 the alternating sampling of rain events and interevent times is repeated until the desired length of the generated rain series is obtained 2 3 climate scaling in the generated continuous rain series climate scaling is implemented by a linear scaling of the rain intensity i a scale factor c for each season is calculated using a first order function with a contribution from a scale factor β which is drawn randomly from a uniform distribution for each season and a contribution α also sampled from a seasonal uniform distribution depending on the fitted two component mixed exponential cumulative probability f i of rain intensity for the season in question 1 c i α f i β the scaling with regard to intensity allows for different change factors for different intensities and gives more variability between the generated rain series an example of a scale factor from a set of randomly selected parameter values for a given season could be β 1 09 and α 0 05 the scale factor c would therefore range between 1 09 for f i 0 and 1 14 for f i 1 the scaling factor c is different from the climate factor cf defined in the evaluation procedure and given in table 1 the latter serves as the projection of the individual target variables whereas the former serves as a stochastic input to the climate scaling the linear scaling of rain intensities is inspired by the delta change method as applied in olsson et al 2009 in which the scaling depends on the intensity distribution compared to a static climate projection e g sørup et al 2017 which might have been implemented using selected climate factors from table 1 directly as scaling parameters the linear scaling creates a dynamic climate projection it allows for the climate scale factor c i to be both smaller and larger than 1 and since parameters α and β are drawn randomly for each season there is a very large flexibility in the scaling procedure the climate scaling however is very dependent on the succeeding evaluation and rejection of series with too large relative errors the brute force approach in which event sampling and scaling parameters are consistently randomized requires the generation of many realizations to obtain a few that comply with acceptance criteria 2 4 evaluation procedure a central part of the stochastic generation of rain series is the evaluation of the generated series according to the specified target climate variables and how the weights of the different targets are applied to calculate the metrics for each individual rain series realization the criterion for accepting a rain series realization is twofold initially each individual target variable has to fit within a specified range of each target defined by the relative error and secondly the overall weighted relative error of the realization must satisfy a specified acceptance criterion the applied target variables are presented in table 1 along with the applied weights the developed methodology has no upper limit with regard to the number of target variables and other variables might be added or replaced if other or better climate variables become available in this paper however we limit the target climate variables to the ones presented in table 1 the climate variables presented in table 2 are related to the dry weather periods between rainfall in this case they are used as validation variables but could also have been equally implemented as targets and weights the interevent times that we sample as part of the alternating procedure are fully stochastic and therefore independent from the projections of dry weather periods furthermore the interevent times are at a minutely timescale as the rain series the dry weather periods are estimated in days although interevent times and dry weather periods indeed represent the same we choose to distinguish between them since the interevent times are used as part of the input for generating rain series and the dry weather periods are used as part of the validation procedure compared to the methodology presented in thorndahl et al 2017 an improved metric of defining the acceptance range for each target variable is developed it is hereby possible to include both variabilities from year to year for the target variables defined annually as well as the uncertainty estimates of the climate projections of the individual target variables for each climate variable m the relative error re for each realization n is calculated as 2 re m n t m r m n t m in which t is the target value and r is the corresponding value based on the realizations in the present climate simulations the target value is an absolute value for a given climate variable e g the mean summer precipitation in the case of the evaluation of climate projected rain series the target value is the absolute value multiplied by the climate factor cf of the climate variable in question for climate variables defined with annual values e g seasonal precipitation number of days with precipitation over a specific threshold etc the relative error term is calculated both as a mean for the period of the rain series as well as the standard deviations of the annual values the target and the realization value related to the means are calculated by 3 t m x m cf m 4 r m n y m n in which x and y are the annual climate variable estimates for the reference rain series and the realization rain series respectively the target t and the realization value r related to the standard deviations are calculated by 5 t m s x m 2 σ cf m 2 s x m 2 cf m 2 σ cf m 2 x m 2 1 2 6 r m n s y m in which s is the sample standard deviation of the annual climate variable estimates and σ cf is the standard deviation of the climate factor the target is equal to the standard deviation of a product of two gaussian distributions in this way we can both include the year to year variability as well as uncertainty estimates on climate factors with regard to the extreme target climate variables defined here as variables that are not estimated on an annual basis but with respect to a return period or frequency f the target and realization values are calculated by 7 t m i d f x m cf m 8 r m i d f y m n where i is the rainfall intensity for a specific duration d and frequency f to fulfill the acceptance criterion each target variable must fulfill 9 re m n 2 σ cf m cf m where σ cf m is the standard deviation of the climate factor cf for climate variable m acceptance is thus allowed if the relative error is within the 95 confidence interval of the climate factor assuming a gaussian distribution the first step of the evaluation procedure certifies that each individual climate variable of each individual realization rain series complies with the acceptance criterion in the second step the average relative error based on the weighted mean of all climate variables is calculated by 10 re n w 1 r e 1 n w 2 r e 2 n w m r e m n wm are the weights for each individual climate variable m by ranking the estimated average relative errors the realizations with the lowest overall errors are identified and selected for further application the accepted realizations for each climate scenario are referred as an ensemble weights can be changed depending on the application of the generated rain series e g by weighting some seasons higher than other seasons or by weighting extremes higher than annual estimates the brute force sampling and evaluation procedure of climacs based on an initial acceptance criterion for each climate variable and the succeeding ranking by the weighted errors is inspired by the glue methodology beven and binley 1992 thorndahl et al 2008 2 5 stormwater detention pond design we use a stormwater detention design to exemplify the application of continuous climate projected rain series as this design is dependent on both the peak rain intensity over as specific rainfall duration as well as the antecedent conditions this mutual dependency displays the importance of the application of continuous rain series rather than single design events in estimating required storage volumes in the procedure for designing stormwater detention ponds we evaluate and compare the ensemble of generated rain series representing current and future climate conditions in order to investigate how both changes in rain intensities as well as interevent times affect the required design volumes the procedure furthermore serves the purpose to investigate the variability between the accepted realizations in each climate scenario ensemble and to explore differences in design volumes depending on the design parameters and choice of the climate scenario for the detention pond design a simple mass balance box model is formulated as a first order differential equation as e g presented in hvitved jacobsen et al 2010 11 dv t dt i t f r q out t where dv t dt is the increase in pond volume per time step dt i t is the rain intensity fr is the contributing catchment area and qout t is the outlet flow from the pond the time of runoff in the catchment is neglected since this is most often insignificant to the emptying time of the pond eq 11 is solved explicitly using backward euler 12 v t 1 v t i t f r q out δ t in which v is the stormwater pond volume and δt is a fixed time step the outlet flow is for simplicity reasons assumed to be a constant defined by an outlet flow rate a l s 1 ha 1 hence qout a fr the simulation of detention pond volumes is executed by a continuous simulation over the total period of each generated rain series thereby it is possible to simulate how the detention pond volume depends on antecedent rainfall and thereby by the emptying of the pond between rain events if the outlet flow rate is low the pond will empty at a slower pace and the antecedent rainfall period becomes relatively more important for low outlet flow rates than for larger ditto the storage pond volume corresponding to a specific return period is found by ranking the event separated volumes applying the california method as cited in e g rakhecha and singh 2009 and a linear interpolation between discrete return periods events are separated by the maximum emptying time or drain time of the pond 3 data the reference rain series applied exclusively for the stochastic generation of rain series in the present study is based on tipping bucket rain gauge recordings from a station in viby aarhus denmark the rain gauge is part of the rain gauge network of the danish water pollution committee sarup 2020 it covers the period from 1979 to 2018 the total observation period is 38 years when the rain series is corrected for outages rainfall data is filtered and quality controlled in regard to the recommendations in publication no 26 of the danish water pollution committee wpc 1999 the rain series contains 9253 individual rain events separated by at least one hour of dry weather and a minimum rain depth of 0 4 mm the temporal resolution of the rain series is 1 min the total observed rain depth corresponds to an average of 660 mm per year individual years with more than 30 days of total downtime are excluded from the annual statistics to remove potential biases in the annual and seasonal statistics individual rain events from the discarded years are however included in the pool of events similar to data from the approved years the calculated absolute mean and standard deviation values for the selected target climate variables as described in the following section are shown in table 1 with respect to the reference rain series correspondingly table 2 presents the same values however for the validation climate variables related to dry weather periods the selection of climate variables and climate factors for each individual climate variable is based on a processing of 20 euro cordex 0 11 ensembles for rcp 4 5 and 57 euro cordex 0 11 ensembles for rcp 8 5 jacob et al 2014 kotlarski et al 2014 prein et al 2016 thejll et al 2020 from this processing it is possible to derive the climate variables that relate to the annual and seasonal values of table 1 and 2 the derived climate factors and their uncertainty estimates represent means and standard deviations for the ratio between the projected period 2071 2100 with rcp 4 5 rcp 8 5 and the reference period 1981 2010 the climate projections are available from the danish climate atlas at https www dmi dk klima atlas data i klimaatlas in climacs only the relative projections between the reference period and the projected period are used it is also possible to use absolute climate variables as targets this is covered further in thorndahl and andersen 2021 the climate factors that relate to the extreme rainfall intensities and their durations and return periods table 1 are based on derived scenarios from the danish design practice wpc 2014 the derived climate factors from herein have their origin in the a1b climate scenario from the ensembles project van der linden and mitchell 2009 supplemented by other single rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 simulations reported in gregersen et al 2014 sørup et al 2016 due to problems of simulating in very fine timescales with climate models they are based on downscaled values from courser models the climate factors are derived to represent danish conditions and are in general agreement with the more recent and euro cordex 0 11 findings of berg et al 2019 which includes simulations at an hourly timescale the climate variables of table 1 are chosen to represent different rainfall conditions in comparison with thorndahl et al 2017 more climate variables are added to cover a wider range of applications within urban drainage design the annual maximum 5 day precipitation is added to include a target related to changes in consecutive rainfall days in an urban drainage context the 5 day precipitation has an impact on the continuous filling and thus the emptying time of stormwater detention ponds with low outflow rates furthermore rain intensities for very short durations of 10 min with return periods 2 and 10 years are added along with rain intensities over 360 min for the same return periods by introducing both shorter and longer durations than the original 60 min we accommodate a range of durations that covers most drainage system pipe design values in denmark in the generation of rain series representing the current climate climate factors corresponding to cf 1 are applied and the standard deviations of the climate factors used in eq 3 5 7 and 9 are derived from the absolute values the validation climate variables table 2 represent both the total number of dry days per season as well as the maximum contiguous number of dry days per season in this way the dry weather periods are parameterized to represent average seasonal values as well as seasonal extremes the absolute values are indeed sensitive to rain gauge station downtime and filtering of defective data therefore some potential uncertainty is associated with estimating these variables solely on the reference series as we do with the target climate variables to overcome this problem we establish the absolute values as well as the climate factors on average regional values from the danish climate atlas thejll et al 2020 the weights applied to estimate the average relative error are also presented in table 1 in this case we assign equal weights to the seasonal rainfall totals and weigh them with a total of 50 12 5 for each season the rest of the climate variables are given weights of 6 for the climate variables with the highest occurrence and 4 for climate variables with the lowest occurrence this weighting certifies that both seasonal and extreme values are represented however if one season or one specific extreme value is more important for particular applications there is the opportunity to change the weights accordingly it is important to notice that the weights are merely applied to rank the realizations that are already accepted based on the individual climate variable criterion eq 9 in the stochastic generation of rain series we assume stationarity over the period of a climatological normal corresponding to 30 years it is assumed that the period of the reference series 1979 2018 is climatological equivalent to the period of the current climate as applied in the eurocordex database 1981 2010 despite the findings by gregersen et al 2015 and willems 2013 any potential gradually increasing effects of climate change during the 38 years of the observed reference rain series is thus not considered 4 results 4 1 generation and evaluation of rain series a total of 50 000 rain series realizations are generated with seasonally variable random parameter values for interevent time distribution climate scaling and event sampling each of the generated rain series covers 39 years which is the same period as the approved period of the historical reference rain series for each of the climate scenarios the realizations that fulfill the relative error acceptance criteria are selected for further analyses concerning the current climate conditions resampled historical 1 049 of the 50 000 realizations fulfill the relative error criteria eq 9 for all of the 15 climate variables table 1 equivalently 145 and 253 realizations are accepted for the realizations of rcp 4 5 and 8 5 respectively the acceptance ratios are indeed low which is because we define an ultimate acceptance criterion that eq 9 must be kept for all 15 target variables many of the generated rain series are rejected because maybe one or two target variables are outside the acceptance range this is definitely a disadvantage of climacs which leads to more than 98 of the realizations being rejected on the positive side we do not compromise results by lowering the acceptance criteria and therefore maintain the stochasticity of each generated series as well as the statistical agreement with targets fig 2 shows time series plots of the historical reference series as well as the realizations of current climate and rcp 4 5 and 8 5 with the lowest weighted relative errors re eq 10 these time series serve as examples of the generated series we rank the top 100 realizations by the smallest weighted average relative errors eq 10 and append them to an ensemble for each climate scenario the weighted relative errors of the 100 member ensembles for the current climate and projections to 2100 with rcp 4 5 and 8 5 are presented in fig 3 the weighted average relative errors of the ensemble of the top 100 realizations are between 5 5 and 8 6 for the resampled current climate conditions resampled hist and 3 6 7 9 and 6 2 11 3 for rcp 4 5 and 8 5 respectively rcp 8 5 has larger relative errors due to larger standard deviation of the climate factors compared to rcp 4 5 the relative errors of winter and summer precipitation are generally larger than the relative errors of spring and autumn precipitation this is due to uncertainties related to solid precipitation in winter see further discussion of this below and more occurrences of extreme intensity events and larger climate factors in summer compared to the other seasons the absolute values for the targets and realization results of the rain series generation are presented in fig 4 as boxplots for the different climate parameters and climate scenarios the boxplots in muted colors represent the projection of each climate variable with mean and standard deviation of climate factors and absolute values from table 1 assuming gaussian distributions the boxplots in vivid colors display the results of the top 100 realizations for each climate scenario the boxplots show medians horizontal lines 25 and 75 quantiles and whiskers as 5 and 95 quantiles all top 100 realizations for each climate scenario and climate variable are pooled such that the boxplot illustrates the aggregated results of all realizations each boxplot span thus represents both the year to year variability the uncertainty related to the climate scenarios as defined by equations 5 and 6 as well as the variability between the realizations the year to year variability and the variability from ensemble member to ensemble member are discussed further in section 4 3 in general there is a good agreement between the median values of targets and realizations and the equivalent quantiles for all climate variables the realizations of winter precipitation have a smaller range than the target values which to some extent also appear in the realizations of annual precipitation this is most certainly due to larger uncertainties in winter precipitation observations due to the occurrence of solid precipitation in this period in an earlier attempt solid precipitation is removed from the reference rain series by temperature filtering unfortunately that leads to a severe underestimation of winter precipitation in the reference rain series and subsequent difficulties in fitting and accepting the realizations based on these evaluations it is decided to keep the data with potential solid precipitation in the reference data and accept larger uncertainties related to winter precipitation the statistics of dry weather periods which we do not apply as targets for the acceptance criteria but only serve as a validation of the accepted rain series for each climate scenario are presented in fig 5 as similar boxplots as in fig 4 as also shown in table 2 the climate change impacts on dry weather periods are generally less than 5 in both rcp 4 5 and 8 5 the most significant changes are the increase in the maximum dry summer period mddsu in rcp 8 5 which increases by 11 and the decrease in the maximum dry winter period mddwi of 8 in rcp 8 5 dry weather periods are generally larger in spring and summer than in autumn and winter both in current and future climate conditions by acknowledging the rather large year to year variability we consider the generated rain series to represent both current and future climate conditions well both with regards to the total number of dry days per season as well as the maximum dry periods per season this is also expected since we get good fits of the seasonal precipitation amounts fig 4 if it was the case that we obtained a bias in the seasonal precipitation between target and realization it would also show as a bias in the dry weather periods this justifies the exclusion of the dry weather periods as direct target variables fig 6 shows idf relationships for the top 100 realizations and targets of the extremes defined by return periods the idf relationships of the historical rain series reference are well represented by the realizations of the current climate hist resampled for the 2 and 10 year return levels there is a larger variability of the data concerning return periods larger than 10 years not shown but exemplified in the stormwater pond design fig 8 this generally is due to the sparse occurrence of the highest ranked events rank 1 4 in the observation simulation periods of 38 years from fig 6 it is also clear that there is a general increase in rain intensity from the current climate situation to the two future climate scenarios the top 100 realizations for each climate scenario present a substantial variability which is caused both by the stochasticity in the generation of rain series as well as the representation of uncertainties in climate projections this is analyzed further in the response analysis section 4 2 in conclusion the specified climate variables and their target values for both means standard deviations as well as extremes are well transferred to the stochastic realizations of current and future climate the generated rain series therefore statistically represent both current and future climate conditions to the degree that fulfill the acceptance criteria we define in climacs 4 2 evaluation of rain series ensembles in stormwater detention pond design the detention pond design is completed for a pond with a unit area of 1 ha of contributing catchment we apply the historical reference series as well as each member of the three ensembles representing current and future climate conditions as continuous inputs to the calculations of pond volumes eq 12 and rank the calculated volumes to estimate the volumes corresponding to specific return periods fig 7 presents an example of a continuous simulation of detention pond volume with the rcp8 5 rain series with the lowest weighted relative error same rain series as shown on the bottom panel of fig 2 the highest ranking design volumes are indicated by their respective return periods the return period for the design volume is initially selected as 5 years corresponding to the engineering practice of many danish municipalities wpc 2007 the required pond volume is estimated for the different rain series with an outlet flow rate of 0 5 1 0 and 5 0 l s 1 ha 1 corresponding to 0 18 0 36 and 1 8 mm h respectively these values represent typical outlet flow rates specified in regulatory permits given by danish water authorities when discharging to receiving waters with different sizes and capacities jensen et al 2020 a maximum outlet flow rate of 0 5 l s 1 ha 1 will typically be permitted discharging to a small stream whereas 5 0 l s 1 ha 1 will represent a robust large stream or river fig 8 shows the calculated detention pond volumes for the different climate scenarios and the three initially selected outlet flow rates and for a fixed return period of 5 years the ranges of the boxplots represent the ensemble variability generally there is little difference between the volumes obtained from historical reference and median of the resampled which indicates that the resampled rain series on average represent the current climate well the increase in rain intensity is evident for the two climate scenarios the reason that the required volumes are smaller for increasing outlet flow rates is that the detention pond with a larger outlet flow rate will empty faster than with a smaller outlet flow rate the design with smaller outlet rates will therefore consist of many succeeding coupled smaller rain events whereas the pond design with larger flow rates is constituted by larger intensity single events this is also reflected in the emptying time of the ponds table 3 which are shown to last up to more than 20 days for very low outlet flow rates there is significant variability of the detention pond volumes for the top 100 realizations fig 8 this variability also depends on the return period and to illustrate this the required pond volumes are estimated as a function of return periods with a fixed outlet flow rate of 1 l s 1 ha 1 in fig 9 as typically seen in extreme event analysis there is an increase in variability as a function of return periods due to the ranking procedure and less data with increasing return periods this illustrates the importance of having an ensemble of rain series to apply in the detention pond design process to evaluate the uncertainty related to the design in fig 8 it is observed that with an increase in outlet flow rate the difference between the current and the future climate projections becomes larger this is studied further in fig 10 where the mean increase in required detention pond volumes between current represented by the mean of the resampled rain series and future climates are plotted as a function of outlet flow rate this shows an increase in required volume from current to future climate conditions of approx 18 rcp 4 5 and 27 rcp 8 5 for outlet flow rates of 0 5 l s 1 ha 1 up to 29 rcp 4 5 and 44 rcp 8 5 for outlet flow rates of 8 l s 1 ha 1 the fact that the impact of climate change is less for the smaller outlet flow rates is found in the change of distribution of rain in future climate it is primarily the summer rainfall that constitutes the design rainfall the total summer rainfall changes little in the future climate and at the same time the extremes will become significantly larger this is even more significant in rcp 8 5 than in rcp 4 5 these changes in rainfall patterns will allow for more time between individual events which is also shown by the climate factors of the summer dry weather periods a larger interevent time will work in favor of smaller outlet flow rates since the pond design with larger outlet flow rates is more dependent on single events the impact of the projected extreme events becomes more significant rcp 8 5 has larger changes in peak intensity and even less total summer rainfall compared to rcp 4 5 and therefore the mean increase curves of fig 10 diverge as a function of increasing outlet flow rate 5 discussion based on the evaluation of the generated rain series on climate variables section 4 1 and the application of rain series ensembles in stormwater pond design section 4 2 it is interesting to consider and discuss the ensemble size in many practical design applications it might be too comprehensive to apply ensembles with 100 members for each climate scenario especially if these practical applications are using integrated model simulations of large and complex drainage systems it is however difficult to recommend a smaller ensemble of rain series or to select individual rain series that represent a specific quantile without considering each climate variable or other derived variables relevant for the application in question since the generated rain series are stochastic a single ensemble member rain series might represent the upper distribution quantile for one climate variable and a lower quantile for another climate variable a selection of an ensemble with fewer members or even a selection of ensemble members to represent e g the mean or a specific quantile must rely on a specific derived rainfall variable if for example the 60 min rainfall intensity is identified as the most critical rainfall duration for a specific part of a drainage system the reduction of the ensemble or the selection of specific members should be done based on the statistics of the 60 min rainfall if on the other hand the application depends on multiple variables or critical variables that have not been identified beforehand it is recommended to apply the full ensemble to propagate the uncertainty of the climate projections through the application statistics of the simulated model response can then subsequently be derived and design decisions can be made based on the uncertainty evaluation of the system response rather than on the rainfall input 6 conclusion the current need for climate projected continuous long term rain series for urban drainage design is provided by the development of climacs the method provides a novel stochastic resampling of individual rain events interevent time and climate scaling based on one single historical reference rain series three ensembles each with 100 members are developed to represent current climate conditions as well as projections to the period 2071 2100 with rcp 4 5 and 8 5 respectively the ensemble members are selected according to a minimization of the relative error between the 15 target climate variables and realizations of generated rain series it is possible to generate rain series that fit both seasonal precipitation and dry weather means and standard deviations as well as extremes considering both year to year variabilities as well as the uncertainty of climate projections of climate variables due to large uncertainties in the projections of the 15 climate variables the variability of the generated rain series also becomes large in the application of the generated rain series for urban drainage design purposes it is therefore important to consider the ensemble variability to evaluate the uncertainty related to the design and climate projection climacs has a general application within urban drainage design that requires long term continuous rain series to represent the complexity of drainage system response based on rainfall loads this is illustrated by the design of stormwater detention ponds where continuous rain series are needed as inputs to simulate the effects of antecedent rainfall conditions that is the emptying of the pond between rain events by varying the outlet flow rate from the detention pond the design volume becomes differently dependent on the continuity of the rain series with a large outlet flow rate the design volume is more or less dependent on single events for smaller outlet flow rates the pond does not empty between events and therefore becomes more dependent on multiple successive events and the interevent time in the future climate the pond volume therefore becomes dependent on the projection of dry weather periods as well as the increase in the design rainfall intensity this complexity illustrates the need for a continuous climate projected rain series that can include heterogeneity in the projection of rainfall to represent multiple climate variables seasonal variability representation of extremes and changes in interevent time or dry

4219,climate projected continuous rain series are required for urban drainage design and analysis outputs from regional climate models are yet insufficient in quality and resolution for this purpose here we introduce a novel method climacs climate projection of measured precipitation series for stochastic climate projection of point rain series for urban drainage design it is developed and evaluated to represent current climate conditions as well as projections for the period 2071 2100 with rcp scenarios 4 5 and 8 5 climacs includes seasonal stochastic resampling of individual rain events and rainfall intermittency as well as climate scaling fifteen climate variables representing multiple changes in the future rainfall are selected and projected to target future conditions realizations of the resampled and stochastically generated rain series are ranked and selected according to the minimum relative error between realization and target to give an insight into the uncertainty of the climate projection as well as year to year variability of precipitation climate variables an ensemble of the top 100 realizations for each climate scenario is selected for further analysis it is concluded that the ensembles represent the future conditions well however with a large variability due to the uncertainties in climate projection with the aim of showing the impact in urban drainage system design a stormwater detention pond design with multiple design parameters and climate scenarios is demonstrated the pond design results show a significant difference in required pond volume depending on the design parameters and the choice of climate scenario which emphasizes the need for climate projected continuous rain series for urban design purposes as an alternative to design storms keywords urban drainage design climate projection stochastic rainfall generation continuous rain series storm detention water pond ensemble modelling 1 introduction in design and planning of urban drainage systems it is crucial to be able to give an estimate of the future loading of the drainage system in order to certify a long lifetime of the designed systems the impacts of how global warming changes precipitation patterns therefore have to be taken into account in the projection of climate change for northern europe it is well known that the most high intensity rainfall will increase and that the average annual precipitation will increase this is the case for all rcp scenarios kovats et al 2014 the climate changes might also cause a shift in the annual precipitation patterns one example for denmark is that the summer precipitation is expected to decrease or remain at the same level in 2071 2100 as in the current climate conditions 1981 2010 at the same time the heavy rain events are expected to increase by some 30 40 resulting in longer drought periods between events thejll et al 2020 small or upstream parts of drainage systems are most commonly designed with idf curves or design storms where rain intensities for a given short duration with a given return period are multiplied by a contributing area to assess a maximum flow corresponding to the specified return period cf the rational method kuichling 1889 the design rainfall can easily be climate projected by multiplying the rainfall intensity with a climate factor that represents the increase in rainfall intensity for short heavy rain events for larger systems or downstream parts where branches confluence and flow are regulated by pumps detention ponds weirs etc flow patterns become more complex the assumption of unity between the return period of the rain and the return period of the flow is therefore not necessarily in agreement rather than using design storms design and impact analysis of complex drainage systems are therefore often done with numerical models that simulate flow with inputs from continuous rain series schaarup jensen et al 2009 thorndahl 2009 thorndahl et al 2008 the return periods of flow or water levels exceeding specified thresholds can hereby be estimated as part of the design process where the design does not only depend on the peak rainfall intensity of the rain over a specified duration but on multiple combinations of rain intensities with different durations as well as regulated flows the linear scaling with regard to climate change also falls short it is necessary to produce continuous rain series that represent the future rain patterns e g by scaling the extremes and less intensive rain differently from each other moreover it is important to represent how the dry periods between events change with changing climate conditions this applies in situations where runoff peak flows etc dependent on the antecedent soil moisture conditions nielsen et al 2019 pathiraja et al 2012 or the design of stormwater detention ponds where the emptying time between rain events is crucial for required volumes in a broader urban drainage context it is essential to be able to calculate loads on receiving waters either from combined or separate sewer systems to do this correctly the yearly and seasonal precipitation amounts also have to match future climate conditions this can only be achieved by developing climate projected continuous rain series global circulation models with different forcings of climate gas concentrations can represent future global warming and thereby changes in climate by deriving relevant boundary conditions from the global models regional climate models can be applied to simulate the impacts of climate change on regional scales this includes the projection of the changes in precipitation in comparison with the observations or rainfall statistics used for urban drainage design or impact analysis the regional climate models are however biased and in course temporal and spatial resolutions it is therefore widely recognized to apply outputs from regional climate models to statistically downscale climate changes to sufficient scales willems et al 2012 there are different approaches to statistical downscaling e g weather typing van uytven et al 2020a willems and vrac 2011 stochastic rainfall generation burton et al 2008 chen et al 2021 haberlandt et al 2015 kim and olivera 2011 park et al 2021 or methods that modify or perturbate time series often referred as change factor based methods e g ntegeka et al 2014 olsson et al 2009 sørup et al 2017 sunyer et al 2015 van uytven et al 2020b argued that the change factor based methods have advantages over rainfall stochastic rainfall generators since they do not contain stochastic elements and therefore can produce one single perturbation of a rain series rather than a stochastic ensemble in this paper we argue for the opposite namely those stochastic rainfall generators have the advantage to simulate an ensemble that can represent the uncertainty in the climate projections of rain series and due to the stochastic features they can be targeted through specific applications in urban drainage design and impact analyses we present a stochastic rainfall generator procedure climacs climate projection of measured precipitation series that can generate a continuous climate projected rain series for urban drainage design and impact analyses a former version is presented in the hess publication event based stochastic point rainfall resampling for statistical replication and climate projection of historical rainfall series by thorndahl et al 2017 and has been evaluated along with other methods in sørup et al 2018 and de niel et al 2019 compared to thorndahl et al 2017 the procedure is further developed and improved with regards to simulating yearly variability implementation of uncertainties in climate projections as well as new stochastic generation and evaluation procedures that make the stochastic procedure faster and more consistent in addition to the targeting of rain series to statistically represent climate variables relevant for precipitation climacs also features validation on the dry weather periods between rainfall events climacs applies new processing of climate model ensembles from the eurocordex database for both rcp 4 5 and 8 5 here we aim to present and evaluate the new features of the improved procedure climacs produces ensembles of stochastically sampled rain events the idea is not to produce rain series that match the true climate and precipitation pattern for a given period but to create rain series that statistically represent rainfall for a given period and which can be used for the design of hydrological systems e g urban drainage systems climacs can provide rain series representing current climate conditions as well as future conditions projected by different climate scenarios the former is considered as a validation of the procedure when the reference rain series and a resampled rain series statistically are in agreement it is important to emphasize that each stochastic realization of a rain series is different the objective of this paper is therefore also to investigate the ensemble variability between generated rain series and to assess how large an ensemble is required in a given design process to investigate and compare the generated rain series under different hydrological design conditions and climate conditions we apply a simple stormwater detention pond design routine that estimates the required pond volume for a given unit area and return period by varying the outlet flow rate from the detention pond the design volume becomes differently dependent on the continuity of the rain series and thus the time between rain events the difference in detention pond design volume is investigated and compared for both current and future climate conditions other applications of climacs rain series as inputs to urban hydrological models of integrated systems e g to simulate flooding surcharge combined sewer overflow is also tested as part of the evaluation of climacs but not reported here the paper is structured as follows in section 2 1 the stochastic procedure and the novel features are presented in section 2 2 the method for evaluating the generated time series in detention pond design is presented the rainfall data and climate model projections applied to exemplify the procedure are presented in section 3 results of the evaluation of both rainfall statistics and detention pond design are presented in section 4 section 5 features a discussion of the ensemble size related to urban drainage design conclusions are provided in section 6 2 methods 2 1 stochastic generation and evaluation of rain series the procedure for generating both resampled rain series representing the current climate and climate projected rain series representing a given future climate scenario is presented in the following section for specific details on the procedure you can refer to thorndahl et al 2017 and the explanations are limited here to present a general understanding of the procedure s steps fig 1 as well as emphasize and detail the improvements of the method climacs can run in two modes single station mode where rain events are sampled from a single historical rain series referred as the reference rain series from hereon and fitted to the statistics or projections of the same rain series or in a multiple station mode thorndahl and andersen 2021 where events are resampled from multiple historical rain series and fitted to regional rainfall statistics and climate projections where the single station mode will generate a rain series representative for the location of the reference rain series the multiple station mode can generate a rain series to represent a random location as long as the regional rainfall statistics and climate projections are available as targets in this paper we limit the description to the single station mode the stochastic generation procedure therefore exclusively samples rain events from the original reference rain series it is a key feature in climacs that the stochastic sampling and climate scaling are split into individual seasons winter spring summer and autumn which allows for different climate projections depending on the season we apply brute force sampling of rain events interevent time and climate scaling which is stochastic and unconditional on the past climacs will generate numerous rain series and the concept is that the posterior evaluation procedure determines if each individual realization should be accepted or rejected based on the statistics of a number of target climate variables these target climate variables are solely related to precipitation and serve as evaluation indicators throughout the paper due to the brute force randomization the greater majority of series are rejected due to too large errors on one or more of the target variables the evaluation and accept reject procedure is based on relative errors between realization and targets related to both annual and seasonal statistics as well as extreme statistics this ensures that the minority of the generated series that in fact comply with the acceptance criteria has low errors on multiple statistical parameters and therefore can represent real rainfall statistics for either the current climate or projections of the future climate 2 2 alternating stochastic sampling of single rain event and interevent time rainfall intermittency interevent time is stochastically sampled from a two component mixed exponential probability density function for each season thorndahl et al 2017 the probability distribution has three parameters for each of the four seasons for replicating the current climate the parameters are assessed by fitting the reference rain series in order for the climate projected rain series to include different interevent time distributions the three parameters for each season are sampled randomly from a uniform distribution with fixed upper and lower boundaries this allows for a shift in interevent times e g to accommodate for longer drought periods or periods with an increased frequency of event occurrences in the future climate rain events are sampled randomly from the pool of seasonally grouped historical events from the reference rain series and each event is treated as an independent event other studies have applied markovian processes e g basinger et al 2010 fowler et al 2005 or even more complex weather generators e g kim and onof 2020 peleg et al 2017 to introduce or simulate interevent dependency since the objective of climacs is to produce continuous rain series which are statistically valid for urban drainage design and not to reproduce real rainfall the interevent dependency is neglected and the continuity of the individual rain events and interevent times are evaluated seasonally by the target climate variables the discrete stochastic sampling of individual rain events to produce continuous rain series is stochastic and unconditional on the past and can thus be described as a non markovian process therefore it is crucial to statistically evaluate the generated series and to reject realizations that do not comply with the acceptance criteria for each climate variable we allow for random sampling of the same event multiple times unlike other studies e g sørup et al 2017 there is no grouping by rainfall intensity or total rain depth of the individual events prior to the random sampling this makes the method flexible in terms of sampling from the complete distribution of events without introducing assumptions on the grouping the disadvantage of this approach is that many generated rain series have to be rejected due to low performance scores or high relative errors on one or more target climate variables this is elaborated in section 4 1 the alternating sampling of rain events and interevent times is repeated until the desired length of the generated rain series is obtained 2 3 climate scaling in the generated continuous rain series climate scaling is implemented by a linear scaling of the rain intensity i a scale factor c for each season is calculated using a first order function with a contribution from a scale factor β which is drawn randomly from a uniform distribution for each season and a contribution α also sampled from a seasonal uniform distribution depending on the fitted two component mixed exponential cumulative probability f i of rain intensity for the season in question 1 c i α f i β the scaling with regard to intensity allows for different change factors for different intensities and gives more variability between the generated rain series an example of a scale factor from a set of randomly selected parameter values for a given season could be β 1 09 and α 0 05 the scale factor c would therefore range between 1 09 for f i 0 and 1 14 for f i 1 the scaling factor c is different from the climate factor cf defined in the evaluation procedure and given in table 1 the latter serves as the projection of the individual target variables whereas the former serves as a stochastic input to the climate scaling the linear scaling of rain intensities is inspired by the delta change method as applied in olsson et al 2009 in which the scaling depends on the intensity distribution compared to a static climate projection e g sørup et al 2017 which might have been implemented using selected climate factors from table 1 directly as scaling parameters the linear scaling creates a dynamic climate projection it allows for the climate scale factor c i to be both smaller and larger than 1 and since parameters α and β are drawn randomly for each season there is a very large flexibility in the scaling procedure the climate scaling however is very dependent on the succeeding evaluation and rejection of series with too large relative errors the brute force approach in which event sampling and scaling parameters are consistently randomized requires the generation of many realizations to obtain a few that comply with acceptance criteria 2 4 evaluation procedure a central part of the stochastic generation of rain series is the evaluation of the generated series according to the specified target climate variables and how the weights of the different targets are applied to calculate the metrics for each individual rain series realization the criterion for accepting a rain series realization is twofold initially each individual target variable has to fit within a specified range of each target defined by the relative error and secondly the overall weighted relative error of the realization must satisfy a specified acceptance criterion the applied target variables are presented in table 1 along with the applied weights the developed methodology has no upper limit with regard to the number of target variables and other variables might be added or replaced if other or better climate variables become available in this paper however we limit the target climate variables to the ones presented in table 1 the climate variables presented in table 2 are related to the dry weather periods between rainfall in this case they are used as validation variables but could also have been equally implemented as targets and weights the interevent times that we sample as part of the alternating procedure are fully stochastic and therefore independent from the projections of dry weather periods furthermore the interevent times are at a minutely timescale as the rain series the dry weather periods are estimated in days although interevent times and dry weather periods indeed represent the same we choose to distinguish between them since the interevent times are used as part of the input for generating rain series and the dry weather periods are used as part of the validation procedure compared to the methodology presented in thorndahl et al 2017 an improved metric of defining the acceptance range for each target variable is developed it is hereby possible to include both variabilities from year to year for the target variables defined annually as well as the uncertainty estimates of the climate projections of the individual target variables for each climate variable m the relative error re for each realization n is calculated as 2 re m n t m r m n t m in which t is the target value and r is the corresponding value based on the realizations in the present climate simulations the target value is an absolute value for a given climate variable e g the mean summer precipitation in the case of the evaluation of climate projected rain series the target value is the absolute value multiplied by the climate factor cf of the climate variable in question for climate variables defined with annual values e g seasonal precipitation number of days with precipitation over a specific threshold etc the relative error term is calculated both as a mean for the period of the rain series as well as the standard deviations of the annual values the target and the realization value related to the means are calculated by 3 t m x m cf m 4 r m n y m n in which x and y are the annual climate variable estimates for the reference rain series and the realization rain series respectively the target t and the realization value r related to the standard deviations are calculated by 5 t m s x m 2 σ cf m 2 s x m 2 cf m 2 σ cf m 2 x m 2 1 2 6 r m n s y m in which s is the sample standard deviation of the annual climate variable estimates and σ cf is the standard deviation of the climate factor the target is equal to the standard deviation of a product of two gaussian distributions in this way we can both include the year to year variability as well as uncertainty estimates on climate factors with regard to the extreme target climate variables defined here as variables that are not estimated on an annual basis but with respect to a return period or frequency f the target and realization values are calculated by 7 t m i d f x m cf m 8 r m i d f y m n where i is the rainfall intensity for a specific duration d and frequency f to fulfill the acceptance criterion each target variable must fulfill 9 re m n 2 σ cf m cf m where σ cf m is the standard deviation of the climate factor cf for climate variable m acceptance is thus allowed if the relative error is within the 95 confidence interval of the climate factor assuming a gaussian distribution the first step of the evaluation procedure certifies that each individual climate variable of each individual realization rain series complies with the acceptance criterion in the second step the average relative error based on the weighted mean of all climate variables is calculated by 10 re n w 1 r e 1 n w 2 r e 2 n w m r e m n wm are the weights for each individual climate variable m by ranking the estimated average relative errors the realizations with the lowest overall errors are identified and selected for further application the accepted realizations for each climate scenario are referred as an ensemble weights can be changed depending on the application of the generated rain series e g by weighting some seasons higher than other seasons or by weighting extremes higher than annual estimates the brute force sampling and evaluation procedure of climacs based on an initial acceptance criterion for each climate variable and the succeeding ranking by the weighted errors is inspired by the glue methodology beven and binley 1992 thorndahl et al 2008 2 5 stormwater detention pond design we use a stormwater detention design to exemplify the application of continuous climate projected rain series as this design is dependent on both the peak rain intensity over as specific rainfall duration as well as the antecedent conditions this mutual dependency displays the importance of the application of continuous rain series rather than single design events in estimating required storage volumes in the procedure for designing stormwater detention ponds we evaluate and compare the ensemble of generated rain series representing current and future climate conditions in order to investigate how both changes in rain intensities as well as interevent times affect the required design volumes the procedure furthermore serves the purpose to investigate the variability between the accepted realizations in each climate scenario ensemble and to explore differences in design volumes depending on the design parameters and choice of the climate scenario for the detention pond design a simple mass balance box model is formulated as a first order differential equation as e g presented in hvitved jacobsen et al 2010 11 dv t dt i t f r q out t where dv t dt is the increase in pond volume per time step dt i t is the rain intensity fr is the contributing catchment area and qout t is the outlet flow from the pond the time of runoff in the catchment is neglected since this is most often insignificant to the emptying time of the pond eq 11 is solved explicitly using backward euler 12 v t 1 v t i t f r q out δ t in which v is the stormwater pond volume and δt is a fixed time step the outlet flow is for simplicity reasons assumed to be a constant defined by an outlet flow rate a l s 1 ha 1 hence qout a fr the simulation of detention pond volumes is executed by a continuous simulation over the total period of each generated rain series thereby it is possible to simulate how the detention pond volume depends on antecedent rainfall and thereby by the emptying of the pond between rain events if the outlet flow rate is low the pond will empty at a slower pace and the antecedent rainfall period becomes relatively more important for low outlet flow rates than for larger ditto the storage pond volume corresponding to a specific return period is found by ranking the event separated volumes applying the california method as cited in e g rakhecha and singh 2009 and a linear interpolation between discrete return periods events are separated by the maximum emptying time or drain time of the pond 3 data the reference rain series applied exclusively for the stochastic generation of rain series in the present study is based on tipping bucket rain gauge recordings from a station in viby aarhus denmark the rain gauge is part of the rain gauge network of the danish water pollution committee sarup 2020 it covers the period from 1979 to 2018 the total observation period is 38 years when the rain series is corrected for outages rainfall data is filtered and quality controlled in regard to the recommendations in publication no 26 of the danish water pollution committee wpc 1999 the rain series contains 9253 individual rain events separated by at least one hour of dry weather and a minimum rain depth of 0 4 mm the temporal resolution of the rain series is 1 min the total observed rain depth corresponds to an average of 660 mm per year individual years with more than 30 days of total downtime are excluded from the annual statistics to remove potential biases in the annual and seasonal statistics individual rain events from the discarded years are however included in the pool of events similar to data from the approved years the calculated absolute mean and standard deviation values for the selected target climate variables as described in the following section are shown in table 1 with respect to the reference rain series correspondingly table 2 presents the same values however for the validation climate variables related to dry weather periods the selection of climate variables and climate factors for each individual climate variable is based on a processing of 20 euro cordex 0 11 ensembles for rcp 4 5 and 57 euro cordex 0 11 ensembles for rcp 8 5 jacob et al 2014 kotlarski et al 2014 prein et al 2016 thejll et al 2020 from this processing it is possible to derive the climate variables that relate to the annual and seasonal values of table 1 and 2 the derived climate factors and their uncertainty estimates represent means and standard deviations for the ratio between the projected period 2071 2100 with rcp 4 5 rcp 8 5 and the reference period 1981 2010 the climate projections are available from the danish climate atlas at https www dmi dk klima atlas data i klimaatlas in climacs only the relative projections between the reference period and the projected period are used it is also possible to use absolute climate variables as targets this is covered further in thorndahl and andersen 2021 the climate factors that relate to the extreme rainfall intensities and their durations and return periods table 1 are based on derived scenarios from the danish design practice wpc 2014 the derived climate factors from herein have their origin in the a1b climate scenario from the ensembles project van der linden and mitchell 2009 supplemented by other single rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 simulations reported in gregersen et al 2014 sørup et al 2016 due to problems of simulating in very fine timescales with climate models they are based on downscaled values from courser models the climate factors are derived to represent danish conditions and are in general agreement with the more recent and euro cordex 0 11 findings of berg et al 2019 which includes simulations at an hourly timescale the climate variables of table 1 are chosen to represent different rainfall conditions in comparison with thorndahl et al 2017 more climate variables are added to cover a wider range of applications within urban drainage design the annual maximum 5 day precipitation is added to include a target related to changes in consecutive rainfall days in an urban drainage context the 5 day precipitation has an impact on the continuous filling and thus the emptying time of stormwater detention ponds with low outflow rates furthermore rain intensities for very short durations of 10 min with return periods 2 and 10 years are added along with rain intensities over 360 min for the same return periods by introducing both shorter and longer durations than the original 60 min we accommodate a range of durations that covers most drainage system pipe design values in denmark in the generation of rain series representing the current climate climate factors corresponding to cf 1 are applied and the standard deviations of the climate factors used in eq 3 5 7 and 9 are derived from the absolute values the validation climate variables table 2 represent both the total number of dry days per season as well as the maximum contiguous number of dry days per season in this way the dry weather periods are parameterized to represent average seasonal values as well as seasonal extremes the absolute values are indeed sensitive to rain gauge station downtime and filtering of defective data therefore some potential uncertainty is associated with estimating these variables solely on the reference series as we do with the target climate variables to overcome this problem we establish the absolute values as well as the climate factors on average regional values from the danish climate atlas thejll et al 2020 the weights applied to estimate the average relative error are also presented in table 1 in this case we assign equal weights to the seasonal rainfall totals and weigh them with a total of 50 12 5 for each season the rest of the climate variables are given weights of 6 for the climate variables with the highest occurrence and 4 for climate variables with the lowest occurrence this weighting certifies that both seasonal and extreme values are represented however if one season or one specific extreme value is more important for particular applications there is the opportunity to change the weights accordingly it is important to notice that the weights are merely applied to rank the realizations that are already accepted based on the individual climate variable criterion eq 9 in the stochastic generation of rain series we assume stationarity over the period of a climatological normal corresponding to 30 years it is assumed that the period of the reference series 1979 2018 is climatological equivalent to the period of the current climate as applied in the eurocordex database 1981 2010 despite the findings by gregersen et al 2015 and willems 2013 any potential gradually increasing effects of climate change during the 38 years of the observed reference rain series is thus not considered 4 results 4 1 generation and evaluation of rain series a total of 50 000 rain series realizations are generated with seasonally variable random parameter values for interevent time distribution climate scaling and event sampling each of the generated rain series covers 39 years which is the same period as the approved period of the historical reference rain series for each of the climate scenarios the realizations that fulfill the relative error acceptance criteria are selected for further analyses concerning the current climate conditions resampled historical 1 049 of the 50 000 realizations fulfill the relative error criteria eq 9 for all of the 15 climate variables table 1 equivalently 145 and 253 realizations are accepted for the realizations of rcp 4 5 and 8 5 respectively the acceptance ratios are indeed low which is because we define an ultimate acceptance criterion that eq 9 must be kept for all 15 target variables many of the generated rain series are rejected because maybe one or two target variables are outside the acceptance range this is definitely a disadvantage of climacs which leads to more than 98 of the realizations being rejected on the positive side we do not compromise results by lowering the acceptance criteria and therefore maintain the stochasticity of each generated series as well as the statistical agreement with targets fig 2 shows time series plots of the historical reference series as well as the realizations of current climate and rcp 4 5 and 8 5 with the lowest weighted relative errors re eq 10 these time series serve as examples of the generated series we rank the top 100 realizations by the smallest weighted average relative errors eq 10 and append them to an ensemble for each climate scenario the weighted relative errors of the 100 member ensembles for the current climate and projections to 2100 with rcp 4 5 and 8 5 are presented in fig 3 the weighted average relative errors of the ensemble of the top 100 realizations are between 5 5 and 8 6 for the resampled current climate conditions resampled hist and 3 6 7 9 and 6 2 11 3 for rcp 4 5 and 8 5 respectively rcp 8 5 has larger relative errors due to larger standard deviation of the climate factors compared to rcp 4 5 the relative errors of winter and summer precipitation are generally larger than the relative errors of spring and autumn precipitation this is due to uncertainties related to solid precipitation in winter see further discussion of this below and more occurrences of extreme intensity events and larger climate factors in summer compared to the other seasons the absolute values for the targets and realization results of the rain series generation are presented in fig 4 as boxplots for the different climate parameters and climate scenarios the boxplots in muted colors represent the projection of each climate variable with mean and standard deviation of climate factors and absolute values from table 1 assuming gaussian distributions the boxplots in vivid colors display the results of the top 100 realizations for each climate scenario the boxplots show medians horizontal lines 25 and 75 quantiles and whiskers as 5 and 95 quantiles all top 100 realizations for each climate scenario and climate variable are pooled such that the boxplot illustrates the aggregated results of all realizations each boxplot span thus represents both the year to year variability the uncertainty related to the climate scenarios as defined by equations 5 and 6 as well as the variability between the realizations the year to year variability and the variability from ensemble member to ensemble member are discussed further in section 4 3 in general there is a good agreement between the median values of targets and realizations and the equivalent quantiles for all climate variables the realizations of winter precipitation have a smaller range than the target values which to some extent also appear in the realizations of annual precipitation this is most certainly due to larger uncertainties in winter precipitation observations due to the occurrence of solid precipitation in this period in an earlier attempt solid precipitation is removed from the reference rain series by temperature filtering unfortunately that leads to a severe underestimation of winter precipitation in the reference rain series and subsequent difficulties in fitting and accepting the realizations based on these evaluations it is decided to keep the data with potential solid precipitation in the reference data and accept larger uncertainties related to winter precipitation the statistics of dry weather periods which we do not apply as targets for the acceptance criteria but only serve as a validation of the accepted rain series for each climate scenario are presented in fig 5 as similar boxplots as in fig 4 as also shown in table 2 the climate change impacts on dry weather periods are generally less than 5 in both rcp 4 5 and 8 5 the most significant changes are the increase in the maximum dry summer period mddsu in rcp 8 5 which increases by 11 and the decrease in the maximum dry winter period mddwi of 8 in rcp 8 5 dry weather periods are generally larger in spring and summer than in autumn and winter both in current and future climate conditions by acknowledging the rather large year to year variability we consider the generated rain series to represent both current and future climate conditions well both with regards to the total number of dry days per season as well as the maximum dry periods per season this is also expected since we get good fits of the seasonal precipitation amounts fig 4 if it was the case that we obtained a bias in the seasonal precipitation between target and realization it would also show as a bias in the dry weather periods this justifies the exclusion of the dry weather periods as direct target variables fig 6 shows idf relationships for the top 100 realizations and targets of the extremes defined by return periods the idf relationships of the historical rain series reference are well represented by the realizations of the current climate hist resampled for the 2 and 10 year return levels there is a larger variability of the data concerning return periods larger than 10 years not shown but exemplified in the stormwater pond design fig 8 this generally is due to the sparse occurrence of the highest ranked events rank 1 4 in the observation simulation periods of 38 years from fig 6 it is also clear that there is a general increase in rain intensity from the current climate situation to the two future climate scenarios the top 100 realizations for each climate scenario present a substantial variability which is caused both by the stochasticity in the generation of rain series as well as the representation of uncertainties in climate projections this is analyzed further in the response analysis section 4 2 in conclusion the specified climate variables and their target values for both means standard deviations as well as extremes are well transferred to the stochastic realizations of current and future climate the generated rain series therefore statistically represent both current and future climate conditions to the degree that fulfill the acceptance criteria we define in climacs 4 2 evaluation of rain series ensembles in stormwater detention pond design the detention pond design is completed for a pond with a unit area of 1 ha of contributing catchment we apply the historical reference series as well as each member of the three ensembles representing current and future climate conditions as continuous inputs to the calculations of pond volumes eq 12 and rank the calculated volumes to estimate the volumes corresponding to specific return periods fig 7 presents an example of a continuous simulation of detention pond volume with the rcp8 5 rain series with the lowest weighted relative error same rain series as shown on the bottom panel of fig 2 the highest ranking design volumes are indicated by their respective return periods the return period for the design volume is initially selected as 5 years corresponding to the engineering practice of many danish municipalities wpc 2007 the required pond volume is estimated for the different rain series with an outlet flow rate of 0 5 1 0 and 5 0 l s 1 ha 1 corresponding to 0 18 0 36 and 1 8 mm h respectively these values represent typical outlet flow rates specified in regulatory permits given by danish water authorities when discharging to receiving waters with different sizes and capacities jensen et al 2020 a maximum outlet flow rate of 0 5 l s 1 ha 1 will typically be permitted discharging to a small stream whereas 5 0 l s 1 ha 1 will represent a robust large stream or river fig 8 shows the calculated detention pond volumes for the different climate scenarios and the three initially selected outlet flow rates and for a fixed return period of 5 years the ranges of the boxplots represent the ensemble variability generally there is little difference between the volumes obtained from historical reference and median of the resampled which indicates that the resampled rain series on average represent the current climate well the increase in rain intensity is evident for the two climate scenarios the reason that the required volumes are smaller for increasing outlet flow rates is that the detention pond with a larger outlet flow rate will empty faster than with a smaller outlet flow rate the design with smaller outlet rates will therefore consist of many succeeding coupled smaller rain events whereas the pond design with larger flow rates is constituted by larger intensity single events this is also reflected in the emptying time of the ponds table 3 which are shown to last up to more than 20 days for very low outlet flow rates there is significant variability of the detention pond volumes for the top 100 realizations fig 8 this variability also depends on the return period and to illustrate this the required pond volumes are estimated as a function of return periods with a fixed outlet flow rate of 1 l s 1 ha 1 in fig 9 as typically seen in extreme event analysis there is an increase in variability as a function of return periods due to the ranking procedure and less data with increasing return periods this illustrates the importance of having an ensemble of rain series to apply in the detention pond design process to evaluate the uncertainty related to the design in fig 8 it is observed that with an increase in outlet flow rate the difference between the current and the future climate projections becomes larger this is studied further in fig 10 where the mean increase in required detention pond volumes between current represented by the mean of the resampled rain series and future climates are plotted as a function of outlet flow rate this shows an increase in required volume from current to future climate conditions of approx 18 rcp 4 5 and 27 rcp 8 5 for outlet flow rates of 0 5 l s 1 ha 1 up to 29 rcp 4 5 and 44 rcp 8 5 for outlet flow rates of 8 l s 1 ha 1 the fact that the impact of climate change is less for the smaller outlet flow rates is found in the change of distribution of rain in future climate it is primarily the summer rainfall that constitutes the design rainfall the total summer rainfall changes little in the future climate and at the same time the extremes will become significantly larger this is even more significant in rcp 8 5 than in rcp 4 5 these changes in rainfall patterns will allow for more time between individual events which is also shown by the climate factors of the summer dry weather periods a larger interevent time will work in favor of smaller outlet flow rates since the pond design with larger outlet flow rates is more dependent on single events the impact of the projected extreme events becomes more significant rcp 8 5 has larger changes in peak intensity and even less total summer rainfall compared to rcp 4 5 and therefore the mean increase curves of fig 10 diverge as a function of increasing outlet flow rate 5 discussion based on the evaluation of the generated rain series on climate variables section 4 1 and the application of rain series ensembles in stormwater pond design section 4 2 it is interesting to consider and discuss the ensemble size in many practical design applications it might be too comprehensive to apply ensembles with 100 members for each climate scenario especially if these practical applications are using integrated model simulations of large and complex drainage systems it is however difficult to recommend a smaller ensemble of rain series or to select individual rain series that represent a specific quantile without considering each climate variable or other derived variables relevant for the application in question since the generated rain series are stochastic a single ensemble member rain series might represent the upper distribution quantile for one climate variable and a lower quantile for another climate variable a selection of an ensemble with fewer members or even a selection of ensemble members to represent e g the mean or a specific quantile must rely on a specific derived rainfall variable if for example the 60 min rainfall intensity is identified as the most critical rainfall duration for a specific part of a drainage system the reduction of the ensemble or the selection of specific members should be done based on the statistics of the 60 min rainfall if on the other hand the application depends on multiple variables or critical variables that have not been identified beforehand it is recommended to apply the full ensemble to propagate the uncertainty of the climate projections through the application statistics of the simulated model response can then subsequently be derived and design decisions can be made based on the uncertainty evaluation of the system response rather than on the rainfall input 6 conclusion the current need for climate projected continuous long term rain series for urban drainage design is provided by the development of climacs the method provides a novel stochastic resampling of individual rain events interevent time and climate scaling based on one single historical reference rain series three ensembles each with 100 members are developed to represent current climate conditions as well as projections to the period 2071 2100 with rcp 4 5 and 8 5 respectively the ensemble members are selected according to a minimization of the relative error between the 15 target climate variables and realizations of generated rain series it is possible to generate rain series that fit both seasonal precipitation and dry weather means and standard deviations as well as extremes considering both year to year variabilities as well as the uncertainty of climate projections of climate variables due to large uncertainties in the projections of the 15 climate variables the variability of the generated rain series also becomes large in the application of the generated rain series for urban drainage design purposes it is therefore important to consider the ensemble variability to evaluate the uncertainty related to the design and climate projection climacs has a general application within urban drainage design that requires long term continuous rain series to represent the complexity of drainage system response based on rainfall loads this is illustrated by the design of stormwater detention ponds where continuous rain series are needed as inputs to simulate the effects of antecedent rainfall conditions that is the emptying of the pond between rain events by varying the outlet flow rate from the detention pond the design volume becomes differently dependent on the continuity of the rain series with a large outlet flow rate the design volume is more or less dependent on single events for smaller outlet flow rates the pond does not empty between events and therefore becomes more dependent on multiple successive events and the interevent time in the future climate the pond volume therefore becomes dependent on the projection of dry weather periods as well as the increase in the design rainfall intensity this complexity illustrates the need for a continuous climate projected rain series that can include heterogeneity in the projection of rainfall to represent multiple climate variables seasonal variability representation of extremes and changes in interevent time or dry
