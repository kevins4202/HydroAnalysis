losses from drainage water and the deep aquifer swat p was tested in a tile drained lowland catchment using a multi site calibration and validation approach swat reached a good statistical performance regarding discharge for all sub catchments and a daily time step as discharge was dominated by subsurface flow we optimized drp concentrations for the drainage water swat p the shallow aquifer swat swat p and the deep aquifer swat p and left other p related parameters at their default settings since they did not influence the model output drp losses were simulated at a monthly time step using swat and swat p the predictive power was weaker compared to discharge for both swat and swat p nevertheless swat p performed considerably better than swat additionally calibrated drp concentrations were unrealistically high for swat whereas calibrated drp concentrations reflected the prevailing conditions in the region using swat p the results indicated improved prediction accuracy for drp losses into streams by using swat p as well as a roughly realistic estimation of drp losses from tile drainage water further research is necessary to account for the temporal drp concentration

waters caused by nutrients mainly nitrogen and phosphorus p is a major environmental concern across the globe the eu water framework directive european parliament 2000 commits the european union member states to achieving good ecological conditions for all surface water bodies due to improved wastewater treatment the influence of p from point sources on the overall p losses has decreased considerably during the past decades in europe grizzetti et al 2012 kronvang et al 2005a pieterse et al 2003 germany behrendt et al 2002 and northeastern germany lung 2008 instead several researchers point to the increasing importance of agriculture dominated landscapes for p leaching e g carpenter et al 1998 gentry et al 2007 kronvang et al 2005a sharpley et al 1994 diffuse p transport pathways dominate these agriculture dominated areas and dissolved reactive phosphorus drp readily available for plants can be the dominant fraction of p vagstad et al 2001 in hilly or mountainous landscapes transported sediment and surface runoff are the dominant sources of particulate p leaching sharpley and smith 1990 in flatter landscapes such as our study region losses of soluble p through subsurface flow become important sims et al 1998 vertical p transport through the soil matrix is facilitated by sandy soils leading to increased drp concentrations in the groundwater chardon and schoumans 2007 peat soils might be susceptible to p leaching as well due to the mineralization of organic matter chardon and schoumans 2007 several studies point to the importance of tile drains as significant sources of p in agricultural catchments king et al 2015 radcliffe et al 2015 a variety of measures such as changes in soil and crop management buffer zones or constructed wetlands exist to reduce p input into surface water bodies kronvang et al 2005b schoumans et al 2014 the effect of these measures on the catchment scale can best be evaluated by eco hydrological models however proper use of these models requires the inclusion of all important p pathways radcliffe et al 2015 reviewed the applicability of nine models to simulate p losses in drained areas they concluded that only a few of the models are designed to simulate p losses via tile drainage water and depending on the model necessary processes and parameters need to be included and tested one potential candidate was the soil and water assessment tool swat arnold et al 1998 as a widely applied watershed model this model considers in its most recent version swat2012 rev 664 drp transport originating from point sources and diffuse sources namely surface runoff and shallow groundwater into streams however drp in tile drainage water has not been taken into account so far in addition swat divides groundwater into a shallow and a deep aquifer while a fixed drp concentration can be set for the shallow aquifer drp is not considered for the deep aquifer a number of recent swat studies in tile drained lowland catchments underestimated drp losses lam et al 2011 2012 lu et al 2015 and attributed this model behavior to missing drp routines for tile drains consequently lu et al 2016 developed a swat extension based on the langmuir isotherm to simulate drp leaching from tile drains into streams this approach seems straightforward but obtaining langmuir isotherm coefficients may be challenging in this paper we introduce an alternative approach to incorporating drp losses from tile drains and the deep aquifer we wrote swat routines that allow the user to specify drp concentrations in tile drainage water and the deep aquifer in the swat input files in addition the model output output hru output sub was extended to visualize drp loads in tile drains and the deep aquifer the modified swat model swat p was tested in a mesoscale tile drained lowland catchment in northeastern germany using eight streams and covering a time span of 20 years 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the warnow river basin is located in northeastern germany and is 3041km2 in size fig 1a the warnow discharges into the baltic sea near the city of rostock fig 1b gentle slopes characterize this lowland catchment with elevations ranging from sea level at the outlet to 146m a s l at the basin s boundary fig 1c the climate is atlantic influenced with a mean annual precipitation total of 647mm and a mean annual temperature of 9 1 c due to low winter temperatures the region is occasionally covered with snow in winter land use is dominated by arable land 58 forests 21 and grassland 13 fig 1d less prominent are wetlands 4 urban areas 3 and open water 1 dlr 2003 mineral soils are characteristic of the basin with a predominance of cambisols 40 and luvisols 30 fig 1e other important soil types are stagnosols 15 histosols 10 and gleysols 2 lung 2010 the geomorphology was formed by the glacial movement of the european continental ice sheet during the last ice age consequently the area is dotted with landscape elements typical to glacial ground and end moraines such as kettle holes a typical feature of the region is the presence of subsurface tile drains to improve soil moisture conditions fig 1f 18 of the catchment is estimated to be drained by tile drainage systems according to the current digital drainage map provided by the state department of environment nature conservation and geology of mecklenburg western pomerania subsurface drainage pipes were mainly installed under arable land with a naturally high groundwater table the drainage systems are usually several decades old whereby the exact location and dimensions are not always known 2 2 input data a digital elevation model with a 25 25m grid cell resolution lva 2000 formed the basis for delineating the catchment the subbasins and the river network weather data from four climate and 14 precipitation stations across the warnow basin obtained from the german weather service served as meteorological input variables corine land cover data dlr 2003 formed the basis of land use classification land use from the corine land cover data was assigned to the corresponding swat plant and land cover codes this procedure included assigning the most important crops in the region table 1 a soil map with a spatial resolution of 1 200 000 lung 2010 was used to specify soil types within the basin the statewide mecklenburg western pomerania map of tile drainage systems was analyzed for plausibility and eventually integrated into the swat model we delineated the warnow basin using arcgis 10 4 sp1 arcswat version 2012 10 4 19 it consists of 29 subbasins and consequently of 29 streams fig 1b 491 hrus were obtained to represent the spatial variability within the warnow basin by overlaying the land use type map the soil class map and the slope class map tile drainage was introduced as a fourth component in order to distinguish drained and non drained hrus to this end the tile drainage map was intersected with the soil map soils influenced by tile drainage were subsequently marked in the swat implemented soil database for 145 tile drained hrus tile drainage parameters were set as follows effective radius of tiles re sdr 5mm distance between two tiles sdrain sdr 13 000mm and depth of tiles ddrain mgt 1100mm according to on site experience tiemeyer et al 2007 land use classes 5 of the sub catchment area and soil classes 5 of the land use area were disregarded we constructed the model with one slope class for this lowland river basin the penmen monteith method was used to calculate evapotranspiration eight discharge gauges fig 1b run by the state department of agriculture and environment of mecklenburg western pomerania and corresponding daily discharge data from 1992 to 2011 were selected to calibrate and validate the discharge for two sub catchments nebel zarnow observed discharge data was only available from 2002 to 2011 we used the periods 1992 to 2001 nebel zarnow 2002 to 2006 for calibration and 2002 to 2011 nebel zarnow 2007 to 2011 for validation the years 1985 to 1991 served as warm up period drp concentrations and thus drp loadings as the product of discharge and drp concentration were available for the same period based on discrete samples in a bi weekly to monthly temporal resolution we used the r software package loadflex appling et al 2015 for daily load estimation this package offers several different approaches from which we applied the rloadest regression model that uses regression and maximum likelihood methods for load estimation for more details regarding the calculations see appling et al 2015 2 3 the swat p model discharge is calculated in swat as the sum of all flow components as follows 1 w y l d s u r q l a t q t i l e q g w q s h a l l o w g w q d e e p p o i n t where wyld is discharge surq is surface runoff latq is lateral flow tileq is tile flow gwq is groundwater flow from either the shallow or the deep aquifer and point is discharge from point sources such as waste water treatment plants the units are mm drp can be transported into the river network via surface runoff surq shallow aquifer gwq shallow and point sources point in the official swat model while the drp concentration in surface runoff is a function of various input parameters a time constant drp concentration needs to be set in order to model drp in the shallow groundwater the official swat version does not consider drp in tile drainage water or in the deep aquifer resulting in drp concentrations of 0mg l for these flow components therefore we modified the swat model swat p in such a way that the user can specify separate time constant drp concentrations for these two flow components tileq gwq deep at the hru level appendix a these concentrations were then converted into drp loadings the drp loadings for the deep aquifer and tile drainage water were added to the swat output files for this study we used swat2012 rev 659 the swat model is written in

intel xeon e5 system with the windows 10 operating system the swat p model is open source and can be obtained by the authors of this study to apply the swat p model drp concentrations for tile drainage water and deep groundwater need to be defined at the hru level in the input files appendix b the drp concentrations in tile drainage water and in the deep groundwater are specified in the groundwater input files gw two extra lines have been added to define values for the new variables tilep con drp concentration in tile drainage water and gwdminp drp concentration in the deep

calibration 2 4 1 hydrology based on previous swat studies in the same watershed koch et al 2013 and in a small catchment within the study area bauwe et al 2017 bauwe et al 2016 we selected 16 potentially relevant hydrological parameters for sensitivity analysis appendix d we performed a global sensitivity analysis based on latin hypercube generated parameters and 1000 runs to extract sensitive parameters using swat cup swat cup 2012 version 5 1 6 2 abbaspour 2014 finally nine parameters were selected for automatic calibration each sub catchment was calibrated automatically using sequential uncertainty fitting sufi 2 and nash sutcliffe efficiency nse as the objective function one iteration consisted of 1000 model runs after an iteration swat cup suggested new usually narrower parameter ranges to reduce the uncertainty and enhance the model performance these new parameters were implemented for the next iteration unless the suggested parameters had no physical meaning e g negative values in those cases the parameters were adjusted manually this procedure was repeated four to five times until no further improvement of model performance could be achieved we calibrated all sub catchments separately because they were not connected to each other afterwards we calibrated the basin outlet warnow by using the final parameters of the sub catchments and changed only parameter values for sub catchments that were not covered yet table 2 gives an overview of the calibrated parameters for each sub catchment discharge was mainly controlled by groundwater evidenced in the fact that four out of nine parameters entering the calibration routines were related to groundwater table 2 in addition one of the most important parameters for calibration typical to many swat projects was cn2 which had to be reduced for model optimization the parameter dep imp defines the depth to the impervious layer in the soil profile neitsch et al 2011 and generally has a large impact on the distribution of tile flow and groundwater flow bauwe et al 2016 the parameter esco calibrated in many swat studies controlled for evaporation and thus water balance rchrg dp was found to be a sensitive parameter as it partitions groundwater into the shallow and deep aquifer components hydrology was calibrated using the official swat model after calibration a model run was performed with the modified swat p model as well resulting in identical hydrological model output values 2 4 2 dissolved reactive phosphorus drp swat distinguishes between three different mineral p pools soluble active stable in the soil in order to obtain reasonable values in the active soil p pool we changed initial drp concentrations sol solp chm in the different soil layers from 5mg kg default to 40mg kg for agricultural land arable land pasture according to literature values mluv 2011 after the hydrology was calibrated we used swat cup to test the sensitivity of p related swat parameters on drp loadings using the official swat version in contrast to other studies in which several p related parameters were sensitive e g daloğlu et al 2012 mehdi et al 2015 molina navarro et al 2014 only the drp concentration in the shallow groundwater gwsolp gw significantly influenced the dynamics and magnitude of drp loads in the sub catchments consequently we left all p related parameters at their default levels and adjusted only the drp concentration in the shallow aquifer gwsolp gw automatically using swat cup for the official swat version this was performed for each sub catchment separately resulting in different optimized drp concentrations per sub catchment similar to this approach drp concentrations for the shallow aquifer the deep aquifer and the tile drainage water were adapted using swat cup for the swat p model version 3 results and discussion 3 1 hydrology 3 1 1 model performance swat reproduced the observed discharge well for the basin outlet rostock with nse values of 0 79 for both the calibration and the validation period fig 2 indicating a good model performance according to moriasi et al 2015 table 3 the nse values differed considerably among the sub catchments corresponding to performance ratings between satisfactory and very good only for the obere warnow was the nse not satisfactory during the validation period most modeled discharge sums were at least satisfactory as indicated by the pbias performance criterion in two sub catchments however pbias was not satisfactory during the validation period obere warnow zarnow overall there was a tendency to underestimate observed discharge for the calibration period and overestimate observed discharge for the validation period the general overestimation of discharge could be attributed to the wetter weather conditions during the validation period the three wettest years 2007 2002 2011 fell in this period the model results were much better than simulation results from the previous study koch et al 2013 in which nse values were generally notably lower the improved model behavior could mainly be attributed to a higher spatial discretization of the warnow basin to include 29 compared to 9 subbasins and the fully automatic calibration approach using swat cup 3 1 2 flow constituents the warnow catchment and its sub catchments are dominated by subsurface flow table 4 surface runoff occurred after heavy storms but played only a minor role in the long term this reflects the topographic situation in this catchment which is characterized by lowlands with only gentle slopes and permeable soils the low slope gradients also restrict the occurrence of larger amounts of lateral flow therefore discharge is dominated by groundwater and tile flow the proportion of tile flow reflects the proportion of artificially drained areas in the sub catchments for example almost the half 48 of the kösterbeck sub catchment is tile drained compared to only 17 in the mühlenbach sub catchment this results in large tile flow contributions for the kösterbeck sub catchment 50 and low contributions for the mühlenbach sub catchment 8 this finding confirms results from the previous study in which the relationship between tile drained areas and the contribution of tile flow to discharge was statistically significant koch et al 2013 groundwater contributed between 44 and 88 to discharge whereby the proportions of the shallow and the deep aquifer on the groundwater flow component differed notably among the sub catchments the percentage of the deep groundwater flow was mainly controlled by the parameter rchrg dp table 2 the higher the value for rchrg dp the more the deep aquifer contributed proportionally to groundwater flow for example the highest value of rchrg dp was 0 56 table 2 for the nebel sub catchment with a correspondingly high percentage of deep groundwater flow 83 of total groundwater flow in contrast the optimal value for rchrg dp was 0 02 for the obere warnow sub catchment resulting in a low deep groundwater contribution 2 of total groundwater flow the large differences of the deep aquifer contributions on groundwater flow are presumably more a result of the swat model concept and the automatic calibration process than a reflection of fundamental differences in groundwater hydrology in the sub catchments waste water treatment plants as point sources contributed little to total discharge with values of 1 3 2 dissolved reactive phosphorus drp 3 2 1 controlling parameters to simulate drp losses for the individual sub catchments and the catchment outlet we calibrated gwsolp gw drp concentration in the shallow aquifer for swat and tilep con gw drp concentration in the tile drainage water gwsolp gw and gwdminp gw drp concentration in the deep aquifer for swat p table 5 calibrated drp concentrations gwsolp gw were higher in swat compared to swat p ranging from 0 05mg l in the obere warnow sub catchment to 0 16mg l in the nebel sub catchment using swat p calibrated drp concentrations tilep con gw gwsolp gw gwdminp gw ranged from 0 01mg l to 0 09mg l here optimized drp concentrations were generally highest in tile drainage water followed by the shallow and the deep groundwater the differences and magnitudes of drp concentrations in swat could mainly be attributed to varying percentages of flow components among the sub catchments table 4 in general it can be stated that a high share of deep groundwater nebel and or tile flow kösterbeck resulted in high final drp concentrations and vice versa mildenitz obere warnow using swat the swat model does not consider drp in tile drainage water and deep groundwater meaning that drp concentrations correspond to 0mg l for these two flow components in contrast constant drp concentrations over time can be defined for tile drainage water and deep groundwater in swat p resulting in a better representation with regard to drp for subsurface flow components unfortunately there is no official monitoring scheme for the warnow basin that records drp concentrations in the tile drainage water or in the groundwater however it is estimated that average drp groundwater concentrations in the study area amount to ca 0 05mg l lung 2004 measurements by our working group on arable land within the zarnow sub catchment revealed even lower drp groundwater concentrations of ca 0 01mg l unpublished data and higher drp concentrations of ca 0 03mg l in tile drainage water kahle et al 2008 the higher drp concentrations in tile drainage water compared to groundwater were reproduced relatively well by the automatic drp calibration using swat p taking into account these observations adjusted drp groundwater concentrations used in the swat model were generally too high our results indicated a necessity to balance the non consideration of drp in tile drainage water and the deep aquifer by adjusting other flow components such as the shallow aquifer resulting in unrealistically high drp concentrations in these flow constituents using swat p calibrated subsurface drp concentrations tile drainage water shallow groundwater deep groundwater were more reasonable and reflected the prevailing conditions in the warnow basin rather realistically 3 2 2 model performance the monthly drp losses at the basin outlet rostock were reproduced fairly well yielding satisfactory nse values using swat and good nse values using swat p according to moriasi s evaluation criteria moriasi et al 2015 table 6 the cumulative drp losses were modeled reasonably well by both swat and swat p fig 3 right however the dynamics of the drp losses were only captured sufficiently for four kösterbeck zarnow beke nebel out of seven sub catchments and the catchment outlet nse values were 0 for three sub catchments mildenitz mühlenbach obere warnow regardless of the model used the low prediction accuracies for these sub catchments mildenitz obere warnow can be partly explained by weak model performances with respect to discharge difficulties in predicting drp losses were also reported by bosch et al 2011 and were partly attributed to the inability of swat to capture an increase in drp export during the validation period as for discharge table 3 there was a tendency to underestimate drp loads during the calibration period and overestimate them during the validation period this model behavior could be attributed to the fact that there is a close positive relationship between simulated drp loads and simulated discharge fig 4c the statistical performance of swat p was superior to swat for each sub catchment table 6 several factors can explain the varying model performance in terms of drp load predictions for the individual sub catchments due to the defined constant drp concentrations over time for groundwater and tile drainage water as primary drp sources drp load predictions in our study were largely a function of discharge fig 4c this means that a close relationship between observed discharge and observed drp losses was a prerequisite to simulate drp loss in a satisfactory manner however a number of studies have shown that drp dynamics undergo various changes spatially and over time within a river network e g house 2003 mulholland and webster 2010 in the warnow basin elevated drp concentrations during low flow conditions are regularly observed in summer fig 4a consequently the relationship between observed drp losses and observed discharge is much weaker lower in some of the sub catchments mildenitz mühlenbach obere warnow fig 4b than it is in the swat model outputs fig 4c resulting in an unsatisfactory model performance one might argue that a proper representation of in stream nutrient processes can overcome this problem however we found only negligible differences for model runs with and without active in stream components migliaccio et al 2007 report a similar result concluding that there is a need for further testing and refinement of the swat algorithms simulating in stream processes this issue was the subject of research in recent years and improved in stream p routines have been incorporated into swat white et al 2014 nonetheless in stream p processes in swat are still undergoing further alterations mittelstet et al 2017 we did not consider lakes in our swat models however lakes can change the discharge dynamics influencing discharge predictability in the accompanying river network and they often act as p sinks e g alexander et al 2002 bosch 2008 svendsen et al 1995 a 250ha lake one km upstream from the gauging station in sternberger burg mildenitz sub catchment probably alters drp dynamics and serves as a drp sink making monthly load predictions difficult this assumption is supported by the fact that annual loads are comparably low in this sub catchment fig 5 3 2 3 drp sources observed annual drp losses ranged from 0 048kg ha nebel to 0 103kg ha zarnow for the entire basin warnow a loss of 0 081kg drp ha was calculated the drp losses in the warnow basin were relatively low compared to other watersheds in the baltic region kronvang et al 2007 vagstad et al 2001 both models swat swat p produced a good fit between mean annual observed and simulated drp losses fig 5 broken down into different sources the drp losses reflected the contributions of different flow constituents table 4 to total discharge swat considers drp for point sources surface runoff and shallow groundwater swat p additionally considers drp losses through tile drainage water and deep groundwater yielding a more differentiated picture of drp sources drp losses via lateral flow are considered by neither swat nor swat p on average 13 of the total drp losses originated from wwtps the magnitudes of drp losses via wwtps were the same for both swat and swat p because these drp loads were specified in input files p dat files that were directly added to the drp losses in the respective subbasin without any modification a small fraction of drp was lost through surface runoff according to simulation results major differences between swat and swat p emerged through a closer look at subsurface diffuse drp losses more than 80 of total drp losses were allocated to the shallow groundwater using swat due to the incorporation of drp into tile drainage water swat p placed drp losses via groundwater at ca 65 tile drainage water contributed significantly to drp losses for example in the kösterbeck sub catchment almost 60 of drp losses originated from tile drainage water at the same time in the mildenitz sub catchment only 12 of the catchment is tile drained resulting in a comparably low percentage of drp losses via tile drainage water the drp losses from tile drainage water mean 20 seem realistic and are supported by results of a modeling study using an empirical physical model package growa denuz weku mephos wendland et al 2015 in which the percentage of total phosphorus losses via tile drainage water is estimated at 18 for the entire federal state of mecklenburg western pomerania swat distinguishes between shallow and deep groundwater which both contributed to discharge eq 1 the contribution of drp losses from the aquifers shallow deep was related to the calibrated parameter rchrg dp when using swat p high values for rchrg dp led to high percentages of drp contributions via the deep groundwater e g mühlenbach and vice versa e g obere warnow it should be noted that the percentages of shallow and deep groundwater contributing to drp losses reflect the swat model structure rather than a realistic estimation of groundwater sources however incorporating drp losses through the deep groundwater pool is essential in preventing unrealistically high estimates for drp concentrations in the shallow aquifer table 5 when the deep groundwater is part of the modeling environment rchrg dp gw 0 4 conclusion and outlook we developed a modified swat model swat p with time constant drp concentrations for tile drainage water and the deep aquifer the results indicated a considerable improvement in the power to predict drp loads when using swat p in comparison to swat modeled drp loads were largely a function of modeled discharge due to time constant drp concentrations in tile drainage water and groundwater future work should overcome this rather mechanistic approach and research should consider the proportion of macropore matrix flow and sorption desorption processes of p in the soil profile radcliffe et al 2015 to account for the temporal

catchment is estimated to be drained by tile drainage systems according to the current digital drainage map provided by the state department of environment nature conservation and geology of mecklenburg western pomerania subsurface drainage pipes were mainly installed under arable land with a naturally high groundwater table the drainage systems are usually several decades old whereby the exact location and dimensions are not always known 2 2 input data a digital elevation model with a 25 25m grid cell resolution lva 2000 formed the basis for delineating the catchment the subbasins and the river network weather data from four climate and 14 precipitation stations across the warnow basin obtained from the german weather service served as meteorological input variables corine land cover data dlr 2003 formed the basis of land use classification land use from the corine land cover data was assigned to the corresponding swat plant and land cover codes this procedure included assigning the most important crops in the region table 1 a soil map with a spatial resolution of 1 200 000 lung 2010 was used to specify soil types within the basin the statewide mecklenburg western pomerania map of tile drainage systems was analyzed for plausibility and eventually integrated into the swat model we delineated the warnow basin using arcgis 10 4 sp1 arcswat version 2012 10 4 19 it consists of 29 subbasins and consequently of 29 streams fig 1b 491 hrus were obtained to represent the spatial variability within the warnow basin by overlaying the land use type map the soil class map and the slope class map tile drainage was introduced as a fourth component in order to distinguish drained and non drained hrus to this end the tile drainage map was intersected with the soil map soils influenced by tile drainage were subsequently marked in the swat implemented soil database for 145 tile drained hrus tile drainage parameters were set as follows effective radius of tiles re sdr 5mm distance between two tiles sdrain sdr 13 000mm and depth of tiles ddrain mgt 1100mm according to on site experience tiemeyer et al 2007 land use classes 5 of the sub catchment area and soil classes 5 of the land use area were disregarded we constructed the model with one slope class for this lowland river basin the penmen monteith method was used to calculate evapotranspiration eight discharge gauges fig 1b run by the state department of agriculture and environment of mecklenburg western pomerania and corresponding daily discharge data from 1992 to 2011 were selected to calibrate and validate the discharge for two sub catchments nebel zarnow observed discharge data was only available from 2002 to 2011 we used the periods 1992 to 2001 nebel zarnow 2002 to 2006 for calibration and 2002 to 2011 nebel zarnow 2007 to 2011 for validation the years 1985 to 1991 served as warm up period drp concentrations and thus drp loadings as the product of discharge and drp concentration were available for the same period based on discrete samples in a bi weekly to monthly temporal resolution we used the r software package loadflex appling et al 2015 for daily load estimation this package offers several different approaches from which we applied the rloadest regression model that uses regression and maximum likelihood methods for load estimation for more details regarding the calculations see appling et al 2015 2 3 the swat p model discharge is calculated in swat as the sum of all flow components as follows 1 w y l d s u r q l a t q t i l e q g w q s h a l l o w g w q d e e p p o i n t where wyld is discharge surq is surface runoff latq is lateral flow tileq is tile flow gwq is groundwater flow from either the shallow or the deep aquifer and point is discharge from point sources such as waste water treatment plants the units are mm drp can be transported into the river network via surface runoff surq shallow aquifer gwq shallow and point sources point in the official swat model while the drp concentration in surface runoff is a function of various input parameters a time constant drp concentration needs to be set in order to model drp in the shallow groundwater the official swat version does not consider drp in tile drainage water or in the deep aquifer resulting in drp concentrations of 0mg l for these flow components therefore we modified the swat model swat p in such a way that the user can specify separate time constant drp concentrations for these two flow components tileq gwq deep at the hru level appendix a these concentrations were then converted into drp loadings the drp loadings for the deep aquifer and tile drainage water were added to the swat output files for this study we used swat2012 rev 659 the swat model is written in

intel xeon e5 system with the windows 10 operating system the swat p model is open source and can be obtained by the authors of this study to apply the swat p model drp concentrations for tile drainage water and deep groundwater need to be defined at the hru level in the input files appendix b the drp concentrations in tile drainage water and in the deep groundwater are specified in the

this extension of the swat model output is identical for daily monthly and yearly displays the swat p model swat p exe can be downloaded from the data repository 2 4 sensitivity analysis and calibration 2 4 1 hydrology based on previous swat studies in the same watershed koch et al 2013 and in a small catchment within the study area bauwe et al 2017 bauwe et al 2016 we selected 16 potentially relevant hydrological parameters for sensitivity analysis appendix d we performed a global sensitivity analysis based on latin hypercube generated parameters and 1000 runs to extract sensitive parameters using swat cup swat cup 2012 version 5 1 6 2 abbaspour 2014 finally nine parameters were selected for automatic calibration each sub catchment was calibrated automatically using sequential uncertainty fitting sufi 2 and nash sutcliffe efficiency nse as the objective function one iteration consisted of 1000 model runs after an iteration swat cup suggested new usually narrower parameter ranges to reduce the uncertainty and enhance the model performance these new parameters were implemented for the next iteration unless the suggested parameters had no physical meaning e g negative values in those cases the parameters were adjusted manually this procedure was repeated four to five times until no further improvement of model performance could be achieved we calibrated all sub catchments separately because they were not connected to each other afterwards we calibrated the basin outlet warnow by using the final parameters of the sub catchments and changed only parameter values for sub catchments that were not covered yet table 2 gives an overview of the calibrated parameters for each sub catchment discharge was mainly controlled by groundwater evidenced in the fact that four out of nine parameters entering the calibration routines were related to groundwater table 2 in addition one of the most important parameters for calibration typical to many swat projects was cn2 which had to be reduced for model optimization the parameter dep imp defines the depth to the impervious layer in the soil profile neitsch et al 2011 and generally has a large impact on the distribution of tile flow and groundwater flow bauwe et al 2016 the parameter esco calibrated in many swat studies controlled for evaporation and thus water balance rchrg dp was found to be a sensitive parameter as it partitions groundwater into the shallow and deep aquifer components hydrology was calibrated using the official swat model after calibration a model run was performed with the modified swat p model as well resulting in identical hydrological model output values 2 4 2 dissolved reactive phosphorus drp swat distinguishes between three different mineral p pools soluble active stable in the soil in order to obtain reasonable values in the active soil p pool we changed initial drp concentrations sol solp chm in the different soil layers from 5mg kg default to 40mg kg for agricultural land arable land pasture according to literature values mluv 2011 after the hydrology was calibrated we used swat cup to test the sensitivity of p related swat parameters on drp loadings using the official swat version in contrast to other studies in which several p related parameters were sensitive e g daloğlu et al 2012 mehdi et al 2015 molina navarro et al 2014 only the drp concentration in the shallow groundwater gwsolp gw significantly influenced the dynamics and magnitude of drp loads in the sub catchments consequently we left all p related parameters at their default levels and adjusted only the drp concentration in the shallow aquifer gwsolp gw automatically using swat cup for the official swat version this was performed for each sub catchment separately resulting in different optimized drp concentrations per sub catchment similar to this approach drp concentrations for the shallow aquifer the deep aquifer and the tile drainage water were adapted using swat cup for the swat p model version 3 results and discussion 3 1 hydrology 3 1 1 model performance swat reproduced the observed discharge well for the basin outlet rostock with nse values of 0 79 for both the calibration and the validation period fig 2 indicating a good model performance according to moriasi et al 2015 table 3 the nse values differed considerably among the sub catchments corresponding to performance ratings between satisfactory and very good only for the obere warnow was the nse not satisfactory during the validation period most modeled discharge sums were at least satisfactory as indicated by the pbias performance criterion in two sub catchments however pbias was not satisfactory during the validation period obere warnow zarnow overall there was a tendency to underestimate observed discharge for the calibration period and overestimate observed discharge for the validation period the general overestimation of discharge could be attributed to the wetter weather conditions during the validation period the three wettest years 2007 2002 2011 fell in this period the model results were much better than simulation results from the previous study koch et al 2013 in which nse values were generally notably lower the improved model behavior could mainly be attributed to a higher spatial discretization of the warnow basin to include 29 compared to 9 subbasins and the fully automatic calibration approach using swat cup 3 1 2 flow constituents the warnow catchment and its sub catchments are dominated by subsurface flow table 4 surface runoff occurred after heavy storms but played only a minor role in the long term this reflects the topographic situation in this catchment which is characterized by lowlands with only gentle slopes and permeable soils the low slope gradients also restrict the occurrence of larger amounts of lateral flow therefore discharge is dominated by groundwater and tile flow the proportion of tile flow reflects the proportion of artificially drained areas in the sub catchments for example almost the half 48 of the kösterbeck sub catchment is tile drained compared to only 17 in the mühlenbach sub catchment this results in large tile flow contributions for the kösterbeck sub catchment 50 and low contributions for the mühlenbach sub catchment 8 this finding confirms results from the previous study in which the relationship between tile drained areas and the contribution of tile flow to discharge was statistically significant koch et al 2013 groundwater contributed between 44 and 88 to discharge whereby the proportions of the shallow and the deep aquifer on the groundwater flow component differed notably among the sub catchments the percentage of the deep groundwater flow was mainly controlled by the parameter rchrg dp table 2 the higher the value for rchrg dp the more the deep aquifer contributed proportionally to groundwater flow for example the highest value of rchrg dp was 0 56 table 2 for the nebel sub catchment with a correspondingly high percentage of deep groundwater flow 83 of total groundwater flow in contrast the optimal value for rchrg dp was 0 02 for the obere warnow sub catchment resulting in a low deep groundwater contribution 2 of total groundwater flow the large differences of the deep aquifer contributions on groundwater flow are presumably more a result of the swat model concept and the automatic calibration process than a reflection of fundamental differences in groundwater hydrology in the sub catchments waste water treatment plants as point sources contributed little to total discharge with values of 1 3 2 dissolved reactive phosphorus drp 3 2 1 controlling parameters to simulate drp losses for the individual sub catchments and the catchment outlet we calibrated gwsolp gw drp concentration in the shallow aquifer for swat and tilep con gw drp concentration in the tile drainage water gwsolp gw and gwdminp gw drp concentration in the deep aquifer for swat p table 5 calibrated drp concentrations gwsolp gw were higher in swat compared to swat p ranging from 0 05mg l in the obere warnow sub catchment to 0 16mg l in the nebel sub catchment using swat p calibrated drp concentrations tilep con gw gwsolp gw gwdminp gw ranged from 0 01mg l to 0 09mg l here optimized drp concentrations were generally highest in tile drainage water followed by the shallow and the deep groundwater the differences and magnitudes of drp concentrations in swat could mainly be attributed to varying percentages of flow components among the sub catchments table 4 in general it can be stated that a high share of deep groundwater nebel and or tile flow kösterbeck resulted in high final drp concentrations and vice versa mildenitz obere warnow using swat the swat model does not consider drp in tile drainage water and deep groundwater meaning that drp concentrations correspond to 0mg l for these two flow components in contrast constant drp concentrations over time can be defined for tile drainage water and deep groundwater in swat p resulting in a better representation with regard to drp for subsurface flow components unfortunately there is no official monitoring scheme for the warnow basin that records drp concentrations in the tile drainage water or in the groundwater however it is estimated that average drp groundwater concentrations in the study area amount to ca 0 05mg l lung 2004 measurements by our working group on arable land within the zarnow sub catchment revealed even lower drp groundwater concentrations of ca 0 01mg l unpublished data and higher drp concentrations of ca 0 03mg l in tile drainage water kahle et al 2008 the higher drp concentrations in tile drainage water compared to groundwater were reproduced relatively well by the automatic drp calibration using swat p taking into account these observations adjusted drp groundwater concentrations used in the swat model were generally too high our results indicated a necessity to balance the non consideration of drp in tile drainage water and the deep aquifer by adjusting other flow components such as the shallow aquifer resulting in unrealistically high drp concentrations in these flow constituents using swat p calibrated subsurface drp concentrations tile drainage water shallow groundwater deep groundwater were more reasonable and reflected the prevailing conditions in the warnow basin rather realistically 3 2 2 model performance the monthly drp losses at the basin outlet rostock were reproduced fairly well yielding satisfactory nse values using swat and good nse values using swat p according to moriasi s evaluation criteria moriasi et al 2015 table 6 the cumulative drp losses were modeled reasonably well by both swat and swat p fig 3 right however the dynamics of the drp losses were only captured sufficiently for four kösterbeck zarnow beke nebel out of seven sub catchments and the catchment outlet nse values were 0 for three sub catchments mildenitz mühlenbach obere warnow regardless of the model used the low prediction accuracies for these sub catchments mildenitz obere warnow can be partly explained by weak model performances with respect to discharge difficulties in predicting drp losses were also reported by bosch et al 2011 and were partly attributed to the inability of swat to capture an increase in drp export during the validation period as for discharge table 3 there was a tendency to underestimate drp loads during the calibration period and overestimate them during the validation period this model behavior could be attributed to the fact that there is a close positive relationship between simulated drp loads and simulated discharge fig 4c the statistical performance of swat p was superior to swat for each sub catchment table 6 several factors can explain the varying model performance in terms of drp load predictions for the individual sub catchments due to the defined constant drp concentrations over time for groundwater and tile drainage water as primary drp sources drp load predictions in our study were largely a function of discharge fig 4c this means that a close relationship between observed discharge and observed drp losses was a prerequisite to simulate drp loss in a satisfactory manner however a number of studies have shown that drp dynamics undergo various changes spatially and over time within a river network e g house 2003 mulholland and webster 2010 in the warnow basin elevated drp concentrations during low flow conditions are regularly observed in summer fig 4a consequently the relationship between observed drp losses and observed discharge is much weaker lower in some of the sub catchments mildenitz mühlenbach obere warnow fig 4b than it is in the swat model outputs fig 4c resulting in an unsatisfactory model performance one might argue that a proper representation of in stream nutrient processes can overcome this problem however we found only negligible differences for model runs with and without active in stream components migliaccio et al 2007 report a similar result concluding that there is a need for further testing and refinement of the swat algorithms simulating in stream processes this issue was the subject of research in recent years and improved in stream p routines have been incorporated into swat white et al 2014 nonetheless in stream p processes in swat are still undergoing further alterations mittelstet et al 2017 we did not consider lakes in our swat models however lakes can change the discharge dynamics influencing discharge predictability in the accompanying river network and they often act as p sinks e g alexander et al 2002 bosch 2008 svendsen et al 1995 a 250ha lake one km upstream from the gauging station in sternberger burg mildenitz sub catchment probably alters drp dynamics and serves as a drp sink making monthly load predictions difficult this assumption is supported by the fact that annual loads are comparably low in this sub catchment fig 5 3 2 3 drp sources observed annual drp losses ranged from 0 048kg ha nebel to 0 103kg ha zarnow for the entire basin warnow a loss of 0 081kg drp ha was calculated the drp losses in the warnow basin were relatively low compared to other watersheds in the baltic region kronvang et al 2007 vagstad et al 2001 both models swat swat p produced a good fit between mean annual observed and simulated drp losses fig 5 broken down into different sources the drp losses reflected the contributions of different flow constituents table 4 to total discharge swat considers drp for point sources surface runoff and shallow groundwater swat p additionally considers drp losses through tile drainage water and deep groundwater yielding a more differentiated picture of drp sources drp losses via lateral flow are considered by neither swat nor swat p on average 13 of the total drp losses originated from wwtps the magnitudes of drp losses via wwtps were the same for both swat and swat p because these drp loads were specified in input files p dat files that were directly added to the drp losses in the respective subbasin without any modification a small fraction of drp was lost through surface runoff according to simulation results major differences between swat and swat p emerged through a closer look at subsurface diffuse drp losses more than 80 of total drp losses were allocated to the shallow groundwater using swat due to the incorporation of drp into tile drainage water swat p placed drp losses via groundwater at ca 65 tile drainage water contributed significantly to drp losses for example in the kösterbeck sub catchment almost 60 of drp losses originated from tile drainage water at the same time in the mildenitz sub catchment only 12 of the catchment is tile drained resulting in a comparably low percentage of drp losses via tile drainage water the drp losses from tile drainage water mean 20 seem realistic and are supported by results of a modeling study using an empirical physical model package growa denuz weku mephos wendland et al 2015 in which the percentage of total phosphorus losses via tile drainage water is estimated at 18 for the entire federal state of mecklenburg western pomerania swat distinguishes between shallow and deep groundwater which both contributed to discharge eq 1 the contribution of drp losses from the aquifers shallow deep was related to the calibrated parameter rchrg dp when using swat p high values for rchrg dp led to high percentages of drp contributions via the deep groundwater e g mühlenbach and vice versa e g obere warnow it should be noted that the percentages of shallow and deep groundwater contributing to drp losses reflect the swat model structure rather than a realistic estimation of groundwater sources however incorporating drp losses through the deep groundwater pool is essential in preventing unrealistically high estimates for drp concentrations in the shallow aquifer table 5 when the deep groundwater is part of the modeling environment rchrg dp gw 0 4 conclusion and outlook we developed a modified swat model swat p with time constant drp concentrations for tile drainage water and the deep aquifer the results indicated a considerable improvement in the power to predict drp loads when using swat p in comparison to swat modeled drp loads were largely a function of modeled discharge due to time constant drp concentrations in tile drainage water and groundwater future work should overcome this rather mechanistic approach and research should consider the proportion of macropore matrix flow and sorption desorption processes of p in the soil profile radcliffe et al 2015 to account for the temporal

1121,farmers along the main reach of the zarqa river basin zrb commonly utilize treated wastewater for irrigation deep percolation is expected to occur as a result of irrigation and it is expected that preferential flow pathways may facilitate the downward movement of irrigation water therefore the aim of this research was to investigate the susceptibility of soils near zarqa river to preferential flow and the hydrus and soil and water assessment tool swat models were used the methodology consisted of taking tension infiltrometer measurements along the zarqa river to determine the main physical properties relevant to preferential flow such as infiltration rate and macroscopic capillary length followed by investigating the downward water movement using hydrus and swat the hydrus simulations were conducted using single porosity sp and dual porosity dp constitutive functions pertaining to matrix and preferential flow respectively the in situ tension infiltrometer measurements were used to parameterize the surface layer of the hydrus dp model hydrus simulations showed that preferential flow occurring in the surface layer of the soil profile controlled the vertical movement of soil water in excess of field capacity the comparison between swat sp and dp showed that both swat and dp were capable of simulating preferential flow in arid watersheds however swat simulations of lateral discharge and deep percolation resemble that of the dp only when the evaporation soil compensation factor esco was set to a value of 0 8 and the length of the soil slope was set to its maximum value this research recommends using hydrus model to verify swat model predictions of soil water redistribution in the soil profile and to improve the parameterization of the swat model the research also suggests an approach for the combined use of both models keywords soil and water assessment tool swat hydrus unsaturated flow irrigated agriculture 1 introduction preferential water flow movement is a natural phenomenon that occurs in most soils and it has been widely recognized as the major contributor to deep percolation and subsequent groundwater recharge hatiye et al 2017 vásquez et al 2015 the preferential flow process has been identified on the local and field scales through in situ measurements and the use of tracers field observations showed high variability of preferential flow both in magnitude and mode of occurrence wiekenkamp et al 2016 sheng et al 2012 hardie et al 2011 wang and zhang 2011 despite the variability in preferential flow hydrus provided satisfactory predictions for solute transport in soil columns with artificially configured macro pores xu et al 2017 wang et al 2014 hydrus is a three dimensional 3d numerical model that simulates saturated and unsaturated soil water movement and redistribution hydrus uses a finite element scheme to solve richard s equation in single or dual permeability domains the model is equipped with a user friendly interface that allows the handling of homogenous or heterogeneous problem domains and accommodates complex geometries the constitutive equations that account for unsaturated hydraulic conditions in a single permeability domain were described by van genuchten 1980 vg equations brooks and corey 1964 and vogel and císlerová 1988 who described modified vg equations these equations describe the unsaturated hydraulic conditions in a single pore space single porosity henceforth sp the single permeability domain in hydrus model also includes constitutive equations that accommodate porous media of two overlapping pore spaces dual porosity henceforth dp in contrast with the single permeability domain the dual permeability model enables hydrus to simulate water flow in fracture and matrix domains šimůnek et al 2016 among the many uses of hydrus there are enhanced determination of soil physical characteristics from field measurements bordoni et al 2017 cong et al 2014 antonopoulos et al 2013 determination of soil water dynamics wegehenkel et al 2017 li et al 2015 and evaluation of groundwater recharge wu et al 2016 hydrus has also been used to simulate interactions between soil and groundwater as well as the impact of irrigation practices on return flow and contaminant transport to groundwater hu et al 2017 shang et al 2016 although diverse in scope the hydrus model is confined to small scales and is not suitable for evaluating soil water movement at the watershed scale the soil and water assessment tool swat is more commonly used for evaluation of water and environmental problems in mid sized to large catchments gassman et al 2007 swat is a conceptual hydrological model based on the soil water balance equation the change in soil water storage in any given time step is determined by the net difference between precipitation and other components of the hydrological cycle including evapotranspiration lateral subsurface discharge to the main reach surface runoff and deep percolation a swat model setup may consist of several sub watersheds and each sub watershed is divided into different hydrological response units hrus the soil water balance equation is solved for each hru so the hru is the basic simulation unit in swat each hru is defined by a unique set of parameters swat also incorporates a comprehensive set of hydrological and hydraulic functions that account for streamflow and sediment routing between sub watersheds and the influence of management practices swat also allows interaction between surface water and groundwater arnold et al 1998 recent implementations of swat have mainly been focused on evaluation of the impact of irrigation urbanization and changes in agricultural land use on watershed hydrological pathways hartwich et al 2016 neupane and kumar 2015 rahbeh et al 2013 another major area of swat utilization is assessment of short and long term climate change impacts on water yield neupane et al 2015 musau et al 2015 narsimlu et al 2013 indeed swat can be instrumental to planning present and future watershed management activities however some important environmental processes occurring at the field and farm scales may not be well represented in the swat model especially in arid areas where the annual rainfall is not sufficient to produce substantial runoff cho et al 2009 studies conducted by al wadaey et al 2016 and ouessar et al 2009 highlight another hurdle of implementing swat in arid regions both studies showed the potential of swat to pinpoint ideal locations for introducing conservation practices and water harvesting structures however due to scarcity of runoff data they were unable to conduct a standard calibration validation procedure instead they validated their model by relying on expert knowledge and comparisons with a limited number of runoff measurements the lack of observed data at the study watershed prompted taddele et al 2016 to calibrate and validate swat on a watershed encompassing the study watershed then the optimized parameters were transferred into the swat model developed for the study watershed for an agricultural watershed that hardly produced any runoff awan and ismaeel 2014 calibrated and validated swat by contrasting the swat simulated evapotranspiration et with the et determined by the surface energy balance algorithm sebal the calibrated swat model was then used to assess groundwater recharge ahn et al 2018 studied the impact of drought on irrigation practices in an arid watershed where runoff was minimal hence 90 of the streamflow originated from a reservoir located upstream of the watershed inlet also streamflow tended to dwindle in the downstream direction due to withdrawals of irrigation water from the main reach nevertheless ahn et al 2018 successfully used the swat model to simulate the impact of irrigation on the main hydrological components within the study watershed zarqa river basin zrb is one of the most important basins in jordan it is the home of half the jordanian population and also supplies the farmers of the jordan valley with irrigation water it drains an area of approximately 3900km2 into the king talal dam ktd most of the runoff water originates from the northwestern part of the watershed where the long term annual rainfall is approximately 650mm the average annual rainfall generally decreases rapidly in the north to south and west to east directions and drops below 100mm in the eastern part of the watershed one of the main concerns about the zrb is that preferential flow and transport may be occurring in the cultivated areas along the main reach of the river similar to the case study presented by ahn et al 2018 farmers draw irrigation water directly from the river or from groundwater wells adjacent to the river the groundwater level is increasing by an average of 20cm per year bajjali et al 2017 as the groundwater is recharged from the river bed and irrigated areas the rise of the groundwater level raises the concern that water and solutes move faster than anticipated through preferential pathways that can potentially occur in soils located around the main reach al kuisi et al 2014 the average annual rainfall in the cultivated areas along the zarqa river is less than 150mm consequently because of the minimal anticipated runoff generation from this area its relative importance can be easily underestimated for a model calibrated to streamflow data therefore downscaling from the watershed scale to the farm scale is necessary for proper assessment of hydrological processes occurring at local scales in this regard hydrus can be a useful tool for in depth assessment and improvement of swat handling of preferential flow this study aims to investigate the 1 influence of preferential flow on the vertical and lateral redistribution of water in soil adjacent to zarqa river using the hydrus model and 2 the ability of the swat model to predict preferential flow in a selected sub watershed within the study area 2 methodology 2 1 study area the area adjacent to the main reach of zarqa river henceforth study area extends between the khirbat es samra treatment plant ktp and the ktd fig 1 and it is cultivated with forage crops and vegetables as well as olive and citrus orchards a land use map for the entire zrb is available al bakri et al 2013 irrigated areas constitute 7 of the zrb while rainfed barley urban areas mixed agricultural areas sparsely vegetated areas and gravel plains constitute 8 11 16 24 and 28 of the zrb respectively however the land use data of the study area were refined based on landsat images covering the period from september 2013 to september 2014 the red and near infrared bands of the operational land imager oli of landsat 8 were processed to derive multi temporal images of the normalized difference vegetation index ndvi fig 2 daily discharge records for the ktp are available from 1986 to 2010 water authority of jordan unpublished data files from january 2000 to december 2009 ktp provided an average daily discharge of 1 5 105 m3 of reclaimed water however in 2010 the average daily discharge increased to 1 77 105 m3 a significant portion of the ktp outflow is used to irrigate the agricultural lands adjacent to the main reach of the zarqa river the farm land is 300 500m above sea level and characterized by fertile loamy soils with 1 5 3 organic content table 1 the relatively warm weather with an average temperature of approximately of 19 c enables intensive farming the average rainfall depth of about 132mm provides only a small fraction of total crop water requirements so the agricultural practices are mainly dependent on irrigation water from the river or local wells as water is readily available farmers tend to over irrigate their crops 2 2 climatic record rainfall data were requested directly from the jordanian ministry of water and irrigation mwi the unpublished database of the mwi contains rainfall records from 56 stations distributed throughout the zrb other forms of climate data such as wind speed sunshine hours solar radiation and temperature were acquired from the climate forecast reanalysis system cfsr 2014 daily rainfall was collected from the hashimiya station located at 32 08 07 7 n 36 06 47 4 e approximately 1800m from the selected site for hydrus modeling henceforth hydrus site fig 3 the station provides over 30 years of recorded data temperature solar radiation and sunshine hours were collected from a grid point cfsr 2014 located at 32 00 14 4 n 35 56 16 8 e approximately 20km from the hydrus site fig 4 shows considerable variability in annual rainfall ranging from 42 to 245 9mm the maximum rainfall of 245 9mm occurred in 1992 and was preceded by near average rainfall of 158 2mm in 1991 and below average rainfall of 94 5mm in 1990 also it was followed by an extreme low annual rainfall of 47mm in 1993 since the period from 1990 to 1993 represents heterogeneous climate conditions including low to maximum annual rainfall the comparison between hydrus and swat models was conducted during the period henceforth simulation period between january 1st 1990 and december 31st 1993 2 3 site measurements in situ measurements of the soil physical properties of the surface layer along the zarqa river were conducted using a standard tension infiltrometer equipped with a pressure transducer and a data logger supplied by ict international similar to the device described by ankeny et al 1988 the measured soil properties include macroscopic capillary length and infiltration rate the in situ tension infiltrometer measurements were conducted at 73 locations the measurements at each location were conducted at tensions of 6 3 and 0cm the infiltration at each tension was maintained until a steady state condition was attained the measurement time varied between 20 to 90minutes depending on the soil type the macroscopic capillary length was determined using wooding s equation 1968 1 q h i π r 2 k s exp α h i 1 4 π r α where q h i is the flow rate at tension h i l3 t k s is the saturated hydraulic conductivity l t α is the inverse macroscopic capillary length 1l 1 and r is the radius of the tension infiltrometer disk l based on the work of white and sully 1987 a macroscopic capillary length of less than 80mm was considered an indication of preferential flow the macroscopic capillary length values fig 3 showed that most soils along the zarqa river are susceptible to preferential flow especially in the vicinity of ktp therefore the hydrus site was selected downstream of ktp for further investigation of soil water redistribution and downward movement using hydrus and subsequent comparison with swat model simulations fig 3 it was delineated based on land use boundaries it is cultivated with vegetables cauliflower lettuce and cabbage and characterized by steep slopes the hydrus site comprises a relatively small area of 70 160m2 and cannot be delineated as a watershed to enable comparisons between hydrus and swat an on stream watershed henceforth swat watershed defined by an inlet and an outlet that encompasses the hydrus site was delineated along the main reach fig 3 fig 3 shows that there are three types of soils in the watershed moa 1994 these are i ayd 8 aydoun characterized by a soil depth of approximately 142cm and a silt clay texture ii nis ii nisab a silt loam soil with a shallow soil profile of 48cm and iii tha 15 ramatha with a clay loam texture and a depth of 86cm the soils in the swat watershed belong to typic xerochrepts and xerochreptic camborthids subgroups table 1 2 4 swat model 2 4 1 general description swat uses a simplified soil physical characterization based mainly on the available soil water content awc defined as the difference between permanent wilting point and field capacity if the soil water content within the soil profile exceeds the field capacity then the excess water goes to deep percolation according to the following routing model neitsch et al 2002 2 w p e r c l y s w l y e x c e s s 1 exp δ t t t p e r c where w perc ly is the amount of water percolating to the underlying soil layer and sw ly excess is the drainable volume of water in soil layer on a given day the travel time tt perc is calculated on a daily basis for each soil layer 3 t t p e r c s a t l y f c l y k s a t root distribution influences the actual transpiration and redistribution of soil water typically the maximum root density is located near the surface and decreases vertically in swat this distribution is handled by the following function neitsch et al 2002 4 w u p t a k e p t t 1 e b w 1 e b w z z r o o t where w uptake mm is the root water uptake pt t mm is the potential transpiration z mm is the potential water uptake from the soil surface to specified depth z root mm is the maximum rooting depth and b w is the water use distribution parameter this parameter is set to 10 its default value in swat model which means that 50 of water uptake will occur from the upper 6 of the root zone 2 4 2 setup of the swat model for swat watershed the land use map soil map and four slope classes 0 5 5 10 10 15 and 15 9999 were overlaid using threshold values of 8 8 and 0 for land use soil and slope classes respectively overall swat generated 38 hrus for the swat watershed the two soil types within the hydrus site are associated with four slope classes distributed over seven hrus table 3 the results of the swat model were expressed as the area weighted averages of the hru outputs for swat initialization the simulation period january 1st 1990 december 31st 1993 was preceded by a warm up period that started on january 1st 1984 and ended on december 31st 1989 a daily time step was used for all swat runs 2 4 3 parameterization of swat model for swat watershed the premise of this study is to downscale from the watershed scale to the local scale that would enable assessing and enhancing swat handling of the processes occurring at the local scale the hydrus model can be used to assess the soil water redistribution within the soil profile then the results of the hydrus model can be compared with the output produced by the swat model meaningful comparison between the two models requires matching parameterization the saturated hydraulic conductivity bulk density and soil texture in the swat model should reflect their counterpart values in hydrus model also a full calibration for the soil properties of the swat model requires continuous monitoring of the soil water content which is not practically possible therefore both models were parameterized based on prior knowledge deduced from the soil maps and in situ soil measurements table 2 2 4 4 calibration and validation of swat model for the whole zrb a reasonable prediction of runoff generation from the swat watershed was ensured by calibrating the swat model for the whole zrb for this purpose the zrb was subdivided into 12 sub watersheds fig 5 fig 5 also shows the thiessen polygons used to determine the areal average rainfall for each sub watershed and that sub watershed 6 is the same as the swat watershed shown in fig 3 the swat model for the zrb consisted of 520 hrus produced by overlaying soil map land use map and five slope classes 0 5 5 10 10 15 15 20 and 20 9999 using threshold values of 5 5 and 5 for land use soil and slope classes respectively the observed record was split into calibration period january 1st 1986 december 31st 2000 validation period january 1st 2001 december 31st 2010 and warm up period january 1st 1984 to december 31st 1985 the parameters selected for calibration include curve number cn awc plant uptake compensation factor epco soil evaporation compensation factor esco slope length baseflow recession constant alpha bf and surface runoff lag time surlag the alpha bf and surlag were calibrated on the basin level while all the other parameters were calibrated on the hru level 2 5 hydrus model 2 5 1 general description hydrus uses two constitutive functions to describe unsaturated hydraulic conditions the traditional single porosity sp function of vg van genuchten 1980 and a dp derivation of vg durner et al 1999 both functions are applicable to the hydrus 3d domain the original vg equation 1980 sp is 5 θ h θ r θ s θ r 1 α h n m where θ s is the saturated water content m3 m3 θ r is the residual soil water content m3 m3 α m day m and n are fitting empirical parameters with m 1 1 n the unsaturated conductivity is determined according to the following vg function sp 6 k h k s s e l 1 1 s e 1 m m 2 where s e is the effective water content k s is the saturated hydraulic conductivity m day and k h is the hydraulic conductivity at matric potential h m day durner et al 1999 extended the vg function into a dp function as follows 7 s e w 1 1 α 1 h n 1 m w 2 1 α 2 h n 2 m 2 8 k s e k s w 1 s e w 2 s e l w 1 α 1 1 1 s e 1 m m w 2 α 2 1 1 s e 1 m m 2 w 1 α 1 w 2 α 2 2 where w 1 and w 2 are weighting factors for the overlapping regions the subscripts 1 and 2 denote region 1 and region 2 respectively 2 5 2 setup 2 5 2 1 geometric configuration the geometric configuration of the hydrus 3d domain was established from contour lines with 1 m intervals interpolated from the 30m digital elevation model dem acquired from landsat the terrain was then digitized and transferred to hydrus the domain was split geometrically into two subdomains representing the aydoun and ramtha soil types subsequently each subdomain was divided into three layers the total soil profile depth of the aydoun and ramtha soil was 142 and 86cm respectively the surface layer was set to a depth of 32cm for both domains but the remaining depth of the soils was divided equally into the second and third layers thus the depth of the second and third layers depended on the total depth of the soil profile and the vertical discretization of the two soil profiles was 32 55 55cm and 32 27 27cm for the aydoun and ramtha soils respectively table 2 2 5 2 2 finite element mesh and time discretization the mesh was created using a triangular prism elements with a uniform size of 18m thus the mesh consisted of 26 060 nodes and 76 033 elements hydrus uses variable time steps that maintain numerical stability and ensure efficient use of the cpu the hydrus time algorithm requires the specification of the initial minimum and maximum time steps which were set to values of 10 5 10 6 and 5 days respectively 2 5 2 3 boundary conditions three types of boundary conditions were applied to the hydrus site 1 atmospheric boundary condition which allows rainfall and evapotranspiration simultaneously from the same nodes the potential evapotranspiration estimates of the swat model were used as input data for the hydrus model potential evapotranspiration estimates were split into potential evaporation and potential transpiration based on the estimated leaf area index the rainfall was combined with irrigation events previously predicted by swat 2 free boundary condition imposed on the base layer this boundary condition assumes that the water table is far below the bottom boundary the percolation is calculated based on a zero pressure head gradient 3 seepage face boundary condition imposed on the side boundary along the foot slope of the domain 2 5 2 4 initial conditions each simulation year started on january 1st when evapotranspiration rates are low and soil water contents are near field capacity soil water was initiated at field capacity which was implemented in hydrus by setting the initial soil water potential to 350cm this was confirmed by a quick examination of the swat hru output file which also indicated that soil water was near capacity at the beginning of each simulation year 2 5 3 parameterization the in situ tension infiltrometer measurements were conducted at three locations within the hydrus site representing the shoulder back and foot slopes the parameters of the dp function of the surface layer were deduced by performing inverse solution on the in situ tension infiltrometer measurements while the parameters of the sp function eq 6 for all layers were deduced from the sand silt and clay fractions using the neural network prediction tool included in hydrus satisfactory inverse solutions were obtained for the surface layer and the sublayers of the shoulder and back slope sites table 2 however both the sp and dp functions led to unsatisfactory inverse solutions at the foot slope sites for that site reasonable fit between the simulated and calibrated data was obtained by manually calibrating the dual permeability model unfortunately hydrus accommodates the dual permeability model only in the two dimensional 2d context therefore the results of the foot slope were not included in the three dimensional characterization of the site the final set of parameters was used to parameterize the hydrus dp and hydrus sp models table 2 the subsurface layers in both models were represented by the sp function while the dp function was applied to the surface layer of the hydrus dp model for the hydrus sp and hydrus dp models the distribution of the root water uptake calculated by eq 4 was edited into the hydrus soil properties table in order to allow for root uptake conditions similar to the swat model 3 results 3 1 swat model 3 1 1 calibration and validation the curve numbers cns for the hrus involved were kept at their default values 81 for aydoun and 78 for ramtha runoff generation simulated by swat was near zero in 1990 and 1993 and 6 and 22mm of runoff were generated during 1991 and 1992 respectively fig 6 this seems reasonable considering the available knowledge of the swat watershed for example visual observations made by landowners and farmers suggest that runoff is either non existing or minimal thus major runoff events are not anticipated the low runoff in the swat watershed fig 3 was also verified by calibrating and validating swat for the whole zrb the comparison between streamflow simulated by swat and observed streamflow at the jaresh bridge station fig 5 yielded acceptable nash sutcliffe coefficients of 0 70 and 0 62 for the calibration and validation periods respectively figs 7 and 8 fig 9 shows the areal average rainfall of each sub watershed during the four year simulation period 1990 1993 the annual average runoff from the swat watershed fig 3 was about 4 7mm which is close to the 5 7mm simulated by the swat model calibrated for the whole zrb area fig 10 3 1 2 irrigation schedule the irrigation schedule was predicted by swat using the automatic irrigation practice option which was set to restore the soil water content swc to field capacity fc after 20mm depletion of swc the irrigation schedules simulated by swat for each hru within the hydrus site were similar but not identical for example the cumulative irrigation depths simulated by swat during the calendar year of 1993 were between 940 and 1280mm fig 11 a record low rainfall of 47mm fig 4 was observed during 1993 therefore a cumulative irrigation depth of 1280mm simulated by swat for the ramtha 15 999 hru during 1993 would reasonably account for the crop water requirement for all seven hrus located within the hydrus site table 3 hence a fixed irrigation schedule was adopted in order to facilitate similar irrigation schedules for swat and hydrus 3 1 3 soil water swat estimated area weighted average actual evapotranspiration rates of 1128 1117 1070 and 1094mm for the calendar years of 1990 1991 1992 and 1993 respectively fig 12 water stress was not indicated in any of the hrus hence the fixed irrigation schedule was adequate and enough water was supplied to the crops the area weighted average of the percolation depth simulated by the swat model showed that deep percolation was induced by daily rainfall greater than 20mm fig 13 approximately one third of total deep percolation was influenced by rainfall events during 1991 and 1993 the years that saw near and above average annual rainfall respectively a steady increase in deep percolation was simulated during the dry summer season as the result of the fixed irrigation schedule that tends to keep the soil water content slightly above field capacity swat results also suggested that deep percolation is influenced by slope class fig 14 the percolation values of the 0 5 5 10 and 10 15 slope classes oscillated around the area weighted average but the excess soil water from the 15 9999 slope class was removed from the soil profile via subsurface lateral flow swat predicted an annual lateral flow between 108 and 140mm which was not simulated by the sp and dp hydrus models two swat parameters were adjusted in order to eliminate the discrepancy between swat and dp esco and the slope length parameter esco is defined as the evaporation soil compensation factor and was initially set to a default value of 0 95 which only allows evaporation to occur from the top 100mm of the soil during calibration esco was reduced to a value of 0 8 to allow swat to meet the evaporative demand from the upper 200mm of the soil profile the reduction of the esco parameter resulted in a net decrease in deep percolation as more soil water was extracted to meet the evaporation demand the slope length is the subsurface length used in swat for the calculation of lateral discharge a short slope length means that most of the soil water saturating the lower semi impermeable soil layer will be discharged to the main stream as lateral flow to reduce the lateral discharge simulated by swat the slope length was set to an upper limit value of 150m thereby 90 of the lateral flow simulated by swat was eliminated fig 13 overall the gap between the swat and the hydrus dp models was narrowed by calibrating esco and the slope length 3 2 hydrus model 3 2 1 soil water the swat results were contrasted with two hydrus simulations the first simulation assumed no preferential flow so the soil physical properties were characterized by the sp model for the second hydrus simulation preferential flow was considered by using the dp model table 2 the cumulative flux from the free drainage boundary condition for both hydrus simulations reiterated the general deep percolation pattern found in swat results especially the peaks of deep percolation induced by substantial rainfall events fig 13 the total deep percolation simulated by the sp model was approximately half the deep percolation simulated by the dp model however for the calendar year of 1992 the sp model simulated 200mm of deep percolation i e two thirds of the deep percolation predicted by the dp model this was due to the above average rainfall during 1992 the sp model demonstrated a gradual decrease in the percolation rates and a smooth response to major rainfall events in contrast hydrus dp and swat models demonstrated abrupt increases in the cumulative percolation rates which coincided with major rainfall events for example percolation rates spiked at julian days 334 in 1991 and 33 in 1992 swat simulated annual percolation exceeded annual percolation simulated by the hydrus dp model by an average of 40mm lateral flow from the seepage boundary conditions was not simulated by the sp or the dp model lateral flow through the side boundary only occurs when the seepage boundary is saturated i e the soil water potential is zero this condition was not met during the simulation period the sp model estimated a four year average of 1200mm of actual evapotranspiration aet compared to 1120 and 1045mm of aet simulated by the dp and swat models respectively fig 13 thus the difference in cumulative percolation between the sp and dp models was partially compensated by a comparable increase in aet 4 discussion 4 1 influence of preferential flow the dp model was applied to the surface layer the physical parametrization of this layer was based on in situ field measurements using a tension infiltrometer although the subsurface layers were represented by the sp model the flow within the soil profile was a function of preferential flow occurring in the surface layer the fast drainage of soil water from the surface to the subsurface layer reduced the amount of water available to meet the evaporative demand and subsequently increased the deep percolation this was evident from the comparison of the sp and the dp models rahbeh et al 2013 discussed the role of evapotranspiration in controlling runoff and deep percolation rates irrigation can boost crop growth which increases the evapotranspiration but the presence of preferential pathways within the surface layer may provide quick release routes for the soil water which may prompt farmers to add more water hydrus simulations also showed that the differences in the deep percolation simulation between the sp and dp models occurred during the rainy season and was particularly associated with major rainfall events with depths greater than 20mm similarly gish et al 2004 suggested that preferential flow may be initiated by a critical input flux mcgrath et al 2010 also found that preferential flow is triggered by major rainfall events 4 2 implications for the swat model the swat model predicted more rapid percolation than the hydrus sp and dp models this can be attributed to the structure of the soil water routing equation in swat eq 2 which approximates the total percolation time based on the saturated hydraulic conductivity eq 3 without adjusting for unsaturated conditions therefore swat not only overestimates the deep percolation rates but it also alters the hydrological pathways by reducing evaporation from the depleted surface layer and redirecting water from evaporation to deep percolation therefore it is important to adjust the total amounts of deep percolation with respect to evaporation this may be done by reducing the esco parameter to 0 8 or less which extends the subsurface depth from which the evaporative demand can be met thus at least partially restricting the rapid downward movement of soil water the soil water in excess of field capacity may become lateral discharge if the horizontal saturated water movement exceeds the percolation rate through the bottom soil layer this condition was simulated by swat for hrus characterized by steep slopes where rapid downward movement of soil water caused an overestimation of lateral discharge the results of the hydrus models showed that subsurface layers never reached saturation so lateral discharge was not simulated by either the sp or the dp models besides the saturated hydraulic conductivity the lateral discharge in swat is also governed by the soil slope length a short slope length means fast removal of excess soil water via the lateral discharge route however on a typical hillslope there is a gradual transition between steep shoulder and gentle foot slopes furthermore the actual discharge of lateral flow occurs at the interface of the stream and the foot slope it is not possible to measure the actual length of the soil slope in swat because the hrus are not geo referenced within each sub watershed therefore the length of the soil slope should be considered as a parameter that can be adjusted in order to alter the subsurface water movement from horizontal to vertical directions this is especially justified in arid watersheds where the lack of vertical saturation of the soil profile prevents the initiation of horizontal water movement 4 3 the combined use of hydrus and swat models the comparison between the results of hydrus and swat models provided two benefits for this research the first benefit is that the hydrus model provided a better physical interpretation of the swat model results the results suggested that the swat model resembles the hydrus dp model indicating that the swat model already contains some aspects of preferential flow such an outcome is favorable for this research because the in situ soil measurements conducted along the zarqa river strongly suggested the presence of preferential flow for other case studies where matrix flow prevails the hydrus model can be used to address and verify necessary improvements in the swat model such as adjusting the soil water routing module eqs 2 and 3 for unsaturated conditions it is noteworthy that swat model simulations of deep percolation and groundwater recharge may be difficult to verify using the standard calibration and validation process rahbeh et al 2011 in this regard the hydrus model can provide an additional verification of swat model results the second benefit is that the hydrus model helped in narrowing the range of values for two swat parameters esco and the soil slope length the standard calibration and validation approach of the swat model produces several combinations of calibrated parameters that can provide a satisfactory fit between the simulated and the observed data however several possible sets of calibrated parameters may also lead to contradictory conclusions the hydrus model can help in selecting the most plausible set of calibrated parameters 5 conclusion the in situ measurements using a tension infiltrometer and the results of the hydrus dp model showed that preferential flow processes occurring in the upper 30cm of the soil profile control the downward movement of excess soil water both the swat and hydrus dp models are suitable for predicting preferential soil water movement in arid watersheds in fact the deep percolation simulations obtained from swat resemble the results of the dp model provided that proper parameterization is applied the esco parameter should be set to a value of 0 8 or less the soil slope length should be set to its maximum possible value i e 150m or adjusted to reflect realistic simulation of lateral discharge the research results imply that the soil water module of the swat model eqs 2 and 3 requires further consideration because it cannot accommodate the matrix flow this research recommends using hydrus model to verify swat model predictions of soil water redistribution in the soil profile and to improve the parameterization of the swat model the research also suggests an approach for the combined use of both models including the following basic steps 1 select a site or sites within the study watershed for the setup of hydrus model 2 conduct an initial calibration and validation of the swat model for the whole watershed 3 select a sub watershed or sub watersheds that include the hydrus model site or sites and prepare the setup of the swat model for the selected sub watersheds the sub watersheds should be small enough to accommodate hru s that have management practices land use and soil properties similar to the hydrus model site s 4 adjust the soil properties values of the swat model at the hru level according to the hydrus model results conflict of interest none declared ethical statement authors state that the research was conducted

1121,farmers along the main reach of the zarqa river basin zrb commonly utilize treated wastewater for irrigation deep percolation is expected to occur as a result of irrigation and it is expected that preferential flow pathways may facilitate the downward movement of irrigation water therefore the aim of this research was to investigate the susceptibility of soils near zarqa river to preferential flow and the hydrus and soil and water assessment tool swat models were used the methodology consisted of taking tension infiltrometer measurements along the zarqa river to determine the main physical properties relevant to preferential flow such as infiltration rate and macroscopic capillary length followed by investigating the downward water movement using hydrus and swat the hydrus simulations were conducted using single porosity sp and dual porosity dp constitutive functions pertaining to matrix and preferential flow respectively the in situ tension infiltrometer measurements were used to parameterize the surface layer of the hydrus dp model hydrus simulations showed that preferential flow occurring in the surface layer of the soil profile controlled the vertical movement of soil water in excess of field capacity the comparison between swat sp and dp showed that both swat and dp were capable of simulating preferential flow in arid watersheds however swat simulations of lateral discharge and deep percolation resemble that of the dp only when the evaporation soil compensation factor esco was set to a value of 0 8 and the length of the soil slope was set to its maximum value this research recommends using hydrus model to verify swat model predictions of soil water redistribution in the soil profile and to improve the parameterization of the swat model the research also suggests an approach for the combined use of both models keywords soil and water assessment tool swat hydrus unsaturated flow irrigated agriculture 1 introduction preferential water flow movement is a natural phenomenon that occurs in most soils and it has been widely recognized as the major contributor to deep percolation and subsequent groundwater recharge hatiye et al 2017 vásquez et al 2015 the preferential flow process has been identified on the local and field scales through in situ measurements and the use of tracers field observations showed high variability of preferential flow both in magnitude and mode of occurrence wiekenkamp et al 2016 sheng et al 2012 hardie et al 2011 wang and zhang 2011 despite the variability in preferential flow hydrus provided satisfactory predictions for solute transport in soil columns with artificially configured macro pores xu et al 2017 wang et al 2014 hydrus is a three dimensional 3d numerical model that simulates saturated and unsaturated soil water movement and redistribution hydrus uses a finite element scheme to solve richard s equation in single or dual permeability domains the model is equipped with a user friendly interface that allows the handling of homogenous or heterogeneous problem domains and accommodates complex geometries the constitutive equations that account for unsaturated hydraulic conditions in a single permeability domain were described by van genuchten 1980 vg equations brooks and corey 1964 and vogel and císlerová 1988 who described modified vg equations these equations describe the unsaturated hydraulic conditions in a single pore space single porosity henceforth sp the single permeability domain in hydrus model also includes constitutive equations that accommodate porous media of two overlapping pore spaces dual porosity henceforth dp in contrast with the single permeability domain the dual permeability model enables hydrus to simulate water flow in fracture and matrix domains šimůnek et al 2016 among the many uses of hydrus there are enhanced determination of soil physical characteristics from field measurements bordoni et al 2017 cong et al 2014 antonopoulos et al 2013 determination of soil water dynamics wegehenkel et al 2017 li et al 2015 and evaluation of groundwater recharge wu et al 2016 hydrus has also been used to simulate interactions between soil and groundwater as well as the impact of irrigation practices on return flow and contaminant transport to groundwater hu et al 2017 shang et al 2016 although diverse in scope the hydrus model is confined to small scales and is not suitable for evaluating soil water movement at the watershed scale the soil and water assessment tool swat is more commonly used for evaluation of water and environmental problems in mid sized to large catchments gassman et al 2007 swat is a conceptual hydrological model based on the soil water balance equation the change in soil water storage in any given time step is determined by the net difference between precipitation and other components of the hydrological cycle including evapotranspiration lateral subsurface discharge to the main reach surface runoff and deep percolation a swat model setup may consist of several sub watersheds and each sub watershed is divided into different hydrological response units hrus the soil water balance equation is solved for each hru so the hru is the basic simulation unit in swat each hru is defined by a unique set of parameters swat also incorporates a comprehensive set of hydrological and hydraulic functions that account for streamflow and sediment routing between sub watersheds and the influence of management practices swat also allows interaction between surface water and groundwater arnold et al 1998 recent implementations of swat have mainly been focused on evaluation of the impact of irrigation urbanization and changes in agricultural land use on watershed hydrological pathways hartwich et al 2016 neupane and kumar 2015 rahbeh et al 2013 another major area of swat utilization is assessment of short and long term climate change impacts on water yield neupane et al 2015 musau et al 2015 narsimlu et al 2013 indeed swat can be instrumental to planning present and future watershed management activities however some important environmental processes occurring at the field and farm scales may not be well represented in the swat model especially in arid areas where the annual rainfall is not sufficient to produce substantial runoff cho et al 2009 studies conducted by al wadaey et al 2016 and ouessar et al 2009 highlight another hurdle of implementing swat in arid regions both studies showed the potential of swat to pinpoint ideal locations for introducing conservation practices and water harvesting structures however due to scarcity of runoff data they were unable to conduct a standard calibration validation procedure instead they validated their model by relying on expert knowledge and comparisons with a limited number of runoff measurements the lack of observed data at the study watershed prompted taddele et al 2016 to calibrate and validate swat on a watershed encompassing the study watershed then the optimized parameters were transferred into the swat model developed for the study watershed for an agricultural watershed that hardly produced any runoff awan and ismaeel 2014 calibrated and validated swat by contrasting the swat simulated evapotranspiration et with the et determined by the surface energy balance algorithm sebal the calibrated swat model was then used to assess groundwater recharge ahn et al 2018 studied the impact of drought on irrigation practices in an arid watershed where runoff was minimal hence 90 of the streamflow originated from a reservoir located upstream of the watershed inlet also streamflow tended to dwindle in the downstream direction due to withdrawals of irrigation water from the main reach nevertheless ahn et al 2018 successfully used the swat model to simulate the impact of irrigation on the main hydrological components within the study watershed zarqa river basin zrb is one of the most important basins in jordan it is the home of half the jordanian population and also supplies the farmers of the jordan valley with irrigation water it drains an area of approximately 3900km2 into the king talal dam ktd most of the runoff water originates from the northwestern part of the watershed where the long term annual rainfall is approximately 650mm the average annual rainfall generally decreases rapidly in the north to south and west to east directions and drops below 100mm in the eastern part of the watershed one of the main concerns about the zrb is that preferential flow and transport may be occurring in the cultivated areas along the main reach of the river similar to the case study presented by ahn et al 2018 farmers draw irrigation water directly from the river or from groundwater wells adjacent to the river the groundwater level is increasing by an average of 20cm per year bajjali et al 2017 as the groundwater is recharged from the river bed and irrigated areas the rise of the groundwater level raises the concern that water and solutes move faster than anticipated through preferential pathways that can potentially occur in soils located around the main reach al kuisi et al 2014 the average annual rainfall in the cultivated areas along the zarqa river is less than 150mm consequently because of the minimal anticipated runoff generation from this area its relative importance can be easily underestimated for a model calibrated to streamflow data therefore downscaling from the watershed scale to the farm scale is necessary for proper assessment of hydrological processes occurring at local scales in this regard hydrus can be a useful tool for in depth assessment and improvement of swat handling of preferential flow this study aims to investigate the 1 influence of preferential flow on the vertical and lateral redistribution of water in soil adjacent to zarqa river using the hydrus model and 2 the ability of the swat model to predict preferential flow in a selected sub watershed within the study area 2 methodology 2 1 study area the area adjacent to the main reach of zarqa river henceforth study area extends between the khirbat es samra treatment plant ktp and the ktd fig 1 and it is cultivated with forage crops and vegetables as well as olive and citrus orchards a land use map for the entire zrb is available al bakri et al 2013 irrigated areas constitute 7 of the zrb while rainfed barley urban areas mixed agricultural areas sparsely vegetated areas and gravel plains constitute 8 11 16 24 and 28 of the zrb respectively however the land use data of the study area were refined based on landsat images covering the period from september 2013 to september 2014 the red and near infrared bands of the operational land imager oli of landsat 8 were processed to derive multi temporal images of the normalized difference vegetation index ndvi fig 2 daily discharge records for the ktp are available from 1986 to 2010 water authority of jordan unpublished data files from january 2000 to december 2009 ktp provided an average daily discharge of 1 5 105 m3 of reclaimed water however in 2010 the average daily discharge increased to 1 77 105 m3 a significant portion of the ktp outflow is used to irrigate the agricultural lands adjacent to the main reach of the zarqa river the farm land is 300 500m above sea level and characterized by fertile loamy soils with 1 5 3 organic content table 1 the relatively warm weather with an average temperature of approximately of 19 c enables intensive farming the average rainfall depth of about 132mm provides only a small fraction of total crop water requirements so the agricultural practices are mainly dependent on irrigation water from the river or local wells as water is readily available farmers tend to over irrigate their crops 2 2 climatic record rainfall data were requested directly from the jordanian ministry of water and irrigation mwi the unpublished database of the mwi contains rainfall records from 56 stations distributed throughout the zrb other forms of climate data such as wind speed sunshine hours solar radiation and temperature were acquired from the climate forecast reanalysis system cfsr 2014 daily rainfall was collected from the hashimiya station located at 32 08 07 7 n 36 06 47 4 e approximately 1800m from the selected site for hydrus modeling henceforth hydrus site fig 3 the station provides over 30 years of recorded data temperature solar radiation and sunshine hours were collected from a grid point cfsr 2014 located at 32 00 14 4 n 35 56 16 8 e approximately 20km from the hydrus site fig 4 shows considerable variability in annual rainfall ranging from 42 to 245 9mm the maximum rainfall of 245 9mm occurred in 1992 and was preceded by near average rainfall of 158 2mm in 1991 and below average rainfall of 94 5mm in 1990 also it was followed by an extreme low annual rainfall of 47mm in 1993 since the period from 1990 to 1993 represents heterogeneous climate conditions including low to maximum annual rainfall the comparison between hydrus and swat models was conducted during the period henceforth simulation period between january 1st 1990 and december 31st 1993 2 3 site measurements in situ measurements of the soil physical properties of the surface layer along the zarqa river were conducted using a standard tension infiltrometer equipped with a pressure transducer and a data logger supplied by ict international similar to the device described by ankeny et al 1988 the measured soil properties include macroscopic capillary length and infiltration rate the in situ tension infiltrometer measurements were conducted at 73 locations the measurements at each location were conducted at tensions of 6 3 and 0cm the infiltration at each tension was maintained until a steady state condition was attained the measurement time varied between 20 to 90minutes depending on the soil type the macroscopic capillary length was determined using wooding s equation 1968 1 q h i π r 2 k s exp α h i 1 4 π r α where q h i is the flow rate at tension h i l3 t k s is the saturated hydraulic conductivity l t α is the inverse macroscopic capillary length 1l 1 and r is the radius of the tension infiltrometer disk l based on the work of white and sully 1987 a macroscopic capillary length of less than 80mm was considered an indication of preferential flow the macroscopic capillary length values fig 3 showed that most soils along the zarqa river are susceptible to preferential flow especially in the vicinity of ktp therefore the hydrus site was selected downstream of ktp for further investigation of soil water redistribution and downward movement using hydrus and subsequent comparison with swat model simulations fig 3 it was delineated based on land use boundaries it is cultivated with vegetables cauliflower lettuce and cabbage and characterized by steep slopes the hydrus site comprises a relatively small area of 70 160m2 and cannot be delineated as a watershed to enable comparisons between hydrus and swat an on stream watershed henceforth swat watershed defined by an inlet and an outlet that encompasses the hydrus site was delineated along the main reach fig 3 fig 3 shows that there are three types of soils in the watershed moa 1994 these are i ayd 8 aydoun characterized by a soil depth of approximately 142cm and a silt clay texture ii nis ii nisab a silt loam soil with a shallow soil profile of 48cm and iii tha 15 ramatha with a clay loam texture and a depth of 86cm the soils in the swat watershed belong to typic xerochrepts and xerochreptic camborthids subgroups table 1 2 4 swat model 2 4 1 general description swat uses a simplified soil physical characterization based mainly on the available soil water content awc defined as the difference between permanent wilting point and field capacity if the soil water content within the soil profile exceeds the field capacity then the excess water goes to deep percolation according to the following routing model neitsch et al 2002 2 w p e r c l y s w l y e x c e s s 1 exp δ t t t p e r c where w perc ly is the amount of water percolating to the underlying soil layer and sw ly excess is the drainable volume of water in soil layer on a given day the travel time tt perc is calculated on a daily basis for each soil layer 3 t t p e r c s a t l y f c l y k s a t root distribution influences the actual transpiration and redistribution of soil water typically the maximum root density is located near the surface and decreases vertically in swat this distribution is handled by the following function neitsch et al 2002 4 w u p t a k e p t t 1 e b w 1 e b w z z r o o t where w uptake mm is the root water uptake pt t mm is the potential transpiration z mm is the potential water uptake from the soil surface to specified depth z root mm is the maximum rooting depth and b w is the water use distribution parameter this parameter is set to 10 its default value in swat model which means that 50 of water uptake will occur from the upper 6 of the root zone 2 4 2 setup of the swat model for swat watershed the land use map soil map and four slope classes 0 5 5 10 10 15 and 15 9999 were overlaid using threshold values of 8 8 and 0 for land use soil and slope classes respectively overall swat generated 38 hrus for the swat watershed the two soil types within the hydrus site are associated with four slope classes distributed over seven hrus table 3 the results of the swat model were expressed as the area weighted averages of the hru outputs for swat initialization the simulation period january 1st 1990 december 31st 1993 was preceded by a warm up period that started on january 1st 1984 and ended on december 31st 1989 a daily time step was used for all swat runs 2 4 3 parameterization of swat model for swat watershed the premise of this study is to downscale from the watershed scale to the local scale that would enable assessing and enhancing swat handling of the processes occurring at the local scale the hydrus model can be used to assess the soil water redistribution within the soil profile then the results of the hydrus model can be compared with the output produced by the swat model meaningful comparison between the two models requires matching parameterization the saturated hydraulic conductivity bulk density and soil texture in the swat model should reflect their counterpart values in hydrus model also a full calibration for the soil properties of the swat model requires continuous monitoring of the soil water content which is not practically possible therefore both models were parameterized based on prior knowledge deduced from the soil maps and in situ soil measurements table 2 2 4 4 calibration and validation of swat model for the whole zrb a reasonable prediction of runoff generation from the swat watershed was ensured by calibrating the swat model for the whole zrb for this purpose the zrb was subdivided into 12 sub watersheds fig 5 fig 5 also shows the thiessen polygons used to determine the areal average rainfall for each sub watershed and that sub watershed 6 is the same as the swat watershed shown in fig 3 the swat model for the zrb consisted of 520 hrus produced by overlaying soil map land use map and five slope classes 0 5 5 10 10 15 15 20 and 20 9999 using threshold values of 5 5 and 5 for land use soil and slope classes respectively the observed record was split into calibration period january 1st 1986 december 31st 2000 validation period january 1st 2001 december 31st 2010 and warm up period january 1st 1984 to december 31st 1985 the parameters selected for calibration include curve number cn awc plant uptake compensation factor epco soil evaporation compensation factor esco slope length baseflow recession constant alpha bf and surface runoff lag time surlag the alpha bf and surlag were calibrated on the basin level while all the other parameters were calibrated on the hru level 2 5 hydrus model 2 5 1 general description hydrus uses two constitutive functions to describe unsaturated hydraulic conditions the traditional single porosity sp function of vg van genuchten 1980 and a dp derivation of vg durner et al 1999 both functions are applicable to the hydrus 3d domain the original vg equation 1980 sp is 5 θ h θ r θ s θ r 1 α h n m where θ s is the saturated water content m3 m3 θ r is the residual soil water content m3 m3 α m day m and n are fitting empirical parameters with m 1 1 n the unsaturated conductivity is determined according to the following vg function sp 6 k h k s s e l 1 1 s e 1 m m 2 where s e is the effective water content k s is the saturated hydraulic conductivity m day and k h is the hydraulic conductivity at matric potential h m day durner et al 1999 extended the vg function into a dp function as follows 7 s e w 1 1 α 1 h n 1 m w 2 1 α 2 h n 2 m 2 8 k s e k s w 1 s e w 2 s e l w 1 α 1 1 1 s e 1 m m w 2 α 2 1 1 s e 1 m m 2 w 1 α 1 w 2 α 2 2 where w 1 and w 2 are weighting factors for the overlapping regions the subscripts 1 and 2 denote region 1 and region 2 respectively 2 5 2 setup 2 5 2 1 geometric configuration the geometric configuration of the hydrus 3d domain was established from contour lines with 1 m intervals interpolated from the 30m digital elevation model dem acquired from landsat the terrain was then digitized and transferred to hydrus the domain was split geometrically into two subdomains representing the aydoun and ramtha soil types subsequently each subdomain was divided into three layers the total soil profile depth of the aydoun and ramtha soil was 142 and 86cm respectively the surface layer was set to a depth of 32cm for both domains but the remaining depth of the soils was divided equally into the second and third layers thus the depth of the second and third layers depended on the total depth of the soil profile and the vertical discretization of the two soil profiles was 32 55 55cm and 32 27 27cm for the aydoun and ramtha soils respectively table 2 2 5 2 2 finite element mesh and time discretization the mesh was created using a triangular prism elements with a uniform size of 18m thus the mesh consisted of 26 060 nodes and 76 033 elements hydrus uses variable time steps that maintain numerical stability and ensure efficient use of the cpu the hydrus time algorithm requires the specification of the initial minimum and maximum time steps which were set to values of 10 5 10 6 and 5 days respectively 2 5 2 3 boundary conditions three types of boundary conditions were applied to the hydrus site 1 atmospheric boundary condition which allows rainfall and evapotranspiration simultaneously from the same nodes the potential evapotranspiration estimates of the swat model were used as input data for the hydrus model potential evapotranspiration estimates were split into potential evaporation and potential transpiration based on the estimated leaf area index the rainfall was combined with irrigation events previously predicted by swat 2 free boundary condition imposed on the base layer this boundary condition assumes that the water table is far below the bottom boundary the percolation is calculated based on a zero pressure head gradient 3 seepage face boundary condition imposed on the side boundary along the foot slope of the domain 2 5 2 4 initial conditions each simulation year started on january 1st when evapotranspiration rates are low and soil water contents are near field capacity soil water was initiated at field capacity which was implemented in hydrus by setting the initial soil water potential to 350cm this was confirmed by a quick examination of the swat hru output file which also indicated that soil water was near capacity at the beginning of each simulation year 2 5 3 parameterization the in situ tension infiltrometer measurements were conducted at three locations within the hydrus site representing the shoulder back and foot slopes the parameters of the dp function of the surface layer were deduced by performing inverse solution on the in situ tension infiltrometer measurements while the parameters of the sp function eq 6 for all layers were deduced from the sand silt and clay fractions using the neural network prediction tool included in hydrus satisfactory inverse solutions were obtained for the surface layer and the sublayers of the shoulder and back slope sites table 2 however both the sp and dp functions led to unsatisfactory inverse solutions at the foot slope sites for that site reasonable fit between the simulated and calibrated data was obtained by manually calibrating the dual permeability model unfortunately hydrus accommodates the dual permeability model only in the two dimensional 2d context therefore the results of the foot slope were not included in the three dimensional characterization of the site the final set of parameters was used to parameterize the hydrus dp and hydrus sp models table 2 the subsurface layers in both models were represented by the sp function while the dp function was applied to the surface layer of the hydrus dp model for the hydrus sp and hydrus dp models the distribution of the root water uptake calculated by eq 4 was edited into the hydrus soil properties table in order to allow for root uptake conditions similar to the swat model 3 results 3 1 swat model 3 1 1 calibration and validation the curve numbers cns for the hrus involved were kept at their default values 81 for aydoun and 78 for ramtha runoff generation simulated by swat was near zero in 1990 and 1993 and 6 and 22mm of runoff were generated during 1991 and 1992 respectively fig 6 this seems reasonable considering the available knowledge of the swat watershed for example visual observations made by landowners and farmers suggest that runoff is either non existing or minimal thus major runoff events are not anticipated the low runoff in the swat watershed fig 3 was also verified by calibrating and validating swat for the whole zrb the comparison between streamflow simulated by swat and observed streamflow at the jaresh bridge station fig 5 yielded acceptable nash sutcliffe coefficients of 0 70 and 0 62 for the calibration and validation periods respectively figs 7 and 8 fig 9 shows the areal average rainfall of each sub watershed during the four year simulation period 1990 1993 the annual average runoff from the swat watershed fig 3 was about 4 7mm which is close to the 5 7mm simulated by the swat model calibrated for the whole zrb area fig 10 3 1 2 irrigation schedule the irrigation schedule was predicted by swat using the automatic irrigation practice option which was set to restore the soil water content swc to field capacity fc after 20mm depletion of swc the irrigation schedules simulated by swat for each hru within the hydrus site were similar but not identical for example the cumulative irrigation depths simulated by swat during the calendar year of 1993 were between 940 and 1280mm fig 11 a record low rainfall of 47mm fig 4 was observed during 1993 therefore a cumulative irrigation depth of 1280mm simulated by swat for the ramtha 15 999 hru during 1993 would reasonably account for the crop water requirement for all seven hrus located within the hydrus site table 3 hence a fixed irrigation schedule was adopted in order to facilitate similar irrigation schedules for swat and hydrus 3 1 3 soil water swat estimated area weighted average actual evapotranspiration rates of 1128 1117 1070 and 1094mm for the calendar years of 1990 1991 1992 and 1993 respectively fig 12 water stress was not indicated in any of the hrus hence the fixed irrigation schedule was adequate and enough water was supplied to the crops the area weighted average of the percolation depth simulated by the swat model showed that deep percolation was induced by daily rainfall greater than 20mm fig 13 approximately one third of total deep percolation was influenced by rainfall events during 1991 and 1993 the years that saw near and above average annual rainfall respectively a steady increase in deep percolation was simulated during the dry summer season as the result of the fixed irrigation schedule that tends to keep the soil water content slightly above field capacity swat results also suggested that deep percolation is influenced by slope class fig 14 the percolation values of the 0 5 5 10 and 10 15 slope classes oscillated around the area weighted average but the excess soil water from the 15 9999 slope class was removed from the soil profile via subsurface lateral flow swat predicted an annual lateral flow between 108 and 140mm which was not simulated by the sp and dp hydrus models two swat parameters were adjusted in order to eliminate the discrepancy between swat and dp esco and the slope length parameter esco is defined as the evaporation soil compensation factor and was initially set to a default value of 0 95 which only allows evaporation to occur from the top 100mm of the soil during calibration esco was reduced to a value of 0 8 to allow swat to meet the evaporative demand from the upper 200mm of the soil profile the reduction of the esco parameter resulted in a net decrease in deep percolation as more soil water was extracted to meet the evaporation demand the slope length is the subsurface length used in swat for the calculation of lateral discharge a short slope length means that most of the soil water saturating the lower semi impermeable soil layer will be discharged to the main stream as lateral flow to reduce the lateral discharge simulated by swat the slope length was set to an upper limit value of 150m thereby 90 of the lateral flow simulated by swat was eliminated fig 13 overall the gap between the swat and the hydrus dp models was narrowed by calibrating esco and the slope length 3 2 hydrus model 3 2 1 soil water the swat results were contrasted with two hydrus simulations the first simulation assumed no preferential flow so the soil physical properties were characterized by the sp model for the second hydrus simulation preferential flow was considered by using the dp model table 2 the cumulative flux from the free drainage boundary condition for both hydrus simulations reiterated the general deep percolation pattern found in swat results especially the peaks of deep percolation induced by substantial rainfall events fig 13 the total deep percolation simulated by the sp model was approximately half the deep percolation simulated by the dp model however for the calendar year of 1992 the sp model simulated 200mm of deep percolation i e two thirds of the deep percolation predicted by the dp model this was due to the above average rainfall during 1992 the sp model demonstrated a gradual decrease in the percolation rates and a smooth response to major rainfall events in contrast hydrus dp and swat models demonstrated abrupt increases in the cumulative percolation rates which coincided with major rainfall events for example percolation rates spiked at julian days 334 in 1991 and 33 in 1992 swat simulated annual percolation exceeded annual percolation simulated by the hydrus dp model by an average of 40mm lateral flow from the seepage boundary conditions was not simulated by the sp or the dp model lateral flow through the side boundary only occurs when the seepage boundary is saturated i e the soil water potential is zero this condition was not met during the simulation period the sp model estimated a four year average of 1200mm of actual evapotranspiration aet compared to 1120 and 1045mm of aet simulated by the dp and swat models respectively fig 13 thus the difference in cumulative percolation between the sp and dp models was partially compensated by a comparable increase in aet 4 discussion 4 1 influence of preferential flow the dp model was applied to the surface layer the physical parametrization of this layer was based on in situ field measurements using a tension infiltrometer although the subsurface layers were represented by the sp model the flow within the soil profile was a function of preferential flow occurring in the surface layer the fast drainage of soil water from the surface to the subsurface layer reduced the amount of water available to meet the evaporative demand and subsequently increased the deep percolation this was evident from the comparison of the sp and the dp models rahbeh et al 2013 discussed the role of evapotranspiration in controlling runoff and deep percolation rates irrigation can boost crop growth which increases the evapotranspiration but the presence of preferential pathways within the surface layer may provide quick release routes for the soil water which may prompt farmers to add more water hydrus simulations also showed that the differences in the deep percolation simulation between the sp and dp models occurred during the rainy season and was particularly associated with major rainfall events with depths greater than 20mm similarly gish et al 2004 suggested that preferential flow may be initiated by a critical input flux mcgrath et al 2010 also found that preferential flow is triggered by major rainfall events 4 2 implications for the swat model the swat model predicted more rapid percolation than the hydrus sp and dp models this can be attributed to the structure of the soil water routing equation in swat eq 2 which approximates the total percolation time based on the saturated hydraulic conductivity eq 3 without adjusting for unsaturated conditions therefore swat not only overestimates the deep percolation rates but it also alters the hydrological pathways by reducing evaporation from the depleted surface layer and redirecting water from evaporation to deep percolation therefore it is important to adjust the total amounts of deep percolation with respect to evaporation this may be done by reducing the esco parameter to 0 8 or less which extends the subsurface depth from which the evaporative demand can be met thus at least partially restricting the rapid downward movement of soil water the soil water in excess of field capacity may become lateral discharge if the horizontal saturated water movement exceeds the percolation rate through the bottom soil layer this condition was simulated by swat for hrus characterized by steep slopes where rapid downward movement of soil water caused an overestimation of lateral discharge the results of the hydrus models showed that subsurface layers never reached saturation so lateral discharge was not simulated by either the sp or the dp models besides the saturated hydraulic conductivity the lateral discharge in swat is also governed by the soil slope length a short slope length means fast removal of excess soil water via the lateral discharge route however on a typical hillslope there is a gradual transition between steep shoulder and gentle foot slopes furthermore the actual discharge of lateral flow occurs at the interface of the stream and the foot slope it is not possible to measure the actual length of the soil slope in swat because the hrus are not geo referenced within each sub watershed therefore the length of the soil slope should be considered as a parameter that can be adjusted in order to alter the subsurface water movement from horizontal to vertical directions this is especially justified in arid watersheds where the lack of vertical saturation of the soil profile prevents the initiation of horizontal water movement 4 3 the combined use of hydrus and swat models the comparison between the results of hydrus and swat models provided two benefits for this research the first benefit is that the hydrus model provided a better physical interpretation of the swat model results the results suggested that the swat model resembles the hydrus dp model indicating that the swat model already contains some aspects of preferential flow such an outcome is favorable for this research because the in situ soil measurements conducted along the zarqa river strongly suggested the presence of preferential flow for other case studies where matrix flow prevails the hydrus model can be used to address and verify necessary improvements in the swat model such as adjusting the soil water routing module eqs 2 and 3 for unsaturated conditions it is noteworthy that swat model simulations of deep percolation and groundwater recharge may be difficult to verify using the standard calibration and validation process rahbeh et al 2011 in this regard the hydrus model can provide an additional verification of swat model results the second benefit is that the hydrus model helped in narrowing the range of values for two swat parameters esco and the soil slope length the standard calibration and validation approach of the swat model produces several combinations of calibrated parameters that can provide a satisfactory fit between the simulated and the observed data however several possible sets of calibrated parameters may also lead to contradictory conclusions the hydrus model can help in selecting the most plausible set of calibrated parameters 5 conclusion the in situ measurements using a tension infiltrometer and the results of the hydrus dp model showed that preferential flow processes occurring in the upper 30cm of the soil profile control the downward movement of excess soil water both the swat and hydrus dp models are suitable for predicting preferential soil water movement in arid watersheds in fact the deep percolation simulations obtained from swat resemble the results of the dp model provided that proper parameterization is applied the esco parameter should be set to a value of 0 8 or less the soil slope length should be set to its maximum possible value i e 150m or adjusted to reflect realistic simulation of lateral discharge the research results imply that the soil water module of the swat model eqs 2 and 3 requires further consideration because it cannot accommodate the matrix flow this research recommends using hydrus model to verify swat model predictions of soil water redistribution in the soil profile and to improve the parameterization of the swat model the research also suggests an approach for the combined use of both models including the following basic steps 1 select a site or sites within the study watershed for the setup of hydrus model 2 conduct an initial calibration and validation of the swat model for the whole watershed 3 select a sub watershed or sub watersheds that include the hydrus model site or sites and prepare the setup of the swat model for the selected sub watersheds the sub watersheds should be small enough to accommodate hru s that have management practices land use and soil properties similar to the hydrus model site s 4 adjust the soil properties values of the swat model at the hru level according to the hydrus model results conflict of interest none declared ethical statement authors state that the research was conducted

ecohydrological functioning of a watershed in order to investigate their spatio temporal dynamics hydrological models are valuable tools however to minimize uncertainties of the modeled estimates good quality distributed observational data sets are required for realist predictions the aim of this study is to apply the soil and water assessment tool swat in a representative watershed of the northeastern brazil and to evaluate the effects of using both discharge and soil moisture datasets on the model uncertainties and predictions the study area is located in the mundaú river basin 4090 39km2 for streamflow the values of the nash sutcliffe model efficiency ns among gauge stations ranged from 0 71 to 0 92 in the calibration phase for the annual time step and between 0 55 and 0 78 in the monthly time step in the validation phase ns values ranged from 0 53 to 0 76 for the annual time step and between 0 62 and 0 72 for the monthly time step calibration and validation against daily soil moisture data resulted in a ns values of 0 53 and 0 52 and pbias of 0 4 and 1 1 respectively these results represent satisfactory and very good performances for discharge and soil moisture although there is still some amount of uncertainty the use of complementary data such as soil moisture to calibrate and validate the swat model is useful especially when discharge data are scarce as for some watersheds in the semiarid zone keywords data scarcity soil moisture hydrological modeling swatcup uncertainty analysis 1 introduction increasing water scarcity and the lack of water resources planning and management are major tasks for meeting future water demands and reducing society vulnerability onu 2012 according to marengo 2014 drought events might affect water and economic security in brazil generating restrictions on the water supply for the population and for the environmental sustainability hydrological models provide an overall understanding of processes dynamics that occur in the soil plant atmosphere system although presenting a degree of uncertainty in their results engel et al 2007 increasingly such tools have been used for planning management and water resources policy for consistent predictions uncertainties inherent to the model calibration validation and evaluation should be accounted for harmel and smith 2007 studies related to the analysis of uncertainties of distributed models have been increasing carried out abbaspour et al 2018 according to abbaspour 2015 calibration and analysis of uncertainties of semi distributed watershed models are subject to a number of issues such as their parameterization the non uniqueness of a set of parameters the definition of what is a calibrated model what are the appropriate limits of its use and the calibration in watersheds where land uses or streams have been greatly modified in addition input data and spatial scale simplifications are also considered as sources of uncertainties abbott and refsgaard 1996 beven 2012 in direct modeling calibration with a single parameter value results in a single model signal on the other hand in an inverse modeling the observed data can be well estimated by different sets of parameters that is with different solutions abbaspour 2015 inverse modeling has become a widely used calibration method in recent years andrade et al 2013 abbaspour et al 2015 bressiani et al 2015 franco and bonumá 2017 blainski et al 2017 the approach that considers more than a single variable to calibrate and validate the model can help reduce the uncertainties associated to calibration procedure beven 2006 2012 daggupati et al 2015 additionally the adoption of different streamflow gauge stations along the watershed might also reduce uncertainties among the various distributed hydrologic models the soil and water assessment tool swat a semi distributed continuous time process based hydrology and water quality model neitsch et al 2011 was developed to analyze the impacts of land use changes on discharge erosion sedimentation and water quality in gauged and ungauged watersheds arnold et al 1998 it is an open source code that considers different hydrologic and agronomic processes ranging from catchment to continental scales abbaspour et al 2015 bressiani et al 2015 soil moisture plays an important role in the hydrology of a watershed affecting several hydrological processes and characteristics such as infiltration percolation hydraulic conductivity recharge and discharge however there are still a reduced number of studies involving the calibration of distributed hydrological models such as swat based on measurements of soil moisture despite its potential in reducing modeling uncertainties in data scarce situations rajib et al 2016 performed a multi objective calibration of the swat model using spatially distributed remotely sensed and in situ soil moisture along with streamflow observations according to the authors acceptable streamflow simulation can be obtained without using any soil moisture information in model calibration however although there is considerable amount of uncertainty equifinality the use of soil moisture data improved the simulated results li et al 2018 performed the swat model calibration using streamflow measurements and remote sensing derived soil moisture values and a more consistent and statistically significant improvement was achieved due to the spatial information introduced by the remotely sensed soil moisture data the aim of this study is to apply the soil and water assessment tool swat in a representative watershed of the northeastern brazil and to evaluate the effects of using two observational datasets on the model uncertainties and predictions for the swat model calibration and validation in this data scarce region we investigate the use of two variables namely the experimental soil moisture data from sensors and the observed discharge obtained from five streamflow gauging stations along the watershed 2 material and methods 2 1 study area the mundaú river basin mrb has a drainage area of 4090 39km2 spreading throughout the states of pernambuco and alagoas in northeastern brazil fig 1 the mrb is predominantly rural has substantial agricultural activity including a large dairy and broilers breeding industry it also has substantial sugarcane production and processing industry the basin has urban areas covering 34 municipalities composed by native vegetation comprised of a small region of caatinga and areas of atlantic forest water bodies such as the mundaú river lagoon and large pasture areas andrade et al 2017b the caatinga vegetation is characterized by seasonally dry shrubs and forests leal et al 2005 while the atlantic forest vegetation

infiltration subsurface flow baseflow and evapotranspiration soil moisture plant growth nutrients pesticides bacteria and pathogens and soil management arnold et al 2012a for the hydrological modeling with swat the watershed is previously divided into several sub basins which amount depends on the minimum drainage area afterwards the model carries out combinations among the land use soil types and slope layers producing the hydrological response units hrus evapotranspiration estimation as well as surface runoff is predicted separately for each hru to enable a better physical representation of hydrological processes strauch et al 2012 the swat model offers three options for estimating the potential evapotranspiration et0 component penman monteith fao hargreaves samani and priestley taylor methods the model standard method is the penman monteith fao which requires meteorological variables such as solar radiation temperature relative humidity and wind speed neitsch et al 2005 in the present study the hargreaves samani method was adopted as it requires only radiation and temperature data and it fits very well for semiarid regions the swat model requires four main types of input data including three maps which are the digital elevation model dem the land use map the soil type map and a series of meteorological data such as precipitation maximum and minimum air temperatures relative humidity wind speed and solar radiation table 1 presents the sources used for the mundaú basin related to maps hydrological and meteorological data sources as well as the data description used with the swat model the digital elevation model dem was obtained from the brazilian agricultural research corporation embrapa fig 1 the land use map of the mrb was constructed using satellite images and image processing tools from landsat 5 the images interpretation was carried out through digital processing tools associated with gps data collection mapping was performed using the supervised classification method adopting the maximum likelihood classifier land use was divided into seven classes presented in fig 2a the association of land uses defined in the mrb with the land use classes in the swat database are presented in table 2 the sixteen soil classes present in the mrb are shown in fig 2b in relation to the weather stations eleven stations measuring only precipitation and two stations recording other meteorological data were adopted additionally five streamflow gauge stations and one soil moisture station were selected for this study the stations locations are presented in fig 1 one of the major problems in modeling brazilian river basins is the lack of extensive series of hydro meteorological data high number of failures or when the data are present they often lack consistency regarding the data availability for the mundaú river basin there are rainfall data since the 1920s however such data present large numbers of failures and not all stations distributed along the watershed have the same data recording period therefore a detailed survey was carried out on all the stations aiming to examine their failures and consistencies until verifying that the period of rainfall data considered acceptable for hydrological modeling with the swat model for the mrb is from 2000 to 2016 constituting 17 years of observational data in relation to streamflow data although there are data since 1980 due to accentuated failures in older periods the adopted experimental period was from 2000 to 2016 comprising 17 years which is usually enough to capture long term time variations as stated by kenard et al these authors point out that in studies that involve hydrological modeling through the use of streamflow data it is recommended that the data series used for modeling presents at least 15 years of records in order to allow identification of important properties related to hydrological processes variability and dynamics the experimental soil moisture data m3 m 3 were obtained from sensors campbell scientific cs 616 installed at the soil profile every 10cm up to 50cm depth and connected to an agrometeorological station located in a strategic area of the watershed under supervision of the federal rural university of pernambuco garanhuns academic unit that provide soil moisture data recorded every 30min the station is located at fazenda riacho do papagaio municipality of são joão pe 8 48 34 2 s and 36 24 29 2 w 695m with an area of 16ha of pasture fig 1 soil water content mm was calculated from soil moisture m3 m 3 considering a depth of 50cm and the measurements were extrapolated to the sub basin at which the station is located there are soil moisture records since 2011 in the station representing a time series of 7 years for the purpose of this study only two years of data was adopted due to higher data quality for this period such configuration presented previously shows that the data scarcity condition is an important issue for the mundaú river basin 2 3 calibration and validation procedures the calibration procedure of swat model was performed in the swat calibration and uncertainty programs swat cup the swat cup is an independent software developed for sensitivity analyses calibration and validation and uncertainty analyses based on swat simulations the program comprises five calibration procedures sufi 2 pso glue parasol and mcmc eleven goal functions mult sum r2 chi2 ns br2 ssqr pbias kge rsr mns and includes applications such as visualization of the study area abbaspour et al 2018 in this study the calibration procedure was performed in the swat cup using the sequential uncertainty fitting algorithm sufi 2 additionally the nash sutcliffe model efficiency ns coefficient was used as goal function sufi 2 is a routine used to capture the uncertainties of the modeling process according to abbaspour 2015 there is a close relationship between the calibration process and the uncertainties and it is of great importance to identify them in sufi 2 the uncertainty of the input parameters is expressed as ranges whereas the uncertainties of the output parameters are expressed from the 95 ppu 95 probability distribution which are calculated at levels of 2 5 and 97 5 of the cumulative distribution of an output variable using latin american hypercube sampling the quantification of the adjustment between the simulation results and the observed data expressed as 95 ppu can be performed by two statistical indices the p factor and the r factor the p factor is the percentage of the observed data points within the uncertainty of model prediction at 95 ppu and varies from 0 to 1 where 1 indicates 100 adjustment of the measured data within model prediction uncertainty i e a perfect model simulation considering the uncertainty while the r factor is the mean uncertainty of the 95 ppu for this study values of the p factor above 70 and values of the r factor close to 1 were considered as adequate for discharge simulations in this study the p factor and the r factor were adopted to analyze the uncertainties of hydrological simulation the sensitivity analysis used in this study was previously performed by andrade et al 2017a using the sufi 2 of the swat cup considering a global sensitivity analysis of 19 parameters related to the processes of flow evapotranspiration percolation recharge infiltration among others in order to identify the most sensitive ones for the mrb simulations according to the authors the two most sensitivity parameters were the curve number for moisture condition ii cn2 and the coefficient of water percolation to the deep aquifer rchrg dp the cn2 was one of the parameters chosen for the calibration of the present study in addition some other parameters were analyzed which did not present such sensitivity in the previous study of andrade et al 2017a the fact is that the latter authors worked with only part of the mrb while the present study focuses on the whole basin such difference in scale interferes in the sensitivity analysis that is the seven parameters used for calibration in this study are not necessarily the same proposed by andrade et al 2017a the first three years of the available streamflow data series were used to warm up the swat model 2000 2002 the calibration 2003 2009 and validation 2010 2016 processes occurred in a hierarchical way first with an annual time step and then with a monthly time step starting from the most upstream stations then proceeding to the closest station to the basin outlet with a total of five stations calibrated and validated along the watershed several researchers used time series of streamflow data with less than 17 years to calibrate and validate the swat model such as wallace et al 2018 which worked with 8 years of data tuo et al 2016 which used 10 years of discharge data and narsimlu et al 2015 which adopted 16 years of fluviometric data for swat modeling for soil moisture data the model was calibrated and validated using daily soil moisture measurements for the years of 2014 and 2015 respectively some tests performed for the hierarchical calibration of the swat model have been proposed by klemes 1986 split sample test differential split sample test and proxy catchment test in this study the split sample test was applied which consists of a classic test where the series of hydrological data should be divided into two segments one for calibration and the other for validation this division might occur in two equal parts 50 50 when the series is sufficiently long or in the configuration 70 30 when the series is not sufficiently long as is the case of this study 17 years of data in the calibration and validation process of the swat model for the mundaú river basin in each sub basin studied the data series used for calibration validation varied among sub basins ranging from 50 50 to 78 22 and averaging approximately 70 30 the calibration data included both dry and wet periods there are several statistical performance indicators for hydrological simulation the most commonly reported for swat calibration and validation are the determination coefficient r 2 the nash sutcliffe model efficiency ns and the percent bias pbias the ns varies between negative infinite and 1 0 the optimal value values between 0 and 1 are generally regarded as acceptable performance levels and values 0 indicate that it is better to use the mean observed data than the predicted value of the model nash and sutcliffe 1970 in relation to pbias its optimal value is 0 with low magnitudes indicating good precision in the model simulation positive values indicate underestimation by the model and negative values indicate overestimation gupta et al 1999 according to abbaspour et al 2004 a model is to be considered satisfactorily calibrated by sufi 2 when r 2 is higher than 0 80 moriasi et al 2007 state nse 0 5 and 25 pbias 25 as satisfactory values while nse 0 75 and 10 pbias 10 are considered very good for discharge calibration of hydrological models in this study the statistical evaluation rating criteria used are based on moriasi et al 2007 in addition to the statistical evaluation analyses were carried out on information frequently extracted from the hydrograph especially some associated with the flow duration curves 3 results and discussion 3 1 optimized parameters for streamflow and soil moisture table 3 lists the parameters which were used for both discharge and soil moisture calibration in the annual monthly and daily time steps using the swat model their descriptions within the model and their calibrated values those parameters are related to hydrological processes such as curve number moisture condition ii cn2 main channel manning s coefficient ch n2 water depth in shallow aquifer required for return flow gwqmn groundwater delay gw delay baseflow recession constant alpha bf saturated hydraulic conductivity sol k and available water capacity sol awc according to blainski et al 2017 some of these parameters are difficult to measure such as gwqmn alpha bf and gw delay the adjusted values for the parameters were then adopted for validation and scenarios generation it is important to highlight that during the parameterization of a hydrological model for calibration different intervals can produce good statistical results however these differences in values might result in incorrect responses to the prediction of land use and climate change scenarios for example therefore it is very important to know the basin characteristics in order to minimize the uncertainties related to parameterization schaefli et al 2004 zhang et al 2009 in the present study the calibrated value of the curve number cn parameter was 73 7 in rural basins this value represents land use of normal permanent fields as pastures for hydrological group c that is soils capable of generating above average discharge and low infiltration rates it was also noticed that these soil types present a considerable amount of clay and are usually shallow most of the soils present in the mundaú river basin have a type d hydrological group however there is also a large representation of group c indicating that the value of the calibrated cn adequately represents the general characteristics of the watershed additionally most of the basin is occupied by pastures further confirming the adequate representation of this parameter in the studied area zettam et al 2017 performing hydrological and sedimentological modeling in the tafna river basin africa a semiarid watershed with 7245km2 of drainage area found calibrated values of cn between 38 5 and 94 the catchment area of the tafna river has 10 land uses types dominated by calcaire soils being the most part of the area characterized by pasture southwestern range swrn perennial semiarid vegetation with leaf area index up 1 5 tomato and winter weat hammouri et al 2017 assessed the impacts of climate change on water resources in arid and semiarid regions of jordan and found a calibrated value of cn equal to 82 6 the basin studied by the authors has about 60 of rainfed agricultural lands and 20 are irrigated with silty clay and silty clay loam as dominant soil types brouziyne et al 2017 performing the manual calibration of the swat model in a semiarid watershed in north western morocco found cn values between 58 and 70 among the land use categories established by the authors the main land cover class is the pasture with approximately 42 and large variability of soil types ranging from loamy clay soils to well drained sandy soils as expected and highlighted by lin et al 2014 the spatial heterogeneity of land use and soil types has significant influence on the runoff spatial distribution in a catchment and hence on the cn values the baseflow recession constant alpha bf ranged from 0 to 1 day as suggested by arnold et al 2012a with 0 05 being the calibrated value very close to 0 048 which is the model default value the interval chosen was the same as that adopted by bressiani 2016 who worked with a watershed located in the ceará state northeastern brazil which has a predominantly caatinga biome and is inserted in a predominantly semiarid climatic zone according to arnold et al 2012a alpha bf values between 0 1 and 0 3 mean that there is a slow recharge response in the basin while values between 0 9 and 1 indicate a rapid response the fitted value of 0 05 indicates that the baseflow recession for the basin studied occurs slowly and consistently which is expected for basins with perennial rivers as is the case of the mrb pereira et al 2014 found a calibrated alpha bf value of 0 004 when performing hydrological simulation using the swat model in a headwater basin in southeastern brazil vaghefi et al 2014 analyzed the impact of climate change on water resources components in semiarid regions of the iran found alpha bf values ranging from 0 to 0 511 using spatially distributed streamflow and remotely sensed soil moisture data rajib et al 2016 performed the multi objective calibration of the swat model and found alpha bf values ranging from 0 45 to 0 77 in the studied basins fontes júnior 2016 performing experimentation and hydrological modeling in a semiarid northeastern basin of brazil found a calibrated alpha bf value of 0 063 fukunaga et al 2015 applying the swat model in the itapemirim river basin brazil a tropical catchment found a calibrated alpha bf value of 0 027 the depth of water in shallow aquifers required for return flow gwqmn can vary from 0 to 4000mm with these values being the default limits given by the swat model the calibrated value of 2686mm indicates that for the occurrence of the return flow in the mundaú watershed the water table should be equal to or greater than approximately 2 7m in depth the return flow from groundwater is related to rainfall and especially with evapotranspiration since it is strongly dependent of capillary flow vaghefi et al 2014 found gwqmn of 3064 7mm for a basin with precipitations of 240 660mmyear 1 and evapotranspiration ranging from 200 to over 1000mmyear 1 zhang et al 2015 performing simulation of peak flows under climate change in lanjiang catchment east china found gwqmn values from 2465 11mm to 4673 13mm the catchment is characterized by a sub tropical humid monsoon climate and the annual mean rainfall is about 1600mm brighenti et al 2016 when performing a hierarchical calibration of the swat model in a watershed in the santa catarina state brazil found gwqmn of 2290 54mm this basin presents similarities with the mundaú river watershed such as the presence of gleisols and maximum and minimum precipitation of 2500 and 1082mm respectively as already stated for mundáu basin rainfall varies from 497 to 1143 63mm some authors have found low values of gwqmn particularly for catchments presenting shallow soils as fontes júnior 2016 for the alto ipanema basin brazil with gwqmn of 717 5mm and blainski et al 2017 for camboriú river basin brazil with gwqmn of 1000mm the groundwater delay gw delay in the mundaú river basin with 4090 39km2 was of approximately 135 days whereas xue et al 2014 when analyzing the parameter uncertainty of surface flow and sediment yield in the huolin basin china with an area of 8102km2 found calibrated values of the gw delay of 101 days on the other hand blainski et al 2017 found a value of 0 65 indicating that the time interval required for the underground recharge in the camboriú river basin with 195km2 was less than 1 day such differences highlight the strong role of the drainage area size on the gw delay parameter the manning s n value for the main channel ch n2 calibrated in the present study was 0 34 similarly to the alpha bf the ch n2 is within the limit of the suggested range in swat input output document arnold et al 2012a which is 0 01 ch n2 0 3 in this case ch n2 is in the maximum allowed value ch n2 0 34 approximately 0 3 chow 1959 has a wide list of manning s roughness coefficients for natural river channels and according to the author the main characteristics of channel with maximum values of ch n2 0 15 are very weedy reaches deep pools or floodways with heavy stand of timber and underbrush rajib et al 2016 found values adjusted from 0 02 to 0 15 in the studied basins in turn pereira et al 2014 obtained 0 011 for the galo creek watershed located in the espírito santo state brazil in the basin atlantic forest vegetation and pasture correspond to approximately 53 and 42 of the area respectively and the soil is characterized as red yellow oxisols which covers 92 of the area fontes júnior 2016 found adjusted values from 0 072 to 0 254 in the studied basin for water channels along alluvial deposits and shrubs riparian vegetation alongside the river beds it can be seen in table 3 that the calibrated value of the sol k parameter is very close to the upper limit allowed by the initial range sol k 953 59 according to andrade et al 2013 saturated hydraulic conductivity usually presents a high spatial variability and the swat model does not take into account this spatial distribution but rather a mean value for a given soil type then the model provides from the optimization process the maximum value allowed in the calibration step oliveira júnior et al 2014 obtained experimentally in the same area of the present study maximum values of sol k of 1036 8 and 1681 2mmh 1 for pasture and caatinga covers respectively initial estimates of available water capacity vary for different soil types ranging from 0 04mmmm 1 to 0 12mmmm 1 for sol awc calibration values were allowed to vary by a factor of 60 to 60 calibration resulted in a 32 increase in sol awc for all soils generating calibrated values between 0 053mmmm 1 and 0 158mmmm 1 3 2 calibration and uncertainty analysis for streamflow comparison between the simulated and observed hydrographs is an important procedure to evaluate model calibration andrade et al 2013 blainski et al 2017 fig 3a j shows the hydrographs observed and simulated by the swat model in the calibration and validation phases for the five streamflow gauge stations of the mundaú river basin santana do mundaú são josé da laje união dos palmares murici and rio largo for annual and monthly time steps respectively for both time steps a satisfactory fitting between measured and simulated hydrograms was observed in general good calibrations and validations are achieved when the data series used to calibrate and validate the model included both dry and wet years within the region in addition good correspondence between other model outputs and measured data soil moisture evapotranspiration etc might increase confidence in model calibration arnold et al 2012b zhang et al 2015 good correspondence was observed fig 3 between the majority of simulated and measured peak flows especially when the calibration and validation were performed in an annual time step andrade et al 2017b with the model still uncalibrated had already observed good correspondences between the hydrographs simulated by swat and the data observed for the same study area observing the monthly hydrographs some peaks were not well represented by the calibrated model for example during 2003 at santana do mundaú fig 3b when the model slightly overestimated the observed values the same could be seen during validation in 2010 with the model underestimating the observed values in 2012 there was a small displacement of the hydrograph to the left at the são josé da laje station some differences between observed and simulated data could also be seen for example for calibration in the years of 2004 and 2005 when the model failed to reach the peak flows causing the ns to decrease in relation to the other stations fig 3d although minimal according to silva and medeiros 2014 these differences may be associated with model simulation difficulties or uncertainties in the input data however in general terms the correspondence between observed and simulated flows were good in the mrb the recession periods were well simulated by the swat model under all proposed conditions confirming the adequate representation and applicability of the swat model for the studied region according to andrade et al 2013 the swat model fitting during the recession periods both in calibration and validation periods indicates good model performance in simulating low flows for both the calibration and validation periods the correspondence of the simulated to the observed hydrographs was higher for the annual time step than for the monthly simulation as reflected by a higher ns for the annual time step the rainfall rates over the studied years are presented in fig 4 it is possible to verify that 2004 was an unusually wet year 1493 3mm total annual rainfall with eight months of the year receiving monthly precipitation over 100mm additionally 2012 was an extremely dry year with below average rainfall 623 5mm the mean value for the 2003 2016 period was 1092 5mm the comparison between two hydrological years with distinct characteristics 2004 wet year and 2012 dry year for the five streamflow gauge stations in the mundaú river basin is given in fig 5 the greater rainfall in 2004 was reflected in greater than normal peak flows increasing from upstream santana do mundaú station with observed flow of 9 23m3 s 1 to downstream rio largo with observed flow of 45 68m3 s 1 fig 3a c e g and i during the validation period the hydrographs fig 3c e g and i show that 2012 was an extremely dry year with below average rainfall and consequently small runoff production and lower peaks this occasioned in lower values of ns because this coefficient result is quite sensitive to estimates of peak flows in fact it is easier to calibrate the swat model in wet periods when there are more frequent peak flows than in dry periods when flow generation is reduced table 4 shows the comparison among the statistical indicators p factor r factor r 2 ns and pbias for discharge calibration using the swat cup semiautomatic calibration method the calibration step of a hydrological model is subjective and no automatic algorithm is able in replacing the researcher s knowledge in relation to his study area therefore the calibration procedures and uncertainty analysis are closely connected and no calibration should be performed without quantifying the degree of uncertainty associated to the model prediction abbaspour et al 2015 in hydrological modeling it is very important to carry out a careful model calibration that is to parameterize it adequately in order to reduce much of the uncertainties associated to modeling over estimation might lead to an excessive application of mitigating measures while under estimation can lead to insufficient preparation for extreme conditions duan et al 1992 van griensven et al 2008 kumar et al 2017 the calibration results show high values of p factor 0 79 annual and 0 89 monthly in average which indicates the high percentage 79 and 89 in matching measured data in the 95ppu plot fig 3 and the range of uncertainty in the output values the thickness of uncertainty band can be seen in 95ppu by the r factor 1 01 annual and 1 26 monthly in average a large p factor and a r factor close to 1 indicate that the uncertainty in simulation were properly predicted by the model in the validation period the values of p factor 0 88 annual and 0 73 monthly in average were also above 70 and r factor values were close to 1 2 22 annual and 1 20 monthly in average indicating good adjustment between the simulation results and the observed discharge data the model uncertainty may be associated with several factors such as natural and anthropogenic processes that occur in the watershed but which are not included in the model yang et al 2008 the uncertainty in soil and water parameters as well as the climate variation during the modeling period abbaspour et al 2015 the values of the determination coefficient r 2 varied between 0 72 and 0 93 in the calibration phase in the annual time step and between 0 56 and 0 79 in the monthly time step for the validation phase r 2 values ranged from 0 63 to 0 99 in the annual time step and from 0 66 to 0 76 in the monthly time step these results indicate that in general the performance of the swat model might be considered satisfactory for the mrb since there were values of r 2 above 0 80 a multi variable calibration of the swat model with remote sensing evapotranspiration data and observed flow data in the upper rio negro basin 3453km2 in the santa catarina and paraná states brazil were performed by franco and bonumá 2017 the authors found r 2 values of 0 76 and 0 78 in the calibration phase and of 0 58 and 0 75 in the validation phase using observed flow data and considering different temporal strategies for calibration validation silva and medeiros 2014 when performing a hydro sedimentological analysis using the swat model for the experimental basin of são joão do cariri 13 5km2 found an r 2 value equal to 0 88 during manual calibration with discharge data the values of the nash sutcliffe model efficiency ns which depict the model precision especially in the representation of peak flows varied among stations from 0 71 to 0 92 in the calibration phase in the annual time step and from 0 55 to 0 78 in the monthly time step considered as satisfactory and very good performances according to the classification proposed by moriasi et al 2007 in the validation phase ns values ranged from 0 53 to 0 76 in the annual time step and from 0 62 to 0 72 in the monthly time step also considered satisfactory and very good performances table 4 by observing these results it is possible to verify that in general the performance of the swat model was better for the annual time step when compared to the monthly time step both for the calibration and validation phases this probably occurred as the monthly errors are smoothed when considering annual data in addition the ns value for the calibration phase was significantly higher than the value obtained for validation in fact ns values were expected to be higher for calibration the phase at which the parameters are modified in order to allow the model to achieve good performances than in the validation the phase during which the parameters are no longer modified most worldwide studies involving the swat model achieved good performances during the calibration phase however performance during validation is often much worse than for calibration this is often due to the over calibration occurred in the process leading to unsatisfactory results for the validation phase there are several studies in the literature that used the ns to test the swat efficiency for simulating the discharge behavior in watersheds around the world andrade et al 2013 found ns values of 0 66 and 0 87 for the calibration and validation phases in the jaguara river basin 32km2 brazil in turn xue et al 2014 found ns values of 0 81 and 0 83 for calibration and validation in the huolin river basin 8102km2 china brighenti et al 2016 found from unsatisfactory to satisfactory ns results in the negrinho river basin 200km2 brazil blainski et al 2017 found ns values of 0 66 and 0 89 for the calibration and validation in the camboriú river basin 195km2 brazil in comparison with previous work involving calibration and validation of the swat model in several parts of the world the ns values obtained for the mrb were satisfactory thus indicating that the swat model was able to represent the main hydrological processes in the mrb and yet suggesting that the model could be useful for simulation of similar watersheds the values of pbias varied in absolute terms between 1 1 and 8 2 in calibration for the annual time step and between 1 5 and 11 6 for the monthly time step for the validation phase pbias values ranged from 2 0 to 9 2 for the annual time step and from 1 2 to 24 2 for the monthly time step these results indicate that the swat model presented satisfactory and very good results according to the classification proposed by moriasi et al 2007 in comparison pereira et al 2014 found pbias values of 7 2 and 14 1 in the calibration and validation phases in the galo creek watershed brazil 3 3 calibration and uncertainty analysis for soil moisture in addition to the discharge data daily soil moisture data were used in this study fig 6 shows the temporal comparison between observed and simulated soil moisture for the calibration and validation phases for a sub basin in the mundaú basin in both steps a satisfactory correspondence was found between measured and simulated data this performance could be verified by the obtained statistical indices with ns values of 0 53 and 0 52 and pbias of 0 4 and 1 1 in the calibration and validation steps respectively these results represent satisfactory and very good performances according to the classification proposed by moriasi et al 2007 for this basin the values of pbias for soil moisture were better than for discharge table 4 however the ns values have not improved when compared to the results of discharge calibration according to vervoort et al 2014 the calibration process helps to improve the estimation of peak flows and recess periods by the model however when using soil moisture data there is not necessarily a better event based response during the simulation this may be a justification for the nash values have not increased when using soil moisture data compared to the calibration adopting the discharge data only according to the result of calibration with soil moisture data 100 of the observed data lies within the uncertainty band p factor 1 but this uncertainty may be high since the value of the r factor was not close to 1 r factor 7 08 fig 6 this could be related to the uncertainty in the soil characteristics but may also be related to the calibration scheme according to uniyal et al 2017 the model uncertainty could be associated to the simplified soil water equations of swat and to the considerable heterogeneity in the observed soil moisture data these uncertainties could be better evaluated through real time updating by collecting soil moisture data wanders et al 2014 alvarez garreton et al 2015 lievens et al 2015 fig 7 shows the simulation error error δ simulated observed between observed and simulated soil water content mm for the calibration and validation phases the error plot clearly indicates minimal or even zero errors in simulations for a significant portion of the time suggesting according to the simulation error that the soil water calibration improved model performance kundu et al 2017 found that rmse error values were reduced in the calibrated model when adopting soil moisture data according to li et al 2018 introducing soil moisture into the model calibration really strengthens the model ability in the forecasting of hydrologic processes since the physical connection between soil moisture and discharge is very strong in process based models it is important to mention that there are still very few studies in the literature that has used soil moisture data as an alternative to calibrate the swat model and most research has applied soil moisture data from remote sensing rajib et al 2016 kundu et al 2017 uniyal et al 2017 rajib et al 2016 performed a multi objective calibration of the swat model using spatially distributed remotely sensed soil moisture and discharge according to the authors satisfactory streamflow simulations could be obtained without using any soil moisture information in the calibration process however a significant improvement in pbias was observed in soil moisture outputs indicating the model ability to reduce uncertainty equifinality problems kundu et al 2017 used data remotely sensed surface soil moisture to calibrate the swat model at the warrego river catchment 69 290km2 and verified that soil moisture was a useful variable in reducing model calibration uncertainties according to the authors the use of soil moisture data enhanced model discharge predictions uniyal et al 2017 evaluated the spatial and temporal patterns of soil moisture simulated by the swat at 30cm depth with indirect soil moisture estimates from landsat images and found that the uncertainty band for soil moisture was narrower these results indicate that the swat model can be calibrated with alternative data such as soil moisture evapotranspiration leaf area index lai water table levels among others to enhance model performance however it is necessary to evaluate the associated uncertainties mainly because of the scale spatial resolution between discharge and the alternative data it is worth mentioning that these data must have high reliability and consistency to allow an adequate calibration the great importance of using alternative data in the calibration process is in the fact that a series of discharge data is not always available as is the case in some brazilian semiarid watersheds with intermittent flow regimes 3 4 flow durations curves analyses according to gomes and fernandes 2017 it is essential to understand the hydrological behavior of watersheds to get more precise results for planning all demands for water use through reference flow procedures one of the alternatives to determine water availability in a watershed is the construction of flow duration curves discharges with probability of exceedance equal to or over 90 are essential in hydrological studies for planning water supply since they indicate the quantity of water that can be guaranteed with the corresponding certainty level discharges with probability of exceedance of 50 are important to evaluate the maximum possible flow to be regularized the probability of exceedance equal to or lower than 10 are applied in studies associated to extreme flood events oliveira et al 2015 fig 8 illustrates the observed and simulated flow duration curves by the swat model in the calibration left and validation right steps by observing the flow duration curves both in the calibration and in the validation periods it can be observed that in general simulated flows below the 40 frequency were underestimated in relation to the flow rates above 80 the lowest flow rates the observed data were underestimated in calibration and overestimated in the validation phase with mean errors of 20 42 and 23 71 respectively in the calibration period the observed mean streamflow was equal to 33 74m3 s 1 and the simulated value was equal to 32 02m3 s 1 for monthly time step in the validation period the observed average streamflow was of 19 47m3 s 1 and the simulated was of 17 32m3 s 1 based on these differences which were of small magnitude it can be verified that the swat model adequately simulated the flow duration curves for the mrb demonstrating its quality and potential as a numerical tool for water resources management 4 conclusions in this study uncertainties were evaluated in using both discharge and soil moisture experimental data on swat calibration and validation for the mundaú river basin considering the representativeness of the watershed and the data scarcity for hydrological modeling the results are very satisfactory a good agreement between simulated and measured annual and monthly streamflow was demonstrated by the determination coefficient r 2 the nash sutcliffe model efficiency ns and the percent bias pbias with satisfactory and very good performances although there is a considerable amount of uncertainty the use of a series of alternative data to calibrate and validate the swat model e g soil moisture data is a feasible and promising option for hydrological modeling especially when hydrological and meteorological data series have low availability as is the case in some of the brazilian semiarid watersheds the use of soil moisture improved the calibration results with better value for the pbias moreover the adequate representation of soil moisture in the calibration process in addition to reducing the uncertainties in hydrological modeling is extremely valuable because the brazilian semiarid is a region with limited water flow volume in the rivers resulting in a dense network of intermittent watercourses with zero flows during the dry period thus the knowledge of the behavior of this variable becomes relevant as the soil moisture is one of the main variables affecting crops development flow generation and agricultural production systems in scarcity periods finally the outcomes achieved were very encouraging swat allows the hydrological processes on the mundaú to be suitably represented the calibrated swat model for the mundaú river basin might be used for scenarios generation the fitted parameters can be adopted to other study periods or to similar watersheds

university college station tx 77843 usa corresponding author soil moisture and discharge are interrelated variables which play a major role on water availability environmental conservation and ecohydrological functioning of a watershed in order to investigate their spatio temporal dynamics hydrological models are valuable tools however to minimize uncertainties of the modeled estimates good quality distributed observational data sets are required for realist predictions the aim of this study is to apply the soil and water assessment tool swat in a representative watershed of the northeastern brazil and to evaluate the effects of using both discharge and soil moisture datasets on the model uncertainties and predictions the study area is located in the mundaú river basin 4090 39km2 for streamflow the values of the nash sutcliffe model efficiency ns among gauge stations ranged from 0 71 to 0 92 in the calibration phase for the annual time step and between 0 55 and 0 78 in the monthly time step in the validation phase ns values ranged from 0 53 to 0 76 for the annual time step and between 0 62 and 0 72 for the monthly time step calibration and validation against daily soil moisture data resulted in a ns values of 0 53 and 0 52 and pbias of 0 4 and 1 1 respectively these results represent satisfactory and very good performances for discharge and soil moisture although there is still some amount of uncertainty the use of complementary data such as soil moisture to calibrate and validate the swat model is useful especially when discharge data are scarce as for some watersheds in the semiarid zone keywords data scarcity soil moisture hydrological modeling swatcup uncertainty analysis 1 introduction increasing water scarcity and the lack of water resources planning and management are major tasks for meeting future water demands and reducing society vulnerability onu 2012 according to marengo 2014 drought events might affect water and economic security in brazil generating restrictions on the water supply for the population and for the environmental sustainability hydrological models provide an overall understanding of processes dynamics that occur in the soil plant atmosphere system although presenting a degree of uncertainty in their results engel et al 2007 increasingly such tools have been used for planning management and water resources policy for consistent predictions uncertainties inherent to the model calibration validation and evaluation should be accounted for harmel and smith 2007 studies related to the analysis of uncertainties of distributed models have been increasing carried out abbaspour et al 2018 according to abbaspour 2015 calibration and analysis of uncertainties of semi distributed watershed models are subject to a number of issues such as their parameterization the non uniqueness of a set of parameters the definition of what is a calibrated model what are the appropriate limits of its use and the calibration in watersheds where land uses or streams have been greatly modified in addition input data and spatial scale simplifications are also considered as sources of uncertainties abbott and refsgaard 1996 beven 2012 in direct modeling calibration with a single parameter value results in a single model signal on the other hand in an inverse modeling the observed data can be well estimated by different sets of parameters that is with different solutions abbaspour 2015 inverse modeling has become a widely used calibration method in recent years andrade et al 2013 abbaspour et al 2015 bressiani et al 2015 franco and bonumá 2017 blainski et al 2017 the approach that considers more than a single variable to calibrate and validate the model can help reduce the uncertainties associated to calibration procedure beven 2006 2012 daggupati et al 2015 additionally the adoption of different streamflow gauge stations along the watershed might also reduce uncertainties among the various distributed hydrologic models the soil and water assessment tool swat a semi distributed continuous time process based hydrology and water quality model neitsch et al 2011 was developed to analyze the impacts of land use changes on discharge erosion sedimentation and water quality in gauged and ungauged watersheds arnold et al 1998 it is an open source code that considers different hydrologic and agronomic processes ranging from catchment to continental scales abbaspour et al 2015 bressiani et al 2015 soil moisture plays an important role in the hydrology of a watershed affecting several hydrological processes and characteristics such as infiltration percolation hydraulic conductivity recharge and discharge however there are still a reduced number of studies involving the calibration of distributed hydrological models such as swat based on measurements of soil moisture despite its potential in reducing modeling uncertainties in data scarce situations rajib et al 2016 performed a multi objective calibration of the swat model using spatially distributed remotely sensed and in situ soil moisture along with streamflow observations according to the authors acceptable streamflow simulation can be obtained without using any soil moisture information in model calibration however although there is considerable amount of uncertainty equifinality the use of soil moisture data improved the simulated results li et al 2018 performed the swat model calibration using streamflow measurements and remote sensing derived soil moisture values and a more consistent and statistically significant improvement was achieved due to the spatial information introduced by the remotely sensed soil moisture data the aim of this study is to apply the soil and water assessment tool swat in a representative watershed of the northeastern brazil and to evaluate the effects of using two observational datasets on the model uncertainties and predictions for the swat model calibration and validation in this data scarce region we investigate the use of two variables namely the experimental soil moisture data from sensors and the observed discharge obtained from five streamflow gauging stations along the watershed 2 material and methods 2 1 study area the mundaú river basin mrb has a drainage area of 4090 39km2 spreading throughout the states of pernambuco and alagoas in northeastern brazil fig 1 the mrb is predominantly rural has substantial agricultural activity including a large dairy and broilers breeding industry it also has substantial sugarcane production and processing industry the basin has urban areas covering 34 municipalities composed by native vegetation comprised of a small region of caatinga and areas of atlantic forest water bodies such as the mundaú river lagoon and large pasture areas andrade et al 2017b the caatinga vegetation is characterized by seasonally dry shrubs and forests leal et al 2005 while the atlantic forest vegetation exhibits seasonally dry and tropical forests werneck 2011 mangroves and coastal vegetation are also found in the region the climate according to the köppen classification is aw tropical with dry season in winter most of the mrb is classified in relation to amount of rainfall as semi humid and a small portion classified as semiarid with an average temperature of 24 c the mean annual rainfall in the mrb is 800mm alvares et al 2014 ranging from 497 to 1 143 63mm araújo et al 2015 with precipitation declining as the distance from the coast increases 2 2 soil and water assessment tool swat model and input data soil and water assessment tool swat model freely available at http swat tamu edu is a semi conceptual semi distributed continuous time process based hydrology and water quality model that uses a daily time step and multiple hydrologic units to simulate different physical processes within the study area such as climate hydrology surface runoff percolation interception infiltration subsurface flow baseflow and evapotranspiration soil moisture plant growth nutrients pesticides bacteria and pathogens and soil management arnold et al 2012a for the hydrological modeling with swat the watershed is previously divided into several sub basins which amount depends on the minimum drainage area afterwards the model carries out combinations among the land use soil types and slope layers producing the hydrological response units hrus evapotranspiration estimation as well as surface runoff is predicted separately for each hru to enable a better physical representation of hydrological processes strauch et al 2012 the swat model offers three options for estimating the potential evapotranspiration et0 component penman monteith fao hargreaves samani and priestley taylor methods the model standard method is the penman monteith fao which requires meteorological variables such as solar radiation temperature relative humidity and wind speed neitsch et al 2005 in the present study the hargreaves samani method was adopted as it requires only radiation and temperature data and it fits very well for semiarid regions the swat model requires four main types of input data including three maps which are the digital elevation model dem the land use map the soil type map and a series of meteorological data such as precipitation maximum and minimum air temperatures relative humidity wind speed and solar radiation table 1 presents the sources used for the mundaú basin related to maps hydrological and meteorological data sources as well as the data description used with the swat model the digital elevation model dem was obtained from the brazilian agricultural research corporation embrapa fig 1 the land use map of the mrb was constructed using satellite images and image processing tools from landsat 5 the images interpretation was carried out through digital processing tools associated with gps data collection mapping was performed using the supervised classification method adopting the maximum likelihood classifier land use was divided into seven classes presented in fig 2a the association of land uses defined in the mrb with the land use classes in the swat database are presented in table 2 the sixteen soil classes present in the mrb are shown in fig 2b in relation to the weather stations eleven stations measuring only precipitation and two stations recording other meteorological data were adopted additionally five streamflow gauge stations and one soil moisture station were selected for this study the stations locations are presented in fig 1 one of the major problems in modeling brazilian river basins is the lack of extensive series of hydro meteorological data high number of failures or when the data are present they often lack consistency regarding the data availability for the mundaú river basin there are rainfall data since the 1920s however such data present large numbers of failures and not all stations distributed along the watershed have the same data recording period therefore a detailed survey was carried out on all the stations aiming to examine their failures and consistencies until verifying that the period of rainfall data considered acceptable for hydrological modeling with the swat model for the mrb is from 2000 to 2016 constituting 17 years of observational data in relation to streamflow data although there are data since 1980 due to accentuated failures in older periods the adopted experimental period was from 2000 to 2016 comprising 17 years which is usually enough to capture long term time variations as stated by kenard et al these authors point out that in studies that involve hydrological modeling through the use of streamflow data it is recommended that the data series used for modeling presents at least 15 years of records in order to allow identification of important properties related to hydrological processes variability and dynamics the experimental soil moisture data m3 m 3 were obtained from sensors campbell scientific cs 616 installed at the soil profile every 10cm up to 50cm depth and connected to an agrometeorological station located in a strategic area of the watershed under supervision of the federal rural university of pernambuco garanhuns academic unit that provide soil moisture data recorded every 30min the station is located at fazenda riacho do papagaio municipality of são joão pe 8 48 34 2 s and 36 24 29 2 w 695m with an area of 16ha of pasture fig 1 soil water content mm was calculated from soil moisture m3 m 3 considering a depth of 50cm and the measurements were extrapolated to the sub basin at which the station is located there are soil moisture records since 2011 in the station representing a time series of 7 years for the purpose of this study only two years of data was adopted due to higher data quality for this period such configuration presented previously shows that the data scarcity condition is an important issue for the mundaú river basin 2 3 calibration and validation procedures the calibration procedure of swat model was performed in the swat calibration and uncertainty programs swat cup the swat cup is an independent software developed for sensitivity analyses calibration and validation and uncertainty analyses based on swat simulations the program comprises five calibration procedures sufi 2 pso glue parasol and mcmc eleven goal functions mult sum r2 chi2 ns br2 ssqr pbias kge rsr mns and includes applications such as visualization of the study area abbaspour et al 2018 in this study the calibration procedure was performed in the swat cup using the sequential uncertainty fitting algorithm sufi 2 additionally the nash sutcliffe model efficiency ns coefficient was used as goal function sufi 2 is a routine used to capture the uncertainties of the modeling process according to abbaspour 2015 there is a close relationship between the calibration process and the uncertainties and it is of great importance to identify them in sufi 2 the uncertainty of the input parameters is expressed as ranges whereas the uncertainties of the output parameters are expressed from the 95 ppu 95 probability distribution which are calculated at levels of 2 5 and 97 5 of the cumulative distribution of an output variable using latin american hypercube sampling the quantification of the adjustment between the simulation results and the observed data expressed as 95 ppu can be performed by two statistical indices the p factor and the r factor the p factor is the percentage of the observed data points within the uncertainty of model prediction at 95 ppu and varies from 0 to 1 where 1 indicates 100 adjustment of the measured data within model prediction uncertainty i e a perfect model simulation considering the uncertainty while the r factor is the mean uncertainty of the 95 ppu for this study values of the p factor above 70 and values of the r factor close to 1 were considered as adequate for discharge simulations in this study the p factor and the r factor were adopted to analyze the uncertainties of hydrological simulation the sensitivity analysis used in this study was previously performed by andrade et al 2017a using the sufi 2 of the swat cup considering a global sensitivity analysis of 19 parameters related to the processes of flow evapotranspiration percolation recharge infiltration among others in order to identify the most sensitive ones for the mrb simulations according to the authors the two most sensitivity parameters were the curve number for moisture condition ii cn2 and the coefficient of water percolation to the deep aquifer rchrg dp the cn2 was one of the parameters chosen for the calibration of the present study in addition some other parameters were analyzed which did not present such sensitivity in the previous study of andrade et al 2017a the fact is that the latter authors worked with only part of the mrb while the present study focuses on the whole basin such difference in scale interferes in the sensitivity analysis that is the seven parameters used for calibration in this study are not necessarily the same proposed by andrade et al 2017a the first three years of the available streamflow data series were used to warm up the swat model 2000 2002 the calibration 2003 2009 and validation 2010 2016 processes occurred in a hierarchical way first with an annual time step and then with a monthly time step starting from the most upstream stations then proceeding to the closest station to the basin outlet with a total of five stations calibrated and validated along the watershed several researchers used time series of streamflow data with less than 17 years to calibrate and validate the swat model such as wallace et al 2018 which worked with 8 years of data tuo et al 2016 which used 10 years of discharge data and narsimlu et al 2015 which adopted 16 years of fluviometric data for swat modeling for soil moisture data the model was calibrated and validated using daily soil moisture measurements for the years of 2014 and 2015 respectively some tests performed for the hierarchical calibration of the swat model have been proposed by klemes 1986 split sample test differential split sample test and proxy catchment test in this study the split sample test was applied which consists of a classic test where the series of hydrological data should be divided into two segments one for calibration and the other for validation this division might occur in two equal parts 50 50 when the series is sufficiently long or in the configuration 70 30 when the series is not sufficiently long as is the case of this study 17 years of data in the calibration and validation process of the swat model for the mundaú river basin in each sub basin studied the data series used for calibration validation varied among sub basins ranging from 50 50 to 78 22 and averaging approximately 70 30 the calibration data included both dry and wet periods there are several statistical performance indicators for hydrological simulation the most commonly reported for swat calibration and validation are the determination coefficient r 2 the nash sutcliffe model efficiency ns and the percent bias pbias the ns varies between negative infinite and 1 0 the optimal value values between 0 and 1 are generally regarded as acceptable performance levels and values 0 indicate that it is better to use the mean observed data than the predicted value of the model nash and sutcliffe 1970 in relation to pbias its optimal value is 0 with low magnitudes indicating good precision in the model simulation positive values indicate underestimation by the model and negative values indicate overestimation gupta et al 1999 according to abbaspour et al 2004 a model is to be considered satisfactorily calibrated by sufi 2 when r 2 is higher than 0 80 moriasi et al 2007 state nse 0 5 and 25 pbias 25 as satisfactory values while nse 0 75 and 10 pbias 10 are considered very good for discharge calibration of hydrological models in this study the statistical evaluation rating criteria used are based on moriasi et al 2007 in addition to the statistical evaluation analyses were carried out on information frequently extracted from the hydrograph especially some associated with the flow duration curves 3 results and discussion 3 1 optimized parameters for streamflow and soil moisture table 3 lists the parameters which were used for both discharge and soil moisture calibration in the annual monthly and daily time steps using the swat model their descriptions within the model and their calibrated values those parameters are related to hydrological processes such as curve number moisture condition ii cn2 main channel manning s coefficient ch n2 water depth in shallow aquifer required for return flow gwqmn groundwater delay gw delay baseflow recession constant alpha bf saturated hydraulic conductivity sol k and available water capacity sol awc according to blainski et al 2017 some of these parameters are difficult to measure such as gwqmn alpha bf and gw delay the adjusted values for the parameters were then adopted for validation and scenarios generation it is important to highlight that during the parameterization of a hydrological model for calibration different intervals can produce good statistical results however these differences in values might result in incorrect responses to the prediction of land use and climate change scenarios for example therefore it is very important to know the basin characteristics in order to minimize the uncertainties related to parameterization schaefli et al 2004 zhang et al 2009 in the present study the calibrated value of the curve number cn parameter was 73 7 in rural basins this value represents land use of normal permanent fields as pastures for hydrological group c that is soils capable of generating above average discharge and low infiltration rates it was also noticed that these soil types present a considerable amount of clay and are usually shallow most of the soils present in the mundaú river basin have a type d hydrological group however there is also a large representation of group c indicating that the value of the calibrated cn adequately represents the general characteristics of the watershed additionally most of the basin is occupied by pastures further confirming the adequate representation of this parameter in the studied area zettam et al 2017 performing hydrological and sedimentological modeling in the tafna river basin africa a semiarid watershed with 7245km2 of drainage area found calibrated values of cn between 38 5 and 94 the catchment area of the tafna river has 10 land uses types dominated by calcaire soils being the most part of the area characterized by pasture southwestern range swrn perennial semiarid vegetation with leaf area index up 1 5 tomato and winter weat hammouri et al 2017 assessed the impacts of climate change on water resources in arid and semiarid regions of jordan and found a calibrated value of cn equal to 82 6 the basin studied by the authors has about 60 of rainfed agricultural lands and 20 are irrigated with silty clay and silty clay loam as dominant soil types brouziyne et al 2017 performing the manual calibration of the swat model in a semiarid watershed in north western morocco found cn values between 58 and 70 among the land use categories established by the authors the main land cover class is the pasture with approximately 42 and large variability of soil types ranging from loamy clay soils to well drained sandy soils as expected and highlighted by lin et al 2014 the spatial heterogeneity of land use and soil types has significant influence on the runoff spatial distribution in a catchment and hence on the cn values the baseflow recession constant alpha bf ranged from 0 to 1 day as suggested by arnold et al 2012a with 0 05 being the calibrated value very close to 0 048 which is the model default value the interval chosen was the same as that adopted by bressiani 2016 who worked with a watershed located in the ceará state northeastern brazil which has a predominantly caatinga biome and is inserted in a predominantly semiarid climatic zone according to arnold et al 2012a alpha bf values between 0 1 and 0 3 mean that there is a slow recharge response in the basin while values between 0 9 and 1 indicate a rapid response the fitted value of 0 05 indicates that the baseflow recession for the basin studied occurs slowly and consistently which is expected for basins with perennial rivers as is the case of the mrb pereira et al 2014 found a calibrated alpha bf value of 0 004 when performing hydrological simulation using the swat model in a headwater basin in southeastern brazil vaghefi et al 2014 analyzed the impact of climate change on water resources components in semiarid regions of the iran found alpha bf values ranging from 0 to 0 511 using spatially distributed streamflow and remotely sensed soil moisture data rajib et al 2016 performed the multi objective calibration of the swat model and found alpha bf values ranging from 0 45 to 0 77 in the studied basins fontes júnior 2016 performing experimentation and hydrological modeling in a semiarid northeastern basin of brazil found a calibrated alpha bf value of 0 063 fukunaga et al 2015 applying the swat model in the itapemirim river basin brazil a tropical catchment found a calibrated alpha bf value of 0 027 the depth of water in shallow aquifers required for return flow gwqmn can vary from 0 to 4000mm with these values being the default limits given by the swat model the calibrated value of 2686mm indicates that for the occurrence of the return flow in the mundaú watershed the water table should be equal to or greater than approximately 2 7m in depth the return flow from groundwater is related to rainfall and especially with evapotranspiration since it is strongly dependent of capillary flow vaghefi et al 2014 found gwqmn of 3064 7mm for a basin with precipitations of 240 660mmyear 1 and evapotranspiration ranging from 200 to over 1000mmyear 1 zhang et al 2015 performing simulation of peak flows under climate change in lanjiang catchment east china found gwqmn values from 2465 11mm to 4673 13mm the catchment is characterized by a sub tropical humid monsoon climate and the annual mean rainfall is about 1600mm brighenti et al 2016 when performing a hierarchical calibration of the swat model in a watershed in the santa catarina state brazil found gwqmn of 2290 54mm this basin presents similarities with the mundaú river watershed such as the presence of gleisols and maximum and minimum precipitation of 2500 and 1082mm respectively as already stated for mundáu basin rainfall varies from 497 to 1143 63mm some authors have found low values of gwqmn particularly for catchments presenting shallow soils as fontes júnior 2016 for the alto ipanema basin brazil with gwqmn of 717 5mm and blainski et al 2017 for camboriú river basin brazil with gwqmn of 1000mm the groundwater delay gw delay in the mundaú river basin with 4090 39km2 was of approximately 135 days whereas xue et al 2014 when analyzing the parameter uncertainty of surface flow and sediment yield in the huolin basin china with an area of 8102km2 found calibrated values of the gw delay of 101 days on the other hand blainski et al 2017 found a value of 0 65 indicating that the time interval required for the underground recharge in the camboriú river basin with 195km2 was less than 1 day such differences highlight the strong role of the drainage area size on the gw delay parameter the manning s n value for the main channel ch n2 calibrated in the present study was 0 34 similarly to the alpha bf the ch n2 is within the limit of the suggested range in swat input output document arnold et al 2012a which is 0 01 ch n2 0 3 in this case ch n2 is in the maximum allowed value ch n2 0 34 approximately 0 3 chow 1959 has a wide list of manning s roughness coefficients for natural river channels and according to the author the main characteristics of channel with maximum values of ch n2 0 15 are very weedy reaches deep pools or floodways with heavy stand of timber and underbrush rajib et al 2016 found values adjusted from 0 02 to 0 15 in the studied basins in turn pereira et al 2014 obtained 0 011 for the galo creek watershed located in the espírito santo state brazil in the basin atlantic forest vegetation and pasture correspond to approximately 53 and 42 of the area respectively and the soil is characterized as red yellow oxisols which covers 92 of the area fontes júnior 2016 found adjusted values from 0 072 to 0 254 in the studied basin for water channels along alluvial deposits and shrubs riparian vegetation alongside the river beds it can be seen in table 3 that the calibrated value of the sol k parameter is very close to the upper limit allowed by the initial range sol k 953 59 according to andrade et al 2013 saturated hydraulic conductivity usually presents a high spatial variability and the swat model does not take into account this spatial distribution but rather a mean value for a given soil type then the model provides from the optimization process the maximum value allowed in the calibration step oliveira júnior et al 2014 obtained experimentally in the same area of the present study maximum values of sol k of 1036 8 and 1681 2mmh 1 for pasture and caatinga covers respectively initial estimates of available water capacity vary for different soil types ranging from 0 04mmmm 1 to 0 12mmmm 1 for sol awc calibration values were allowed to vary by a factor of 60 to 60 calibration resulted in a 32 increase in sol awc for all soils generating calibrated values between 0 053mmmm 1 and 0 158mmmm 1 3 2 calibration and uncertainty analysis for streamflow comparison between the simulated and observed hydrographs is an important procedure to evaluate model calibration andrade et al 2013 blainski et al 2017 fig 3a j shows the hydrographs observed and simulated by the swat model in the calibration and validation phases for the five streamflow gauge stations of the mundaú river basin santana do mundaú são josé da laje união dos palmares murici and rio largo for annual and monthly time steps respectively for both time steps a satisfactory fitting between measured and simulated hydrograms was observed in general good calibrations and validations are achieved when the data series used to calibrate and validate the model included both dry and wet years within the region in addition good correspondence between other model outputs and measured data soil moisture evapotranspiration etc might increase confidence in model calibration arnold et al 2012b zhang et al 2015 good correspondence was observed fig 3 between the majority of simulated and measured peak flows especially when the calibration and validation were performed in an annual time step andrade et al 2017b with the model still uncalibrated had already observed good correspondences between the hydrographs simulated by swat and the data observed for the same study area observing the monthly hydrographs some peaks were not well represented by the calibrated model for example during 2003 at santana do mundaú fig 3b when the model slightly overestimated the observed values the same could be seen during validation in 2010 with the model underestimating the observed values in 2012 there was a small displacement of the hydrograph to the left at the são josé da laje station some differences between observed and simulated data could also be seen for example for calibration in the years of 2004 and 2005 when the model failed to reach the peak flows causing the ns to decrease in relation to the other stations fig 3d although minimal according to silva and medeiros 2014 these differences may be associated with model simulation difficulties or uncertainties in the input data however in general terms the correspondence between observed and simulated flows were good in the mrb the recession periods were well simulated by the swat model under all proposed conditions confirming the adequate representation and applicability of the swat model for the studied region according to andrade et al 2013 the swat model fitting during the recession periods both in calibration and validation periods indicates good model performance in simulating low flows for both the calibration and validation periods the correspondence of the simulated to the observed hydrographs was higher for the annual time step than for the monthly simulation as reflected by a higher ns for the annual time step the rainfall rates over the studied years are presented in fig 4 it is possible to verify that 2004 was an unusually wet year 1493 3mm total annual rainfall with eight months of the year receiving monthly precipitation over 100mm additionally 2012 was an extremely dry year with below average rainfall 623 5mm the mean value for the 2003 2016 period was 1092 5mm the comparison between two hydrological years with distinct characteristics 2004 wet year and 2012 dry year for the five streamflow gauge stations in the mundaú river basin is given in fig 5 the greater rainfall in 2004 was reflected in greater than normal peak flows increasing from upstream santana do mundaú station with observed flow of 9 23m3 s 1 to downstream rio largo with observed flow of 45 68m3 s 1 fig 3a c e g and i during the validation period the hydrographs fig 3c e g and i show that 2012 was an extremely dry year with below average rainfall and consequently small runoff production and lower peaks this occasioned in lower values of ns because this coefficient result is quite sensitive to estimates of peak flows in fact it is easier to calibrate the swat model in wet periods when there are more frequent peak flows than in dry periods when flow generation is reduced table 4 shows the comparison among the statistical indicators p factor r factor r 2 ns and pbias for discharge calibration using the swat cup semiautomatic calibration method the calibration step of a hydrological model is subjective and no automatic algorithm is able in replacing the researcher s knowledge in relation to his study area therefore the calibration procedures and uncertainty analysis are closely connected and no calibration should be performed without quantifying the degree of uncertainty associated to the model prediction abbaspour et al 2015 in hydrological modeling it is very important to carry out a careful model calibration that is to parameterize it adequately in order to reduce much of the uncertainties associated to modeling over estimation might lead to an excessive application of mitigating measures while under estimation can lead to insufficient preparation for extreme conditions duan et al 1992 van griensven et al 2008 kumar et al 2017 the calibration results show high values of p factor 0 79 annual and 0 89 monthly in average which indicates the high percentage 79 and 89 in matching measured data in the 95ppu plot fig 3 and the range of uncertainty in the output values the thickness of uncertainty band can be seen in 95ppu by the r factor 1 01 annual and 1 26 monthly in average a large p factor and a r factor close to 1 indicate that the uncertainty in simulation were properly predicted by the model in the validation period the values of p factor 0 88 annual and 0 73 monthly in average were also above 70 and r factor values were close to 1 2 22 annual and 1 20 monthly in average indicating good adjustment between the simulation results and the observed discharge data the model uncertainty may be associated with several factors such as natural and anthropogenic processes that occur in the watershed but which are not included in the model yang et al 2008 the uncertainty in soil and water parameters as well as the climate variation during the modeling period abbaspour et al 2015 the values of the determination coefficient r 2 varied between 0 72 and 0 93 in the calibration phase in the annual time step and between 0 56 and 0 79 in the monthly time step for the validation phase r 2 values ranged from 0 63 to 0 99 in the annual time step and from 0 66 to 0 76 in the monthly time step these results indicate that in general the performance of the swat model might be considered satisfactory for the mrb since there were values of r 2 above 0 80 a multi variable calibration of the swat model with remote sensing evapotranspiration data and observed flow data in the upper rio negro basin 3453km2 in the santa catarina and paraná states brazil were performed by franco and bonumá 2017 the authors found r 2 values of 0 76 and 0 78 in the calibration phase and of 0 58 and 0 75 in the validation phase using observed flow data and considering different temporal strategies for calibration validation silva and medeiros 2014 when performing a hydro sedimentological analysis using the swat model for the experimental basin of são joão do cariri 13 5km2 found an r 2 value equal to 0 88 during manual calibration with discharge data the values of the nash sutcliffe model efficiency ns which depict the model precision especially in the representation of peak flows varied among stations from 0 71 to 0 92 in the calibration phase in the annual time step and from 0 55 to 0 78 in the monthly time step considered as satisfactory and very good performances according to the classification proposed by moriasi et al 2007 in the validation phase ns values ranged from 0 53 to 0 76 in the annual time step and from 0 62 to 0 72 in the monthly time step also considered satisfactory and very good performances table 4 by observing these results it is possible to verify that in general the performance of the swat model was better for the annual time step when compared to the monthly time step both for the calibration and validation phases this probably occurred as the monthly errors are smoothed when considering annual data in addition the ns value for the calibration phase was significantly higher than the value obtained for validation in fact ns values were expected to be higher for calibration the phase at which the parameters are modified in order to allow the model to achieve good performances than in the validation the phase during which the parameters are no longer modified most worldwide studies involving the swat model achieved good performances during the calibration phase however performance during validation is often much worse than for calibration this is often due to the over calibration occurred in the process leading to unsatisfactory results for the validation phase there are several studies in the literature that used the ns to test the swat efficiency for simulating the discharge behavior in watersheds around the world andrade et al 2013 found ns values of 0 66 and 0 87 for the calibration and validation phases in the jaguara river basin 32km2 brazil in turn xue et al 2014 found ns values of 0 81 and 0 83 for calibration and validation in the huolin river basin 8102km2 china brighenti et al 2016 found from unsatisfactory to satisfactory ns results in the negrinho river basin 200km2 brazil blainski et al 2017 found ns values of 0 66 and 0 89 for the calibration and validation in the camboriú river basin 195km2 brazil in comparison with previous work involving calibration and validation of the swat model in several parts of the world the ns values obtained for the mrb were satisfactory thus indicating that the swat model was able to represent the main hydrological processes in the mrb and yet suggesting that the model could be useful for simulation of similar watersheds the values of pbias varied in absolute terms between 1 1 and 8 2 in calibration for the annual time step and between 1 5 and 11 6 for the monthly time step for the validation phase pbias values ranged from 2 0 to 9 2 for the annual time step and from 1 2 to 24 2 for the monthly time step these results indicate that the swat model presented satisfactory and very good results according to the classification proposed by moriasi et al 2007 in comparison pereira et al 2014 found pbias values of 7 2 and 14 1 in the calibration and validation phases in the galo creek watershed brazil 3 3 calibration and uncertainty analysis for soil moisture in addition to the discharge data daily soil moisture data were used in this study fig 6 shows the temporal comparison between observed and simulated soil moisture for the calibration and validation phases for a sub basin in the mundaú basin in both steps a satisfactory correspondence was found between measured and simulated data this performance could be verified by the obtained statistical indices with ns values of 0 53 and 0 52 and pbias of 0 4 and 1 1 in the calibration and validation steps respectively these results represent satisfactory and very good performances according to the classification proposed by moriasi et al 2007 for this basin the values of pbias for soil moisture were better than for discharge table 4 however the ns values have not improved when compared to the results of discharge calibration according to vervoort et al 2014 the calibration process helps to improve the estimation of peak flows and recess periods by the model however when using soil moisture data there is not necessarily a better event based response during the simulation this may be a justification for the nash values have not increased when using soil moisture data compared to the calibration adopting the discharge data only according to the result of calibration with soil moisture data 100 of the observed data lies within the uncertainty band p factor 1 but this uncertainty may be high since the value of the r factor was not close to 1 r factor 7 08 fig 6 this could be related to the uncertainty in the soil characteristics but may also be related to the calibration scheme according to uniyal et al 2017 the model uncertainty could be associated to the simplified soil water equations of swat and to the considerable heterogeneity in the observed soil moisture data these uncertainties could be better evaluated through real time updating by collecting soil moisture data wanders et al 2014 alvarez garreton et al 2015 lievens et al 2015 fig 7 shows the simulation error error δ simulated observed between observed and simulated soil water content mm for the calibration and validation phases the error plot clearly indicates minimal or even zero errors in simulations for a significant portion of the time suggesting according to the simulation error that the soil water calibration improved model performance kundu et al 2017 found that rmse error values were reduced in the calibrated model when adopting soil moisture data according to li et al 2018 introducing soil moisture into the model calibration really strengthens the model ability in the forecasting of hydrologic processes since the physical connection between soil moisture and discharge is very strong in process based models it is important to mention that there are still very few studies in the literature that has used soil moisture data as an alternative to calibrate the swat model and most research has applied soil moisture data from remote sensing rajib et al 2016 kundu et al 2017 uniyal et al 2017 rajib et al 2016 performed a multi objective calibration of the swat model using spatially distributed remotely sensed soil moisture and discharge according to the authors satisfactory streamflow simulations could be obtained without using any soil moisture information in the calibration process however a significant improvement in pbias was observed in soil moisture outputs indicating the model ability to reduce uncertainty equifinality problems kundu et al 2017 used data remotely sensed surface soil moisture to calibrate the swat model at the warrego river catchment 69 290km2 and verified that soil moisture was a useful variable in reducing model calibration uncertainties according to the authors the use of soil moisture data enhanced model discharge predictions uniyal et al 2017 evaluated the spatial and temporal patterns of soil moisture simulated by the swat at 30cm depth with indirect soil moisture estimates from landsat images and found that the uncertainty band for soil moisture was narrower these results indicate that the swat model can be calibrated with alternative data such as soil moisture evapotranspiration leaf area index lai water table levels among others to enhance model performance however it is necessary to evaluate the associated uncertainties mainly because of the scale spatial resolution between discharge and the alternative data it is worth mentioning that these data must have high reliability and consistency to allow an adequate calibration the great importance of using alternative data in the calibration process is in the fact that a series of discharge data is not always available as is the case in some brazilian semiarid watersheds with intermittent flow regimes 3 4 flow durations curves analyses according to gomes and fernandes 2017 it is essential to understand the hydrological behavior of watersheds to get more precise results for planning all demands for water use through reference flow procedures one of the alternatives to determine water availability in a watershed is the construction of flow duration curves discharges with probability of exceedance equal to or over 90 are essential in hydrological studies for planning water supply since they indicate the quantity of water that can be guaranteed with the corresponding certainty level discharges with probability of exceedance of 50 are important to evaluate the maximum possible flow to be regularized the probability of exceedance equal to or lower than 10 are applied in studies associated to extreme flood events oliveira et al 2015 fig 8 illustrates the observed and simulated flow duration curves by the swat model in the calibration left and validation right steps by observing the flow duration curves both in the calibration and in the validation periods it can be observed that in general simulated flows below the 40 frequency were underestimated in relation to the flow rates above 80 the lowest flow rates the observed data were underestimated in calibration and overestimated in the validation phase with mean errors of 20 42 and 23 71 respectively in the calibration period the observed mean streamflow was equal to 33 74m3 s 1 and the simulated value was equal to 32 02m3 s 1 for monthly time step in the validation period the observed average streamflow was of 19 47m3 s 1 and the simulated was of 17 32m3 s 1 based on these differences which were of small magnitude it can be verified that the swat model adequately simulated the flow duration curves for the mrb demonstrating its quality and potential as a numerical tool for water resources management 4 conclusions in this study uncertainties were evaluated in using both discharge and soil moisture experimental data on swat calibration and validation for the mundaú river basin considering the representativeness of the watershed and the data scarcity for hydrological modeling the results are very satisfactory a good agreement between simulated and measured annual and monthly streamflow was demonstrated by the determination coefficient r 2 the nash sutcliffe model efficiency ns and the percent bias pbias with satisfactory and very good performances although there is a considerable amount of uncertainty the use of a series of alternative data to calibrate and validate the swat model e g soil moisture data is a feasible and promising option for hydrological modeling especially when hydrological and meteorological data series have low availability as is the case in some of the brazilian semiarid watersheds the use of soil moisture improved the calibration results with better value for the pbias moreover the adequate representation of soil moisture in the calibration process in addition to reducing the uncertainties in hydrological modeling is extremely valuable because the brazilian semiarid is a region with limited water flow volume in the rivers resulting in a dense network of intermittent watercourses with zero flows during the dry period thus the knowledge of the behavior of this variable becomes relevant as the soil moisture is one of the main variables affecting crops development flow generation and agricultural production systems in scarcity periods finally the outcomes achieved were very encouraging swat allows the hydrological processes on the mundaú to be suitably represented the calibrated swat model for the mundaú river basin might be used for scenarios generation the fitted parameters can be adopted to other study periods or to similar watersheds the results can also be useful for areas with few data and information availability at scales from micro watershed to large watersheds conflict of interest none declared ethical statement authors

temporal distribution of freshwater components is an important step toward sustainable planning and management of water resources this case study applied the soil and water assessment tool swat to characterize freshwater availability and scarcity in the lrb swat predictions of hydrologic fluxes in the basin are generally satisfactory when compared to measured streamflow records although uncertainties persist in model estimates estimates of streamflow herein referred to as blue water varied from 0 2 to 570mm year between 1984 and 2013 over the basin the analysis revealed alternating cycles of one to two years of water surplus periods and three to five years of dry periods during the study period the results also indicated that considering the natural water yield 20 of the basin

based hydrological model arnold et al 1998 srinivasan et al 1998 gassman et al 2007 developed for simulating the long term impacts of land management practices and climate on hydrologic and water quality conditions of a watershed nietsch et al 2005 the swat uses information related to soil land use and slope to delineate a watershed into subwatersheds which are further subdivided into hydrological response units hrus the smallest modeling units with a homogeneous area of aggregated land use soil and slope swat has been utilized worldwide for watershed modeling in more than 2500 peer reviewed studies gassman et al 2007 https www card iastate edu swat articles like any other technology tools swat is constantly evolving for improvement to realistically represent landscape characteristics e g arnold et al 2010 rathjens et al 2015 sun et al 2016 2 3 data used input data required to build the lrb s swat model are meteorological elevation soil and land use data as shown in table 2 daily meteorological data for the lrb used were climate forecast system reanalysis cfsr weather data for a period of 35 years january 1 1979 to july 31 2014 the dataset consists of gridded rainfall maximum and minimum temperature wind speed relative humidity and solar radiation dile and srinivasan 2014 the gridded datasets were extracted for 371 locations that fall within the lrb s boundary 30m digital elevation model dem was utilized in delineation of the basin and soil data were used in definition of hrus high resolution land cover data were used for the analysis table 2 population distribution data from landscan database were used to estimate the total yearly basin s population from 2000 to 2013 using spatial statistics in arcgis 2 4 model set up calibration and validation various steps including watershed delineation hru definition parameter sensitivity analysis and calibration were followed to set up swat for the lrb swat version 2012 10 2 was used to perform all terrain preprocessing and watershed delineation for the study basin subbasin parameters including slope gradient slope length and stream network characteristics i e channel slope length and width were derived from the dem the lrb was discretized into 871 subbasins and 13 059 hrus were created based on land use soil type and slope characteristics the original swat soil database was modified by appending additional soil characteristics to include the study area since the original swat database does not have soil information of the lrb at the time of this study due to limited availability of observed streamflow data in the basin different time periods were used for streamflow calibration and validation of the lrb model see section 2 3 monthly streamflow datasets at five locations within the basin were used to calibrate and validate the model as shown in table 3 only streamflow gauge stations with continuous observed daily data not considerably affected by water withdrawal and retention were selected for the lrb model calibration and validation table 3 five years from january 1979 to december 1983 were used as a warm up period the sequential uncertainty fitting version 2 sufi 2 algorithm as implemented in the swat calibration and uncertainty programs swat cup package abbaspour 2015 was used for the lrb model calibration the sufi 2 algorithm performs a global search procedure from a large number of parameters abbaspour 2015 pagliero et al 2014 the algorithm starts with large physically meaningful parameter ranges and converges to acceptable ranges of parameters to bracket the observed data within 95 prediction uncertainty 95ppu calculated at the 2 5 and 97 5 levels of the cumulative distribution of an output variable obtained through latin hypercube sampling abbaspour 2015 for this study the same set of 10 parameters see table 4 was selected based on parameter sensitivity analysis for all five streamflow calibration locations bai et al 2017 also used a similar approach for a three site calibration study for a 9000km2 watershed in this study the 10 selected parameters for streamflow calibration were tuned simultaneously at the specified calibration locations abbaspour 2015 pagliero et al 2014 zhang et al 2008 chen et al 2018 given the size of the lrb the multi site calibration was adopted to capture the spatial heterogeneity of the basin with headwater catchments nested in downstream catchments it was assumed that land and water management practices including dam water release scheduling have been reflected in the observed streamflow used for model calibration and validation in addition due to the lack of reliable data the model was not calibrated with crop yields and volumes of water extracted for irrigation the simulated monthly streamflow of the lrb was compared to observed monthly streamflow using nash sutcliffe efficiency nse nash and sutcliffe 1970 and coefficient of determination r 2 following moriasi et al 2007 the model performance is deemed satisfactory if nse and r 2 are greater or equalled to 0 5 for flow simulation at monthly time step a perfect fit between the simulated and observed data is indicated by a value of 1 for nse while a value 0 indicates that the observed data is a more accurate than the simulated output arnold et al 2012 a 0 value for r 2 indicates no correlation and 1 represents perfect correlation between the simulated and observed data arnold et al 2012 the calibrated model was then adopted to simulate natural streamflow over a period of 30 years january 1984 to december 2013 in the lrb 2 5 simulation of spatial and temporal distribution of blue water availability model outputs consisting of water yield and aquifer recharge were used to quantify the spatial and temporal distribution of blue water calculated as the summation of water yield and aquifer recharge e g faramarzi et al 2009 falkenmark and rockstrom 2006 schuol et al 2008 water yield is the amount of water leaving a swat hru and entering the main channel based on the simulation time step which is monthly time step in this study temporal variability in blue water availability was determined by aggregating monthly simulations into annual values and subbasin values 871 swat delineated subcatchments see section 2 4 were aggregated into major catchments of the lrb from 1984 to 2013 to determine how blue water availability varied in the basin a time series plot was generated and individual annual values were then compared with the long term average values for each of the 27 major catchments over the study period 1984 2013 see section 2 4 following knapp et al 2015 as well as expert opinion about rainfall intensities flood events and dry spells in basin years where rainfall was less than 40 of the long term average were classified as drought years while years with rainfall more than 50 above the long term average were considered years of water surplus with high potential for flooding knapp et al 2015 the surplus and dry years determined with the rainfall analysis were propagated into classification of temporal variability of blue water in this basin spatial variability of blue water availability was also evaluated at swat delineated subbasin scale average annual blue water for the simulation period 1984 2013 was calculated for each swat delineated subbasin to be conservative however annual blue water estimates were not aggregated into major catchments for the spatial variability unlike the approach used for the temporal variability assessment arcgis symbology toolset from data management toolbox was used to illustrate the spatial distribution of blue water availability in the basin 2 6 determination of water risk water demand use is as important as water supply in determining if a community is likely to experience recurrent water shortage or excess knowledge of water demand and supply can be used to determine water risk or water sensitive areas wsas of a region water sensitive area is defined in this study as an area prone to water stress or surplus relative water demand rwd or the ratio of total water consumption use to water available brown and matlock 2011 mcnulty et al 2010 watkins et al 2004 was used as a simple metric to determine wsas in the lrb the metric is expressed as brown and matlock 2011 watkins et al 2004 1 rwd twd twa 100 where twa is total blue water available and twd is total water demand table 5 indicates different categories that describe the level of water availability i e too little or more than enough over an area of interest for example if a catchment s total water demand is 540m3 ha year and total available water is 300m3 ha year then the estimated rwd is 180 which falls within the category of high stress as shown in table 5 total water demand is the sum of water demand use for domestic industrial and agricultural sectors while there were no detailed data on industrial water use for individual major catchments in the basin published reports indicated that less than 10 of the lrb available water was allocated to industrial water demand use business tech 2015 rahm et al 2006 united nations wwap 2006 zhuwakinyu 2012 based on these reports 5 of industrial water use was assumed for built up areas water demand use in domestic and agricultural sectors was estimated with a water demand estimation tool the simplified hydro economic demand model developed by new mexico state university brian hurd personal communication annual domestic municipal water demand use within the tool for each swat subbasin was calculated as the product of per capita water demand use and population while data on estimates of water use in south africa watersheds were accessible national water resource strategy nwrs 2004 this information was not readily available for other countries in the lrb thus remotely sensed data were used to estimate water demand use for the remaining country major catchments in the basin population was estimated by spatially aggregating gridded global population data from landscan database bhaduri et al 2002 bhaduri et al 2007 over each subbasin as described in section 2 3 the aggregated population was used to estimate water demand for domestic use for agricultural water use global land cover dataset national geomatics center of china http ngcc sbsm gov cn article en were utilized to estimate cropland areas and crop water use requirements although the simulation period spans from 1979 to 2013 total water demand use was only estimated for 2000 2013 period because the population data extracted from landscan were only available from the year 2000 annual agricultural water demand use was also calculated for a period of 2000 2013 as the product of cropland land area and water demand use per square meter since crop variety could not be identified in the land use map maize production was assumed for the crop area as it is the common crop grown in the study area from published literature 450 600mm of water is needed per season to grow maize in southern africa du plessis 2003 and 600mm of water per season was used for maize production in this study it should be noted that there is only one growing season per year in this region which corresponds to the rainy season i e october march total water demand from different water sectors was calculated as 2 twd wd i where wd is water demand use and i is individual water sectors 3 results and discussion 3 1 swat calibration and validation multi location calibration and validation for the lrb model was performed based on observed streamflow data using sufi 2 program within swat cup 2012 abbaspour 2015 as mentioned earlier the same set of sensitive parameters were selected for all locations used for streamflow calibration in the basin table 5 fig 2 the performance of swat for monthly streamflow simulations at the selected gauge stations range from 0 43 to 0 77 for nse and greater than 0 50 for r 2 during the calibration period and from 0 57 to 0 82 for nse and greater than 0 5 during the validation periods table 5 fig 2 while nse value for streamflow observation station 534 during the calibration period fig 2 table 5 falls below model evaluation guidelines e g engel et al 2007 moriasi et al 2007 the overall basin wide model performance was deemed satisfactory for the analysis fig 2 table 5 due to the complexity of swat calibration for large scale simulations malagò et al 2015 pagliero et al 2014 piniewski et al 2017 coupled with data quality issues for this study it was difficult to obtain high scores for the evaluation criteria at each calibration location e g abbaspour et al 2015 schuol et al 2008 the challenge for performing automated multi location calibration reside in the fact that all streamflow outlets were parameterized and optimized simultaneously to return an overall result for all the selected observation stations abbaspour 2015 during the process some observation stations may be poorly calibrated while others may show better statistics abbaspour et al 2015 to ensure a proper calibration of the model simulated et values were also compared to modis et values from the national terradynamic simulation group http www ntsg umt edu at many random locations of the basin parts of the basin located beyond the most downstream calibration location fig 2 the deviations between the two ets varied between 0 and 15 not shown here comparisons of model evaluation criteria between upstream and downstream stations did not show any particular pattern in model performance the most downstream streamflow observation location station 534 shows satisfactory evaluation statistics during the validation period table 5 indicating that swat was able to capture variation in streamflow downstream of the lrb fig 5 magnitude of streamflow at the most downstream calibration station over the study period fig 3c was consistent with streamflow magnitude measured at a nearby gauge station chokwe in mozambique lbptc 2010 the chokwe and combomune streamflow gauge stations are both located on the main stem of limpopo river in mozambique 3 2 temporal and spatial distribution of blue water availability distribution of rainfall and blue water over time for notwane ws3 motloutse ws10 and lower limpopo ws27 are shown in fig 4a and b to illustrate cases of low medium and high blue water availability respectively the results were presented with 95 confidence bands denoted by 95 prediction uncertainty band 95ppu abbaspour 2015 faramarzi et al 2013 providing modeling uncertainties that may propagate into the outputs between 1984 and 2013 blue water for the 27 major catchments ranged from 0 02 to 47mm year within 95ppu in marico catchment in botswana to 7 to 807mm year 95ppu in lower olifants catchment in south africa table 7 overall annual freshwater components fell below normal i e dry years in 11 16 years and water surplus years varied between four and 10 in the basin table 7 availability of blue water in the lrb depicted high inter annual variability fig 4b table 7 an analysis of rainfall pattern in the basin fig 4a also revealed high variability indicating that variability in blue water is mostly driven by rainfall below average years i e dry years which are associated with droughts are frequent and tend to cluster over extended periods for example below long term annual average blue water started in 1985 and ended in 1990 for one cycle of dry years and from 1993 to 1997 for a second cycle in the lower limpopo catchment ws27 similarly 1984 1986 and 2001 2005 were cycles of dry year for blue water for notwane ws3 and motloutse ws10 catchments fig 4b table 7 this pattern with slight differences in years is observable for other major catchments in the lrb table 7 estimates of blue water that fall above the long term average are not frequent in the lrb fig 4b table 7 indicating less surplus years than more dry and normal years during the simulation period 1984 2013 the years that show high estimates of blue water above the long term average i e surplus years are generally associated with extreme rainfall and flood events in the basin e g fig 4b while it appears that rainfall in individual years did not substantially deviate from their respective catchment long term averages streamflow in these years still resulted in flooding due to high intensity rainfall usually influenced by advent of cyclones gebre and getahun 2016 maposa 2016 trambauer et al 2014 a typical example was the year 2000 flooding in the lower limpopo catchment fig 4a and b caused by cyclone elaine comparison of blue availability in individual major catchments in west of the basin shows clustered years generally more than two consecutive years that frequently fall below the long term average than variability in blue water in the east figs 1 and 4b tables 1 and 6 the simulated blue water that fall below and above the long term annual average in the major lrb catchments are consistent with known drought and flood years reported by other researchers lbptc 2010 wmo 2012 for example the year 2013 flooding which caused approximately 70 deaths and affected around 4210 farms and residential homes in botswana and 213 000 people mozambique unocha rosa 2013 is noticeable in the blue water time series of motloutse and lower limpopo catchments shown in fig 4b these were also revealed by the analysis of rainfall records in that year not shown in text fig 4a another example is the year 2000 flood in the lower limpopo catchment located downstream eastern part of the lrb trambauer et al 2014 above normal years of 1987 1989 for blue water for notwane catchment correspond to high incident rainfall events depicted in this study fig 4a moses 2016 also found clustered years of above normal rainfall for this catchment during 1975 2015 drought events that occurred in the years 1993 1995 and 2005 are also shown by the analysis fig 4b table 7 due to historically low rainfall in west of the basin deviation in blue water from the long term average in those areas was less pronounced e g notwane catchment ws3 fig 4b and table 7 spatial variability of rainfall and blue water are shown in fig 6a and b annual rainfall varied between 176mm and 1047mm with an average of 334mm year for the study period fig 5a these values are generally comparable to the range of 350 800mm of rain year reported by the joint limpopo river basin study lbptc 2010 west of the basin and some parts in the south display low rainfall amounts while the eastern parts receive high rainfall overall nearly all catchments in botswana west of zimbabwe and south africa receive low rainfall these areas fig 5a are prone to droughts and water stress as reported by other studies lbptc 2010 trambauer et al 2014 wmo 2012 average annual blue water i e water yield and deep aquifer recharge for this study ranged between 1 and 566mm during the simulation period fig 5b the analysis showed high blue water availability in northeast east and southeast of the lrb e g bubi ws16 levuvhu ws17 changane ws26 steelpoort ws21 catchments table 7 figs 1 and 5b this can be explained by high rainfall events that are common in these areas wmo 2006 north and northeast rainfall is driven by the influence of inter tropical convergence zone itcz while east and southeast rainfall is due to prevailing rain bearing winds that blow from the indian ocean thus bringing rainfall inland ashton et al 2001 lbptc 2010 the itcz is an area of low atmospheric pressure emanated from mixed wind from northeast southeast of the equator wamukonya et al 2007 this process causes water vapor to be released as rain resulting in a band of heavy rainfall in countries around the equator wamukonya et al 2007 during the southern hemisphere summer migration of this phenomenon to the south of the equator leads to abundant rainfall in areas north of the lrb compared to the southern and western parts of the basin which are farther away from the itcz fig 5a the eastern part of the basin due to its proximity to the ocean is influenced by southward flowing currents often associated with cyclones which bring warm seawater and humid air fronts from the equator creating a humid warm climate with abundant rainfall wmo 2012 the influence of these two natural rainfall forcing factors is minimal in western lrb thus less rainfall mostly convective is usually recorded in western leading to less blue water availability fig 5a and b 3 3 water sensitive areas the spatial distribution of population and cropland areas in the lrb fig 6a and b reveals that crop cultivating activities are concentrated in south and north of the basin with some pockets in the east e g ws27 while population in mostly concentrated in south of the basin areas under water stress are prominent in the lrb especially in the south and west fig 7 for a total of 27 major catchments 22 i e 81 completely fall within the categories of slight to extreme water stress table 5 fig 7 while five 19 fall within normal to potential surplus categories vörösmarty et al 2000 also reported that the lrb is one of the highly water stressed basins in the world based on fig 7 areas with enough and even surplus blue water exhibited some degree of stress when taking twd into consideration e g parts of crocodile mokolo lephalala and steelport catchments similarly areas that showed water deficit fig 5b appears drier indicating that these areas were likely under heavy water stress during the study period when accounting only for blue water availability table 7 fig 7 where there is more cropland land and high population for instance the lower limpopo and upper olifants ws27 and ws19 fig 6 table 7 the analysis revealed that these areas despite having high blue water may still struggle for freshwater figs 5b 7 other researchers reported similar levels of water stress for these areas e g alcamo et al 2003 2007 vörösmarty et al 2000 van beek et al 2011 catchments such as shingwedzi ws24 lower middle limpopo ws25 and changane ws26 are few of the lrb s major catchments that were in a good shape in terms of blue water availability this is understandable since these areas had little cultivated cropland and sparse population but received abundant rainfall figs 6 and 7 pockets of sufficient available water located toward the middle of lrb could also be explained by minimal crop cultivating and population water demands figs 6 and 7 although the spatial mapping of water stress presented in the joint limpopo river basin study lbptc 2010 showed a different pattern compared to this study there is a general agreement that west of the basin is under water stress and water surplus exists in east catchments of the basin the differences in water balance across studies are likely attributable to the study period assumptions and computational methods used in the two studies in general the analysis conducted in this study revealed blue water stress for over 81 of the lrb in west of the basin botswana and south south africa and majority of the north zimbabwe figs 1 and 7 heavy agricultural activities increasing domestic water demands due to population growth and unreliable rainfall are likely the major driving factors of the pressure on freshwater resources in west and south of the lrb figs 6 and 7 east of the lrb mainly mozambique appears to be a land of excess blue water translated by constant frequent flood events recorded in mozambique lbptc 2010 3 4 implications for water resources management in the study basin accounting for annual distribution of blue water is valuable for water resource management especially in semi arid regions where spatial and temporal variability of rainfall is particularly important for runoff and recharge processes the simulated water availability showed alternating cycles of drought and flood years as well as water stressed areas in the basin historically both drought and flood periods have notable impacts on agricultural production and water supply for domestic use in the basin alemaw and kileshye onema 2014 fao 2004 trambauer et al 2014 during drought events crop failure is common resulting from low available blue and moisture domestic water supply also decreases due to reduced replenishment in water storage structures e g dams flood years in the basin have been associated with both crop failure and property damage including damage of public infrastructure kandji et al 2006 the focus of existing water resources management efforts in the basin has been on utilization of wastewater recycling and reuse to meet the needs of different water users lbptc 2010 water conservation strategies such as drought resistant crop cultivation crop diversification rain water harvesting and terrace farming have also been used at individual country scales in the basin to meet both agriculture and domestic water demands rockström et al 2009 limpopo rak 2011 this study shows that more than 50 of the basin is under water stress this situation may escalate with climate change climate change in southern africa including the lrb is projected to result in increased temperatures changes in rainfall duration and timing changes in seasons characterized by shorter summers and increased climate variability e g more floods droughts and heatwaves stocker 2014 these changes will likely amplify water stress in these sensitive areas fig 7 as population increases in the basin stress on water resources will likely increase increased understanding of long tern variability of freshwater availability would be very helpful in the future to guide proper use of resources and adaptation to water issues in the basin effective management of water resources would continue to rely on scientific research to identify and deploy sustainable strategies that could help alleviate water issues in the region sustainable strategies may include strengthening institutional capacity to encourage more research and improved drought and flood management plans with buy in from all stakeholders e g the general public academic researchers practitioners and policy makers among others water transfers from water abundant areas increased water recycling and reuse and transfer of desalinated water from neighbor countries are plausible solutions to support areas that would experience water deficit implementation of best management practices bmps that include principles of low impact development and green infrastructure in urban areas as well farm level bmps such as water recycling in water abundant areas could also contribute achievable solutions to water issues in the basin 4 limitations of the study despite the overall satisfactory performance of the model table 6 the study presents many challenges uncertainty in blue water estimates resides mostly in representation of processes that could not be accounted for in this study these include water transfers water releases irrigation practices and undocumented small dams due to lack of reliable data the most important source of uncertainty for model predictions in this study because of these limitations the model was set up to simulate the natural flow in the basin as opposed to the human impacted flow better climatic soil and observed streamflow data in the basin as well as representation of water management practices in the model may lead to improved model predictions in capturing flow processes even though population was estimated for every year from 2000 to 2013 results obtained in this study did not consider change in land use over the entire simulation period 1984 2013 this means that a fixed cropland land area from the 2010 global land cover map national geomatics center of china http ngcc sbsm gov cn article en was used for the simulations this assumption may easily lead to under or overestimation of water demand a single crop i e maize water requirement was used to estimate agricultural water demand in reality cropping systems in the basin involve several crops water use from different sectors such as industrial power generation and environmental requirements leading to probable uncertainty in water demand estimates another challenge is the use of remotely sensed data for population and land use classification although advantageous by providing reliable data both in space and in time there are still uncertainties associated with remotely sensed data which were not explicitly addressed in this study this work acknowledged these challenges by presenting model outputs with 95 prediction uncertainty bands extension of this work should evaluate all freshwater components i e blue and green water and water demand from all sectors and all water supply sources including groundwater with more comprehensive datasets 5 conclusions in this study swat was utilized to quantify blue water availability in the lrb the swat model as calibrated at multiple locations in the basin for monthly streamflow simulation showed satisfactory results given the scale and variability in physical characteristics of the basin as well as limitations in datasets the simulated blue water estimates over the basin vary between 0 2 and 570mm year during the 1984 2013 study period temporal variability in blue water availability in the lrb revealed alternating episodes of surplus and dry years corresponding to documented drought and flood periods in the basin on average deviations of blue water estimates from the normal cycled every three to five years for dry periods and one to two years for the surplus periods during the study period spatial analysis showed a decreased pattern in blue water availability from east to west and from north to south of the basin consistent with other studies the analysis of water sensitive areas revealed that more than 80 of the lrb mainly in the west experienced some degree of water stress over the study period based on blue water availability east of the basin about 20 of the lrb however has sufficient freshwater due likely to abundant rainfall and low population in this part of the basin despite the uncertainties mentioned above see section 4 this study contributes a modeling

1123,water is vital for human survival and ecosystem health in arid and semi arid areas like the limpopo river basin lrb in southern africa water is a precious commodity the study of spatial and temporal distribution of freshwater components is an important step toward sustainable planning and management of water resources this case study applied the soil and water assessment tool swat to characterize freshwater availability and scarcity in the lrb swat predictions of hydrologic fluxes in the basin are generally satisfactory when compared to measured streamflow records although uncertainties persist in model estimates estimates of streamflow herein referred to as blue water varied from 0 2 to 570mm year between 1984 and 2013 over the basin the analysis revealed alternating cycles of one to two years of water surplus periods and three to five years of dry periods during the study period the results also indicated that considering the natural water yield 20 of the basin mostly east has enough water while the remaining 80 continues to experience dryness and water stress keywords limpopo river watershed modeling physical hydrology water risk swat 1 introduction global water resources are increasingly experiencing pressure due to rising demands from a range of social and economic driving forces the problem of adequate freshwater supply to support agriculture industry and domestic use in semi arid regions such as the lrb is of paramount importance the lrb encompasses four countries botswana mozambique south africa and zimbabwe with various needs and challenges which are exacerbated by extreme climate variability typified by intense el niño southern oscillation enso events kandji et al 2006 schulze et al 2001 these enso events are often linked to intense drought and flood occurrences glantz et al 1997 kandji et al 2006 wmo 1984 2012 population dynamics urbanization industrial development and increasing agricultural activities in the face of a changing climate continue to add pressure on surface and groundwater resources in the basin bawden et al 2014 van der zaag et al 2010 mosase 2018 water scarcity is expected to increase with population increases in the lrb to alleviate water availability issues the four limpopo river co basin countries have invested in construction of dams and reservoirs however these reservoirs often fall short to meet freshwater demands and expectations fao 2004 owen 2013 freshwater components including blue and green water play a major role in sustaining life on earth schuol et al 2008 blue water refers to

invaluable source of water for food production and economic development in the lrb lbptc 2010 with recent advancements in computational tools various independent and joint efforts have been made to quantify freshwater availability in the basin fao 2004 lbptc 2010 petrie et al 2014 the joint limpopo basin study lbptc 2010 for example is a multi phase multi national endeavor that aimed at providing science based information on present and future water resources to assist strategic development and management of water resources in the basin while decision makers continue to evaluate options for sustainable and equitable management of water resources in the basin increased understanding of freshwater distribution in time and space is needed to support these efforts the contribution of the present study is therefore to add a modeling perspective to the lrb s baseline information on water resources the specific objectives of the study were to 1 perform multi site calibrations of swat model for the lrb 2 assess the spatial and temporal distribution of blue water and 3 document physical water sensitive areas in the lrb water sensitive area is defined in this

of the basin drain portions of botswana mozambique south africa and zimbabwe respectively mohamed 2014 trambauer et al 2014 the lrb is located at 250 to 2 300m above mean sea level usgs 2004 limpopo river is the main channel of the basin it stretches over 1 770km starting in south africa and flowing north where it creates the south africa botswana border then east to form the south africa zimbabwe border and southeast through mozambique before ending in the indian ocean fig 1a the lrb is the second most populated basin in the southern african development community sadc region after orange river basin which has more than 19 million people earle et al 2005 the lrb is home to nearly 17 million people consisting of 69 22 10 and 7 of botswana south africa zimbabwe and mozambique s population respectively mohamed 2014 the population in the lrb is projected to be 23 million by 2040 lbptc 2010 following the lbptc 2010 approach the basin has been subdivided in this study into 27 subbasins of similar sizes and geographically homogeneous areas and referred to as major catchments fig 1b see table 1 land use in the basin consists of grassland 72 of the total drainage area cropland 10 shrub land 10 and other land uses 8 such as urban areas open water and wetlands fig 2 irrigation is the largest water user in the four lrb countries with an estimated total water demand of 4700million m3 of which 62 allocated to south africa 30 to zimbabwe 6 to mozambique and 2 to botswana mohamed 2014 climate in the lrb varies from arid in west to semi arid and temperate in east of the basin rainfall is seasonal and erratic causing frequent droughts and heavy flood events the lrb s rainfall ranges from 200 in the west to 1200mm year in the east with an average of 530mm year over the basin trambauer et al 2014 wmo 2012 mosase and ahiablame 2018 more than 95 of rainfall occurs between october and april summer months with january and february being the peak rainfall months air

based hydrological model arnold et al 1998 srinivasan et al 1998 gassman et al 2007 developed for simulating the long term impacts of land management practices and climate on hydrologic and water quality conditions of a watershed nietsch et al 2005 the swat uses information related to soil land use and slope to delineate a watershed into subwatersheds which are further subdivided into hydrological response units hrus the smallest modeling units with a homogeneous area of aggregated land use soil and slope swat has been utilized worldwide for watershed modeling in more than 2500 peer reviewed studies gassman et al 2007 https www card iastate edu swat articles like any other technology tools swat is constantly evolving for improvement to realistically represent landscape characteristics e g arnold et al 2010 rathjens et al 2015 sun et al 2016 2 3 data used input data required to build the lrb s swat model are meteorological elevation soil and land use data as shown in table 2 daily meteorological data for the lrb used were climate forecast system reanalysis cfsr weather data for a period of 35 years january 1 1979 to july 31 2014 the dataset consists of gridded rainfall maximum and minimum temperature wind speed relative humidity and solar radiation dile and srinivasan 2014 the gridded datasets were extracted for 371 locations that fall within the lrb s boundary 30m digital elevation model dem was utilized in delineation of the basin and soil data were used in definition of hrus high resolution land cover data were used for the analysis table 2 population distribution data from landscan database were used to estimate the total yearly basin s population from 2000 to 2013 using spatial statistics in arcgis 2 4 model set up calibration and validation various steps including watershed delineation hru definition parameter sensitivity analysis and calibration were followed to set up swat for the lrb swat version 2012 10 2 was used to perform all terrain preprocessing and watershed delineation for the study basin subbasin parameters including slope gradient slope length and stream network characteristics i e channel slope length and width were derived from the dem the lrb was discretized into 871 subbasins and 13 059 hrus were created based on land use soil type and slope characteristics the original swat soil database was modified by appending additional soil characteristics to include the study area since the original swat database does not have soil information of the lrb at the time of this study due to limited availability of observed streamflow data in the basin different time periods were used for streamflow calibration and validation of the lrb model see section 2 3 monthly streamflow datasets at five locations within the basin were used to calibrate and validate the model as shown in table 3 only streamflow gauge stations with continuous observed daily data not considerably affected by water withdrawal and retention were selected for the lrb model calibration and validation table 3 five years from january 1979 to december 1983 were used as a warm up period the sequential uncertainty fitting version 2 sufi 2 algorithm as implemented in the swat calibration and uncertainty programs swat cup package abbaspour 2015 was used for the lrb model calibration the sufi 2 algorithm performs a global search procedure from a large number of parameters abbaspour 2015 pagliero et al 2014 the algorithm starts with large physically meaningful parameter ranges and converges to acceptable ranges of parameters to bracket the observed data within 95 prediction uncertainty 95ppu calculated at the 2 5 and 97 5 levels of the cumulative distribution of an output variable obtained through latin hypercube sampling abbaspour 2015 for this study the same set of 10 parameters see table 4 was selected based on parameter sensitivity analysis for all five streamflow calibration locations bai et al 2017 also used a similar approach for a three site calibration study for a 9000km2 watershed in this study the 10 selected parameters for streamflow calibration were tuned simultaneously at the specified calibration locations abbaspour 2015 pagliero et al 2014 zhang et al 2008 chen et al 2018 given the size of the lrb the multi site calibration was adopted to capture the spatial heterogeneity of the basin with headwater catchments nested in downstream catchments it was assumed that land and water management practices including dam water release scheduling have been reflected in the observed streamflow used for model calibration and validation in addition due to the lack of reliable data the model was not calibrated with crop yields and volumes of water extracted for irrigation the simulated monthly streamflow of the lrb was compared to observed monthly streamflow using nash sutcliffe efficiency nse nash and sutcliffe 1970 and coefficient of determination r 2 following moriasi et al 2007 the model performance is deemed satisfactory if nse and r 2 are greater or equalled to 0 5 for flow simulation at monthly time step a perfect fit between the simulated and observed data is indicated by a value of 1 for nse while a value 0 indicates that the observed data is a more accurate than the simulated output arnold et al 2012 a 0 value for r 2 indicates no correlation and 1 represents perfect correlation between the simulated and observed data arnold et al 2012 the calibrated model was then adopted to simulate natural streamflow over a period of 30 years january 1984 to december 2013 in the lrb 2 5 simulation of spatial and temporal distribution of blue water availability model outputs consisting of water yield and aquifer recharge were used to quantify the spatial and temporal distribution of blue water calculated as the summation of water yield and aquifer recharge e g faramarzi et al 2009 falkenmark and rockstrom 2006 schuol et al 2008 water yield is the amount of water leaving a swat hru and entering the main channel based on the simulation time step which is monthly time step in this study temporal variability in blue water availability was determined by aggregating monthly simulations into annual values and subbasin values 871 swat delineated subcatchments see section 2 4 were aggregated into major catchments of the lrb from 1984 to 2013 to determine how blue water availability varied in the basin a time series plot was generated and individual annual values were then compared with the long term average values for each of the 27 major catchments over the study period 1984 2013 see section 2 4 following knapp et al 2015 as well as expert opinion about rainfall intensities flood events and dry spells in basin years where rainfall was less than 40 of the long term average were classified as drought years while years with rainfall more than 50 above the long term average were considered years of water surplus with high potential for flooding knapp et al 2015 the surplus and dry years determined with the rainfall analysis were propagated into classification of temporal variability of blue water in this basin spatial variability of blue water availability was also evaluated at swat delineated subbasin scale average annual blue water for the simulation period 1984 2013 was calculated for each swat delineated subbasin to be conservative however annual blue water estimates were not aggregated into major catchments for the spatial variability unlike the approach used for the temporal variability assessment arcgis symbology toolset from data management toolbox was used to illustrate the spatial distribution of blue water availability in the basin 2 6 determination of water risk water demand use is as important as water supply in determining if a community is likely to experience recurrent water shortage or excess knowledge of water demand and supply can be used to determine water risk or water sensitive areas wsas of a region water sensitive area is defined in this study as an area prone to water stress or surplus relative water demand rwd or the ratio of total water consumption use to water available brown and matlock 2011 mcnulty et al 2010 watkins et al 2004 was used as a simple metric to determine wsas in the lrb the metric is expressed as brown and matlock 2011 watkins et al 2004 1 rwd twd twa 100 where twa is total blue water available and twd is total water demand table 5 indicates different categories that describe the level of water availability i e too little or more than enough over an area of interest for example if a catchment s total water demand is 540m3 ha year and total available water is 300m3 ha year then the estimated rwd is 180 which falls within the category of high stress as shown in table 5 total water demand is the sum of water demand use for domestic industrial and agricultural sectors while there were no detailed data on industrial water use for individual major catchments in the basin published reports indicated that less than 10 of the lrb available water was allocated to industrial water demand use business tech 2015 rahm et al 2006 united nations wwap 2006 zhuwakinyu 2012 based on these reports 5 of industrial water use was assumed for built up areas water demand use in domestic and agricultural sectors was estimated with a water demand estimation tool the simplified hydro economic demand model developed by new mexico state university brian hurd personal communication annual domestic municipal water demand use within the tool for each swat subbasin was calculated as the product of per capita water demand use and population while data on estimates of water use in south africa watersheds were accessible national water resource strategy nwrs 2004 this information was not readily available for other countries in the lrb thus remotely sensed data were used to estimate water demand use for the remaining country major catchments in the basin population was estimated by spatially aggregating gridded global population data from landscan database bhaduri et al 2002 bhaduri et al 2007 over each subbasin as described in section 2 3 the aggregated population was used to estimate water demand for domestic use for agricultural water use global land cover dataset national geomatics center of china http ngcc sbsm gov cn article en were utilized to estimate cropland areas and crop water use requirements although the simulation period spans from 1979 to 2013 total water demand use was only estimated for 2000 2013 period because the population data extracted from landscan were only available from the year 2000 annual agricultural water demand use was also calculated for a period of 2000 2013 as the product of cropland land area and water demand use per square meter since crop variety could not be identified in the land use map maize production was assumed for the crop area as it is the common crop grown in the study area from published literature 450 600mm of water is needed per season to grow maize in southern africa du plessis 2003 and 600mm of water per season was used for maize production in this study it should be noted that there is only one growing season per year in this region which corresponds to the rainy season i e october march total water demand from different water sectors was calculated as 2 twd wd i where wd is water demand use and i is individual water sectors 3 results and discussion 3 1 swat calibration and validation multi location calibration and validation for the lrb model was performed based on observed streamflow data using sufi 2 program within swat cup 2012 abbaspour 2015 as mentioned earlier the same set of sensitive parameters were selected for all locations used for streamflow calibration in the basin table 5 fig 2 the performance of swat for monthly streamflow simulations at the selected gauge stations range from 0 43 to 0 77 for nse and greater than 0 50 for r 2 during the calibration period and from 0 57 to 0 82 for nse and greater than 0 5 during the validation periods table 5 fig 2 while nse value for streamflow observation station 534 during the calibration period fig 2 table 5 falls below model evaluation guidelines e g engel et al 2007 moriasi et al 2007 the overall basin wide model performance was deemed satisfactory for the analysis fig 2 table 5 due to the complexity of swat calibration for large scale simulations malagò et al 2015 pagliero et al 2014 piniewski et al 2017 coupled with data quality issues for this study it was difficult to obtain high scores for the evaluation criteria at each calibration location e g abbaspour et al 2015 schuol et al 2008 the challenge for performing automated multi location calibration reside in the fact that all streamflow outlets were parameterized and optimized simultaneously to return an overall result for all the selected observation stations abbaspour 2015 during the process some observation stations may be poorly calibrated while others may show better statistics abbaspour et al 2015 to ensure a proper calibration of the model simulated et values were also compared to modis et values from the national terradynamic simulation group http www ntsg umt edu at many random locations of the basin parts of the basin located beyond the most downstream calibration location fig 2 the deviations between the two ets varied between 0 and 15 not shown here comparisons of model evaluation criteria between upstream and downstream stations did not show any particular pattern in model performance the most downstream streamflow observation location station 534 shows satisfactory evaluation statistics during the validation period table 5 indicating that swat was able to capture variation in streamflow downstream of the lrb fig 5 magnitude of streamflow at the most downstream calibration station over the study period fig 3c was consistent with streamflow magnitude measured at a nearby gauge station chokwe in mozambique lbptc 2010 the chokwe and combomune streamflow gauge stations are both located on the main stem of limpopo river in mozambique 3 2 temporal and spatial distribution of blue water availability distribution of rainfall and blue water over time for notwane ws3 motloutse ws10 and lower limpopo ws27 are shown in fig 4a and b to illustrate cases of low medium and high blue water availability respectively the results were presented with 95 confidence bands denoted by 95 prediction uncertainty band 95ppu abbaspour 2015 faramarzi et al 2013 providing modeling uncertainties that may propagate into the outputs between 1984 and 2013 blue water for the 27 major catchments ranged from 0 02 to 47mm year within 95ppu in marico catchment in botswana to 7 to 807mm year 95ppu in lower olifants catchment in south africa table 7 overall annual freshwater components fell below normal i e dry years in 11 16 years and water surplus years varied between four and 10 in the basin table 7 availability of blue water in the lrb depicted high inter annual variability fig 4b table 7 an analysis of rainfall pattern in the basin fig 4a also revealed high variability indicating that variability in blue water is mostly driven by rainfall below average years i e dry years which are associated with droughts are frequent and tend to cluster over extended periods for example below long term annual average blue water started in 1985 and ended in 1990 for one cycle of dry years and from 1993 to 1997 for a second cycle in the lower limpopo catchment ws27 similarly 1984 1986 and 2001 2005 were cycles of dry year for blue water for notwane ws3 and motloutse ws10 catchments fig 4b table 7 this pattern with slight differences in years is observable for other major catchments in the lrb table 7 estimates of blue water that fall above the long term average are not frequent in the lrb fig 4b table 7 indicating less surplus years than more dry and normal years during the simulation period 1984 2013 the years that show high estimates of blue water above the long term average i e surplus years are generally associated with extreme rainfall and flood events in the basin e g fig 4b while it appears that rainfall in individual years did not substantially deviate from their respective catchment long term averages streamflow in these years still resulted in flooding due to high intensity rainfall usually influenced by advent of cyclones gebre and getahun 2016 maposa 2016 trambauer et al 2014 a typical example was the year 2000 flooding in the lower limpopo catchment fig 4a and b caused by cyclone elaine comparison of blue availability in individual major catchments in west of the basin shows clustered years generally more than two consecutive years that frequently fall below the long term average than variability in blue water in the east figs 1 and 4b tables 1 and 6 the simulated blue water that fall below and above the long term annual average in the major lrb catchments are consistent with known drought and flood years reported by other researchers lbptc 2010 wmo 2012 for example the year 2013 flooding which caused approximately 70 deaths and affected around 4210 farms and residential homes in botswana and 213 000 people mozambique unocha rosa 2013 is noticeable in the blue water time series of motloutse and lower limpopo catchments shown in fig 4b these were also revealed by the analysis of rainfall records in that year not shown in text fig 4a another example is the year 2000 flood in the lower limpopo catchment located downstream eastern part of the lrb trambauer et al 2014 above normal years of 1987 1989 for blue water for notwane catchment correspond to high incident rainfall events depicted in this study fig 4a moses 2016 also found clustered years of above normal rainfall for this catchment during 1975 2015 drought events that occurred in the years 1993 1995 and 2005 are also shown by the analysis fig 4b table 7 due to historically low rainfall in west of the basin deviation in blue water from the long term average in those areas was less pronounced e g notwane catchment ws3 fig 4b and table 7 spatial variability of rainfall and blue water are shown in fig 6a and b annual rainfall varied between 176mm and 1047mm with an average of 334mm year for the study period fig 5a these values are generally comparable to the range of 350 800mm of rain year reported by the joint limpopo river basin study lbptc 2010 west of the basin and some parts in the south display low rainfall amounts while the eastern parts receive high rainfall overall nearly all catchments in botswana west of zimbabwe and south africa receive low rainfall these areas fig 5a are prone to droughts and water stress as reported by other studies lbptc 2010 trambauer et al 2014 wmo 2012 average annual blue water i e water yield and deep aquifer recharge for this study ranged between 1 and 566mm during the simulation period fig 5b the analysis showed high blue water availability in northeast east and southeast of the lrb e g bubi ws16 levuvhu ws17 changane ws26 steelpoort ws21 catchments table 7 figs 1 and 5b this can be explained by high rainfall events that are common in these areas wmo 2006 north and northeast rainfall is driven by the influence of inter tropical convergence zone itcz while east and southeast rainfall is due to prevailing rain bearing winds that blow from the indian ocean thus bringing rainfall inland ashton et al 2001 lbptc 2010 the itcz is an area of low atmospheric pressure emanated from mixed wind from northeast southeast of the equator wamukonya et al 2007 this process causes water vapor to be released as rain resulting in a band of heavy rainfall in countries around the equator wamukonya et al 2007 during the southern hemisphere summer migration of this phenomenon to the south of the equator leads to abundant rainfall in areas north of the lrb compared to the southern and western parts of the basin which are farther away from the itcz fig 5a the eastern part of the basin due to its proximity to the ocean is influenced by southward flowing currents often associated with cyclones which bring warm seawater and humid air fronts from the equator creating a humid warm climate with abundant rainfall wmo 2012 the influence of these two natural rainfall forcing factors is minimal in western lrb thus less rainfall mostly convective is usually recorded in western leading to less blue water availability fig 5a and b 3 3 water sensitive areas the spatial distribution of population and cropland areas in the lrb fig 6a and b reveals that crop cultivating activities are concentrated in south and north of the basin with some pockets in the east e g ws27 while population in mostly concentrated in south of the basin areas under water stress are prominent in the lrb especially in the south and west fig 7 for a total of 27 major catchments 22 i e 81 completely fall within the categories of slight to extreme water stress table 5 fig 7 while five 19 fall within normal to potential surplus categories vörösmarty et al 2000 also reported that the lrb is one of the highly water stressed basins in the world based on fig 7 areas with enough and even surplus blue water exhibited some degree of stress when taking twd into consideration e g parts of crocodile mokolo lephalala and steelport catchments similarly areas that showed water deficit fig 5b appears drier indicating that these areas were likely under heavy water stress during the study period when accounting only for blue water availability table 7 fig 7 where there is more cropland land and high population for instance the lower limpopo and upper olifants ws27 and ws19 fig 6 table 7 the analysis revealed that these areas despite having high blue water may still struggle for freshwater figs 5b 7 other researchers reported similar levels of water stress for these areas e g alcamo et al 2003 2007 vörösmarty et al 2000 van beek et al 2011 catchments such as shingwedzi ws24 lower middle limpopo ws25 and changane ws26 are few of the lrb s major catchments that were in a good shape in terms of blue water availability this is understandable since these areas had little cultivated cropland and sparse population but received abundant rainfall figs 6 and 7 pockets of sufficient available water located toward the middle of lrb could also be explained by minimal crop cultivating and population water demands figs 6 and 7 although the spatial mapping of water stress presented in the joint limpopo river basin study lbptc 2010 showed a different pattern compared to this study there is a general agreement that west of the basin is under water stress and water surplus exists in east catchments of the basin the differences in water balance across studies are likely attributable to the study period assumptions and computational methods used in the two studies in general the analysis conducted in this study revealed blue water stress for over 81 of the lrb in west of the basin botswana and south south africa and majority of the north zimbabwe figs 1 and 7 heavy agricultural activities increasing domestic water demands due to population growth and unreliable rainfall are likely the major driving factors of the pressure on freshwater resources in west and south of the lrb figs 6 and 7 east of the lrb mainly mozambique appears to be a land of excess blue water translated by constant frequent flood events recorded in mozambique lbptc 2010 3 4 implications for water resources management in the study basin accounting for annual distribution of blue water is valuable for water resource management especially in semi arid regions where spatial and temporal variability of rainfall is particularly important for runoff and recharge processes the simulated water availability showed alternating cycles of drought and flood years as well as water stressed areas in the basin historically both drought and flood periods have notable impacts on agricultural production and water supply for domestic use in the basin alemaw and kileshye onema 2014 fao 2004 trambauer et al 2014 during drought events crop failure is common resulting from low available blue and moisture domestic water supply also decreases due to reduced replenishment in water storage structures e g dams flood years in the basin have been associated with both crop failure and property damage including damage of public infrastructure kandji et al 2006 the focus of existing water resources management efforts in the basin has been on utilization of wastewater recycling and reuse to meet the needs of different water users lbptc 2010 water conservation strategies such as drought resistant crop cultivation crop diversification rain water harvesting and terrace farming have also been used at individual country scales in the basin to meet both agriculture and domestic water demands rockström et al 2009 limpopo rak 2011 this study shows that more than 50 of the basin is under water stress this situation may escalate with climate change climate change in southern africa including the lrb is projected to result in increased temperatures changes in rainfall duration and timing changes in seasons characterized by shorter summers and increased climate variability e g more floods droughts and heatwaves stocker 2014 these changes will likely amplify water stress in these sensitive areas fig 7 as population increases in the basin stress on water resources will likely increase increased understanding of long tern variability of freshwater availability would be very helpful in the future to guide proper use of resources and adaptation to water issues in the basin effective management of water resources would continue to rely on scientific research to identify and deploy sustainable strategies that could help alleviate water issues in the region sustainable strategies may include strengthening institutional capacity to encourage more research and improved drought and flood management plans with buy in from all stakeholders e g the general public academic researchers practitioners and policy makers among others water transfers from water abundant areas increased water recycling and reuse and transfer of desalinated water from neighbor countries are plausible solutions to support areas that would experience water deficit implementation of best management practices bmps that include principles of low impact development and green infrastructure in urban areas as well farm level bmps such as water recycling in water abundant areas could also contribute achievable solutions to water issues in the basin 4 limitations of the study despite the overall satisfactory performance of the model table 6 the study presents many challenges uncertainty in blue water estimates resides mostly in representation of processes that could not be accounted for in this study these include water transfers water releases irrigation practices and undocumented small dams due to lack of reliable data the most important source of uncertainty for model predictions in this study because of these limitations the model was set up to simulate the natural flow in the basin as opposed to the human impacted flow better climatic soil and observed streamflow data in the basin as well as representation of water management practices in the model may lead to improved model predictions in capturing flow processes even though population was estimated for every year from 2000 to 2013 results obtained in this study did not consider change in land use over the entire simulation period 1984 2013 this means that a fixed cropland land area from the 2010 global land cover map national geomatics center of china http ngcc sbsm gov cn article en was used for the simulations this assumption may easily lead to under or overestimation of water demand a single crop i e maize water requirement was used to estimate agricultural water demand in reality cropping systems in the basin involve several crops water use from different sectors such as industrial power generation and environmental requirements leading to probable uncertainty in water demand estimates another challenge is the use of remotely sensed data for population and land use classification although advantageous by providing reliable data both in space and in time there are still uncertainties associated with remotely sensed data which were not explicitly addressed in this study this work acknowledged these challenges by presenting model outputs with 95 prediction uncertainty bands extension of this work should evaluate all freshwater components i e blue and green water and water demand from all sectors and all water supply sources including groundwater with more comprehensive datasets 5 conclusions in this study swat was utilized to quantify blue water availability in the lrb the swat model as calibrated at multiple locations in the basin for monthly streamflow simulation showed satisfactory results given the scale and variability in physical characteristics of the basin as well as limitations in datasets the simulated blue water estimates over the basin vary between 0 2 and 570mm year during the 1984 2013 study period temporal variability in blue water availability in the lrb revealed alternating episodes of surplus and dry years corresponding to documented drought and flood periods in the basin on average deviations of blue water estimates from the normal cycled every three to five years for dry periods and one to two years for the surplus periods during the study period spatial analysis showed a decreased pattern in blue water availability from east to west and from north to south of the basin consistent with other studies the analysis of water sensitive areas revealed that more than 80 of the lrb mainly in the west experienced some degree of water stress over the study period based on blue water availability east of the basin about 20 of the lrb however has sufficient freshwater due likely to abundant rainfall and low population in this part of the basin despite the uncertainties mentioned above see section 4 this study contributes a modeling

1124,the projection of streamflow and nutrient exports are essential for future water resource and environmental management plans under climate change this study investigated the responses of streamflow and total nitrogen tn loading to future climate scenarios in the miyun reservoir basin mrb by coupling a physical process based hydrologic and water quality model soil and water assessment model swat and 42 statistical downscaled climate projections on the basis of cmip5 models future climatic projections during the two future periods 2021 2035 and 2051 2065 under rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 emission scenarios primarily precipitation and temperature were used to drive the calibrated swat model results show that the mrb would be warmer and more humid the ensemble mean changes in average annual precipitation mean temperature are expected to be more than 5 4 0 6 c during the period of 2021 2035 and 12 5 1 6 c during 2051 2065 future streamflow and tn loading projection are expected to increase in two future periods meanwhile the changes in streamflow and tn loading would be higher in summer than in other seasons the uncertainty ranges in tn loading projection is larger than that in streamflow projection the probability that streamflow and tn loading increase would be higher in the period of 2021 2035 than in 2051 2065 this study could be of use for providing an insight into the availability of future streamflow and pollution control for the mrb keywords climate change miyun reservoir basin swat model nex gddp dataset 1 introduction the anthropogenic climate change is now occurring as documented in the fifth assessment report of the intergovernmental panel on climate change ipcc ar5 the globally averaged temperature increased by 0 85 c from 1880 to 2012 and each of the last three decades has been successively warmer than any preceding decade since 1850 ipcc 2013 global climate change affect the hydrologic cycle further such changes in climate change and hydrologic processes begetting the alteration of biogeochemical processes that control the transformation and transportation characteristics of nutrients with possible adverse impacts on aquatic ecosystems and human health stuart et al 2011 whitehead et al 2009 in addition to climate change impacts on water resources the impacts of climate change on the biochemical processes of nutrients at the watershed scale are receiving widespread attention from government and public which is the focus of current studies ahmadi et al 2014 shrestha et al 2012 verma et al 2015 zhang et al 2012 the integration of process based hydrologic and water quality models general circulation models gcms and downscaling techniques is extensively used to quantify the response of hydrology and water quality to future climate change at the watershed scale jha et al 2015 ye and grimm 2013 gcm a continuous three dimensional mathematical model for the simulation of atmospheric oceanic and cryospheric processes is the principal instrument for making projection of future climatic condition and widely applied to the researches related to natural system response to future climate change chun et al 2016 zhang et al 2016 however the spatial resolutions of gcms remain relatively coarse so that they are unable to resolve important sub grid scale features such as topography and clouds wilby et al 2002 therefore the raw gcms outputs are limited to regional impact studies especially at the watershed scale fowler et al 2007 fortunately the development of downscaling techniques including statistical and dynamic downscaling methods which downscale coarse gcms output to finer resolution could dissolve scale problem between the outputs from the gcms and the need for regional impact studies wilby et al 1999 comparing to dynamic downscaling statistical downscaling is comparatively cheap computationally efficient and widely used all over the world in regional impact studies ahmadi et al 2014 ye and grimm 2013 zhang et al 2012 for statistical downscaling techniques delta change wu et al 2012 ye et al 2011 quantile mapping fang et al 2015 kim et al 2016 statistical downscaling model sdsm zhang et al 2012 zhang et al 2016 bias correction spatial disaggregation bcsd luo et al 2013 naz et al 2018 were adopted for climate change impact studies for example wu et al 2012 assessed the hydrologic effects of climate change in the upper mississippi river basin based on climate change scenarios data generated by delta change method naz et al 2018 adopted the bcsd method for investigating the streamflow extreme responses to future climate change in the united states watershed modeling approach is always adopted for translating the gcm generated climate data to their potential effects on the hydrologic and biogeochemical cycles at the watershed scale jha et al 2015 ye and grimm 2013 among the hydrologic models more modeling efforts are conducted by means of the soil and water assessment tool swat for climate change impact studies arnold and fohrer 2005 gassman et al 2007 gassman et al 2014 for example luo et al 2013 investigated the streamflow and stream temperature responses to climate change by using the modified swat model and concluded that unfavorable conditions for cold water species in summertime would occur due to decreased streamflow and higher projected air temperature modeling result of swat models in the 3s rivers of the mekong basin indicated that streamflow and non point source pollutant loads were predicted to increase in the future as well as the occurrence of water shortage in the dry season and soil degradation in the wet season dao nguyen and le viet 2017 therefore swat model was chosen in this study to represent the climate change effects on watershed hydrology and water quality simulation the miyun reservoir located in the upstream portion of the haihe river basin china is the major surface source of drinking water for downstream cities such as beijing city the capital of china fig 1 in recent years strong human activities and lasting dry years result in dramatically reduced streamflow into the reservoir bao et al 2012 yan et al 2018 yan et al 2017 in addition the excessive nitrogen loss into the water body of miyun reservoir from its upstream catchment namely miyun reservoir basin mrb is the main reason for the eutrophication of miyun reservoir further threatening the drinking water safety for beijing city wang and gong 2010 zhang et al 2009 despite the fact that its water quality reaches the national environmental standard ii grade for surface water at present liang et al 2016 with the effective control of point source pollution increased nitrogen export is attributed to non point pollution caused by anthropogenic activities such as agricultural practices in the mrb jiao et al 2015 nowadays from the perspective of the watershed scale some studies have been conducted on the effects of climate change on ecological environment including streamflow bao et al 2012 ma et al 2010 yan et al 2018 yang and tian 2009 zheng et al 2016 water quality tang et al 2011 and ecological flow wang et al 2015 however the potential impact of future climate change on the hydrology and water quality has not been conducted so far future climate change could influence the water availability and nutrient export in the mrb thus deeper understanding of the changes in streamflow and water quality in response to the changing climate at the watershed scale is essential for the development of effective management plans and mitigation strategies for natural system under the changing climate based on statistically downscaled climate data as mode input for driving the calibrated swat model the purpose of our study was to 1 project future climate change by 21 cmip5 models under representative concentration pathway 4 5 and 8 5 rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 over the entire mbr 2 assess the potential impacts of climate change on river streamflow and nitrogen export at the watershed outlet the findings presented here may provide a scientific reference for decision making regarding non point pollution control in future climate change conditions in the mrb as well as other regions that possess similar climatic characteristics 2 materials and methods 2 1 description of the study area the miyun reservoir basin mrb approximately 80km away from the beijing city is located between 40 19 n and 41 38 n and between 115 25 e and 115 35 e it flows into the miyun reservoir the most important surface source of drinking water for beijing city china the drainage area is approximately 15 400km2 two tributaries the chao and bai rivers are in the watershed fig 1 watershed elevation ranges from 88 to 2289m there are two major reservoirs the yunzhou and the baihepu reservoirs located in the upstream and midstream portions of the bai river respectively fig 1 these two reservoirs supply agricultural irrigation for the upstream part of miyun reservoir the watershed experiences a temperate continental monsoon climate that is cold and dry in winter but rainy and hot in summer the average annual temperature is approximately 7 5 c yan et al 2017 mean annual precipitation is about 487mm and more than 80 of precipitation occurs mainly during the flood season june to september in a region with precipitation driven hydrologic processes the internal distribution pattern of streamflow is similar to that of precipitation fig 2 2 2 soil and water assessment tool swat swat is a watershed scale distributed parameter and continuous time hydrologic and water quality model based on physical processes and is primarily designed to evaluate the long term impact of land use and management practices on water sediment and agricultural chemical yields in large complex watersheds neitsch et al 2011 major model components include weather hydrology land cover plant growth nutrients pesticide and land management in swat modeling according to topography and user defined threshold drainage area the model delineates a watershed into many sub basins which are then further partitioned into hydrologic response units hrus with unique soil land use and slope characteristics the hru is the smallest landscape component of swat for hydrology processes the simulation of hydrologic processes is separated into the two phases the land phase and routing phase the former controls the amount of water sediment and nutrients loadings into the main channel of each sub basin the latter is defined as the movement of water sediment and nutrients through the stream network to the watershed outlet the swat model has the ability to simulate nutrients circulation including biogeochemical processes mineralization immobilization denitrification and volatilization plant uptake and in stream transformations in the hru level the swat is used not only for agricultural non point pollution modeling but for the assessment of the impacts of climate change on river discharge and water quality at the watershed scale worldwide arnold and fohrer 2005 gassman et al 2014 tuppad et al 2011 the further detailed description of swat model can be found in neitsch et al 2011 2 3 swat setup calibration and validation in the setup of swat model in the mrb input geospatial data included a 90 m resolution digital elevation model dem in 2003 a 1 1 000 000 resolution soil map in 2010 and a 1 25 000 resolution land use map in 2000 fig 3 these geospatial datasets of different resolutions were converted to a common resolution raster 90m the daily climate data of 1991 2005 for driving the model included precipitation maximum and minimum temperature solar radiation relative humidity and wind speed the precipitation data from eight meteorological stations and 21 rain gauges in and around the watershed were adopted the remaining climate variables are from the above mentioned meteorological stations monthly observed streamflow data of 1991 2005 and water quality data total nitrogen of 1999 2005 at the xiahui hydrologic station in the chao river and zhangjiafen hydrologic station in the bai river respectively were used to drive the model the sources of these input data were listed in table 1 in swat modeling the baihe basin was divided into 45 sub basins comprising 664 hrus and the chaohe basin has 28 sub basins and 543 hrus meanwhile soil conservation service scs curve number method was used to calculate the surface runoff from daily precipitation the penmann monteith method was used to estimate the potential evapotranspiration for routing stream flows the variable storage coefficient method was adopted in this study additionally due to the shortage of reservoir operation data the reservoir factor was not incorporated into the simulation as the previous studies did in the mrb tang et al 2011 wang et al 2009 yan et al 2018 and other basins worldwide grusson et al 2015 ye et al 2011 in this study crop management practices and fertilizer application including chemical fertilizer and organic manure were input into the swat model for summer corn based on field investigations and literature reviews geng et al 2013 wang et al 2011 for fertilizer application about 75kg ha of diammonium phosphate was applied as base fertilizer on april 20 while about 112 5kg ha of carbamide was applied as topdressing on june 20 due to different development level of livestock and poultry industry in the mrb the organic fertilizer rate was calculated in the county level by multiplying the pollutants producing and discharging coefficients and the amount of animal manure in each county the organic fertilizer rates varied between 311kg ha and 2005kg ha the detailed information was summarized in table 2 the above mentioned information related to crop management practices and fertilizer application remained unchanged over future assessment periods the monthly observed data were split into a warm up period 1997 1998 a calibration period 1999 2002 and a validation period 2003 2005 after completion of calibration and validation of swat during the period of 1999 2005 the swat was forced by future climate data for the future projection period without changing any of the calibrated model parameters similarly the model was driven by historical climate data during the period of 1991 2005 as a 15 year baseline period 1991 2005 to compare with the average monthly changes in the hydrologic and biogeochemical processes during two future assessment periods 2021 2035 and 2051 2065 thus potential changes in the hydrologic and nutrient transport regimes in the watershed were identified additionally non climatic factors such as land use crop management practices and fertilizer application remained unchanged over future assessment periods the swat calibration and uncertainty programs swat cup developed by abbaspour et al 2007 was adopted for sensitivity analysis and calibration and validation of swat model considering the high efficiency and wide application of parameter optimization method sequential uncertainty fitting sufi 2 algorithm was adopted in this study yang et al 2008 yan et al 2018 based on the investigation of literature related to swat calibration as well as testing of sensitive parameters the parameters to be calibrated and the initial ranges are listed in the supplementary table s2 simulation performance of swat model was evaluated by visual inspection of the figures of the observed and simulated values and also by statistical measures including coefficient of determination r 2 and nash sutcliffe efficiency nse the r 2 and nse were calculated by using the following equation r 2 i 1 n o i o p i p 2 i 1 n o i o 2 i 1 n p i p 2 nse i 1 n o i o 2 i 1 n p i o i 2 i 1 n o i o 2 where p i and o i are the simulated and observed values at each time step i p and o are the mean of simulated and observed values n is the total number of paired values the range of nse is from to 1 and r 2 from 0 to 1 the optimal statistical value occurs when r 2 and nse values are closer to 1 the model performance can be considered satisfactory when monthly nse value is greater than 0 50 moriasi et al 2015 a value greater than 0 75 for monthly nse can be considered to be very good the value between 0 65 and 0 75 can be considered to be good while its value between 0 5 and 0 65 is considered satisfactory 2 4 future climate change scenarios future climatic data precipitation and temperature were derived from the nasa earth exchange global daily downscaled projections nex gddp dataset which was developed to provide a set of global high resolution climate change projections that can be used to assist the science community in conducting studies of climate change impacts at local or regional scales the dataset compiles 42 climate projections from 21 cmip5 gcms under two rcp scenarios rcp 4 5 and rcp 8 5 for the period from 2006 to 2100 as well as the historical experiment for each model for the period from 1950 to 2005 the spatial resolution of the dataset is 0 25 degrees 25km 25km the statistical downscaling method bias correction spatial disaggregation bcsd method luo et al 2013 naz et al 2018 was adopted in the downscaling of the cmip5 gcm data the climate dataset from the global meteorological forcing dataset gmfd developed by princeton university was used as the observational climate data each of the climate projections includes daily maximum temperature minimum temperature and precipitation further detailed information of nex gddp dataset could be found at https cds nccs nasa gov nex gddp the 21 cmip5 models used in this study with their institutes and spatial resolutions are listed in the supplementary table s3 and the rcp4 5 and rcp 8 5 emission scenarios in table 3 the simulated monthly precipitation and mean temperature from nex gddp dataset were compared graphically with corresponding observational values during the period from 1991 to 2005 in fig 4 it shows that the simulated values can capture the monthly distribution of precipitation and mean temperature for the period of 1991 2005 however the observed error of precipitation and mean temperature may be attributed to the global meteorological forcing dataset used as observational climate data during the downscaling process therefore the original nex gddp dataset was not adopted in this study in order to fully understand potential impacts of climate change climate change signals from 21 cmip5 models was kept and used to generate the future climate data precipitation and temperature based on the delta change method in this method mean monthly changes in each climate variables from nex gddp between the baseline period and future assessment periods were calculated in terms of ratio for precipitation or difference for maximum and minimum temperature the calculated changes were added to the baseline observational data to obtain the corresponding future projections to investigate the potential impact of climate change on the streamflow and nutrient exports in the mrb the delta change method was performed by using the following equations 1 t adj fur d t obs d t gcm fur m t gcm ref m 2 p adj fur d p obs d p gcm fur m p gcm ref m where t adj fur d p adj fur d is the adjusted daily temperature precipitation for the future assessment period t obs d p obs d is the observed daily temperature precipitation for the baseline period t gcm fur m p gcm fur m and t gcm ref m p gcm ref m are the monthly mean temperature precipitation from the gcm simulation for the future years and the baseline period respectively in this study 29 nex gddp grid points fall within the mrb boundary fig 1 the sub watersheds were then liked to the nearest grid point as the climatic input to the swat simulation basin wide precipitation and temperature are calculated by the arithmetic average method and mean temperature is average of the maximum and minimum temperature 3 results 3 1 calibration and validation of the swat mode the graphical comparisons of the monthly observed and simulated streamflow and tn loading during the 15 year baseline period 1991 2005 including 4 year calibration 1999 2002 and 3 year validation 2003 2005 periods are shown in figs 5 and 6 it is obvious that both the timing and magnitude of most peaks of streamflow and tn loading matched well with the observed values at the two hydrologic stations however there are still some discrepancies in some peaks of streamflow and tn loading which might be attributed to precipitation data observational error for streamflow and tn and inadequate representation of natural or man made processed in the model additionally the r 2 and nse values for the evaluation of model performance over the calibration and validation periods are shown in table 4 at the baihe basin the r 2 nse for streamflow was 0 81 0 79 for calibration and 0 77 0 64 for the validation period similarly the r 2 nse for chaohe basin was 0 89 0 83 and 0 80 0 71 for the calibration and validation period respectively in simulation of tn loading the values of r 2 nse during the calibration period were 0 75 0 62 and 0 87 0 72 for the baihe basin and chaohe basin respectively meanwhile these values were 0 90 0 79 and 0 88 0 77 for the model validation indicating that simulated values of total nitrogen load were in close agreement with the observed values in general the calibrated model achieved a good performance on the basis of performance criteria proposed by moriasi et al 2015 based on the visual and statistical measures comparison the calibrated swat model can represent the hydrologic process and nitrogen biogeochemical cycle for conducting the climate change impact studies at the miyun reservoir watershed the calibrated swat model was executed for the baseline period 1991 2005 with the no changing calibrated parameters the simulated result for streamflow in table 4 and fig 6 shows the hydrologic calibrated parameters derived from calibration period were reasonable as indicted by r 2 and nse higher than 0 8 for the baseline period 3 2 changes in future precipitation and temperature fig 7 shows the changes of monthly precipitation and temperature from 21 cmip5 models under rcp45 and rcp85 scenarios over two future assessment periods 2021 2035 and 2051 2065 relative to the reference period 1991 2005 the general variation of average monthly temperature and precipitation are similar in two future periods specifically the ensembles of 21 cmip5 models predicted that future average monthly precipitation and temperature in the mrb would increase as for precipitation the increases would mainly occur during the flood season june september in addition the ranges of precipitation and temperature changes are higher during the period of 2051 2065 than during the period of 2021 2035 the rectangular box in the fig 8 represents the range of precipitation and temperature changes between gcms and emission scenarios as indicated in fig 8 the uncertainty ranges of gcms are larger than those of emission scenarios all gcms and rcps indicate that the future annual temperature would increase across the mrb unlike the temperature projected changes in future annual precipitation are bidirectional and vary depending on the gcms and time period the non unidirectional changes in precipitation may be attributed to the complexity in interpreting precipitation as different gcms often do not agree with regard in both magnitude and direction at a specific region in addition the uncertainty ranges vary with the chosen time period the ranges of precipitation changes and temperature changes are higher during the period of 2051 2065 than during the period of 2021 2035 the ensemble mean changes in average annual precipitation are expected to be 6 1 for rcp4 5 and 5 4 for rcp8 5 in 2021 2035 and 12 7 for rcp4 5 and 12 5 for rcp8 5 in 2051 2065 as for temperature the ensemble mean changes are projected to be 0 6 c for rcp4 5 and 0 9 c for rcp8 5 in 2021 2035 and 1 6 c for rcp4 5 and 2 6 c for rcp8 5 in 2051 2065 3 3 impact of climate change on streamflow and nutrient loadings the calibrated swat model was run with 42 climate change projection scenarios for two future periods 2021 2035 and 2051 2065 to investigate the potential effect of climate change on hydrologic processes and total nitrogen export in the mrb 3 3 1 streamflow stream discharge as an important hydrologic variable can synthetically reflect the response of components of watershed hydrologic cycle to a changing climate in the watershed fig 9a shows the changes in monthly streamflow predicted by swat according to 21 cmip5 models under rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 over two future periods compared with the baseline period 1991 2005 the general variations of average monthly streamflow are similar in two future periods specifically the ensembles of 21 cmip5 models prediction show that future monthly streamflow would increase in the outlet of the mrb the increases in streamflow would mainly occur during the flood season june september the largest increase in average monthly streamflow was projected to be 17 6 25 5 and 16 4 22 8 m3 s in july under rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 in the period of 2021 2035 2051 2065 respectively fig 10a shows the changes in seasonal and annual runoff during two future periods the range of summer runoff changes is higher than those in other seasons under rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 in two future periods under the predicted climatic condition compared with the average baseline discharge 16 9m3 s river discharge predicted by swat model would increase by 22 5 45 0 and 26 0 39 6 on an average annual basis under the rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 during the period of 2021 2035 2051 2065 respectively seasonal variation in the projected discharge increase was consistent with projected seasonal changes in precipitation most of the discharge increase would occur in flood season between june and september the different gcms provide various possibilities for streamflow changes caused by future climate change scenarios in the mrb the cumulative distribution functions cdfs of the relative changes in streamflow in the mrb is constructed to show the uncertainty of changes in streamflow based on the average of projected values from 21 cmip5 models the cdfs are established by using kernel density estimator normal kernel smoother with 15 values over the 15 years baseline period the annual streamflow is likely to increase under rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 for both time horizons 2021 2035 and 2051 2065 specifically there is a likelihood of 100 of increased annual streamflow under rcp 4 5 for the period of 2021 2035 and 2051 2065 and more than 99 of increased annual streamflow under rcp8 5 for two future assessment periods fig 11a 3 3 2 total nitrogen fig 9b shows the changes in monthly tn loading predicted by swat according to 21 cmip5 models under rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 over two future periods compared to the baseline period 1991 2005 the general variations of average monthly tn loading are similar in two future periods specifically the ensembles of 21 cmip5 models prediction show that future monthly tn loading would increase in the outlet of the mrb the increases in tn loading would mainly occur in the flood season june september the largest increase in average monthly tn loading was projected to increase by 97 7 156 4 ton in july medeiros braga et al 2013 under rcp4 5 and by 112 4 76 ton in august medeiros braga et al 2013 rcp8 5 in the period of 2021 2035 2051 2065 respectively the temporal change in tn loading patterns in two future periods was similar to that of streamflow because hydrologic process is the driving force for the transport and fate of tn in the watershed fig 10b shows the changes in seasonal and annual tn loading in two future periods the range of summer tn loading changes is higher than those in other seasons under rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 in two future periods under the predicted climatic condition compared with the average baseline tn loading 1963 7 ton tn loading predicted by swat model would increase by 14 0 26 9 and 18 8 14 5 on an average annual basis under the rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 during the period of 2021 2035 2051 2065 respectively seasonal variation in the tn loading was consistent with projected seasonal changes in streamflow the strongest increase in the tn loading would occur in flood season between june and september the cumulative distribution functions cdfs of tn loading changes under rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 for two future assessment periods were analyzed in fig 11b overall simulations show that the annual tn loading is likely to increase in the future specifically the likelihood of increases in tn loading ranges between 73 5 and 83 6 for the mrb as a whole in addition the probability that tn loading increase would be higher in the period of 2021 2035 than in 2051 2065 4 discussion the future climate change would have a positive impacts on water resources in the mrb with projections of increased river streamflow into the miyun reservoir bao et al 2012 which is consist with the projection of climate change in haihe basin however comprehensive assessment on the response of streamflow and total nitrogen export to the climate change along with consideration of uncertainty in the mrb has not been conducted so far by forcing the swat model with downscaled data from 21 cmip5 models under rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 investigation of possible regional climate change and identification details of impacts on streamflow and total nitrogen in the watershed were conducted in the mrb in this study the future climate change was projected to be wetter and more humid in the watershed which is consistent with sun et al 2015 and bao et al 2012 specifically compared with baseline period 1991 2005 average annual precipitation is expected to be 6 1 for rcp4 5 and 5 4 for rcp8 5 in 2021 2035 and 12 7 for rcp4 5 and 12 5 for rcp8 5 in 2051 2065 as for temperature the ensemble mean changes are projected to be 0 6 c for rcp4 5 and 0 9 c for rcp8 5 in 2021 2035 and 1 6 c for rcp4 5 and 2 6 c for rcp8 5 in 2051 2065 during the flood season especially between june and september increased river streamflow mean to flood occurrence in the future indicating there is a need of appropriate flood management in the future the increased inflow into miyun reservoir would not only ensure water supply for beijing city but also effectively cope with current regional ecological environment problems caused by water scarcity such as decreased water surface area of reservoir water level declined the decrease in wetland area zhang et al 2011 and overexploitation of groundwater regionally zhai et al 2013 in addition tn loading into miyun reservoir would increase with the likelihood more than 70 in two future assessment periods this information can help watershed managers to understand probable climate impacts on local water resources and environment in the model chain for climate change impact studies there are two major sources of uncertainties presented in this study swat simulations of hydrologic processes and nutrient cycle at the watershed scale and prediction of future climate change for all hydrologic and water quality models the simulation of hydrologic processes and nutrient cycles at the watershed scale is challenging due to numerous processes and linkage control dynamics of water and nutrients in real world generally modeling uncertainties come from model structural uncertainties input data uncertainties and parameter uncertainties in this study based on performance criteria moriasi et al 2015 both calibration and validation results of monthly river streamflow and total nitrogen in the mrb were good indicating that the calibrated swat model can represent the hydrologic process and nitrogen cycles in the mrb for calibration and validation periods the difference of peak values of simulated and observed streamflow and total nitrogen may be attributed to that the existing meteorological stations and rain gauges cannot accurately represent spatial variation of precipitation and simplification representation of hydrologic processes and nutrient cycles in the watershed it should be noted that a relative higher simulation error at the zhangjiafen hydrologic station may have been partly caused by not considering reservoir effects in the bai river tang et al 2011 even though swat model was well calibrated uncertainties from the selection of gcm and downscaling techniques also influence the reliability of our results firstly the reliability of gcms the most advanced instruments is subject to three distinct sources of uncertainties stemming from internal variability scenario uncertainty and model uncertainty including parameter uncertainty and structural uncertainty hawkins and sutton 2009 knutti 2008 while complexity and resolution of gcms have been gradually improved the uncertainties of their projections still remain large hua et al 2014 huang et al 2013 secondly the downscaling techniques could downscale coarse gcms output to finer resolution requested for climate change impact studies however the performance ability varies with different downscaling methods it is noted that compared with uncertainties from hydrologic and water quality model studies indicated that the selected gcms and downscaling method are the main sources of uncertainty in climate change impact studies chen et al 2011 in view of this ensemble projection is recommended as an effective way to remove the single gcm biases and improve model result although the non climatic factors such as land use are important drivers for altering hydrologic processes and biogeochemical cycles in the watershed those factors keep unchanged during two future projection periods 2021 2035 and 2051 2065 in order to assess the climate change impact alone 5 conclusion in this study the potential impacts of climate change on the water and nitrogen export were investigated based on the results of 21 cmip5 models under rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 emission scenarios in the short term future 2021 2035 and long term future 2051 2065 in the mrb the basin would be more humid and warmer in those two future periods the ensemble mean changes in average annual precipitation are expected to be more than 5 4 in the period of 2021 2035 and 12 5 in 2051 2065 the ensemble mean changes in mean temperature are projected to be more than 0 6 c in 2021 2035 and 1 6 c in 2051 2065 the higher performance metric showed that calibrated swat model can reflect hydrologic process characteristics and nitrogen biogeochemical cycle and reasonably revealed their changes in the future climatic condition in the miyun reservoir basin the results indicated that the streamflow and tn loading are expected to increase in two future periods the changes in streamflow and tn loading would be higher in summer than in other seasons the probability that streamflow and tn loading increase would be higher in the period of 2021 2035 than in 2051 2065 this information can help watershed managers to understand probable climate impacts on local water resources and their associated uncertainty

1124,the projection of streamflow and nutrient exports are essential for future water resource and environmental management plans under climate change this study investigated the responses of streamflow and total nitrogen tn loading to future climate scenarios in the miyun reservoir basin mrb by coupling a physical process based hydrologic and water quality model soil and water assessment model swat and 42 statistical downscaled climate projections on the basis of cmip5 models future climatic projections during the two future periods 2021 2035 and 2051 2065 under rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 emission scenarios primarily precipitation and temperature were used to drive the calibrated swat model results show that the mrb would be warmer and more humid the ensemble mean changes in average annual precipitation mean temperature are expected to be more than 5 4 0 6 c during the period of 2021 2035 and 12 5 1 6 c during 2051 2065 future streamflow and tn loading projection are expected to increase in two future periods meanwhile the changes in streamflow and tn loading would be higher in summer than in other seasons the uncertainty ranges in tn loading projection is larger than that in streamflow projection the probability that streamflow and tn loading increase would be higher in the period of 2021 2035 than in 2051 2065 this study could be of use for providing an insight into the availability of future streamflow and pollution control for the mrb keywords climate change miyun reservoir basin swat model nex gddp dataset 1 introduction the anthropogenic climate change is now occurring as documented in the fifth assessment report of the intergovernmental panel on climate change ipcc ar5 the globally averaged temperature increased by 0 85 c from 1880 to 2012 and each of the last three decades has been successively warmer than any preceding decade since 1850 ipcc 2013 global climate change affect the hydrologic cycle further such changes in climate change and hydrologic processes begetting the alteration of biogeochemical processes that control the transformation and transportation characteristics of nutrients with possible adverse impacts on aquatic ecosystems and human health stuart et al 2011 whitehead et al 2009 in addition to climate change impacts on water resources the impacts of climate change on the biochemical processes of nutrients at the watershed scale are receiving widespread attention from government and public which is the focus of current studies ahmadi et al 2014 shrestha et al 2012 verma et al 2015 zhang et al 2012 the integration of process based hydrologic and water quality models general circulation models gcms and downscaling techniques is extensively used to quantify the response of hydrology and water quality to future climate change at the watershed scale jha et al 2015 ye and grimm 2013 gcm a continuous three dimensional mathematical model for the simulation of atmospheric oceanic and cryospheric processes is the principal instrument for making projection of future climatic condition and widely applied to the researches related to natural system response to future climate change chun et al 2016 zhang et al 2016 however the spatial resolutions of gcms remain relatively coarse so that they are unable to resolve important sub grid scale features such as topography and clouds wilby et al 2002 therefore the raw gcms outputs are limited to regional impact studies especially at the watershed scale fowler et al 2007 fortunately the development of downscaling techniques including statistical and dynamic downscaling methods which downscale coarse gcms output to finer resolution could dissolve scale problem between the outputs from the gcms and the need for regional impact studies wilby et al 1999 comparing to dynamic downscaling statistical downscaling is comparatively cheap computationally efficient and widely used all over the world in regional impact studies ahmadi et al 2014 ye and grimm 2013 zhang et al 2012 for statistical downscaling techniques delta change wu et al 2012 ye et al 2011 quantile mapping fang et al 2015 kim et al 2016 statistical downscaling model sdsm zhang et al 2012 zhang et al 2016 bias correction spatial disaggregation bcsd luo et al 2013 naz et al 2018 were adopted for climate change impact studies for example wu et al 2012 assessed the hydrologic effects of climate change in the upper mississippi river basin based on climate change scenarios data generated by delta change method naz et al 2018 adopted the bcsd method for investigating the streamflow extreme responses to future climate change in the united states watershed modeling approach is always adopted for translating the gcm generated climate data to their potential effects on the hydrologic and biogeochemical cycles at the watershed scale jha et al 2015 ye and grimm 2013 among the hydrologic models more modeling efforts are conducted by means of the soil and water assessment tool swat for climate change impact studies arnold and fohrer 2005 gassman et al 2007 gassman et al 2014 for example luo et al 2013 investigated the streamflow and stream temperature responses to climate change by using the modified swat model and concluded that unfavorable conditions for cold water species in summertime would occur due to decreased streamflow and higher projected air temperature modeling result of swat models in the 3s rivers of the mekong basin indicated that streamflow and non point source pollutant loads were predicted to increase in the future as well as the occurrence of water shortage in the dry season and soil degradation in the wet season dao nguyen and le viet 2017 therefore swat model was chosen in this study to represent the climate change effects on watershed hydrology and water quality simulation the miyun reservoir located in the upstream portion of the haihe river basin china is the major surface source of drinking water for downstream cities such as beijing city the capital of china fig 1 in recent years strong human activities and lasting dry years result in dramatically reduced streamflow into the reservoir bao et al 2012 yan et al 2018 yan et al 2017 in addition the excessive nitrogen loss into the water body of miyun reservoir from its upstream catchment namely miyun reservoir basin mrb is the main reason for the eutrophication of miyun reservoir further threatening the drinking water safety for beijing city wang and gong 2010 zhang et al 2009 despite the fact that its water quality reaches the national environmental standard ii grade for surface water at present liang et al 2016 with the effective control of point source pollution increased nitrogen export is attributed to non point pollution caused by anthropogenic activities such as agricultural practices in the mrb jiao et al 2015 nowadays from the perspective of the watershed scale some studies have been conducted on the effects of climate change on ecological environment including streamflow bao et al 2012 ma et al 2010 yan et al 2018 yang and tian 2009 zheng et al 2016 water quality tang et al 2011 and ecological flow wang et al 2015 however the potential impact of future climate change on the hydrology and water quality has not been conducted so far future climate change could influence the water availability and nutrient export in the mrb thus deeper understanding of the changes in streamflow and water quality in response to the changing climate at the watershed scale is essential for the development of effective management plans and mitigation strategies for natural system under the changing climate based on statistically downscaled climate data as mode input for driving the calibrated swat model the purpose of our study was to 1 project future climate change by 21 cmip5 models under representative concentration pathway 4 5 and 8 5 rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 over the entire mbr 2 assess the potential impacts of climate change on river streamflow and nitrogen export at the watershed outlet the findings presented here may provide a scientific reference for decision making regarding non point pollution control in future climate change conditions in the mrb as well as other regions that possess similar climatic characteristics 2 materials and methods 2 1 description of the study area the miyun reservoir basin mrb approximately 80km away from the beijing city is located between 40 19 n and 41 38 n and between 115 25 e and 115 35 e it flows into the miyun reservoir the most important surface source of drinking water for beijing city china the drainage area is approximately 15 400km2 two tributaries the chao and bai rivers are in the watershed fig 1 watershed elevation ranges from 88 to 2289m there are two major reservoirs the yunzhou and the baihepu reservoirs located in the upstream and midstream portions of the bai river respectively fig 1 these two reservoirs supply agricultural irrigation for the upstream part of miyun reservoir the watershed experiences a temperate continental monsoon climate that is cold and dry in winter but rainy and hot in summer the average annual temperature is approximately 7 5 c yan et al 2017 mean annual precipitation is about 487mm and more than 80 of precipitation occurs mainly during the flood season june to september in a region with precipitation driven hydrologic processes the internal distribution pattern of streamflow is similar to that of precipitation fig 2 2 2 soil and water assessment tool swat swat is a watershed scale distributed parameter and continuous time hydrologic and water quality model based on physical processes and is primarily designed to evaluate the long term impact of land use and management practices on water sediment and agricultural chemical yields in large complex watersheds neitsch et al 2011 major model components include weather hydrology land cover plant growth nutrients pesticide and land management in swat modeling according to topography and user defined threshold drainage area the model delineates a watershed into many sub basins which are then further partitioned into hydrologic response units hrus with unique soil land use and slope characteristics the hru is the smallest landscape component of swat for hydrology processes the simulation of hydrologic processes is separated into the two phases the land phase and routing phase the former controls the amount of water sediment and nutrients loadings into the main channel of each sub basin the latter is defined as the movement of water sediment and nutrients through the stream network to the watershed outlet the swat model has the ability to simulate nutrients circulation including biogeochemical processes mineralization immobilization denitrification and volatilization plant uptake and in stream transformations in the hru level the swat is used not only for agricultural non point pollution modeling but for the assessment of the impacts of climate change on river discharge and water quality at the watershed scale worldwide arnold and fohrer 2005 gassman et al 2014 tuppad et al 2011 the further detailed description of swat model can be found in neitsch et al 2011 2 3 swat setup calibration and validation in the setup of swat model in the mrb input geospatial data included a 90 m resolution digital elevation model dem in 2003 a 1 1 000 000 resolution soil map in 2010 and a 1 25 000 resolution land use map in 2000 fig 3 these geospatial datasets of different resolutions were converted to a common resolution raster 90m the daily climate data of 1991 2005 for driving the model included precipitation maximum and minimum temperature solar radiation relative humidity and wind speed the precipitation data from eight meteorological stations and 21 rain gauges in and around the watershed were adopted the remaining climate variables are from the above mentioned meteorological stations monthly observed streamflow data of 1991 2005 and water quality data total nitrogen of 1999 2005 at the xiahui hydrologic station in the chao river and zhangjiafen hydrologic station in the bai river respectively were used to drive the model the sources of these input data were listed in table 1 in swat modeling the baihe basin was divided into 45 sub basins comprising 664 hrus and the chaohe basin has 28 sub basins and 543 hrus meanwhile soil conservation service scs curve number method was used to calculate the surface runoff from daily precipitation the penmann monteith method was used to estimate the potential evapotranspiration for routing stream flows the variable storage coefficient method was adopted in this study additionally due to the shortage of reservoir operation data the reservoir factor was not incorporated into the simulation as the previous studies did in the mrb tang et al 2011 wang et al 2009 yan et al 2018 and other basins worldwide grusson et al 2015 ye et al 2011 in this study crop management practices and fertilizer application including chemical fertilizer and organic manure were input into the swat model for summer corn based on field investigations and literature reviews geng et al 2013 wang et al 2011 for fertilizer application about 75kg ha of diammonium phosphate was applied as base fertilizer on april 20 while about 112 5kg ha of carbamide was applied as topdressing on june 20 due to different development level of livestock and poultry industry in the mrb the organic fertilizer rate was calculated in the county level by multiplying the pollutants producing and discharging coefficients and the amount of animal manure in each county the organic fertilizer rates varied between 311kg ha and 2005kg ha the detailed information was summarized in table 2 the above mentioned information related to crop management practices and fertilizer application remained unchanged over future assessment periods the monthly observed data were split into a warm up period 1997 1998 a calibration period 1999 2002 and a validation period 2003 2005 after completion of calibration and validation of swat during the period of 1999 2005 the swat was forced by future climate data for the future projection period without changing any of the calibrated model parameters similarly the model was driven by historical climate data during the period of 1991 2005 as a 15 year baseline period 1991 2005 to compare with the average monthly changes in the hydrologic and biogeochemical processes during two future assessment periods 2021 2035 and 2051 2065 thus potential changes in the hydrologic and nutrient transport regimes in the watershed were identified additionally non climatic factors such as land use crop management practices and fertilizer application remained unchanged over future assessment periods the swat calibration and uncertainty programs swat cup developed by abbaspour et al 2007 was adopted for sensitivity analysis and calibration and validation of swat model considering the high efficiency and wide application of parameter optimization method sequential uncertainty fitting sufi 2 algorithm was adopted in this study yang et al 2008 yan et al 2018 based on the investigation of literature related to swat calibration as well as testing of sensitive parameters the parameters to be calibrated and the initial ranges are listed in the supplementary table s2 simulation performance of swat model was evaluated by visual inspection of the figures of the observed and simulated values and also by statistical measures including coefficient of determination r 2 and nash sutcliffe efficiency nse the r 2 and nse were calculated by using the following equation r 2 i 1 n o i o p i p 2 i 1 n o i o 2 i 1 n p i p 2 nse i 1 n o i o 2 i 1 n p i o i 2 i 1 n o i o 2 where p i and o i are the simulated and observed values at each time step i p and o are the mean of simulated and observed values n is the total number of paired values the range of nse is from to 1 and r 2 from 0 to 1 the optimal statistical value occurs when r 2 and nse values are closer to 1 the model performance can be considered satisfactory when monthly nse value is greater than 0 50 moriasi et al 2015 a value greater than 0 75 for monthly nse can be considered to be very good the value between 0 65 and 0 75 can be considered to be good while its value between 0 5 and 0 65 is considered satisfactory 2 4 future climate change scenarios future climatic data precipitation and temperature were derived from the nasa earth exchange global daily downscaled projections nex gddp dataset which was developed to provide a set of global high resolution climate change projections that can be used to assist the science community in conducting studies of climate change impacts at local or regional scales the dataset compiles 42 climate projections from 21 cmip5 gcms under two rcp scenarios rcp 4 5 and rcp 8 5 for the period from 2006 to 2100 as well as the historical experiment for each model for the period from 1950 to 2005 the spatial resolution of the dataset is 0 25 degrees 25km 25km the statistical downscaling method bias correction spatial disaggregation bcsd method luo et al 2013 naz et al 2018 was adopted in the downscaling of the cmip5 gcm data the climate dataset from the global meteorological forcing dataset gmfd developed by princeton university was used as the observational climate data each of the climate projections includes daily maximum temperature minimum temperature and precipitation further detailed information of nex gddp dataset could be found at https cds nccs nasa gov nex gddp the 21 cmip5 models used in this study with their institutes and spatial resolutions are listed in the supplementary table s3 and the rcp4 5 and rcp 8 5 emission scenarios in table 3 the simulated monthly precipitation and mean temperature from nex gddp dataset were compared graphically with corresponding observational values during the period from 1991 to 2005 in fig 4 it shows that the simulated values can capture the monthly distribution of precipitation and mean temperature for the period of 1991 2005 however the observed error of precipitation and mean temperature may be attributed to the global meteorological forcing dataset used as observational climate data during the downscaling process therefore the original nex gddp dataset was not adopted in this study in order to fully understand potential impacts of climate change climate change signals from 21 cmip5 models was kept and used to generate the future climate data precipitation and temperature based on the delta change method in this method mean monthly changes in each climate variables from nex gddp between the baseline period and future assessment periods were calculated in terms of ratio for precipitation or difference for maximum and minimum temperature the calculated changes were added to the baseline observational data to obtain the corresponding future projections to investigate the potential impact of climate change on the streamflow and nutrient exports in the mrb the delta change method was performed by using the following equations 1 t adj fur d t obs d t gcm fur m t gcm ref m 2 p adj fur d p obs d p gcm fur m p gcm ref m where t adj fur d p adj fur d is the adjusted daily temperature precipitation for the future assessment period t obs d p obs d is the observed daily temperature precipitation for the baseline period t gcm fur m p gcm fur m and t gcm ref m p gcm ref m are the monthly mean temperature precipitation from the gcm simulation for the future years and the baseline period respectively in this study 29 nex gddp grid points fall within the mrb boundary fig 1 the sub watersheds were then liked to the nearest grid point as the climatic input to the swat simulation basin wide precipitation and temperature are calculated by the arithmetic average method and mean temperature is average of the maximum and minimum temperature 3 results 3 1 calibration and validation of the swat mode the graphical comparisons of the monthly observed and simulated streamflow and tn loading during the 15 year baseline period 1991 2005 including 4 year calibration 1999 2002 and 3 year validation 2003 2005 periods are shown in figs 5 and 6 it is obvious that both the timing and magnitude of most peaks of streamflow and tn loading matched well with the observed values at the two hydrologic stations however there are still some discrepancies in some peaks of streamflow and tn loading which might be attributed to precipitation data observational error for streamflow and tn and inadequate representation of natural or man made processed in the model additionally the r 2 and nse values for the evaluation of model performance over the calibration and validation periods are shown in table 4 at the baihe basin the r 2 nse for streamflow was 0 81 0 79 for calibration and 0 77 0 64 for the validation period similarly the r 2 nse for chaohe basin was 0 89 0 83 and 0 80 0 71 for the calibration and validation period respectively in simulation of tn loading the values of r 2 nse during the calibration period were 0 75 0 62 and 0 87 0 72 for the baihe basin and chaohe basin respectively meanwhile these values were 0 90 0 79 and 0 88 0 77 for the model validation indicating that simulated values of total nitrogen load were in close agreement with the observed values in general the calibrated model achieved a good performance on the basis of performance criteria proposed by moriasi et al 2015 based on the visual and statistical measures comparison the calibrated swat model can represent the hydrologic process and nitrogen biogeochemical cycle for conducting the climate change impact studies at the miyun reservoir watershed the calibrated swat model was executed for the baseline period 1991 2005 with the no changing calibrated parameters the simulated result for streamflow in table 4 and fig 6 shows the hydrologic calibrated parameters derived from calibration period were reasonable as indicted by r 2 and nse higher than 0 8 for the baseline period 3 2 changes in future precipitation and temperature fig 7 shows the changes of monthly precipitation and temperature from 21 cmip5 models under rcp45 and rcp85 scenarios over two future assessment periods 2021 2035 and 2051 2065 relative to the reference period 1991 2005 the general variation of average monthly temperature and precipitation are similar in two future periods specifically the ensembles of 21 cmip5 models predicted that future average monthly precipitation and temperature in the mrb would increase as for precipitation the increases would mainly occur during the flood season june september in addition the ranges of precipitation and temperature changes are higher during the period of 2051 2065 than during the period of 2021 2035 the rectangular box in the fig 8 represents the range of precipitation and temperature changes between gcms and emission scenarios as indicated in fig 8 the uncertainty ranges of gcms are larger than those of emission scenarios all gcms and rcps indicate that the future annual temperature would increase across the mrb unlike the temperature projected changes in future annual precipitation are bidirectional and vary depending on the gcms and time period the non unidirectional changes in precipitation may be attributed to the complexity in interpreting precipitation as different gcms often do not agree with regard in both magnitude and direction at a specific region in addition the uncertainty ranges vary with the chosen time period the ranges of precipitation changes and temperature changes are higher during the period of 2051 2065 than during the period of 2021 2035 the ensemble mean changes in average annual precipitation are expected to be 6 1 for rcp4 5 and 5 4 for rcp8 5 in 2021 2035 and 12 7 for rcp4 5 and 12 5 for rcp8 5 in 2051 2065 as for temperature the ensemble mean changes are projected to be 0 6 c for rcp4 5 and 0 9 c for rcp8 5 in 2021 2035 and 1 6 c for rcp4 5 and 2 6 c for rcp8 5 in 2051 2065 3 3 impact of climate change on streamflow and nutrient loadings the calibrated swat model was run with 42 climate change projection scenarios for two future periods 2021 2035 and 2051 2065 to investigate the potential effect of climate change on hydrologic processes and total nitrogen export in the mrb 3 3 1 streamflow stream discharge as an important hydrologic variable can synthetically reflect the response of components of watershed hydrologic cycle to a changing climate in the watershed fig 9a shows the changes in monthly streamflow predicted by swat according to 21 cmip5 models under rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 over two future periods compared with the baseline period 1991 2005 the general variations of average monthly streamflow are similar in two future periods specifically the ensembles of 21 cmip5 models prediction show that future monthly streamflow would increase in the outlet of the mrb the increases in streamflow would mainly occur during the flood season june september the largest increase in average monthly streamflow was projected to be 17 6 25 5 and 16 4 22 8 m3 s in july under rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 in the period of 2021 2035 2051 2065 respectively fig 10a shows the changes in seasonal and annual runoff during two future periods the range of summer runoff changes is higher than those in other seasons under rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 in two future periods under the predicted climatic condition compared with the average baseline discharge 16 9m3 s river discharge predicted by swat model would increase by 22 5 45 0 and 26 0 39 6 on an average annual basis under the rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 during the period of 2021 2035 2051 2065 respectively seasonal variation in the projected discharge increase was consistent with projected seasonal changes in precipitation most of the discharge increase would occur in flood season between june and september the different gcms provide various possibilities for streamflow changes caused by future climate change scenarios in the mrb the cumulative distribution functions cdfs of the relative changes in streamflow in the mrb is constructed to show the uncertainty of changes in streamflow based on the average of projected values from 21 cmip5 models the cdfs are established by using kernel density estimator normal kernel smoother with 15 values over the 15 years baseline period the annual streamflow is likely to increase under rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 for both time horizons 2021 2035 and 2051 2065 specifically there is a likelihood of 100 of increased annual streamflow under rcp 4 5 for the period of 2021 2035 and 2051 2065 and more than 99 of increased annual streamflow under rcp8 5 for two future assessment periods fig 11a 3 3 2 total nitrogen fig 9b shows the changes in monthly tn loading predicted by swat according to 21 cmip5 models under rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 over two future periods compared to the baseline period 1991 2005 the general variations of average monthly tn loading are similar in two future periods specifically the ensembles of 21 cmip5 models prediction show that future monthly tn loading would increase in the outlet of the mrb the increases in tn loading would mainly occur in the flood season june september the largest increase in average monthly tn loading was projected to increase by 97 7 156 4 ton in july medeiros braga et al 2013 under rcp4 5 and by 112 4 76 ton in august medeiros braga et al 2013 rcp8 5 in the period of 2021 2035 2051 2065 respectively the temporal change in tn loading patterns in two future periods was similar to that of streamflow because hydrologic process is the driving force for the transport and fate of tn in the watershed fig 10b shows the changes in seasonal and annual tn loading in two future periods the range of summer tn loading changes is higher than those in other seasons under rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 in two future periods under the predicted climatic condition compared with the average baseline tn loading 1963 7 ton tn loading predicted by swat model would increase by 14 0 26 9 and 18 8 14 5 on an average annual basis under the rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 during the period of 2021 2035 2051 2065 respectively seasonal variation in the tn loading was consistent with projected seasonal changes in streamflow the strongest increase in the tn loading would occur in flood season between june and september the cumulative distribution functions cdfs of tn loading changes under rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 for two future assessment periods were analyzed in fig 11b overall simulations show that the annual tn loading is likely to increase in the future specifically the likelihood of increases in tn loading ranges between 73 5 and 83 6 for the mrb as a whole in addition the probability that tn loading increase would be higher in the period of 2021 2035 than in 2051 2065 4 discussion the future climate change would have a positive impacts on water resources in the mrb with projections of increased river streamflow into the miyun reservoir bao et al 2012 which is consist with the projection of climate change in haihe basin however comprehensive assessment on the response of streamflow and total nitrogen export to the climate change along with consideration of uncertainty in the mrb has not been conducted so far by forcing the swat model with downscaled data from 21 cmip5 models under rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 investigation of possible regional climate change and identification details of impacts on streamflow and total nitrogen in the watershed were conducted in the mrb in this study the future climate change was projected to be wetter and more humid in the watershed which is consistent with sun et al 2015 and bao et al 2012 specifically compared with baseline period 1991 2005 average annual precipitation is expected to be 6 1 for rcp4 5 and 5 4 for rcp8 5 in 2021 2035 and 12 7 for rcp4 5 and 12 5 for rcp8 5 in 2051 2065 as for temperature the ensemble mean changes are projected to be 0 6 c for rcp4 5 and 0 9 c for rcp8 5 in 2021 2035 and 1 6 c for rcp4 5 and 2 6 c for rcp8 5 in 2051 2065 during the flood season especially between june and september increased river streamflow mean to flood occurrence in the future indicating there is a need of appropriate flood management in the future the increased inflow into miyun reservoir would not only ensure water supply for beijing city but also effectively cope with current regional ecological environment problems caused by water scarcity such as decreased water surface area of reservoir water level declined the decrease in wetland area zhang et al 2011 and overexploitation of groundwater regionally zhai et al 2013 in addition tn loading into miyun reservoir would increase with the likelihood more than 70 in two future assessment periods this information can help watershed managers to understand probable climate impacts on local water resources and environment in the model chain for climate change impact studies there are two major sources of uncertainties presented in this study swat simulations of hydrologic processes and nutrient cycle at the watershed scale and prediction of future climate change for all hydrologic and water quality models the simulation of hydrologic processes and nutrient cycles at the watershed scale is challenging due to numerous processes and linkage control dynamics of water and nutrients in real world generally modeling uncertainties come from model structural uncertainties input data uncertainties and parameter uncertainties in this study based on performance criteria moriasi et al 2015 both calibration and validation results of monthly river streamflow and total nitrogen in the mrb were good indicating that the calibrated swat model can represent the hydrologic process and nitrogen cycles in the mrb for calibration and validation periods the difference of peak values of simulated and observed streamflow and total nitrogen may be attributed to that the existing meteorological stations and rain gauges cannot accurately represent spatial variation of precipitation and simplification representation of hydrologic processes and nutrient cycles in the watershed it should be noted that a relative higher simulation error at the zhangjiafen hydrologic station may have been partly caused by not considering reservoir effects in the bai river tang et al 2011 even though swat model was well calibrated uncertainties from the selection of gcm and downscaling techniques also influence the reliability of our results firstly the reliability of gcms the most advanced instruments is subject to three distinct sources of uncertainties stemming from internal variability scenario uncertainty and model uncertainty including parameter uncertainty and structural uncertainty hawkins and sutton 2009 knutti 2008 while complexity and resolution of gcms have been gradually improved the uncertainties of their projections still remain large hua et al 2014 huang et al 2013 secondly the downscaling techniques could downscale coarse gcms output to finer resolution requested for climate change impact studies however the performance ability varies with different downscaling methods it is noted that compared with uncertainties from hydrologic and water quality model studies indicated that the selected gcms and downscaling method are the main sources of uncertainty in climate change impact studies chen et al 2011 in view of this ensemble projection is recommended as an effective way to remove the single gcm biases and improve model result although the non climatic factors such as land use are important drivers for altering hydrologic processes and biogeochemical cycles in the watershed those factors keep unchanged during two future projection periods 2021 2035 and 2051 2065 in order to assess the climate change impact alone 5 conclusion in this study the potential impacts of climate change on the water and nitrogen export were investigated based on the results of 21 cmip5 models under rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 emission scenarios in the short term future 2021 2035 and long term future 2051 2065 in the mrb the basin would be more humid and warmer in those two future periods the ensemble mean changes in average annual precipitation are expected to be more than 5 4 in the period of 2021 2035 and 12 5 in 2051 2065 the ensemble mean changes in mean temperature are projected to be more than 0 6 c in 2021 2035 and 1 6 c in 2051 2065 the higher performance metric showed that calibrated swat model can reflect hydrologic process characteristics and nitrogen biogeochemical cycle and reasonably revealed their changes in the future climatic condition in the miyun reservoir basin the results indicated that the streamflow and tn loading are expected to increase in two future periods the changes in streamflow and tn loading would be higher in summer than in other seasons the probability that streamflow and tn loading increase would be higher in the period of 2021 2035 than in 2051 2065 this information can help watershed managers to understand probable climate impacts on local water resources and their associated uncertainty
