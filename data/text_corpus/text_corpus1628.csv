8140,study region republic of benin study focus in the ouémé river basin 48 292 km2 we investigate if the soil and water assessment tool swat model can satisfactorily simulate streamflow when observed data is not available and when swat is calibrated using monthly aet data from gleam thus we compare the performance of swat by applying two different calibration and validation procedures i using time series of observed streamflow q proc ii using gleam v3 0a aet data aet proc new hydrological insight for the region the streamflow simulations from aet proc did not perform as well as with q proc the highest nse values from aet proc for streamflow were obtained in 2 catchments 0 45 and 0 66 with q proc these nse values were 0 55 and 0 72 respectively in fact with q proc acceptable streamflow nse and r2 values were obtained at all four gauges yet the q proc simulation of aet was poor with only 3 and 1 gauges showing satisfactory pbias and kges respectively the aet proc however simulated aet very well with satisfactory kge and pbias statistics at all four gauges and satisfactory nse and r2 values at 2 gauges for streamflow only the r2 values were satisfactory at all gauges comparing further simulated variables such as the soil moisture water yield and crop yields from q proc and aet proc the result showed the use of gleam aet data for calibration can reproduce the temporal dynamics of the rainfall runoff behaviour further research is required to fine tune the aet proc for improved streamflow simulation conceivably by including soil moisture products keywords actual evapotranspiration hydrological modelling calibration swat streamflow 1 introduction integrated water resources management in west africa remains challenging due to the lack of quantitative and qualitative data needed to gain knowledge on surface and ground water systems the data scarcity is also a main limitation for setting up hydrological models used as decision support tools to manage the water resources tourian et al 2017 poméon et al 2018 odusanya et al 2019 schröder et al 2019 today remote sensing technologies offer large scale spatially distributed observations as alternative input data for setting up calibrating and validating mathematical models remote sensing data provides relatively long monitoring periods and good spatial coverage e g of surface water bodies across the globe this allows for a wide range of hydrological applications including satellite based soil moisture sm and actual evapotranspiration products aet for model calibration rajib et al 2016 lazzari franco and bonumá 2017 lópez lópez et al 2017 ha et al 2018 due to remote sensing data applications in hydrology several methods have been developed recently for modelling in ungauged basins for example immerzeel and droogers 2008 calibrated the eco hydrological soil and water assessment swat model by optimizing the simulated aet against derived aet from remotely sensed data using the gradient search gauss marquardt levenberg gml algorithm in a data scarce catchment in india their results showed a close agreement between the simulated aet and the satellite based aet at a monthly time step and at the sub basin level although they were not able to implement a direct validation of the simulated streamflow due to heavy human regulation of the study area using satellite based aet and sm data for streamflow prediction kunnath poovakka et al 2016 proposed a calibration approach that utilizes the shuffled complex evolution uncertainty algorithm sce ua to globally optimize parameters of a simplified australian water resource assessment landscape model awra l for 11 catchments in eastern austrialia their results showed improved streamflow simulations in most of the catchments for more than one objective function during the calibration period no results were available for the validation satellite based aet data is increasingly used in data scarce catchments in africa to calibrate hydrological model parameters with satisfactory model performance results in some studies only a few sub basins are examined where measured data is available lópez lópez et al 2017 nesru et al 2020 wambura et al 2018 and in other studies a limited knowledge of ground truth e g landcover is relied on for example in an ungauged basin in zambia winsemius et al 2008 used time series of satellite based aet to constrain the land related parameters of the hydrological hbv model without calibrating model parameters based on observed streamflow their results showed that using remotely sensed aet data can both reveal hydrological model structural deficiencies and condition model parameters to determine rainfall runoff behaviour moreover they recommend that in semi arid areas where aet dominates this method should be combined with model calibration based on streamflow hence the potential for applying remote sensing data to hydrological modelling is great in west africa given the prevalent situation of a lack of up to date observed streamflow data and the gradual decline in the number of hydrological stations in many catchments it is unrealistic to anticipate more available streamflow observations in the near future thus a robust method for hydrological model calibration and validation based on satellite based products for simulating streamflow without the possibility to verify the simulations using observed streamflow is highly relevant in a recent study carried out in the ungauged ogun river basin in southwestern nigeria we determined which potential evapotranspiration pet equation performed best in the eco hydrological model swat for simulating the aet by comparing the results to several satellite based aet products during the calibration and validation odusanya et al 2019 from our study the combination of using the hargreaves equation with the gleam aet v3 0a data showed the most satisfactory swat model performance when simulating aet yet using this model set up the swat simulated streamflow was not assessed with observed streamflow data as the data was lacking and the effectiveness of satellite based aet in estimating streamflow with swat still remains unclear in order to verify the validity of the methodology proposed by odusanya et al 2019 namely of using satellite based aet for calibrating and validating swat the present study set up the swat model with the aforementioned method in a neighbouring gauged catchment in the republic of benin with the aim of evaluating the swat streamflow performance the objective of this study was to assess the performance of simulated streamflow in the gauged ouémé river basin in the republic of benin by the swat model calibrated and validated with gleam aet v3 0a data as outlined in odusanya et al 2019 to undertake this assessment two procedures were undertaken 1 calibrating validating the swat simulated streamflow using observed streamflow i e the traditional way and 2 calibrating validating the swat simulated aet using gleam aet v3 0a data 2 materials and methods 2 1 description of the study area the ouémé river basin is situated in the republic of benin west africa the ouémé river flows southward shortly before it would reach the atlantic ocean in southern benin it drains into the coastal lagoon system lake nokoué lagoon of porto novo at the bonou outlet the catchment has an area of 48 292 km2 the catchment lies between 6 54 and 10 6 north latitude and 1 40 and 3 22 east longitude fig 1 the elevation of the catchment ranges from 628 m to 5 m the relief is mainly flat and low the watershed mean annual rainfall 1980 2005 is 1110 8 mm and the mean annual temperature 1980 2005 is 27 4 c the mean annual discharge 1980 2005 at the outlet of the watershed at bonou gauging station is 161 m3 s 1 the rainfall regime is controlled by the atmospheric circulation of two air masses the harmattan and the west african monsoon and their seasonal movements le barbé et al 1993 dègan et al 2018 the watershed has a wet as well as a dry tropical climate that can be subdivided into three climatic zones according to the different rainfall regimes fink et al 2010 speth et al 2010 first the unimodal rainfall regime in north ouémé comprising two seasons i e the rainy season from may to october and the dry and hot season second the bimodal rainfall regime in south ouémé comprising two wet seasons and third the transitional rainfall regime in central ouémé comprising a rainy season between march and october with or without a short dry season in august le barbé et al 1993 hounkpè et al 2015 the meteorological measurements 1980 2005 used in this study highlight the three rainfall regimes of the watershed fig 1 the geology of the study area is mainly characterized by a precambrian basement which consists predominantly of complex granulites and gneisses bossa et al 2014 the land cover in the watershed is 80 7 forested 18 9 cropland and 0 3 urban the major crops grown in the catchment are corn cassava yam and sorghum nicely 2014 2 2 the eco hydrological model swat 2 2 1 model set up the soil and water assessment model swat arnold et al 1998 is a semi distributed process based model that runs on a daily time step and can simulate the hydrological cycle nutrient transport crop yield and soil erosion the arcswat2012 version winchell et al 2013 was set up in the ouémé river basin based on a 30 m resolution digital elevation model dem with an estimated vertical accuracy of 9 m rodríguez et al 2006 uuemaa et al 2020 the watershed was delineated and divided into 59 sub basins with the main outlet located at bonou the watershed was further divided into 1890 hrus the basic operational unit of swat is the hydrologic response unit hru which consists of an area of homogeneous soil slope and landuse in each sub basin in each hru the hydrologic and vegetation growth processes are simulated based on the curve number rainfall runoff partitioning and the heat unit phenological development method neitsch et al 2005 winchell et al 2013 the input data dem meteorological data 9 landuse classes 9 soil classes and their spatial resolution used to configure the swat model for the study area are described in table 1 the location of input precipitation from twenty six ground stations and temperature from four ground stations are presented in fig 1 the descriptive statistics frequency proportion and combinations of the missing meteorological data are presented in figs a1 and b1 the missing values of daily measured maximum and minimum temperature and precipitation were simulated in swat using the weather generator wgen cfsr world the daily relative humidity wind speed and solar radiation were also simulated using wgen cfsr world the cfsr world database was developed by the national centre for environmental prediction ncep using global datasets for climate forecast system reanalysis cfsr and consists of long term monthly weather statistics hru thresholds of 0 for landuse 10 for soil type and 10 for slope were applied in the swat set up whereby areas below these thresholds are not considered in the simulations not selecting a threshold value for landuse was based on our desire to retain all of the land use classes the consequences of assigning thresholds include faster computational efficiency while keeping the key landscape features information the swat simulations for ouémé river basin included a warm up period of 5 years 1975 2005 2 2 2 streamflow estimation in swat the surface runoff is simulated using the modified soil conservation services curve number method for each sub basin and then routed to the channel scs usda scs 1986 the kinetic storage routing method sloan and moore 1984 is used to simulate the lateral flow in the soil profile in each soil layer simultaneously the percolation from the bottom of the root zone is estimated with lateral subsurface flow in the soil profile ground water flow is simulated by routing the shallow aquifer storage component to the stream the variable storage coefficient method williams 1969 neitsch et al 2009 is used to route streamflow through the channel 2 2 3 evaporation estimation in swat to be consistent with the previous study odusanya et al 2019 of which this paper is an extension we also applied the hargreaves pet equation hargreaves and samani 1985 in swat the hargreaves equation requires temperature and extra terrestrial radiation as inputs the latter of which is estimated as a function of location and time of the year neitsch et al 2009 once pet is calculated actual evapotranspiration aet is estimated which requires reduction of pet through factors such as the leaf area index and soil available water content swat estimates evaporation from soils according to ritchie 1972 the actual soil water evaporation is estimated using exponential functions of water content and soil depth and plant transpiration is computed as a linear function of leaf area index and pet 2 3 satellite based evapotranspiration data the global land evaporation amsterdam model gleam https www gleam eu produces daily estimates of land evaporation at a 0 25 28 km spatial resolution and are generated by combining a wide range of remote sensing observations from different satellites to separately estimate the different components of terrestrial evaporation such as open water evaporation bare soil evaporation transpiration interception loss and snow sublimation martens et al 2017 gleam is continuously revised and updated one of the three versions of the actual evapotranspiration datasets produced in 2016 is gleam v3 0a it was used for this study based on its satisfactory performance in the previous study odusanya et al 2019 conducted in a neighboring catchment and therefore to maintain consistency we opted for the same aet product furthermore the gleam aet has shown to be valid when measured against aet data from 64 eddy covariance towers across a broad range of ecosystem martens et al 2017 and has also shown to be consistent in similar region in africa trambauer et al 2014 the aet from gleam is based on reanalysis of net radiation and air temperature a combination of gauged based reanalysis and satellite based precipitation and satellite based vegetation optical depth martens et al 2017 miralles et al 2011 it should be noted that aet from gleam does not stem from measured data obtained from eddy covariance instruments but instead it is based on global earth observation products 2 4 swat calibration validation and quantification of uncertainty the sequential uncertainty fitting tool version 2 sufi 2 abbaspour et al 2004 included in the swat calibration uncertainty program swatcup ver 4 3 2 abbaspour 2015 is an optimization algorithm that is based on stochastic procedures abbaspour 2015 for drawing independent parameter sets using latin hypercube sampling lhs sufi 2 was used to perform the sensitivity analysis calibration validation and uncertainty analysis of the swat model simulations the initial pre selection of parameters for sensitivity analysis was undertaken through a literature review rafiei emam et al 2016 lópez lópez et al 2017 ha et al 2018 in this study the sensitivity analysis of parameters related to aet and to streamflow were performed separately a global sensitivity analysis gsa which attempts to assess all combinations of parameter values based on a multiple regression that regresses the lhs generated parameters against the objective function values was carried out in the gsa a t test was used to identify the relative significance of each parameter the larger in absolute terms the value of t stat the coefficient of a parameter divided by its standard error and the smaller the p value the more sensitive the parameter abbaspour 2015 a larger p value suggests that changes in the parameter are not associated with changes in the response parameter not very sensitive and a parameter that has a low p value is likely suggesting a meaningful addition to the model the results of the t test and p values are reported in table 2 two different calibration validation procedures were carried out with the swat model set up in ouémé river basin both with the goal of evaluating the resulting simulated streamflow performance and the effectiveness of the proposed method in the first procedure the swat model parameters were calibrated validated based on observed streamflow in the ouémé watershed which can be considered as the traditional procedure hereafter termed q proc in the second procedure the swat model parameters were calibrated validated based on satellite derived aet from gleam v3 0a hereafter termed aet proc in q proc and aet proc a calibration period from 1980 to 1992 and a validation period from 1993 to 2005 was selected we followed the split sample method as presented by klemes 1986 and gan et al 1997 which consists of splitting the available data when the record is sufficiently long to represent different climatic conditions our splitting ensured that the hydrology in the calibration and validation periods were not substantially different i e wet moderate and dry years occurred in both periods as a check both procedures were compared to the uncalibrated swat model performance further evaluation was undertaken by comparing aet proc and q proc crop yields and the other water balance components such as the soil water amount of water in the soil profile mm water yield the net amount of water that leaves the sub basin and contributes to streamflow in the reach mm and the percolation water that percolates past the root zone mm the water yield wyld is estimated in swat using the following eq 1 1 wyld surq lat q gw q q tloss where surq is the surface runoff contribution to streamflow lat q is the lateral flow contribution to streamflow gw q is the groundwater contribution to streamflow and q tloss is the transmission loss the crop yields from agricultural land agrl were aggregated from hru in each sub basin fig 2 shows a schematic of the study workflow for both q proc and aet proc a multi site monthly time step model calibration 1980 1992 and validation 1993 2005 at the four gauging stations bétérou savè atchérigbé and bonou fig 1 was carried out the most sensitive parameters to the simulation of streamflow in q proc and to aet in aet proc were altered during the calibration process table 2 the p factor and r factor values are used as criteria to determine when a sufficient number of simulations had been performed as described below for q proc to reach a reasonable result two iterations for the calibration were performed the first with 1000 simulations and the second with 500 simulations for aet proc one iteration with 1000 simulations was performed to reach a reasonable result in both procedures the best run was used for the validation period it should be noted that to compare the swat simulated aet in each subbasin to the gleam aet v3 0a a netcdf raster layer was created in arcgis fig c1 the aet from each gleam v3 0a pixel 0 25 0 25 regular grid was extracted for each sub basin by using the convert raster to points tool in arcgis and an area weighted averaging scheme was performed for each subbbasin the extracted daily data were also aggregated to monthly data for each sub basin for a direct comparison with the monthly aet output from swat the degree to which sufi 2 algorithm accounts for the uncertainties conceptual model input data and parameter in the calibrated model is described by two measures namely the p factor and the r factor abbaspour et al 2004 the p factor is the percentage of measured data enveloped by the 95 prediction uncertainty 95ppu band of the simulated output the r factor is the measure of the thickness of the 95ppu band and is calculated as the average thickness of the 95ppu band divided by the standard deviation of the measured data eq 2 2 r f a c t o r 1 n t 1 n x t u x t l σ o b s where x t u and x t l are the upper and lower bounds of the 95ppu at time step t n is the number of data points and σ o b s is the standard deviation of the observed variable identification of all acceptable model solutions in the face of input uncertainties mapped in parameter distribution provides us with the model uncertainty expressed as 95ppu the 95ppu is estimated from the 2 5 and 97 5 levels of the cumulative distribution of an output variable generated by the propagation of the parameter uncertainties using lhs the value of the p factor ranges between 0 and 100 while the value of r factor ranges between 0 and infinity a p factor of 1 and an r factor of 0 is a simulation that exactly corresponds to the observed data abbaspour et al 2004 abbaspour 2015 the objective function used during the calibration and validation in both procedures was the nash sutcliffe efficiency nse nash and sutcliffe 1970 to assess a more complete evaluation of the model three additional metrics r2 kge pbias were applied to the swat simulations post performance some performance ratings for the statistics provided by moriasi et al 2007 2015 gupta et al 2009 and kouchi et al 2017 are not only relevant for streamflow but also for aet lópez lópez et al 2017 ha et al 2018 coefficient of determination r2 ranges from 0 to 1 with higher values indicating less error variance and 1 being the optimal value nash sutcliffe efficiency nse nash and sutcliffe 1970 ranges from to 1 where nse of 1 is the optimal value kling gupta efficiency kge gupta et al 2009 ranges from to 1 where a kge value of 1 is strived for percent bias pbias ranges from to low magnitude values indicate better simulation the optimum value of pbias is 0 moriasi et al 2007 2015 and kouchi et al 2017 recommended performance statistics at a monthly time step of nse 0 50 r2 0 60 kge 0 50 and pbias 25 as satisfactory thresholds 3 results 3 1 sensitivity analysis t2he sensitivity rank and the optimal values of the two procedures aet proc and q proc for the ouémé river basin vary significantly table 2 out of the thirteen parameters that showed significant impacts on the streamflow simulation trnsrch cn2 ch k2 ddrain ch n2 epco sol bd alpha bf biomx gw delay lat time sl soil bio init the fraction of transmission losses from main channel that enter deep aquifer trnsrch was the most sensitive whereas out of the thirteen parameters that showed significance for the aet simulation epco canmx sol bd cn2 esco sol 2 sol awc sl soil blai bio min revapmin lat time tdrain the plant uptake compensation factor epco was the most sensitive the description of the swat parameters used in this study and their minimum and maximum range is presented in table d1 3 2 q proc calibration validation and uncertainty not surprisingly the q proc streamflow results show an improved performance compared to the uncalibrated swat model despite the uncalibrated swat simulations at some gauges showing a satisfactory performance the performance of q proc was superior for all gauges as judged by all objective functions except the kge and pbias values at bétérou station table 3 the streamflow performance at all four gauges increases significantly from the headwaters progressively to the outlet of the watershed in spite of the simultaneous multi gauge calibration implemented the q proc performance statistics for aet compared with the gleam aet v3 0a data is presented in table 3 the nse and r2 results at all the four gauges show an unsatisfactory aet simulation which is attributed to the spatially aggregated aet associated with the q proc method section 2 4 that averages the model outputs to the subbasin level the quantification of uncertainty using the 95ppu in the q proc simulated streamflow shows that the r factors were high at the four gauging stations indicating large model uncertainties fig 3 the p factor values at savè and bonou in both the calibration and validation periods show that well over half of the observed streamflow points are bracketed by the 95ppu while at bétérou and atchérigbé gauges the observed streamflow points bracketed by the 95ppu are around or just under 50 this signifies that the 95ppu of q proc captured most of the observed streamflow at savè and bonou whereas at the latter two gauges bétérou calibration validation and atchérigbé calibration the 95ppu did not capture all the observed streamflow point 3 3 aet proc calibration validation and uncertainty from the four statistical measures nse r2 kge and pbias for the entire basin the aet proc had improved the simulations for aet compared to the uncalibrated swat model figs 4 and e1 and achieved an acceptable model performance result according to moriasi et al 2007 2015 the average pbias of the basin shows that swat over estimated the aet fig 4 for the calibration the aet proc showed that 29 out of the 59 sub basins have a simulated aet performance of nse 0 50 as well as an r2 0 60 in 26 sub basins and in all the 59 sub basins a pbias 15 and a kge 0 50 fig 5 for the validation 24 out the 59 sub basins have a simulated aet performance of nse 0 50 as well as r2 0 60 in 33 sub basins and in 58 sub basins a kge 0 50 and in all the sub basins a pbias 20 fig 6 the aet proc overestimated aet except at the outlet gauge in bonou station although the r factor was quite large indicating large model uncertainties the p factor values obtained revealed that more than half of the aet data in aet proc are bracketed by the 95ppu in all 59 sub basins extracts of the graphical presentation of the 95ppu and the p factor and r factor values are presented in fig 7 3 4 aet proc simulated streamflow the simulated streamflow from the aet proc was evaluated with respect to observed streamflow at the four gauging stations the atchérigbé gauging station had a satisfactory nse for streamflow simulation after the calibration and the validation however the other gauging stations did not table 4 yet the r2 values were satisfactory for streamflow at all the four gauging stations calibration and validation from the kge and pbias values these results reveal that whereas using aet data from gleam v3 0a for calibrating swat greatly improves the aet simulations at all the gauging locations the resulting streamflow simulations at three out of the four gauges do not meet the required statistical criteria for a satisfactory swat model performance according to literature values thus in our case study the streamflow simulations resulting from aet proc did not perform as well as when using observed streamflow data to calibrate streamflow in swat i e with q proc see table 3 3 5 comparing the water balance components and the crop yields from q proc and aet proc the temporal dynamics of aet simulations from the q proc and the aet proc were compared statistically to each other good agreement in the aet dynamic r2 0 60 in 91 5 of the sub basins and a low pbias 25 in 94 of the sub basins were obtained fig f1 from the graphical comparison and the statistical results pbias the aet simulated from aet proc is slightly higher than the aet from q proc figs 8 and the temporal dynamics of other water balance components soil moisture percolation and water yield and the crop yields from q proc and aet proc show a very good agreement the high pbias values soil moisture percolation and water yield indicates that the two simulations of the time series are not in agreement table 5 the comparison was based on the modelled output variables and show the soil water contents resulting from aet proc are overall higher compared to the soil water of q proc the percolation water yield and the crop yields from aet proc are lower to those of q proc table 5 and fig 9 the graphical comparison of sw perc wyld and the crop yield simulations from q proc aet proc and the uncalibrated swat are presented in figs g1 and h1 4 discussion 4 1 sensitivity analysis of model parameters the results of the sensitivity analysis for the swat model show that only 5 out of 13 parameters share the same sensitivity to both aet and to streamflow namely cn2 sol bd epco slsoil lat time however these parameters differ in their sensitivity ranking depending on the variable simulated the parameter cn2 is the scs runoff curve number for moisture condition ii and is one of the dominant parameters that controls the overland flow processes and is also directly related to the peak runoff for the ouémé river basin the cn2 was in the top two most sensitive parameters for streamflow as well as one of the dominant parameters controlling the aet processes table 2 the sol bd parameter is related to the bulk density of the soil and defines the relative amount of pore space in each soil layer it is sensitive for both aet and streamflow simulations because it affects the movement of soil water and therefore also loss of soil water from the system e g through evaporation or lateral flow the epco parameter is the plant uptake compensation factor and its sensitivity indicates that both q proc and aet proc react to the adjusted plant water uptake e g when the soil upper layers do not contain enough water to meet the plant water needs the slsoil and lat time parameters strongly influence the temporal dynamics of the streamflow and aet simulations 4 2 aet proc performance in the aet proc method the result of the simulated aet for the entire ouémé river basin fig 4 agrees with the previous study conducted in nigeria west africa odusanya et al 2019 the aet proc reveals that streamflow at gauges with predominantly low flow bétérou and atchérigbé in the upper basins performed better than that at gauges with high flows save and bonou and this may be associated with the climate gradients and with the different landcover types fig i1 across the ouémé river basin previous studies campo et al 2006 barrett and renzullo 2009 also reported that heterogeneity in land surface conditions and the climatic variability affects the accuracy of the satellite products across a region our results also agree with a study conducted by kunnath poovakka et al 2016 that stated that calibration based on satellite based aet in low flow catchments would result in more accurate prediction due to the strong dependence between aet and streamflow which may probably be due to the fact that aet is a continuous process related to streamflow since streamflow and aet are major output fluxes in the rainfall runoff system an increase in aet will reduce the streamflow especially if the stream has a low flow it is noteworthy to mention some inconsistences in the aet proc results from sub basins where gauges are located which show a well simulated aet but not simulated streamflow thus if aet is well simulated this does not necessarily guarantee a well performing streamflow and conversely having a poor simulated aet does not always mean a poor streamflow table 4 and fig 7 the limitations stated above on the climate and land use gradients and reported in previous studies campo et al 2006 barrett and renzullo 2009 kunnath poovakka et al 2016 may also lead the satellite based aet to not effectively capture and constrain the swat parameters that govern the streamflow fluxes at some gauges apart from the atchérigbé gauging station the aet proc yielded satisfactory aet simulations in most of the sub basins however the resulting simulated streamflow as indicated by the performance metrics nse kge pbias showed no significant streamflow improvement over q proc this result obtained agrees with a study in chindwin basin south east asia sirisena et al 2020 in which the swat model was calibrated using aet and streamflow data separately when one variable was calibrated alone it led to a satisfactory performance but resulted in a reduced performance of the other variable the poor performance of simulated streamflow in aet proc revealed in our study is that the calibrated model parameters are inadequate to reproduce the observed streamflow from the sensitivity analysis for aet proc the epco and canmx were the two most sensitive parameters for aet both parameters control the vertical flux of water aet with little effect on the horizontal flux streamflow and thus affect the ability of swat to simulate streamflow when aet is primarily calibrated 4 3 q proc performance in q proc the performance of simulated streamflow was satisfactory at all gauging stations at all stations except at bétérou the simulated streamflow for both calibration and validation periods show similar r2 and nse values as in other studies bossa et al 2014 dègan et al 2018 in q proc despite our consideration of i similar climate conditions in the calibration and validation periods ii calibrating parameter sets that are sensitive to streamflow e g parameters that control baseflow lateral flow evaporation and surface runoff e g cn2 can adjust for different antecedent moisture conditions dry normal wet and iii using parameter sets that are within to the best of our knowledge physically realistic ranges the failure for swat to capture peak flow at two gauging stations especially at bétérou may be attributed to the uncertainty in the driving variables e g rainfall for instance in the northern part of ouémé river basin where the bétérou gauge is located 3 out of the 9 rainfall stations have frequent approximately 10 missing daily rainfall 1000 of 9497 data points in the lower half of the catchment were the atchérigbé gauge is located the rainfall data is more consistent during the validation period more than half of the observed streamflow is captured by swat and the monthly streamflow is well simulated the missing rainfall data was simulated using the weather generator and may have introduce some uncertainty also the rainfall data from the weather stations around the two gauges may not fully represent the spatial variabilty of the meteorological conditions of the location 4 4 comparing aet proc and q proc simulations a study conducted in the central western region of morocco using the hydrologic model pcr globwb calibrated with satellite based aet from gleam v3 0a lópez lópez et al 2017 found similar results as ours whereby an independent calibration based only on aet data improved the simulated streamflow only to a small extent and that a better streamflow performance was achieved when the model was calibrated with in situ streamflow data jiang et al 2020 used satellite based aet for the spatially distributed calibration of the vic model to determine the effectiveness on simulated streamflow they reported that the hydrologic model calibrated with aet can efficiently tune the relevant model parameters for better aet and streamflow simulations within their physically meaningful ranges the difference in their work that enhances their results is the implementation of the improved vic model by updating the model vegetation input using a satellite observation based on an updated leaf area index lai dataset to define variations in canopy cover and the use of a high quality precipitation dataset comparing the aet proc with q proc simulated water balance components aet sw perc and wyld and the crop yields reveals the aet proc can constrain the swat model parameters to achieve comparable temporal dynamic in the rainfall runoff behaviour and in the biomass yields to q proc the large difference in the value of the pbias for the soil water content from aet proc and q proc indicated that aet proc increases the simulated soil moisture to fit the gleam aet v3 0a data in most of the sub basins the extremely negative pbias between aet proc and q proc simulated soil water agrees with a previous study rajib et al 2018 that reported a model calibrated against solely aet or soil water sw would produce too little or too much of a vertical water flux either to the atmosphere or through soil horizons unless the horizontal water routing streamflow in the model are also simultaneously adjusted the aet proc produces too much of a vertical water flux probably because the two most sensitive parameters canmx and epco have a large impact on the vertical flux of water to fit the simulated aet to the gleam aet v3 0a also birkel et al 2014 reported that the information contained in streamflow time series may not sufficiently capture how vertical fluxes evolve at different spatial and temporal scales within the watershed this process could probably affect the simulation and performance of the resulting streamflow of aet proc the lower crop yields simulated in aet proc compared to q proc are mostly a result of the high soil water estimation by the aet proc fig h1 and the temperature stress indicated by the high aet values it is emerging from this study that the actual soil moisture is the big unknown and can be a key factor to consider in a rainfall runoff model calibration the swat model is structured to provide plant available water from the soil layers from 0 to 200 cm whereas most satellite based soil moisture products provide volumetric moisture in the shallow soil depth 0 5 2 cm thus a direct comparison of the absolute soil moisture is problematic and not possible this limitation in comparing the soil moisture during calibration has been reported by several studies poméon et al 2018 odusanya et al 2019 yet many studies have successfully assimilated satellite based sm into swat by using the ensemble kalman filter han et al 2012 lei et al 2014 liu et al 2018 for improved streamflow simulation since this study strives to use freely available global satellite based data to estimate streamflow for ungauged basins the assimilation of sm in swat is a suggestion for future work 5 conclusion this study tested a calibration validation methodology for the swat model to simulate aet and streamflow for the ouémé river basin in west africa the method is based on satellite based actual evapotranspiration data i e gleam aet product that are used to condition the model predictions of aet and streamflow and is evaluated at 4 sub basin gauges where streamflow observations are available first we showed that satellite based aet data from gleam can be used to effectively calibrate sensitive parameters in swat for simulating catchment wide aet aet proc when compared to an uncalibrated version of the swat model the performance is highly improved and in about half of the sub basins a satisfactory nse performance could be obtained however the resulting streamflow simulations at 3 out of the 4 gauges do not meet the required statistical criteria for a satisfactory swat model performance according to literature values secondly available observed streamflow data from 4 sub basins allowed us to calibrate validate the swat model in a gauged catchment setting q proc and to assess the quality of the model calibration validation for the ungauged situation aet proc when only satellite aet data are available the streamflow simulations for the aet proc method showed a much lower performance when compared to the q proc method for one of the four sub basins the nse value for streamflow from aet proc is below zero indicating that even the mean value of the streamflow observations is a better estimator than the calibrated swat model however in the aet proc method when aet is simulated by the swat model that is calibrated using satellite aet the model performance for streamflow is reduced whereby the nse values for the four sub basins drop from 0 55 0 84 0 72 0 79 case with q proc to 0 45 0 27 0 66 0 87 with aet proc respectively this study illustrates some challenges of the swat model to simulate streamflow well when it is calibrated with the satellite aet product from gleam the poor streamflow simulation performance could be due to several reasons for example poor spatial representation of rainfall over subbasins and due to the swat model structural limitations concerning the runoff generation and evapotranspiration processes we show common swat model parameters that are sensitive both to discharge and to the aet processes these parameters need to satisfy both processes which sometimes have competing interests the data quality of the aet product could also be a reason i e due to aggregating daily to monthly values and due to the weighted average of the gleam pixel values extended to the sub basin level further reasons could be that the available data sets for precipitation and runoff are prone to significant errors and biases or due to the resolution of the input data e g the soil map layer due to the limited streamflow data available in many african catchments with no anticipated increase in streamflow monitoring stations becoming available in the near future it is important to develop a hydrological model calibration method that does not rely on in situ observed streamflow the results from this research contribute to a better understanding of the capabilities and limitations of using satellite based aet in calibration validating swat for both aet and streamflow simulation in a west african catchment since soil moisture plays a key role in the processes of aet overland flow groundwater replenishment and repartition of the mass and energy fluxes e g modulating evapotranspiration between land surface and the atmosphere including the streamflow improving the soil moisture parametrisation should be considered in future work future work could focus on the improvement of the proposed methodology by implementing a multi variable calibration of swat model with other available satellite based data such as soil moisture and leaf area

8140,study region republic of benin study focus in the ouémé river basin 48 292 km2 we investigate if the soil and water assessment tool swat model can satisfactorily simulate streamflow when observed data is not available and when swat is calibrated using monthly aet data from gleam thus we compare the performance of swat by applying two different calibration and validation procedures i using time series of observed streamflow q proc ii using gleam v3 0a aet data aet proc new hydrological insight for the region the streamflow simulations from aet proc did not perform as well as with q proc the highest nse values from aet proc for streamflow were obtained in 2 catchments 0 45 and 0 66 with q proc these nse values were 0 55 and 0 72 respectively in fact with q proc acceptable streamflow nse and r2 values were obtained at all four gauges yet the q proc simulation of aet was poor with only 3 and 1 gauges showing satisfactory pbias and kges respectively the aet proc however simulated aet very well with satisfactory kge and pbias statistics at all four gauges and satisfactory nse and r2 values at 2 gauges for streamflow only the r2 values were satisfactory at all gauges comparing further simulated variables such as the soil moisture water yield and crop yields from q proc and aet proc the result showed the use of gleam aet data for calibration can reproduce the temporal dynamics of the rainfall runoff behaviour further research is required to fine tune the aet proc for improved streamflow simulation conceivably by including soil moisture products keywords actual evapotranspiration hydrological modelling calibration swat streamflow 1 introduction integrated water resources management in west africa remains challenging due to the lack of quantitative and qualitative data needed to gain knowledge on surface and ground water systems the data scarcity is also a main limitation for setting up hydrological models used as decision support tools to manage the water resources tourian et al 2017 poméon et al 2018 odusanya et al 2019 schröder et al 2019 today remote sensing technologies offer large scale spatially distributed observations as alternative input data for setting up calibrating and validating mathematical models remote sensing data provides relatively long monitoring periods and good spatial coverage e g of surface water bodies across the globe this allows for a wide range of hydrological applications including satellite based soil moisture sm and actual evapotranspiration products aet for model calibration rajib et al 2016 lazzari franco and bonumá 2017 lópez lópez et al 2017 ha et al 2018 due to remote sensing data applications in hydrology several methods have been developed recently for modelling in ungauged basins for example immerzeel and droogers 2008 calibrated the eco hydrological soil and water assessment swat model by optimizing the simulated aet against derived aet from remotely sensed data using the gradient search gauss marquardt levenberg gml algorithm in a data scarce catchment in india their results showed a close agreement between the simulated aet and the satellite based aet at a monthly time step and at the sub basin level although they were not able to implement a direct validation of the simulated streamflow due to heavy human regulation of the study area using satellite based aet and sm data for streamflow prediction kunnath poovakka et al 2016 proposed a calibration approach that utilizes the shuffled complex evolution uncertainty algorithm sce ua to globally optimize parameters of a simplified australian water resource assessment landscape model awra l for 11 catchments in eastern austrialia their results showed improved streamflow simulations in most of the catchments for more than one objective function during the calibration period no results were available for the validation satellite based aet data is increasingly used in data scarce catchments in africa to calibrate hydrological model parameters with satisfactory model performance results in some studies only a few sub basins are examined where measured data is available lópez lópez et al 2017 nesru et al 2020 wambura et al 2018 and in other studies a limited knowledge of ground truth e g landcover is relied on for example in an ungauged basin in zambia winsemius et al 2008 used time series of satellite based aet to constrain the land related parameters of the hydrological hbv model without calibrating model parameters based on observed streamflow their results showed that using remotely sensed aet data can both reveal hydrological model structural deficiencies and condition model parameters to determine rainfall runoff behaviour moreover they recommend that in semi arid areas where aet dominates this method should be combined with model calibration based on streamflow hence the potential for applying remote sensing data to hydrological modelling is great in west africa given the prevalent situation of a lack of up to date observed streamflow data and the gradual decline in the number of hydrological stations in many catchments it is unrealistic to anticipate more available streamflow observations in the near future thus a robust method for hydrological model calibration and validation based on satellite based products for simulating streamflow without the possibility to verify the simulations using observed streamflow is highly relevant in a recent study carried out in the ungauged ogun river basin in southwestern nigeria we determined which potential evapotranspiration pet equation performed best in the eco hydrological model swat for simulating the aet by comparing the results to several satellite based aet products during the calibration and validation odusanya et al 2019 from our study the combination of using the hargreaves equation with the gleam aet v3 0a data showed the most satisfactory swat model performance when simulating aet yet using this model set up the swat simulated streamflow was not assessed with observed streamflow data as the data was lacking and the effectiveness of satellite based aet in estimating streamflow with swat still remains unclear in order to verify the validity of the methodology proposed by odusanya et al 2019 namely of using satellite based aet for calibrating and validating swat the present study set up the swat model with the aforementioned method in a neighbouring gauged catchment in the republic of benin with the aim of evaluating the swat streamflow performance the objective of this study was to assess the performance of simulated streamflow in the gauged ouémé river basin in the republic of benin by the swat model calibrated and validated with gleam aet v3 0a data as outlined in odusanya et al 2019 to undertake this assessment two procedures were undertaken 1 calibrating validating the swat simulated streamflow using observed streamflow i e the traditional way and 2 calibrating validating the swat simulated aet using gleam aet v3 0a data 2 materials and methods 2 1 description of the study area the ouémé river basin is situated in the republic of benin west africa the ouémé river flows southward shortly before it would reach the atlantic ocean in southern benin it drains into the coastal lagoon system lake nokoué lagoon of porto novo at the bonou outlet the catchment has an area of 48 292 km2 the catchment lies between 6 54 and 10 6 north latitude and 1 40 and 3 22 east longitude fig 1 the elevation of the catchment ranges from 628 m to 5 m the relief is mainly flat and low the watershed mean annual rainfall 1980 2005 is 1110 8 mm and the mean annual temperature 1980 2005 is 27 4 c the mean annual discharge 1980 2005 at the outlet of the watershed at bonou gauging station is 161 m3 s 1 the rainfall regime is controlled by the atmospheric circulation of two air masses the harmattan and the west african monsoon and their seasonal movements le barbé et al 1993 dègan et al 2018 the watershed has a wet as well as a dry tropical climate that can be subdivided into three climatic zones according to the different rainfall regimes fink et al 2010 speth et al 2010 first the unimodal rainfall regime in north ouémé comprising two seasons i e the rainy season from may to october and the dry and hot season second the bimodal rainfall regime in south ouémé comprising two wet seasons and third the transitional rainfall regime in central ouémé comprising a rainy season between march and october with or without a short dry season in august le barbé et al 1993 hounkpè et al 2015 the meteorological measurements 1980 2005 used in this study highlight the three rainfall regimes of the watershed fig 1 the geology of the study area is mainly characterized by a precambrian basement which consists predominantly of complex granulites and gneisses bossa et al 2014 the land cover in the watershed is 80 7 forested 18 9 cropland and 0 3 urban the major crops grown in the catchment are corn cassava yam and sorghum nicely 2014 2 2 the eco hydrological model swat 2 2 1 model set up the soil and water assessment model swat arnold et al 1998 is a semi distributed process based model that runs on a daily time step and can simulate the hydrological cycle nutrient transport crop yield and soil erosion the arcswat2012 version winchell et al 2013 was set up in the ouémé river basin based on a 30 m resolution digital elevation model dem with an estimated vertical accuracy of 9 m rodríguez et al 2006 uuemaa et al 2020 the watershed was delineated and divided into 59 sub basins with the main outlet located at bonou the watershed was further divided into 1890 hrus the basic operational unit of swat is the hydrologic response unit hru which consists of an area of homogeneous soil slope and landuse in each sub basin in each hru the hydrologic and vegetation growth processes are simulated based on the curve number rainfall runoff partitioning and the heat unit phenological development method neitsch et al 2005 winchell et al 2013 the input data dem meteorological data 9 landuse classes 9 soil classes and their spatial resolution used to configure the swat model for the study area are described in table 1 the location of input precipitation from twenty six ground stations and temperature from four ground stations are presented in fig 1 the descriptive statistics frequency proportion and combinations of the missing meteorological data are presented in figs a1 and b1 the missing values of daily measured maximum and minimum temperature and precipitation were simulated in swat using the weather generator wgen cfsr world the daily relative humidity wind speed and solar radiation were also simulated using wgen cfsr world the cfsr world database was developed by the national centre for environmental prediction ncep using global datasets for climate forecast system reanalysis cfsr and consists of long term monthly weather statistics hru thresholds of 0 for landuse 10 for soil type and 10 for slope were applied in the swat set up whereby areas below these thresholds are not considered in the simulations not selecting a threshold value for landuse was based on our desire to retain all of the land use classes the consequences of assigning thresholds include faster computational efficiency while keeping the key landscape features information the swat simulations for ouémé river basin included a warm up period of 5 years 1975 2005 2 2 2 streamflow estimation in swat the surface runoff is simulated using the modified soil conservation services curve number method for each sub basin and then routed to the channel scs usda scs 1986 the kinetic storage routing method sloan and moore 1984 is used to simulate the lateral flow in the soil profile in each soil layer simultaneously the percolation from the bottom of the root zone is estimated with lateral subsurface flow in the soil profile ground water flow is simulated by routing the shallow aquifer storage component to the stream the variable storage coefficient method williams 1969 neitsch et al 2009 is used to route streamflow through the channel 2 2 3 evaporation estimation in swat to be consistent with the previous study odusanya et al 2019 of which this paper is an extension we also applied the hargreaves pet equation hargreaves and samani 1985 in swat the hargreaves equation requires temperature and extra terrestrial radiation as inputs the latter of which is estimated as a function of location and time of the year neitsch et al 2009 once pet is calculated actual evapotranspiration aet is estimated which requires reduction of pet through factors such as the leaf area index and soil available water content swat estimates evaporation from soils according to ritchie 1972 the actual soil water evaporation is estimated using exponential functions of water content and soil depth and plant transpiration is computed as a linear function of leaf area index and pet 2 3 satellite based evapotranspiration data the global land evaporation amsterdam model gleam https www gleam eu produces daily estimates of land evaporation at a 0 25 28 km spatial resolution and are generated by combining a wide range of remote sensing observations from different satellites to separately estimate the different components of terrestrial evaporation such as open water evaporation bare soil evaporation transpiration interception loss and snow sublimation martens et al 2017 gleam is continuously revised and updated one of the three versions of the actual evapotranspiration datasets produced in 2016 is gleam v3 0a it was used for this study based on its satisfactory performance in the previous study odusanya et al 2019 conducted in a neighboring catchment and therefore to maintain consistency we opted for the same aet product furthermore the gleam aet has shown to be valid when measured against aet data from 64 eddy covariance towers across a broad range of ecosystem martens et al 2017 and has also shown to be consistent in similar region in africa trambauer et al 2014 the aet from gleam is based on reanalysis of net radiation and air temperature a combination of gauged based reanalysis and satellite based precipitation and satellite based vegetation optical depth martens et al 2017 miralles et al 2011 it should be noted that aet from gleam does not stem from measured data obtained from eddy covariance instruments but instead it is based on global earth observation products 2 4 swat calibration validation and quantification of uncertainty the sequential uncertainty fitting tool version 2 sufi 2 abbaspour et al 2004 included in the swat calibration uncertainty program swatcup ver 4 3 2 abbaspour 2015 is an optimization algorithm that is based on stochastic procedures abbaspour 2015 for drawing independent parameter sets using latin hypercube sampling lhs sufi 2 was used to perform the sensitivity analysis calibration validation and uncertainty analysis of the swat model simulations the initial pre selection of parameters for sensitivity analysis was undertaken through a literature review rafiei emam et al 2016 lópez lópez et al 2017 ha et al 2018 in this study the sensitivity analysis of parameters related to aet and to streamflow were performed separately a global sensitivity analysis gsa which attempts to assess all combinations of parameter values based on a multiple regression that regresses the lhs generated parameters against the objective function values was carried out in the gsa a t test was used to identify the relative significance of each parameter the larger in absolute terms the value of t stat the coefficient of a parameter divided by its standard error and the smaller the p value the more sensitive the parameter abbaspour 2015 a larger p value suggests that changes in the parameter are not associated with changes in the response parameter not very sensitive and a parameter that has a low p value is likely suggesting a meaningful addition to the model the results of the t test and p values are reported in table 2 two different calibration validation procedures were carried out with the swat model set up in ouémé river basin both with the goal of evaluating the resulting simulated streamflow performance and the effectiveness of the proposed method in the first procedure the swat model parameters were calibrated validated based on observed streamflow in the ouémé watershed which can be considered as the traditional procedure hereafter termed q proc in the second procedure the swat model parameters were calibrated validated based on satellite derived aet from gleam v3 0a hereafter termed aet proc in q proc and aet proc a calibration period from 1980 to 1992 and a validation period from 1993 to 2005 was selected we followed the split sample method as presented by klemes 1986 and gan et al 1997 which consists of splitting the available data when the record is sufficiently long to represent different climatic conditions our splitting ensured that the hydrology in the calibration and validation periods were not substantially different i e wet moderate and dry years occurred in both periods as a check both procedures were compared to the uncalibrated swat model performance further evaluation was undertaken by comparing aet proc and q proc crop yields and the other water balance components such as the soil water amount of water in the soil profile mm water yield the net amount of water that leaves the sub basin and contributes to streamflow in the reach mm and the percolation water that percolates past the root zone mm the water yield wyld is estimated in swat using the following eq 1 1 wyld surq lat q gw q q tloss where surq is the surface runoff contribution to streamflow lat q is the lateral flow contribution to streamflow gw q is the groundwater contribution to streamflow and q tloss is the transmission loss the crop yields from agricultural land agrl were aggregated from hru in each sub basin fig 2 shows a schematic of the study workflow for both q proc and aet proc a multi site monthly time step model calibration 1980 1992 and validation 1993 2005 at the four gauging stations bétérou savè atchérigbé and bonou fig 1 was carried out the most sensitive parameters to the simulation of streamflow in q proc and to aet in aet proc were altered during the calibration process table 2 the p factor and r factor values are used as criteria to determine when a sufficient number of simulations had been performed as described below for q proc to reach a reasonable result two iterations for the calibration were performed the first with 1000 simulations and the second with 500 simulations for aet proc one iteration with 1000 simulations was performed to reach a reasonable result in both procedures the best run was used for the validation period it should be noted that to compare the swat simulated aet in each subbasin to the gleam aet v3 0a a netcdf raster layer was created in arcgis fig c1 the aet from each gleam v3 0a pixel 0 25 0 25 regular grid was extracted for each sub basin by using the convert raster to points tool in arcgis and an area weighted averaging scheme was performed for each subbbasin the extracted daily data were also aggregated to monthly data for each sub basin for a direct comparison with the monthly aet output from swat the degree to which sufi 2 algorithm accounts for the uncertainties conceptual model input data and parameter in the calibrated model is described by two measures namely the p factor and the r factor abbaspour et al 2004 the p factor is the percentage of measured data enveloped by the 95 prediction uncertainty 95ppu band of the simulated output the r factor is the measure of the thickness of the 95ppu band and is calculated as the average thickness of the 95ppu band divided by the standard deviation of the measured data eq 2 2 r f a c t o r 1 n t 1 n x t u x t l σ o b s where x t u and x t l are the upper and lower bounds of the 95ppu at time step t n is the number of data points and σ o b s is the standard deviation of the observed variable identification of all acceptable model solutions in the face of input uncertainties mapped in parameter distribution provides us with the model uncertainty expressed as 95ppu the 95ppu is estimated from the 2 5 and 97 5 levels of the cumulative distribution of an output variable generated by the propagation of the parameter uncertainties using lhs the value of the p factor ranges between 0 and 100 while the value of r factor ranges between 0 and infinity a p factor of 1 and an r factor of 0 is a simulation that exactly corresponds to the observed data abbaspour et al 2004 abbaspour 2015 the objective function used during the calibration and validation in both procedures was the nash sutcliffe efficiency nse nash and sutcliffe 1970 to assess a more complete evaluation of the model three additional metrics r2 kge pbias were applied to the swat simulations post performance some performance ratings for the statistics provided by moriasi et al 2007 2015 gupta et al 2009 and kouchi et al 2017 are not only relevant for streamflow but also for aet lópez lópez et al 2017 ha et al 2018 coefficient of determination r2 ranges from 0 to 1 with higher values indicating less error variance and 1 being the optimal value nash sutcliffe efficiency nse nash and sutcliffe 1970 ranges from to 1 where nse of 1 is the optimal value kling gupta efficiency kge gupta et al 2009 ranges from to 1 where a kge value of 1 is strived for percent bias pbias ranges from to low magnitude values indicate better simulation the optimum value of pbias is 0 moriasi et al 2007 2015 and kouchi et al 2017 recommended performance statistics at a monthly time step of nse 0 50 r2 0 60 kge 0 50 and pbias 25 as satisfactory thresholds 3 results 3 1 sensitivity analysis t2he sensitivity rank and the optimal values of the two procedures aet proc and q proc for the ouémé river basin vary significantly table 2 out of the thirteen parameters that showed significant impacts on the streamflow simulation trnsrch cn2 ch k2 ddrain ch n2 epco sol bd alpha bf biomx gw delay lat time sl soil bio init the fraction of transmission losses from main

blai bio min revapmin lat time tdrain the plant uptake compensation factor epco was the most sensitive the description of the swat parameters used in this study and their minimum and maximum range is presented in table d1 3 2 q proc calibration validation and uncertainty not surprisingly the q proc streamflow results show an improved performance compared to the uncalibrated swat model despite the uncalibrated swat simulations at some gauges showing a satisfactory performance the performance of q proc was superior for all gauges as judged by all objective functions except the kge and pbias values at bétérou station table 3 the streamflow performance at all four gauges increases significantly from the headwaters progressively to the outlet of the watershed in spite of the simultaneous multi gauge calibration implemented the q proc performance statistics for aet compared with the gleam aet v3 0a data is presented in table 3 the nse and r2 results at all the four gauges show an unsatisfactory aet simulation which is attributed to the spatially aggregated aet associated with the q proc method section 2 4 that averages the model outputs to the subbasin level the quantification of uncertainty using the 95ppu in the q proc simulated streamflow shows that the r factors were high at the four gauging stations indicating large model uncertainties fig 3 the p factor values at savè and bonou in both the calibration and validation periods show that well over half of the observed streamflow points are bracketed by the 95ppu while at bétérou and atchérigbé gauges the observed streamflow points bracketed by the 95ppu are around or just under 50 this signifies that the 95ppu of q proc captured most of the observed streamflow at savè and bonou whereas at the latter two gauges bétérou calibration validation and atchérigbé calibration the 95ppu did not capture all the observed streamflow point 3 3 aet proc calibration validation and uncertainty from the four statistical measures nse r2 kge and pbias for the entire basin the aet proc had improved the simulations for aet compared to the uncalibrated swat model figs 4 and e1 and achieved an acceptable model performance result according to moriasi et al 2007 2015 the average pbias of the basin shows that swat over estimated the aet fig 4 for the calibration the aet proc showed that 29 out of the 59 sub basins have a simulated aet performance of nse 0 50 as well as an r2 0 60 in 26 sub basins and in all the 59 sub basins a pbias 15 and a kge 0 50 fig 5 for the validation 24 out the 59 sub basins have a simulated aet performance of nse 0 50 as well as r2 0 60 in 33 sub basins and in 58 sub basins a kge 0 50 and in all the sub basins a pbias 20 fig 6 the aet proc overestimated aet except at the outlet gauge in bonou station although the r factor was quite large indicating large model uncertainties the p factor values obtained revealed that more than half of the aet data in aet proc are bracketed by the 95ppu in all 59 sub basins extracts of the graphical presentation of the 95ppu and the p factor and r factor values are presented in fig 7 3 4 aet proc simulated streamflow the simulated streamflow from the aet proc was evaluated with respect to observed streamflow at the four gauging stations the atchérigbé gauging station had a satisfactory nse for streamflow simulation after the calibration and the validation however the other gauging stations did not table 4 yet the r2 values were satisfactory for streamflow at all the four gauging stations calibration and validation from the kge and pbias values these results reveal that whereas using aet data from gleam v3 0a for calibrating swat greatly improves the aet simulations at all the gauging locations the resulting streamflow simulations at three out of the four gauges do not meet the required statistical criteria for a satisfactory swat model performance according to literature values thus in our case study the streamflow simulations resulting from aet proc did not perform as well as when using observed streamflow data to calibrate streamflow in swat i e with q proc see table 3 3 5 comparing the water balance components and the crop yields from q proc and aet proc the temporal dynamics of aet simulations from the q proc and the aet proc were compared statistically to each other good agreement in the aet dynamic r2 0 60 in 91 5 of the sub basins and a low pbias 25 in 94 of the sub basins were obtained fig f1 from the graphical comparison and the statistical results pbias the aet simulated from aet proc is slightly higher than the aet from q proc figs 8 and the temporal dynamics of other water balance components soil moisture percolation and water yield and the crop yields from q proc and aet proc show a very good agreement the high pbias values soil moisture percolation and water yield indicates that the two simulations of the time series are not in agreement table 5 the comparison was based on the modelled output variables and show the soil water contents resulting from aet proc are overall higher compared to the soil water of q proc the percolation water yield and the crop yields from aet proc are lower to those of q proc table 5 and fig 9 the graphical comparison of sw perc wyld and the crop yield simulations from q proc aet proc and the uncalibrated swat are presented in figs g1 and h1 4 discussion 4 1 sensitivity analysis of model parameters the results of the sensitivity analysis for the swat model show that only 5 out of 13 parameters share the same sensitivity to both aet and to streamflow namely cn2 sol bd epco slsoil lat time however these parameters differ in their sensitivity ranking depending on the variable simulated the parameter cn2 is the scs runoff curve number for moisture condition ii and is one of the dominant parameters that controls the overland flow processes and is also directly related to the peak runoff for the ouémé river basin the cn2 was in the top two most sensitive parameters for streamflow as well as one of the dominant parameters controlling the aet processes table 2 the sol bd parameter is related to the bulk density of the soil and defines the relative amount of pore space in each soil layer it is sensitive for both aet and streamflow simulations because it affects the movement of soil water and therefore also loss of soil water from the system e g through evaporation or lateral flow the epco parameter is the plant uptake compensation factor and its sensitivity indicates that both q proc and aet proc react to the adjusted plant water uptake e g when the soil upper layers do not contain enough water to meet the plant water needs the slsoil and lat time parameters strongly influence the temporal dynamics of the streamflow and aet simulations 4 2 aet proc performance in the aet proc method the result of the simulated aet for the entire ouémé river basin fig 4 agrees with the previous study conducted in nigeria west africa odusanya et al 2019 the aet proc reveals that streamflow at gauges with predominantly low flow bétérou and atchérigbé in the upper basins performed better than that at gauges with high flows save and bonou and this may be associated with the climate gradients and with the different landcover types fig i1 across the ouémé river basin previous studies campo et al 2006 barrett and renzullo 2009 also reported that heterogeneity in land surface conditions and the climatic variability affects the accuracy of the satellite products across a region our results also agree with a study conducted by kunnath poovakka et al 2016 that stated that calibration based on satellite based aet in low flow catchments would result in more accurate prediction due to the strong dependence between aet and streamflow which may probably be due to the fact that aet is a continuous process related to streamflow since streamflow and aet are major output fluxes in the rainfall runoff system an increase in aet will reduce the streamflow especially if the stream has a low flow it is noteworthy to mention some inconsistences in the aet proc results from sub basins where gauges are located which show a well simulated aet but not simulated streamflow thus if aet is well simulated this does not necessarily guarantee a well performing streamflow and conversely having a poor simulated aet does not always mean a poor streamflow table 4 and fig 7 the limitations stated above on the climate and land use gradients and reported in previous studies campo et al 2006 barrett and renzullo 2009 kunnath poovakka et al 2016 may also lead the satellite based aet to not effectively capture and constrain the swat parameters that govern the streamflow fluxes at some gauges apart from the atchérigbé gauging station the aet proc yielded satisfactory aet simulations in most of the sub basins however the resulting simulated streamflow as indicated by the performance metrics nse kge pbias showed no significant streamflow improvement over q proc this result obtained agrees with a study in chindwin basin south east asia sirisena et al 2020 in which the swat model was calibrated using aet and streamflow data separately when one variable was calibrated alone it led to a satisfactory performance but resulted in a reduced performance of the other variable the poor performance of simulated streamflow in aet proc revealed in our study is that the calibrated model parameters are inadequate to reproduce the observed streamflow from the sensitivity analysis for aet proc the epco and canmx were the two most sensitive parameters for aet both parameters control the vertical flux of water aet with little effect on the horizontal flux streamflow and thus affect the ability of swat to simulate streamflow when aet is primarily calibrated 4 3 q proc performance in q proc the performance of simulated streamflow was satisfactory at all gauging stations at all stations except at bétérou the simulated streamflow for both calibration and validation periods show similar r2 and nse values as in other studies bossa et al 2014 dègan et al 2018 in q proc despite our consideration of i similar climate conditions in the calibration and validation periods ii calibrating parameter sets that are sensitive to streamflow e g parameters that control baseflow lateral flow evaporation and surface runoff e g cn2 can adjust for different antecedent moisture conditions dry normal wet and iii using parameter sets that are within to the best of our knowledge physically realistic ranges the failure for swat to capture peak flow at two gauging stations especially at bétérou may be attributed to the uncertainty in the driving variables e g rainfall for instance in the northern part of ouémé river basin where the bétérou gauge is located 3 out of the 9 rainfall stations have frequent approximately 10 missing daily rainfall 1000 of 9497 data points in the lower half of the catchment were the atchérigbé gauge is located the rainfall data is more consistent during the validation period more than half of the observed streamflow is captured by swat and the monthly streamflow is well simulated the missing rainfall data was simulated using the weather generator and may have introduce some uncertainty also the rainfall data from the weather stations around the two gauges may not fully represent the spatial variabilty of the meteorological conditions of the location 4 4 comparing aet proc and q proc simulations a study conducted in the central western region of morocco using the hydrologic model pcr globwb calibrated with satellite based aet from gleam v3 0a lópez lópez et al 2017 found similar results as ours whereby an independent calibration based only on aet data improved the simulated streamflow only to a small extent and that a better streamflow performance was achieved when the model was calibrated with in situ streamflow data jiang et al 2020 used satellite based aet for the spatially distributed calibration of the vic model to determine the effectiveness on simulated streamflow they reported that the hydrologic model calibrated with aet can efficiently tune the relevant model parameters for better aet and streamflow simulations within their physically meaningful ranges the difference in their work that enhances their results is the implementation of the improved vic model by updating the model vegetation input using a satellite observation based on an updated leaf area index lai dataset to define variations in canopy cover and the use of a high quality precipitation dataset comparing the aet proc with q proc simulated water balance components aet sw perc and wyld and the crop yields reveals the aet proc can constrain the swat model parameters to achieve comparable temporal dynamic in the rainfall runoff behaviour and in the biomass yields to q proc the large difference in the value of the pbias for the soil water content from aet proc and q proc indicated that aet proc increases the simulated soil moisture to fit the gleam aet v3 0a data in most of the sub basins the extremely negative pbias between aet proc and q proc simulated soil water agrees with a previous study rajib et al 2018 that reported a model calibrated against solely aet or soil water sw would produce too little or too much of a vertical water flux either to the atmosphere or through soil horizons unless the horizontal water routing streamflow in the model are also simultaneously adjusted the aet proc produces too much of a vertical water flux probably because the two most sensitive parameters canmx and epco have a large impact on the vertical flux of water to fit the simulated aet to the gleam aet v3 0a also birkel et al 2014 reported that the information contained in streamflow time series may not sufficiently capture how vertical fluxes evolve at different spatial and temporal scales within the watershed this process could probably affect the simulation and performance of the resulting streamflow of aet proc the lower crop yields simulated in aet proc compared to q proc are mostly a result of the high soil water estimation by the aet proc fig h1 and the temperature stress indicated by the high aet values it is emerging from this study that the actual soil moisture is the big unknown and can be a key factor to consider in a rainfall runoff model calibration the swat model is structured to provide plant available water from the soil layers from 0 to 200 cm whereas most satellite based soil moisture products provide volumetric moisture in the shallow soil depth 0 5 2 cm thus a direct comparison of the absolute soil moisture is problematic and not possible this limitation in comparing the soil moisture during calibration has been reported by several studies poméon et al 2018 odusanya et al 2019 yet many studies have successfully assimilated satellite based sm into swat by using the ensemble kalman filter han et al 2012 lei et al 2014 liu et al 2018 for improved streamflow simulation since this study strives to use freely available global satellite based data to estimate streamflow for ungauged basins the assimilation of sm in swat is a suggestion for future work 5 conclusion this study tested a calibration validation methodology for the swat model to simulate aet and streamflow for the ouémé river basin in west africa the method is based on satellite based actual evapotranspiration data i e gleam aet product that are used to condition the model predictions of aet and streamflow and is evaluated at 4 sub basin gauges where streamflow observations are available first we showed that satellite based aet data from gleam can be used to effectively calibrate sensitive parameters in swat for simulating catchment wide aet aet proc when compared to an uncalibrated version of the swat model the performance is highly improved and in about half of the sub basins a satisfactory nse performance could be obtained however the resulting streamflow simulations at 3 out of the 4 gauges do not meet the required statistical criteria for a satisfactory swat model performance according to literature values secondly available observed streamflow data from 4 sub basins allowed us to calibrate validate the swat model in a gauged catchment setting q proc and to assess the quality of the model calibration validation for the ungauged situation aet proc when only satellite aet data are available the streamflow simulations for the aet proc method showed a much lower performance when compared to the q proc method for one of the four sub basins the nse value for streamflow from aet proc is below zero indicating that even the mean value of the streamflow observations is a better estimator than the calibrated swat model however in the aet proc method when aet is simulated by the swat model that is calibrated using satellite aet the model performance for streamflow is reduced whereby the nse values for the four sub basins drop from 0 55 0 84 0 72 0 79 case with q proc to 0 45 0 27 0 66 0 87 with aet proc respectively this study illustrates some challenges of the swat model to simulate streamflow well when it is calibrated with the satellite aet product from gleam the poor streamflow simulation performance could be due to several reasons for example poor spatial representation of rainfall over subbasins and due to the swat model structural limitations concerning the runoff generation and evapotranspiration processes we show common swat model parameters that are sensitive both to discharge and to the aet processes these parameters need to satisfy both processes which sometimes have competing interests the data quality of the aet product could also be a reason i e due to aggregating daily to monthly values and due to the weighted average of the gleam pixel values extended to the sub basin level further reasons could be that the available data sets for precipitation and runoff are prone to significant errors and biases or due to the resolution of the input data e g the soil map layer due to the limited streamflow data available in many african catchments with no anticipated increase in streamflow monitoring stations becoming available in the near future it is important to develop a hydrological model calibration method that does not rely on in situ observed streamflow the results from this research contribute to a better understanding of the capabilities and limitations of using satellite based aet in calibration validating swat for both aet and streamflow simulation in a west african catchment since soil moisture plays a key role in the processes of aet overland flow groundwater replenishment and repartition of the mass and energy fluxes e g modulating evapotranspiration between land surface and the atmosphere including the streamflow improving the soil moisture parametrisation should be considered in future work future work

the qilian mountains on the northeastern margin of the qinghai tibetan plateau flows through yumen city and guazhou county and finally injects into haranor lake 30 km southwest to dunhuang city this is the second largest inland river basin in the hexi corridor northwestern china snow frozen ground and glaciers have influenced the mountain river runoff the annual average temperature ranges between 6 9 c and 8 8 c and precipitation varies from 47 mm to 63 mm the annual average mean pan evaporation is between 2897 and 3042 mm http slt gansu gov cn slhglj lygk lygk s 201611 t20161111 93070 html therefore the srb is controlled by a standard continental drought climate fig 1 many works in relation to agriculture industry ecology and hydroelectric water use is undertaken in the srb which are important for the region s socioeconomic sustainable development about 315 200 permanent residents lived in this region in 2017 which has an urbanization rate of 38 50 and an annual gross domestic product gdp of 20 billion cny liu 2018 the ratio of the three industries primary secondary and tertiary is 9 27 52 43 38 48 affected by large scale population migration the basin urbanization rate has followed a trend from its previous regression to a slow increase in the past two decades the proportion of the primary industry has been shrinking continuously the secondary industry has been growing slowly and the tertiary industry has been increasing rapidly 3 settings and methods 3 1 available freshwater resources generally freshwater resources refer to the surface and groundwater resources that are directly utilized in arid and semi arid areas precipitation provides little recharge to groundwater and therefore sustainable exploitation of groundwater is limited as a type of reserve resource a large amount of groundwater withdrawal in a long term scale in the arid areas means that regional water resources have reached an unsustainable scale or are close to an unsustainable stage liu and zhao 2015 because extraction of groundwater is limited in the srb we did not consider it to be an available freshwater resource in this study most of basin surface water comes from upstream mountainous areas although water resources still play an important role in maintaining local natural vegetation the annual evaporation level is more than 30 times that of the annual precipitation in the mid downstream resulting in a limited amount of surface water in the srb therefore water resources generated in the mid downstream also were not included in the amount of available water resources in this study in particular to maintain the sustainability of basin natural ecosystem and human development declaration 2007 we also deducted the efr from the surface water resources 3 2 runoff simulation an updated variable infiltration capacity cas vic cas hydrological model coupled with glacier module has been applied successfully to the srb zhao et al 2015 zhang et al 2019 input parameters and model data include the following meteorological data of 12 national meteorological stations in and around the upstream of the srb soil data global soil data task group 2000 digital elevation model data http asterweb jpl nasa gov gdem asp the monthly river runoff data at changma hydrological station between 1971 and 2013 1 km global surface coverage data products hansen et al 1998 glaciers distribution data from the chinese glacier inventory zhang et al 2012 the second chinese glacier inventory guo et al 2015 and the downscaling scheme of data outputs from four cmip5 gcms under the representative concentration pathway 2 6 table 1 we used the nash sutcliffe efficiency coefficient nse square of the correlation coefficient r2 mean relative error mre mean monthly absolute error mmae mean annual absolute error maae and mean absolute error for june july and august sub mae to evaluate the simulation efficiency of the vic cas model the results showed that the simulations had good efficiency with a high nse above 0 8 a high r2 above 0 85 a low mre less than 0 3 and a low mmae less than 9 20 m3 s zhang et al 2019 under the scenarios of rcp2 6 and 4 5 the interannual variation trend of total runoff from 2014 to 2099 was consistent the actual value was before 2014 with little difference in the variation range thus in this study we selected only the scenario of rcp2 6 to simulate runoff of surface water resources the runoff data used in this study came from simulation results of the vic cas model and the water resources bulletin issued by the gansu provincial department of water resources the population economic and agricultural data came from the 2000 to 2018 gansu development yearbook in the context of global warming increasing precipitation and glacial meltwater in the upper reaches of the srb have led to an upward trend in the total upstream surface runoff during the period from 2000 to 2010 the average annual runoff was about 1 04 109 m3 including an average annual glacial runoff of about 2 64 108 m3 the glacier runoff reached its peak in 2010 and then gradually decreased thereafter forecasts for 2020 2030 have indicated that compared with 2000 2010 the average runoff will increase by 22 80 whereas the average glacial runoff will decrease by 11 zhang et al 2019 3 3 environmental flow requirement although there are more than 200 efr methods at present tharme 2003 their theories can be grouped into the following four categories hydrological methods hydraulic methods habitat simulation methods and holistic methods pastor et al 2014 considering the availability of local data we selected hydrological methods to calculate the efr of the srb these methods usually are based on annual minimum ﬂow thresholds such as 7q10 in which the lowest ﬂow that occurs for seven consecutive days once in 10 years telis and district 1992 or q90 in which the ﬂow exceeds 90 of the period of record ngprp 1974 pastor et al 2014 pastor et al 2014 described the specific steps of the hydrological method to estimate efr during the period from 2000 to 2010 the average annual basin ecological baseflow was 4 20 108 m3 accounting for 40 60 of the average annual surface runoff during the period from 2020 to 2030 baseflow is expected to decrease to 3 84 108 m3 accounting for 30 2 of the annual average surface runoff affected by the reduction in glacial runoff the basin ecological baseflow has followed a downward trend 3 4 water withdrawal quantity there are many ways to calculate the water withdrawal quantity wwq restricted by the availability of data we used the socioeconomic indicators e g population gdp farmland area multiplied by indicators of average water demand i e the water demand by each resident for life for irrigation per hectare of farmland and for every 10 000 cny of industrial gdp generated in this study we obtained the data from the gansu water resources bulletin http slt gansu gov cn xxgk gknb to estimate the wwq in which primary industry water demand pwd between 2011 and 2015 was provided by the local water department to verify the estimations appendix table a1 we calculated the relative deviation between the simulated value and actual value to evaluate whether the results of water withdrawal calculation were reasonable referring to the relevant literature moriasi et al 2007 if the relative deviation was within 10 the calculation results were reasonable we calculated this deviation as follows 1 p b i a s i 1 n y i s i m y i o b s 100 i 1 n y i o b s where pbias represents the relative deviation y i o b s represents the observed value and y i s i m represents the simulated value 3 5 level of water stress in this study we used lws to measure the exploitation extent of regional water resource and the level reflection of regional water resource carrying capacity and overload the formula to calculate lws is as follows 2 l w s d s where s represents freshwater resources and d is freshwater withdrawal lws is defined by following categories 10 refers to low stress 10 20 is low to medium stress 20 40 is medium to high stress 40 80 is high stress and 80 is extremely high stress in the current study the freshwater withdrawal mainly refers to the wwq and the available freshwater resources also should be deducted from the efr that maintains the stability of the natural ecosystem in addition based on the setting of the available freshwater resources given in section 3 1 the formula becomes 3 l w s d p r e 4 l w s g l a c i e r d p r r g l a c i e r e where dp is the wwq r represents the total runoff in the upstream of the srb e refers efr lwsglacier represents the lws when the total runoff does not include glacier runoff and rglacier is the glacier runoff 4 results 4 1 change in the level of water stress between 2000 and 2017 4 1 1 change in water withdrawal wwq involves many indicators of the water resource system considering the lack of data for some factors and standard differences we selected only the two main variables of the wwq and pwd for the validity test of calculated results in the srb from 2011 to 2015 appendix table a2 the relative deviations of the wwq and pwd reached 9 60 and 5 20 respectively lower than 10 which meant that the calculation results were reasonable wwq is composed of the pwd secondary industry water demand swd tertiary industry water demand twd turban and rural residents domestic water demand rwd and artificial ecosystem water demand aewd which followed the trend of previously increasing in value and then following a decreasing trend from 2000 to 2017 in 2010 the wwq reached its peak which was about 12 108 m3 after 2010 the wwq has been declining gradually with the gradual implement of the water resources utilization and ecological protection planning of dunhuang dunhuang planning in 2017 the wwq was about 8 21 108 m3 fig 2 the pwd had the largest proportion in the wwq with an annually average value of 87 8 between 2000 and 2017 in 2000 the pwd was 5 27 108 m3 accounting for 93 60 by 2017 the pwd had increased to 7 34 108 m3 but its proportion decreased to 89 40 within the primary industry the vast majority of the pwd is used for farmland irrigation causing the percentage to reach more than 96 50 the increase in the pwd and even in wwq was due to the continuous expansion of farmland area which has resulted in increased irrigation demand the swd has shown a downward trend since 2004 from 0 83 108 m3 in 2004 to 0 66 108 m3 in 2017 mainly because of improvements in its water use efficiency because the tertiary industry is developing rapidly the twd has increased from 0 02 108 m3 in 2000 to 0 06 108 m3 in 2017 and the rwd has decrease from 0 09 108 m3 in 2000 to 0 06 108 m3 in 2017 because of the decline in average water demand the expansion of farmland area has led to an increases in the shelterbelt area and urban green spaces ma et al 2019 together these two factors contributed to an increase in the aewd except for the pwd other categories of water demand accounted for only a small proportion in the future the improvement of efficiency of irrigation and efficient water saving measures for agriculture will be key measures to reduce the lws and ensure sustainable development of the basin 4 1 2 changes in the level of water stress the results showed that the lws was continuous and is expected to remain at a very high level between 0 68 and 1 66 from 2000 to 2030 from 2005 to 2014 water resources were under lower pressure after 2005 the lws was more than 1 0 which meant that the wwq had exceeded the available freshwater resources and the socioeconomic system had occupied the efr and downstream water demand from 2015 to 2020 basin water resource generally was in a balanced state between supply and demand if the glacier runoff was deducted from the available freshwater resources the lws would be much higher than 1 0 between 2000 and 2015 and in individual drought years would be even higher than 3 0 which could cause serious threats to natural ecological and socioeconomic systems in downstream areas fig 3 4 2 changes in the level of water stress between 2018 and 2030 4 2 1 change in water withdrawal to calculate the carrying capacity of basin water resources under the current trends of socioeconomic development and water utilization between 2018 and 2030 we assumed that the main socioeconomic indicators and water demand would continue to follow the current change trends over the next 13 years during which time the change rates of the main and unit indicators of socioeconomic development and its water demand in the future would be set appendix table a3 according to current change trends the wwq and pwd would increase from 8 39 108 m3 and 7 52 108 m3 in 2018 to 12 01 108 m3 and 10 99 108 m3 in 2030 following an obvious increasing trend the proportion of the pwd remained the largest in the wwq and was expected to increase from 89 70 in 2018 to 91 5 in 2030 in the meantime the pwd and wwq would continue to increase because of the continuous expansion of the farmland area leading to an increase in irrigation water demand and the aewd as it followed the increased values from 0 10 108 m3 in 2018 to 0 16 108 m3 in 2030 the swd is expected to follow a slowly decrease trend from 0 64 108 m3 in 2018 to 0 56 108 m3 in 2030 rapid development of the tertiary industry and increased population will drive the twd and rwd gradually to increase from 0 07 108 m3 and 0 06 108 m3 in 2018 to 0 23 108 m3 and 0 07 108 m3 in 2030 fig 4 during the period from 2018 to 2030 the wwq and pwd will increase from an average of 8 15 108 m3 a to 9 96 108 m3 a and 7 15 108 m3 a to 9 06 108 m3 a respectively compared with the period from 2000 to 2017 in the same period the swd rwd and aewd will reduce from an average of 0 64 108 m3 a to 0 58 108 m3 a from 0 15 108 m3 a to 0 06 108 m3 a and from 0 19 108 m3 a to 0 12 108 m3 a respectively during the period from 2018 to 2030 the twd will increase from an average of 0 03 108 m3 a to 0 14 108 m3 a fig 4 4 2 2 changes in the level of water stress if basin wwq changes continue to follow current trends in the future the wwq will be larger than that of available freshwater resources from 2018 to 2030 which still had a very high lws after 2017 the increased rate of precipitation was far less than that in the wwq thus the crisis of water shortage will continue to be serious and the lws will follow an increasing trend from 0 93 between 2000 and 2017 to 1 74 between 2018 and 2030 if we subtracted the glacier runoff from available freshwater resources the future lws would increase by an average value of 0 44 per year keeping a larger rate of increase compared with that from 2000 to 2017 the annual average basin lws from 2018 to 2030 will decrease from 1 20 to 1 16 if the available freshwater resources include the glacier runoff the annual average lws will decrease from 2 06 to 1 60 during the period between 2000 and 2030 glacier runoff will continue to reduce the lws by an average of 0 71 per year fig 3 if the proportion of glacier runoff in the total runoff continues to decrease from 22 between 2000 and 2017 to 18 between 2018 and 2030 the inhibitory effect of glacier runoff on the lws will significantly decrease which will exacerbate the future water shortage crisis regardless of whether glacier runoff exists it will be difficult for the srb to achieve water supply and demand balance target of sdg 6 4 2 by 2030 5 conclusion during the observed and predicted period between 2000 and 2030 the runoff of the srb followed an overall increasing trend from 2000 to 2010 the annual average runoff was 10 90 108 m3 and is predicted to increase by 22 80 from 2020 to 2030 the average contribution of glacier meltwater to the total srb runoff may decrease from the current 23 to 15 by 2030 rcp 2 6 from 2015 to 2020 the supply of freshwater resources remained close to the level of demand between 2020 and 2030 the lws will increase and the existence of glacial meltwater will continue to reduce the water stress of the srb by an average of 0 71 glacial runoff is important means to relieve water stress and is conducive to the sustainable development of the socioeconomic systems in global glacier covered arid areas glacial meltwater runoff is predicted to decrease continuously in the srb in the future and runoff regulation and relief of the water stress function of glaciers will decrease significantly higher consumption of agricultural irrigation and lower water use efficiency are the main factors causing lws in the basin in the future strict control over arable land expansion higher use efficiency of irrigation water and developing efficient water saving agriculture are key measures to reduce freshwater withdrawal and to maintain the sustainable use of water resources in global glacier covered arid areas chen et al 2020 by 2030 if the current cultivated area of srb remains unchanged the irrigation water consumption will be controlled within 0 63 m3 m2 the water use efficiency will be improved to about 0 63 high confidence and the water consumption per 10 000 cny industrial added value will be reduced from the current 88 5 m3 104 cny to 55 m3 104 cny the lws will be reduced to about 0 8 high confidence the pressure on water resources will be greatly eased and the utilization of water resources will be reasonable and sustainable 6 discussion the pwd most notably of the irrigation water demand has always occupied a high proportion whereas the proportion of output value of the primary industry has been much lower in 2017 the actual irrigation water demand per hectare of basin farmland was 1 6 times higher than the specified irrigation water demand in the hexi corridor area in the gansu province industrial water standard 2017 version the reduced high efficiency water saving irrigation area is the major reason why the pwd has remained at a high level for a long time in 2018 among the 193 56 million hectares of farmland in jiuquan including the danghe river basin the midstream and downstream region of the srb and part of the downstream region of heihe river basin only 48 200 ha of farmland have implemented water saving irrigation facilities such as spray drip irrigation micro irrigation and low pressure pipe irrigation the facilities with low pressure pipe irrigation have accounted for the vast majority of water savings and other farmlands still use flood irrigation accordingly the ability to efficiently apply basin irrigation water has remained quite low in fact these problems are common in other developing countries and arid regions of the world where the rural economy is heavily dependent on agriculture abbaspour et al 2009 song and pijanowski 2014 samian et al 2015 fao 2016 song and deng 2017 liu et al 2017 song et al 2018 lang et al 2018 lang and song 2018 the ability to reduce the pwd will provide a direct means to decrease the wwq and to maintain the sustainable use of water resources in arid areas specific measures include encouraging farmers to plant fruits economic crops and drought tolerant crops implementing fallow rotation systems of farmland building high standard basic farmland promoting concentrated farming and management allocating or optimizing water resources according to the farmer s crop types improving irrigation water efficiency and strictly controlling the expansion of farmland area the top priority should be to restrain the expansion of farmland area the development of nonagricultural industries especially the high efficiency clean energy industry not only can drive the employment of the remaining agricultural population but also can use the output value to feed agricultural development this in turn would promote and coordinate sustainable development among the population water resources and the economy on a basin scale against the background of global warming in half of the global glacier watersheds glacier runoff is about to reach or has reached its peak this runoff will follow a decreasing trend for a long period of time in the future huss and hock 2018 which will seriously threaten the survival and development of the residents and will expose them to a severe water shortage crisis in the ggaas the results of this study suggest that the lws can be reduced by controlling the wwq the ggaas need to take various effective measures as soon as possible including the construction of water conservancy facilities the promotion of water saving knowledge the promotion of industrial transformation and upgrading and the development of efficient water saving agriculture

based on the united nations sustainable development goals sdgs indicator 6 4 2 level of water stress lws new hydrological insights for the region during the period between 2000 and 2030 the runoff of the srb was predicted to follow an overall increasing trend from 2000 to 2020 the annual average runoff in the upper reaches of the srb was 10 9 108 m3 and then from 2021 to 2030 it increased by 22 8 according this trend the average contribution of glacier meltwater to the total basin runoff is expected to decrease from the current 23 to 15 by 2030 representative concentration pathway 2 6 rcp 2 6 the supply of fresh water resources has been close to the level of demand since 2015 and the lws may increase between 2021 and 2030 the existence of glacial meltwater is expected to result in the

ggaas therefore it is necessary to correct the lws assessment method to this scale to propose adaptive measures for basin sustainable water resource use we selected the shule river basin srb as a representative area of the ggaas wang et al 2019a b xu et al 2019 zhang et al 2019 we estimated and assessed the water withdrawal quantity and lws to consider the environmental flows requirement efr in the srb from 2000 to 2030 this research was based on the simulation data of total and glacier runoff in the upstream of the srb during this period between 2000 and 2030 zhang et al 2019 and on the data from the yearbook and government bulletin for 2000 to 2017 the purpose of the study is to improve the present sdg 6 4 2 assessment method and to quantitatively and accurately assess the impact of glacier runoff on the sustainability of the ggaas providing reference and support for achievement of sdg 6 4 2 in the ggaas 2 study area the shule river originates from the ganggeexiaoheli glacier in the qilian mountains on the northeastern margin of the qinghai tibetan plateau flows through yumen city and guazhou county and finally injects into haranor lake 30 km southwest to dunhuang city this is the second largest inland river basin in the hexi corridor northwestern china snow frozen ground and glaciers have influenced the mountain river runoff the annual average temperature ranges between 6 9 c and 8 8 c and precipitation varies from 47 mm to 63 mm the annual average mean pan evaporation is between 2897 and 3042 mm http slt gansu gov cn slhglj lygk lygk s 201611 t20161111 93070 html therefore the srb is controlled by a standard continental drought climate fig 1 many works in relation to agriculture industry ecology and hydroelectric water use is undertaken in the srb which are important for the region s socioeconomic sustainable development about 315 200 permanent residents lived in this region in 2017 which has an urbanization rate of 38 50 and an annual gross domestic product gdp of 20 billion cny liu 2018 the ratio of the three industries primary secondary and tertiary is 9 27 52 43 38 48 affected by large scale population migration the basin urbanization rate has followed a trend from its previous regression to a slow increase in the past two decades the proportion of the primary industry has been shrinking continuously the secondary industry has been growing slowly and the tertiary industry has been increasing rapidly 3 settings and methods 3 1 available freshwater resources generally freshwater resources refer to the surface and groundwater resources that are directly utilized in arid and semi arid areas precipitation provides little recharge to groundwater and therefore sustainable exploitation of groundwater is limited as a type of reserve resource a large amount of groundwater withdrawal in a long term scale in the arid areas means that regional water resources have reached an unsustainable scale or are close to an unsustainable stage liu and zhao 2015 because extraction of groundwater is limited in the srb we did not consider it to be an available freshwater resource in this study most of basin surface water comes from upstream mountainous areas although water resources still play an important role in maintaining local natural vegetation the annual evaporation level is more than 30 times that of the annual precipitation in the mid downstream resulting in a limited amount of surface water in the srb therefore water resources generated in the mid downstream also were not included in the amount of available water resources in this study in particular to maintain the sustainability of basin natural ecosystem and human development declaration 2007 we also deducted the efr from the surface water resources 3 2 runoff simulation an updated variable infiltration capacity cas vic cas hydrological model coupled with glacier module has been applied successfully to the srb zhao et al 2015 zhang et al 2019 input parameters and model data include the following meteorological data of 12 national meteorological stations in and around the upstream of the srb soil data global soil data task group 2000 digital elevation model data http asterweb jpl nasa gov gdem asp the monthly river runoff data at changma hydrological station between 1971 and 2013 1 km global surface coverage data products hansen et al 1998 glaciers distribution data from the chinese glacier inventory zhang et al 2012 the second chinese glacier inventory guo et al 2015 and the downscaling scheme of data outputs from four cmip5 gcms under the representative concentration pathway 2 6 table 1 we used the nash sutcliffe efficiency coefficient nse square of the correlation coefficient r2 mean relative error mre mean monthly absolute error mmae mean annual absolute error maae and mean absolute error for june july and august sub mae to evaluate the simulation efficiency of the vic cas model the results showed that the simulations had good efficiency with a high nse above 0 8 a high r2 above 0 85 a low mre less than 0 3 and a low mmae less than 9 20 m3 s zhang et al 2019 under the scenarios of rcp2 6 and 4 5 the interannual variation trend of total runoff from 2014 to 2099 was consistent the actual value was before 2014 with little difference in the variation range thus in this study we selected only the scenario of rcp2 6 to simulate runoff of surface water resources the runoff data used in this study came from simulation results of the vic cas model and the water resources bulletin issued by the gansu provincial department of water resources the population economic and agricultural data came from the 2000 to 2018 gansu development yearbook in the context of global warming increasing precipitation and glacial meltwater in the upper reaches of the srb have led to an upward trend in the total upstream surface runoff during the period from 2000 to 2010 the average annual runoff was about 1 04 109 m3 including an average annual glacial runoff of about 2 64 108 m3 the glacier runoff reached its peak in 2010 and then gradually decreased thereafter forecasts for 2020 2030 have indicated that compared with 2000 2010 the average runoff will increase by 22 80 whereas the average glacial runoff will decrease by 11 zhang et al 2019 3 3 environmental flow requirement although there are more than 200 efr methods at present tharme 2003 their theories can be grouped into the following four categories hydrological methods hydraulic methods habitat simulation methods and holistic methods pastor et al 2014 considering the availability of local data we selected hydrological methods to calculate the efr of the srb these methods usually are based on annual minimum ﬂow thresholds such as 7q10 in which the lowest ﬂow that occurs for seven consecutive days once in 10 years telis and district 1992 or q90 in which the ﬂow exceeds 90 of the period of record ngprp 1974 pastor et al 2014 pastor et al 2014 described the specific steps of the hydrological method to estimate efr during the period from 2000 to 2010 the average annual basin ecological baseflow was 4 20 108 m3 accounting for 40 60 of the average annual surface runoff during the period from 2020 to 2030 baseflow is expected to decrease to 3 84 108 m3 accounting for 30 2 of the annual average surface runoff affected by the reduction in glacial runoff the basin ecological baseflow has followed a downward trend 3 4 water withdrawal quantity there are many ways to calculate the water withdrawal quantity wwq restricted by the availability of data we used the socioeconomic indicators e g population gdp farmland area multiplied by indicators of average water demand i e the water demand by each resident for life for irrigation per hectare of farmland and for every 10 000 cny of industrial gdp generated in this study we obtained the data from the gansu water resources bulletin http slt gansu gov cn xxgk gknb to estimate the wwq in which primary industry water demand pwd between 2011 and 2015 was provided by the local water department to verify the estimations appendix table a1 we calculated the relative deviation between the simulated value and actual value to evaluate whether the results of water withdrawal calculation were reasonable referring to the relevant literature moriasi et al 2007 if the relative deviation was within 10 the calculation results were reasonable we calculated this deviation as follows 1 p b i a s i 1 n y i s i m y i o b s 100 i 1 n y i o b s where pbias represents the relative deviation y i o b s represents the observed value and y i s i m represents the simulated value 3 5 level of water stress in this study we used lws to measure the exploitation extent of regional water resource and the level reflection of regional water resource carrying capacity and overload the formula to calculate lws is as follows 2 l w s d s where s represents freshwater resources and d is freshwater withdrawal lws is defined by following categories 10 refers to low stress 10 20 is low to medium stress 20 40 is medium to high stress 40 80 is high stress and 80 is extremely high stress in the current study the freshwater withdrawal mainly refers to the wwq and the available freshwater resources also should be deducted from the efr that maintains the stability of the natural ecosystem in addition based on the setting of the available freshwater resources given in section 3 1 the formula becomes 3 l w s d p r e 4 l w s g l a c i e r d p r r g l a c i e r e where dp is the wwq r represents the total runoff in the upstream of the srb e refers efr lwsglacier represents the lws when the total runoff does not include glacier runoff and rglacier is the glacier runoff 4 results 4 1 change in the level of water stress between 2000 and 2017 4 1 1 change in water withdrawal wwq involves many indicators of the water resource system considering the lack of data for some factors and standard differences we selected only the two main variables of the wwq and pwd for the validity test of calculated results in the srb from 2011 to 2015 appendix table a2 the relative deviations of the wwq and pwd reached 9 60 and 5 20 respectively lower than 10 which meant that the calculation results were reasonable wwq is composed of the pwd secondary industry water demand swd tertiary industry water demand twd turban and rural residents domestic water demand rwd and artificial ecosystem water demand aewd which followed the trend of previously increasing in value and then following a decreasing trend from 2000 to 2017 in 2010 the wwq reached its peak which was about 12 108 m3 after 2010 the wwq has been declining gradually with the gradual implement of the water resources utilization and ecological protection planning of dunhuang dunhuang planning in 2017 the wwq was about 8 21 108 m3 fig 2 the pwd had the largest proportion in the wwq with an annually average value of 87 8 between 2000 and 2017 in 2000 the pwd was 5 27 108 m3 accounting for 93 60 by 2017 the pwd had increased to 7 34 108 m3 but its proportion decreased to 89 40 within the primary industry the vast majority of the pwd is used for farmland irrigation causing the percentage to reach more than 96 50 the increase in the pwd and even in wwq was due to the continuous expansion of farmland area which has resulted in increased irrigation demand the swd has shown a downward trend since 2004 from 0 83 108 m3 in 2004 to 0 66 108 m3 in 2017 mainly because of improvements in its water use efficiency because the tertiary industry is developing rapidly the twd has increased from 0 02 108 m3 in 2000 to 0 06 108 m3 in 2017 and the rwd has decrease from 0 09 108 m3 in 2000 to 0 06 108 m3 in 2017 because of the decline in average water demand the expansion of farmland area has led to an increases in the shelterbelt area and urban green spaces ma et al 2019 together these two factors contributed to an increase in the aewd except for the pwd other categories of water demand accounted for only a small proportion in the future the improvement of efficiency of irrigation and efficient water saving measures for agriculture will be key measures to reduce the lws and ensure sustainable development of the basin 4 1 2 changes in the level of water stress the results showed that the lws was continuous and is expected to remain at a very high level between 0 68 and 1 66 from 2000 to 2030 from 2005 to 2014 water resources were under lower pressure after 2005 the lws was more than 1 0 which meant that the wwq had exceeded the available freshwater resources and the socioeconomic system had occupied the efr and downstream water demand from 2015 to 2020 basin water resource generally was in a balanced state between supply and demand if the glacier runoff was deducted from the available freshwater resources the lws would be much higher than 1 0 between 2000 and 2015 and in individual drought years would be even higher than 3 0 which could cause serious threats to natural ecological and socioeconomic systems in downstream areas fig 3 4 2 changes in the level of water stress between 2018 and 2030 4 2 1 change in water withdrawal to calculate the carrying capacity of basin water resources under the current trends of socioeconomic development and water utilization between 2018 and 2030 we assumed that the main socioeconomic indicators and water demand would continue to follow the current change trends over the next 13 years during which time the change rates of the main and unit indicators of socioeconomic development and its water demand in the future would be set appendix table a3 according to current change trends the wwq and pwd would increase from 8 39 108 m3 and 7 52 108 m3 in 2018 to 12 01 108 m3 and 10 99 108 m3 in 2030 following an obvious increasing trend the proportion of the pwd remained the largest in the wwq and was expected to increase from 89 70 in 2018 to 91 5 in 2030 in the meantime the pwd and wwq would continue to increase because of the continuous expansion of the farmland area leading to an increase in irrigation water demand and the aewd as it followed the increased values from 0 10 108 m3 in 2018 to 0 16 108 m3 in 2030 the swd is expected to follow a slowly decrease trend from 0 64 108 m3 in 2018 to 0 56 108 m3 in 2030 rapid development of the tertiary industry and increased population will drive the twd and rwd gradually to increase from 0 07 108 m3 and 0 06 108 m3 in 2018 to 0 23 108 m3 and 0 07 108 m3 in 2030 fig 4 during the period from 2018 to 2030 the wwq and pwd will increase from an average of 8 15 108 m3 a to 9 96 108 m3 a and 7 15 108 m3 a to 9 06 108 m3 a respectively compared with the period from 2000 to 2017 in the same period the swd rwd and aewd will reduce from an average of 0 64 108 m3 a to 0 58 108 m3 a from 0 15 108 m3 a to 0 06 108 m3 a and from 0 19 108 m3 a to 0 12 108 m3 a respectively during the period from 2018 to 2030 the twd will increase from an average of 0 03 108 m3 a to 0 14 108 m3 a fig 4 4 2 2 changes in the level of water stress if basin wwq changes continue to follow current trends in the future the wwq will be larger than that of available freshwater resources from 2018 to 2030 which still had a very high lws after 2017 the increased rate of precipitation was far less than that in the wwq thus the crisis of water shortage will continue to be serious and the lws will follow an increasing trend from 0 93 between 2000 and 2017 to 1 74 between 2018 and 2030 if we subtracted the glacier runoff from available freshwater resources the future lws would increase by an average value of 0 44 per year keeping a larger rate of increase compared with that from 2000 to 2017 the annual average basin lws from 2018 to 2030 will decrease from 1 20 to 1 16 if the available freshwater resources include the glacier runoff the annual average lws will decrease from 2 06 to 1 60 during the period between 2000 and 2030 glacier runoff will continue to reduce the lws by an average of 0 71 per year fig 3 if the proportion of glacier runoff in the total runoff continues to decrease from 22 between 2000 and 2017 to 18 between 2018 and 2030 the inhibitory effect of glacier runoff on the lws will significantly decrease which will exacerbate the future water shortage crisis regardless of whether glacier runoff exists it will be difficult for the srb to achieve water supply and demand balance target of sdg 6 4 2 by 2030 5 conclusion during the observed and predicted period between 2000 and 2030 the runoff of the srb followed an overall increasing trend from 2000 to 2010 the annual average runoff was 10 90 108 m3 and is predicted to increase by 22 80 from 2020 to 2030 the average contribution of glacier meltwater to the total srb runoff may decrease from the current 23 to 15 by 2030 rcp 2 6 from 2015 to 2020 the supply of freshwater resources remained close to the level of demand between 2020 and 2030 the lws will increase and the existence of glacial meltwater will continue to reduce the water stress of the srb by an average of 0 71 glacial runoff is important means to relieve water stress and is conducive to the sustainable development of the socioeconomic systems in global glacier covered arid areas glacial meltwater runoff is predicted to decrease continuously in the srb in the future and runoff regulation and relief of the water stress function of glaciers will decrease significantly higher consumption of agricultural irrigation and lower water use efficiency are the main factors causing lws in the basin in the future strict control over arable land expansion higher use efficiency of irrigation water and developing efficient water saving agriculture are key measures to reduce freshwater withdrawal and to maintain the sustainable use of water resources in global glacier covered arid areas chen et al 2020 by 2030 if the current cultivated area of srb remains unchanged the irrigation water consumption will be controlled within 0 63 m3 m2 the water use efficiency will be improved to about 0 63 high confidence and the water consumption per 10 000 cny industrial added value will be reduced from the current 88 5 m3 104 cny to 55 m3 104 cny the lws will be reduced to about 0 8 high confidence the pressure on water resources will be greatly eased and the utilization of water resources will be reasonable and sustainable 6 discussion the pwd most notably of the irrigation water demand has always occupied a high proportion whereas the proportion of output value of the primary industry has been much lower in 2017 the actual irrigation water demand per hectare of basin farmland was 1 6 times higher than the specified irrigation water demand in the hexi corridor area in the gansu province industrial water standard 2017 version the reduced high efficiency water saving irrigation area is the major reason why the pwd has remained at a high level for a long time in 2018 among the 193 56 million hectares of farmland in jiuquan including the danghe river basin the midstream and downstream region of the srb and part of the downstream region of heihe river basin only 48 200 ha of farmland have implemented water saving irrigation facilities such as spray drip irrigation micro irrigation and low pressure pipe irrigation the facilities with low pressure pipe irrigation have accounted for the vast majority of water savings and other farmlands still use flood irrigation accordingly the ability to efficiently apply basin irrigation water has remained quite low in fact these problems are common in other developing countries and arid regions of the world where the rural economy is heavily dependent on agriculture abbaspour et al 2009 song and pijanowski 2014 samian et al 2015 fao 2016 song and deng 2017 liu et al 2017 song et al 2018 lang et al 2018 lang and song 2018 the ability to reduce the pwd will provide a direct means to decrease the wwq and to maintain the sustainable use of water resources in arid areas specific measures include encouraging farmers to plant fruits economic crops and drought tolerant crops implementing fallow rotation systems of farmland building high standard basic farmland promoting concentrated farming and management allocating or optimizing water resources according to the farmer s crop types improving irrigation water efficiency and strictly controlling the expansion of farmland area the top priority should be to restrain the expansion of farmland area the development of nonagricultural industries especially the high efficiency clean energy industry not only can drive the employment of the remaining agricultural population but also can use the output value to feed agricultural development this in turn would promote and coordinate sustainable development among the population water resources and the economy on a basin scale against the background of global warming in half of the global glacier watersheds glacier runoff is about to reach or has reached its peak this runoff will follow a decreasing trend for a long period of time in the future huss and hock 2018 which will seriously threaten the survival and development of the residents and will expose them to a severe water

8142,extreme hydrological events have been reported to be on an increase in terms of magnitude and frequency in southern africa groundwater in this area plays a significant role in domestic water supply and agriculture the aim of this study is to evaluate the relationship between groundwater levels and hydrological extremes in north eastern south africa an index based approach was used to determine the drought and flood events over the study period while the water table fluctuation approach was used to determine groundwater recharge flow duration curves were further employed to determine the exceedance period of high and low flows in the study area mann kendall and sequential mann kendall were used to detect trends and the point of change both floods and drought were found to have occurred in the study area at different magnitudes however both the standardized precipitation index spi and standardized streamflow index ssi found that majority of these were not categorized as mild to near normal conditions specific yield determined using the simple linear regression method ranged between 0 04 and 0 06 groundwater recharge estimates ranged between 1 1 and 11 5 of mean annual rainfall ranging between 167 1000 mm a about 60 of the stations i e rainfall streamflow and groundwater show significantly decreasing trend this therefore indicates that there is a decreasing trend in groundwater levels streamflow and rainfall over the study area based on the trend analysis findings it suggests that extreme events in the catchment influences groundwater resources keywords drought floods groundwater rainfall sequential mann kendall streamflow trends water table fluctuation 1 introduction groundwater plays a critical role in maintaining ecosystem services and supporting communities adaptation to climate change taylor et al 2012 almost 30 of global freshwater is groundwater one third of which serves as the source of all freshwater withdrawals shiklomanov 1993 globally taylor et al 2012 reported that groundwater supplies 36 for domestic use 42 for agricultural use and 27 for industrial use in the present study groundwater recharge was estimated for the luvuvhu river catchment lrc and the relationship between groundwater levels and hydrological extremes were analysed knowledge of groundwater and hydrological extremes relationship is of great significance in the region as this helps in better management of water resources the present study realised the importance of looking at how groundwater responds to hydrological extremes in lrc groundwater remains the sole source of domestic water supply for many rural communities many of which are in semi arid and arid environments riemann et al 2012 taylor et al 2012 for instance in south africa groundwater is widely used by millions of people for domestic water use grip limpopo 2002 odiyo and makungo 2012 roughly 75 of the population in limpopo province depends on groundwater resources and it accounts for about 70 of domestic water supply for rural communities in the province botha and van rooyen 2001 du toit et al 2012 semi arid regions are characterised by low rainfall averages thereby making groundwater resources important and valuable compared to humid regions due to its resilience to drought groundwater plays a significant role as one of the first response strategies for water supply during prolonged dry conditions dws 2010 however temperatures were reported to have increased by 1 c over limpopo river basin in recent years phophi et al 2020 and gbetibuou 2009 dwa 2010 observed significant declining trends of groundwater levels following prolonged dry periods water resource auditing suggests that groundwater is a feasible and cost effective source of supply to meet future water demand in limpopo river basin lrb busari 2007 however climate change might have considerable impacts on groundwater resources with changes in rainfall patterns likely to affect the rate of aquifer recharge furthermore due to climate change induced temperature increases odiyo et al 2019 indicated that droughts and floods have also become most common in south africa thus given the potential impacts on water resources emanating from climate anomalies and the increasing magnitude and frequency of hydrological extremes studies that aim to quantify groundwater recharge have become of significance these extreme events have the potential to cause harm and threaten communities livelihoods kundzewickz and matczak 2015 furthermore atta darkwa et al 2013 highlighted the impacts of hydrological extreme on groundwater as one aspect to consider in managing groundwater resources kolusu et al 2019 highlighted the need to understand patterns of climate variability both temporally and spatially that inﬂuence groundwater resources hydrological extremes are characterised by hydroclimatic data and can be determined by analysing such data to determine long term climate anomalies climate trends and patterns hence climatic trend studies have been conducted using different techniques i e linear regression mann kendall trend test pettit change point test and correlation analysis tao et al 2018 pei et al 2017 odiyo et al 2015 nenwiini and kabanda 2013 tao et al 2018 investigated spatial and temporal variations of precipitation extremes using the mann kendall trend test pettit change point test and correlation analysis in china and found that changes in precipitation extremes were closely related to changes in the total precipitation in most parts of the country between 1961 and 2013 studies on the impacts of climate change on groundwater variability have also been conducted previously such studies include fu et al 2019 who demonstrated the benefits of using statistical methods when investigating the climate and non climatic drivers responsible for the variations in groundwater in south east south australia based on 71 climatic metrics and 17 non climatic metrics the study found that 1 decline in rainfall was identified as a factor leading to groundwater recharge reduction 2 suggests that seasonal shift in rainfall can reduce groundwater recharge even when there is no change in annual rainfall and 3 a decrease in groundwater level due to declines in rainfall can lead to further declines in groundwater recharge impacts of hydrological extreme on groundwater have been reported by atta darkwa et al 2013 as one aspect to consider in managing groundwater resources even with knowledge of potential impacts of extreme events there are limited studies that have investigated their impacts on groundwater resources and consequently studies that aim at quantifying groundwater recharge have become of significance therefore the present study aims to investigate the relationship between hydrological extreme events and groundwater levels in the lrc in north eastern south africa this was achieved through a series of steps which included recharge estimation using wtf method index based extreme events assessment and trend analysis 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the luvuvhu river catchment lrc is situated in limpopo province in the north eastern part of south africa and it is a sub catchment of the lrb one of the major shared river basins in the region department of water affairs dwa 2014 odiyo et al 2019 vdm idp 2016 17 it covers an area of approximately 5 941 km2 and is located at 1 312 m above sea level between latitudes 22 17 33 57 s and 23 17 57 31 s and 29 49 46 16 e and 30 23 32 02 e fig 1 groundwater resources are of significance in this rural catchment as it is a major source of domestic water supply to the majority of the population and agricultural activities it has been reported that the catchment is an economic region with several major farms located within the levubu valley department of water affairs dwa 2014 odiyo et al 2019 according to odiyo et al 2015 the distribution of precipitation is highly variable with most of the precipitation received in the upper reaches of the catchment with the lower reaches around the kruger national park receiving the lowest rainfall in the entire catchment rainfall season is from october to april and the remaining months may to september are characterised by dry season conditions in the upper reach of the catchment rainfall exceeds 1 000 mm a and declines to less than 200 mm a in the east northeast direction with increased potential evaporation the mean annual rainfall is 608 mm for the entire catchment mathivha et al 2016 and the mean annual runoff is about 520 million m3 yr which yields to 11 4 mm year of annual rainfall odiyo et al 2019 reported spatial temporal variability in rainfall as one factor that increases the exposure of a community to hydrological extremes there have been several destructive floods and droughts reported in the lrc with extensive negative impacts on agriculture and rural communities odiyo et al 2019 mathivha et al 2016 singo et al 2012 2 2 geology and hydrogeology of the study area fig 2 a shows the simplified geological formation of the lrc sourced from the council of geoscience the catchment is mostly made up of the old basement rocks of the swazian age the goudplaats gneiss forms the base for other lithologies to be deposited such as biotite gneiss migmatite and re melted granite the soutpansberg group rocks dominate the mountainous middle reaches of the catchment and are mostly quarzitic rocks with extrusive basalt which gave rise to a mountainous wedge shaped terrain that extends from the kruger national park brand 1999 busari 2007 before the formation of the karoo rock group the soutpansberg group formed a flat featureless landscape and it occupies most of the lower reaches of the catchment while some of the karoo sediments occupy northern parts of the catchment department of water affairs dwa 2014 groundwater flow in fractured granite gneiss pegmatite and dolerite coupled with climate and physiography affect groundwater recharge together with groundwater surface water interactions vegter 2003 the occurrence physiography and climate are used to describe and classify the groundwater regions unit gru see fig 2 b department of water affairs dwa 2014 2 3 data and methods precipitation streamflow and groundwater level data were obtained for periods ranging between nine years and 30 years 1986 and 2016 the variation in data length is due to the unavailability of long term data for some hydro meteorological variables in the study area precipitation data were obtained from the south africa weather service saws while groundwater and streamflow data were obtained from the department of water and sanitation fig 3 shows the different stations where data was collected these stations were selected based on data availability table 1 shows the summary statistics of the datasets used in the study i e rainfall streamflow and groundwater mean monthly rainfall ranged between 64 and 85 mm mean monthly streamflow ranged between 2 09 and 26 45 m3 s while monthly groundwater levels ranged between 5 89 and 22 68 m the variance increased with an increased standard deviation and this is for all the datasets in all stations the standard deviation and variance results obtained in this study are comparable to zhang et al 2018 which showed similar behaviour while comparing statistics of datasets majority of the kurtosis values for groundwater are much smaller than those of rainfall and streamflow and this is due to single digits values of measured groundwater levels 2 3 1 hydrological extremes in the study area hydrological extremes considered in this study are those dominant in the study area i e drought and floods to determine these extremes an index based approach was used the precipitation based spi and streamflow based ssi were selected for the present study the spi has been widely applied in drought studies department of water affairs dwa 2014 nam et al 2015 santos et al 2017 the index has been recommended by the world meteorological organisation wmo for operational drought monitoring world meteorological organization wmo 2012 the ssi calculation is the same as the process of calculating spi the only difference is that instead of precipitation data surface run off data is used shamshirband et al 2020 the values of the indices use the standard deviation of precipitation and streamflow from median values for the long term period for this study normal distribution fitting of homogeneous precipitation series was done using the transform function while for the case of water level the normalising function adopted the two parameter logarithmic function vicente serrano et al 2012 since data such as precipitation are random variables that do not conform to normal distribution input data sequence was normalised with the transformation function f x labedzki 2017 1 f x u x 3 where x is the element of either precipitation or water levels equation 2 was therefore used to compute the indices 2 z f x μ ˆ δ ˆ where z is the chosen index spi ssi f x is the transformed sum of precipitation and water level μ ˆ is the mean of normalised x and δ ˆ is the standard deviation of normalized x flow durations curves fdcs for selected streamflow stations were formulated to determine the exceedance time for high and low flow in the catchment the curves provide historical information on catchment water regime i e the severity of the droughts and magnitude of high and low ﬂows fdcs are widely used in hydrological practice i e hydropower feasibility studies warnick 1984 estimation of optimal release from reservoirs alaouze 1989 and design flow diversion pitman 1993 mallory and mckenzie 1993 however wilby et al 1994 assessed the effects of climate scenarios on streamflow with reference to low flow making use of fdcs although several time resolutions of streamﬂow data can be used to formulate the fdc smakhtin 2001 reported that the ﬁner the resolution the higher is the information provided by the fdc about the hydrological characteristics of the river however daily streamflow data from dws contains many gaps and this has been outlined amongst others by smakhtin 2001 as major limitation for their use therefore to formulate fdcs monthly streamflow data are ranked in descending order and then the sorted data is plotted against their corresponding frequency of exceedance the duration di of the ith sorted observation is its exceedance probability p i if p i is estimated using a weibull plotting position the duration di for any qi with i 1 n is given by eq 3 3 d i p q q i p i i n 1 where n is the length of the streamﬂow series and qi is the ith sorted streamﬂow value 2 3 2 groundwater recharge determination the wtf method was adopted for this study groundwater recharge was obtained by multiplying the change in height of the water table δh with the specific yield sy of the aquifer healy 2010 the δh is the difference between the measured peak of the rise from the recharge event and the extrapolated antecedent recession curve as demonstrated in fig 4 and shown in eq 4 the extrapolated antecedent recession curve is the path the hydrograph would follow if the recharge event had not occurred healy 2010 obuobie et al 2012 atta darkwa et al 2013 the approach is normally performed by drawing the antecedent recession curve on a groundwater hydrograph the curves are based on the scientific s best guess as to how the recession curve would have behaved in the absence of a recharge event healy 2010 obuobie et al 2012 further to the hydrologist knowledge cuthbert 2010 reported that recharge estimates from the wtf should be compared with estimates from other methods for verification purposes therefore study did a comparison analysis of recharge estimates obtained through cmb by a different study in the study area cuthbert 2010 modified the wtf method so that it can be used with time series than event based 4 r t m s y δ h t m where rtm is recharge occurring from t 0 to t m sy is a specific yield and δhtm is the peak water table rise from t 0 to t m 2 3 3 estimation of specific yield determination of specific yield sy is identified as the main challenge involved in the application of wtf in this study the sy value of the aquifer was determined using the simple linear regression model described varni et al 2013 the approach is based on the relationship between the rainfall and groundwater level increase for each recharge event the sy value is estimated by drawing a plot of rainfall against the rise in the groundwater level according to varni et al 2013 the inverse of the slope of a line drawn through the origin to just above all the measured points gives the maximum value of sy 2 3 4 trend analysis mann kendall mk trend test was used for trend detection and analysis for both groundwater and hydrological extremes mann 1945 kendall 1990 this non parametric method was used to detect trends and check the significance of trends in the study mann kendall trend test has been widely applied and has the advantage that the power and significance are not affected by the actual distribution unlike the parametric distributions this method has been applied widely in studies that focused on hydrological trend analysis burn and hag elnur 2002 longobardi and villani 2009 odiyo et al 2015 the mk trend method can be extended into a sequential version of the mann kendall test statistic called the sequential mann kendall sq mk this was proposed by sneyers 1991 and it is used to detect approximate potential trends turning points in a time series this method has been successfully employed by many researchers to detect trend turning points and its significance sneyers 1991 mbatha and xulu 2018 the method generates two time series a progressive u t and a retrograde u t trends to utilise the effectiveness of this trend detection method it is required that both the progressive and the retrograde time series are plotted in the same figure if they happen to cross each other and diverge beyond the specific threshold then there is a statistically significant trend in the time series however in sq mk trend analysis sometimes the forward and backward trends cancel each other and finally do not give a significant trend mbatha and bencherif 2020 the method is computed by using the ranked values of y i of a given time series x 1 x 2 x 3 x n in the analyses the magnitudes of y i i 1 2 3 n are compared with y i j 1 2 3 j 1 at each comparison the number of cases where y i y j are counted and then donated to n i the statistic t i is thereafter defined using eq 5 sneyers 1991 5 t i j 1 i n i the mean and variance of the statistic t i are given by 6 e t i i i 1 4 and 7 var t i i i 1 2 i 5 72 finally the sequential values of statistic u t i which are standardized are calculated using the eq 8 8 u t i t i e t i var t i the above equation gives a forward sequential statistic which is normally called the progressive statistic to calculate the backward retrograde statistic values u t the same time series x 1 x 2 x 3 x n is used but statistic values are computed by starting from the end of the time series the combination of the forward and backward sequential statistic allows for the detection of the approximate beginning of a developing trend 3 results and discussion 3 1 interannual rainfall and streamflow time series over the study area figs 5 and 6 show the interannual variability of rainfall and streamflow in the lrc for 30 years from 1986 to 2016 monthly mean data from 11 weather stations and seven streamflow stations were averaged using the arithmetic mean method to obtain the overall catchment interannual variability although it is rather a simpler approach compared to the thiessen polygon and isohyetal method balany 2011 compared the three methods of averaging catchment rainfall and found that no method is consistently superior to the other the variability plots depict a strong seasonal variation in the study area makarau 1995 reported that the rainy season of the region is characterised by alternating wet and dry spells the streamflow time series showed a positive linear trend while rainfall showed a negative linear trend over the 30 year period although both linear trends were not significant rainfall and streamflow showed an r2 of 0 008 and 0 0005 respectively the wet and dry alternating result obtained in this study is comparable with those obtained by chikoore 2016 over southern africa the two figures depict the negative departure from the mean between the 1980s and 1990s kabanda 2004 reported a declining trend over the study area during the decade while chikoore 2016 reported a high interannual variability of mean rainfall with drier years negative departures during the same period rainfall increased in 1995 96 which resulted in increased streamflow in 1996 97 this event was followed by above normal rainfall received over southern africa in 2000 as a result of tropical cyclone eline which produced 25 of mean rainfall over a few days in the year 2000 reason and keibel 2004 the latter two periods indicate that the system was on partial recovery therefore these findings are comparable with chikoore 2016 3 2 evaluation of hydrological extremes to determine extreme hydrological events in the study area an index based approach was used the spi and ssi were analysed at a 12 month timescale this is because longer timescales exhibit precipitation deficit impact on water resources wmo 2012 reported that groundwater streamflow and reservoir storage are reflected in long term precipitation anomalies figs 7 a d and 8 a c show spi 12 and ssi 12 for the four selected weather and streamflow stations respectively rainfall based index depicted the 1991 92 and 2014 16 major drought and the year 2000 floods hydrological extremes have been reported in southern africa development community sadc notably drought events in 1982 83 1987 88 1991 92 1994 95 1997 98 mason and tyson 2000 food and agricultural organisation fao 2004 and the most recent multi season 2014 16 drought nhamo et al 2019 this drought event resulted in major water resources supply challenges in the western cape province before the 2014 16 drought the 1991 92 drought was classified as the most extreme however this study analysis found that mukumbani and levubu stations noted the 2014 16 as the most extreme it should be noted that thohoyandou station started operations in 1996 and therefore could not account for the 1991 92 drought event while data for pafuri weather station operated until 2013 and therefore could not account for the most recent multi season 2014 16 drought in the year 2000 tropical cyclone eline caused continuous heavy rains over southern africa resulting in a devastating flood over the limpopo river basin before this event the study area has experienced floods in 1976 78 christie and hanlon 2001 the latter most floods events were reported to have occurred in 2010 11 and 2012 13 musyoki et al 2016 all the four selected weather stations spi at 12 month timescale depicted the 1999 00 flood while both 2010 11 and 2013 were underestimated by the index at this timescale the year 2000 flood was most catastrophic and results in loss of lives and flooded infrastructure odiyo et al 2019 reported that the 1999 2000 and 2011 2012 floods resulted in bridge collapse in the study area the 12 month timescale of ssi at stations a9h003 and a9h013 showed the major flood event that occurred in the region in the year 2000 while station a9h012 underestimated the flood event and depicted a notable flood in 1996 tables 2 and 3 show the different spi and ssi moisture level categories percentages for the respective stations at a 12 month timescale these moisture level categories are adopted from mckee et al 1993 near normal conditions were found to be most dominant over the study period and ranged between 68 and 77 in the respective weather stations however some stations exhibited more wet spells compared to other stations the weather station in thohoyandou town for instance showed more moderate wet years compared to the other stations while levubu showed the highest extreme dry years and recorded the highest percentage of extreme drought events with 10 21 of spi showing this category over the study period for the case of ssi station a9h003 in the tshinane river one of the major tributaries of the luvuvhu rivers exhibited higher duration in the near normal category the lower reach of the catchment in the mutale river ranked second in the extreme dryness category compared to the middle reached as represented by station a9h012 3 3 fdc for luvuvhu river catchment fig 9 a d show monthly flow duration curves for the selected streamflow station in the study area all the stations exhibited similar characteristics and this is noted as a result of the shape of the curves a b and c station a9h003 and a9h012 flowed 100 of the time while a9h013 flowed just above the 90th percentile station a9h003 observed 1618 76 m3 s highest flows while the rest of the stations highest flows observed were 198 636 and 366 67 m3 s at the 50th percentile stations a9h003 a9h012 and a9h013 observed 13 84 m3 s 4 53 m3 s and 1 62 m3 s respectively and according to smakhtin 2001 low flows correspond to the entire section of the fdc below the 50th percentile q50 the percentage of time a stream experiences zero flows illustrates the degree of its intermittency and indicates the percentage of zero flow months gorgens and hughes 1982 smakhtin et al 1995 smakhtin 2001 further stated that the longest record of consecutive zero flow months may be perceived as an indication of extreme drought table 4 shows the period when the respective river systems experienced flood and drought conditions low flow thresholds usually adopted in drought studies range between the 70th and 95th percentiles hisdal et al 2004 corzo perez et al 2011 while the 31st to 69th percentile is considered near normal and anything at the 30th percentile and below is considered as floods streamflow at the 50th percentile is a conservative upper bound to low flow hydrology with the absolute minimum flow representing the lower bound cammalleri et al 2017 similarly streamflow at the 30th percentile is the lower bound for flood while the 1st percentile shows the absolute maximum flow in a river system upper bound although studies have reported both extremes frequencies to be on the increase usman and reason 2004 this study found that majority of these events were mild cases over the study period the fdcs were then used to support index based hydrological extremes findings i e results of spi and ssi the fdcs findings for the respective stations show that the catchment experienced both high and low flows over the study period at different magnitudes therefore this agrees with the results of the index that the two hydrological extremes occurred at different magnitudes in the study area over the study period and that majority of the time the catchment near normal conditions where streams are neither experiencing drought or floods 3 4 determined specific yield for the study area fig 10 a c show the relationship between groundwater levels and rainfall obtained through a linear regression model the slope of the line in fig 10 a c corresponds to a specific yield of 0 04 0 05 and 0 06 for boreholes a9n0018 a9n0007 and a9n0008 respectively each of these specific yield values has been reported to be the maximum value although it can decrease if rainfall recharge events occur when soil and vadose zone were not at field capacity the specific yield obtained in this study agrees with findings in other studies conducted in the same study area tshipala 2018 nemaxwi et al 2019 3 5 groundwater recharge in the lrc fig 11 a c confirm that the wet season in this area starts from october and proceed until april whereas the dry season starts from may to september during the wet season groundwater levels rise due to the amount of rainwater that infiltrates and percolates the ground the highest monthly rainfall was recorded in october in all the selected rainfall stations for the duration considered in this study this month falls within the rainfall season the figures show that the rise of groundwater levels varies with rainfall with a significant lag observed in the peak rainfall and water level rise in borehole a9n0008 according to xu and beekman 2003 the lag could have been due to prolonged recharge events caused by increasing thickness of the unsaturated zone or delayed due to the 3 dimensional spreading of moisture the highest groundwater level increased was 0 75 0 83 and 1 01 m for borehole a9n0008 a9n0007 and a9n0018 respectively it also indicates that recharge to groundwater is almost entirely from the seasonal rainfall as the rise of water levels occurs during this period scarpa 1994 obuobie 2008 groundwater recharge estimations were carried out for three boreholes located within the fractured granite gneiss pegmatite and dolerite aquifers the specific yield of geologic materials within the study area ranged from 0 04 to 0 06 table 5 shows groundwater recharge for the selected boreholes in the study area borehole a9n0007 recorded the highest groundwater level in 2006 and the lowest in 2012 the estimated groundwater recharge for this borehole ranged between 5 and 50 mm year which is equivalent to 1 5 11 5 of the annual rainfall the highest groundwater recharge estimated was 11 5 received in2007 and the lowest groundwater recharge was 1 5 received in 2010 for the case of borehole a9n0008 the estimated groundwater recharge ranged between 42 and 48 mm year which is equivalent to 5 6 10 3 of the annual rainfall the highest groundwater recharge estimated was 10 3 received in 2012 and the lowest groundwater recharge was 5 6 received 2009 estimated groundwater recharge for borehole a9n0018 ranged between 8 and 52 mm year the estimated groundwater recharge for borehole a9n0018 is equivalent to 1 1 11 5 of the annual rainfall the highest groundwater recharge estimated was 11 5 received in the year 2016 and the lowest groundwater recharge was 1 1 received in 2010 therefore groundwater recharge estimates ranged from 1 1 11 5 of mean annual rainfall in the lrc dwaf 2006 reported an estimated recharge ranging between 2 3 of mean annual rainfall using the cmb while nemaxwi et al 2019 found aquifer recharge estimates ranging between 3 10 3 of mean annual precipitation in the lrc these therefore show that the catchment receives less amount of recharge from total rainfall the recharge results obtained in this study are therefore comparable to other studies conducted in the same study area and in areas with similar geologic properties and climate conditions 3 6 hydrological extremes and groundwater trends in the luvuvhu river catchment table 6 shows the mk test statistics for spi ssi and groundwater levels in the study area for the case of index based extremes such as in this case a decreasing trend in streamflow indicates that an area is experiencing more drought while an increasingly positive trend is indicative of drought recovery spi depicted a significant decreasing trend in three of the rainfall stations i e thohoyandou mukumbani and levubu with the pafuri station located downstream of the catchment depicting an increasing insignificant trend the ssi results showed a significant increasing trend in two streamflow stations i e a9h012 and a negative decreasing trend which was significant in the lower reaches of the catchment for the case of groundwater levels all stations showed a significant decreasing trend apart from a9n0008 which showed an insignificant decreasing trend in that respective station figs 12 a c 13 a d and 14 a c show the sq mk for ssi spi and groundwater levels for the study area respectively the sq mk plots agree with the trend detection as reported by mk spi showed significant decreasing changes were detected in the years 2009 2004 and 2012 for mukumbani thohoyandou and levubu respectively while pafuri stations noted the insignificant increasing change in the 1990s for the case of ssi streamflow a9h003 and a9h012 observed significant increasing changes in 2000 while station a9h013 located downstream of the catchment showed a significant decreasing trend change after the flood in the year 2000 the direction of change is indicated when the forward and backward prog and retr lines intersect after which there is some stabilization groundwater station a9n0007 trend was on a stable decreasing trend between august 2007 and october 2013 which at this point the level seemed to be recovering the sq mk behaviour for a9n0007 and a9n0008 were similar while a9n0018 showed to have stabilised from july 2007 until august 2014 and the trend was noted to have moved towards the negative further to the significant changes detected by mk sq mk showed that most stations i e weather streamflow and groundwater also had significant trend changes over the study period the study noted the correlation between groundwater levels and the amount of rainfall over the study period for example a declining ssi trend for streamflow station a9h013 and an insignificant trend of spi found in pafuri weather station the same relationship was realised between groundwater weather and streamflow found within the catchment for instance groundwater recharge in a9n0018 and the spi in levubu showed decreasing significant trends over the study period the same relationship was realised in quaternary catchment a91 f i e a9n0008 and thohoyandou where both groundwater levels and the thohoyandou spi showed a decreasing trend although the spi trend was not significant this therefore shows that there exists a relationship between groundwater levels and hydro meteorological variables these findings are comparable to those obtained by kolusu et al 2019 which found that the 2015 2016 el nino induced extreme drought resulted in groundwater storage declines over the limpopo river basin the variation in the response of groundwater to the estimated hydrological extremes i e drought and floods in some stations for this study may be due to the fact that weather stations are not in the same position within the quaternary catchment 4 conclusion groundwater is a vital resource for domestic and irrigation water supply in rural areas dominantly characterized by semi arid climates this study aimed at evaluating the relationship between groundwater and hydrological extreme a semi arid catchment found in north eastern south africa indices i e spi and ssi were used as drought and flood indicators and the fdcs were further used to determine the exceedance of high and low flows in the lrc the wtf method was used to estimate groundwater recharge to further determine the relationship between hydrological extremes and groundwater levels trend analysis was performed the study found that although near normal conditions are dominant in the study area stations i e levubu and mukumbani showed drier conditions compared to pafuri and thohoyandou at the 50th percentile the middle reach of the catchment flow varied between 13 84 m3 s and 4 53 m3 s while the lower reaches showed the lowest flows at 1 62 m3 s the specific yield of geologic materials within the study area ranged from 0 04 to 0 06 groundwater recharge estimates ranged from 1 1 11 5 of mean annual rainfall about 60 of the stations i e streamflow groundwater and rainfall stations showed a significantly decreasing trend this therefore indicates that there was a decreasing trend in groundwater levels streamflow and rainfall over the study period the decreasing trends found on all the variables considered indicated that there is some relationship between variables considered in this study therefore when there is above average rainfall in the catchment groundwater levels are likely to increase and the opposite is the case during the dry periods studies such as varni et al 2013 have linked groundwater level rise to groundwater recharge and as such rainfall does have some form of linear relationship with groundwater recharge given the increasing frequency of hydrological extremes and the relationship they have with groundwater resources as shown in this study it is important to have stricter management practices implemented this will not only ensure the sustainability of the groundwater resources but also improve the livelihoods of rural communities who are dependent on groundwater resources for domestic water uses author s statement all persons who meet authorship criteria are listed as authors and

8142,extreme hydrological events have been reported to be on an increase in terms of magnitude and frequency in southern africa groundwater in this area plays a significant role in domestic water supply and agriculture the aim of this study is to evaluate the relationship between groundwater levels and hydrological extremes in north eastern south africa an index based approach was used to determine the drought and flood events over the study period while the water table fluctuation approach was used to determine groundwater recharge flow duration curves were further employed to determine the exceedance period of high and low flows in the study area mann kendall and sequential mann kendall were used to detect trends and the point of change both floods and drought were found to have occurred in the study area at different magnitudes however both the standardized precipitation index spi and standardized streamflow index ssi found that majority of these were not categorized as mild to near normal conditions specific yield determined using the simple linear regression method ranged between 0 04 and 0 06 groundwater recharge estimates ranged between 1 1 and 11 5 of mean annual rainfall ranging between 167 1000 mm a about 60 of the stations i e rainfall streamflow and groundwater show significantly decreasing trend this therefore indicates that there is a decreasing trend in groundwater levels streamflow and rainfall over the study area based on the trend analysis findings it suggests that extreme events in the catchment influences groundwater resources keywords drought floods groundwater rainfall sequential mann kendall streamflow trends water table fluctuation 1 introduction groundwater plays a critical role in maintaining ecosystem services and supporting communities adaptation to climate change taylor et al 2012 almost 30 of global freshwater is groundwater one third of which serves as the source of all freshwater withdrawals shiklomanov 1993 globally taylor et al 2012 reported that groundwater supplies 36 for domestic use 42 for agricultural use and 27 for industrial use in the present study groundwater recharge was estimated for the luvuvhu river catchment lrc and the relationship between groundwater levels and hydrological extremes were analysed knowledge of groundwater and hydrological extremes relationship is of great significance in the region as this helps in better management of water resources the present study realised the importance of looking at how groundwater responds to hydrological extremes in lrc groundwater remains the sole source of domestic water supply for many rural communities many of which are in semi arid and arid environments riemann et al 2012 taylor et al 2012 for instance in south africa groundwater is widely used by millions of people for domestic water use grip limpopo 2002 odiyo and makungo 2012 roughly 75 of the population in limpopo province depends on groundwater resources and it accounts for about 70 of domestic water supply for rural communities in the province botha and van rooyen 2001 du toit et al 2012 semi arid regions are characterised by low rainfall averages thereby making groundwater resources important and valuable compared to humid regions due to its resilience to drought groundwater plays a significant role as one of the first response strategies for water supply during prolonged dry conditions dws 2010 however temperatures were reported to have increased by 1 c over limpopo river basin in recent years phophi et al 2020 and gbetibuou 2009 dwa 2010 observed significant declining trends of groundwater levels following prolonged dry periods water resource auditing suggests that groundwater is a feasible and cost effective source of supply to meet future water demand in limpopo river basin lrb busari 2007 however climate change might have considerable impacts on groundwater resources with changes in rainfall patterns likely to affect the rate of aquifer recharge furthermore due to climate change induced temperature increases odiyo et al 2019 indicated that droughts and floods have also become most common in south africa thus given the potential impacts on water resources emanating from climate anomalies and the increasing magnitude and frequency of hydrological extremes studies that aim to quantify groundwater recharge have become of significance these extreme events have the potential to cause harm and threaten communities livelihoods kundzewickz and matczak 2015 furthermore atta darkwa et al 2013 highlighted the impacts of hydrological extreme on groundwater as one aspect to consider in managing groundwater resources kolusu et al 2019 highlighted the need to understand patterns of climate variability both temporally and spatially that inﬂuence groundwater resources hydrological extremes are characterised by hydroclimatic data and can be determined by analysing such data to determine long term climate anomalies climate trends and patterns hence climatic trend studies have been conducted using different techniques i e linear regression mann kendall trend test pettit change point test and correlation analysis tao et al 2018 pei et al 2017 odiyo et al 2015 nenwiini and kabanda 2013 tao et al 2018 investigated spatial and temporal variations of precipitation extremes using the mann kendall trend test pettit change point test and correlation analysis in china and found that changes in precipitation extremes were closely related to changes in the total precipitation in most parts of the country between 1961 and 2013 studies on the impacts of climate change on groundwater variability have also been conducted previously such studies include fu et al 2019 who demonstrated the benefits of using statistical methods when investigating the climate and non climatic drivers responsible for the variations in groundwater in south east south australia based on 71 climatic metrics and 17 non climatic metrics the study found that 1 decline in rainfall was identified as a factor leading to groundwater recharge reduction 2 suggests that seasonal shift in rainfall can reduce groundwater recharge even when there is no change in annual rainfall and 3 a decrease in groundwater level due to declines in rainfall can lead to further declines in groundwater recharge impacts of hydrological extreme on groundwater have been reported by atta darkwa et al 2013 as one aspect to consider in managing groundwater resources even with knowledge of potential impacts of extreme events there are limited studies that have investigated their impacts on groundwater resources and consequently studies that aim at quantifying groundwater recharge have become of significance therefore the present study aims to investigate the relationship between hydrological extreme events and groundwater levels in the lrc in north eastern south africa this was achieved through a series of steps which included recharge estimation using wtf method index based extreme events assessment and trend analysis 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the luvuvhu river catchment lrc is situated in limpopo province in the north eastern part of south africa and it is a sub catchment of the lrb one of the major shared river basins in the region department of water affairs dwa 2014 odiyo et al 2019 vdm idp 2016 17 it covers an area of approximately 5 941 km2 and is located at 1 312 m above sea level between latitudes 22 17 33 57 s and 23 17 57 31 s and 29 49 46 16 e and 30 23 32 02 e fig 1 groundwater resources are of significance in this rural catchment as it is a major source of domestic water supply to the majority of the population and agricultural activities it has been reported that the catchment is an economic region with several major farms located within the levubu valley department of water affairs dwa 2014 odiyo et al 2019 according to odiyo et al 2015 the distribution of precipitation is highly variable with most of the precipitation received in the upper reaches of the catchment with the lower reaches around the kruger national park receiving the lowest rainfall in the entire catchment rainfall season is from october to april and the remaining months may to september are characterised by dry season conditions in the upper reach of the catchment rainfall exceeds 1 000 mm a and declines to less than 200 mm a in the east northeast direction with increased potential evaporation the mean annual rainfall is 608 mm for the entire catchment mathivha et al 2016 and the mean annual runoff is about 520 million m3 yr which yields to 11 4 mm year of annual rainfall odiyo et al 2019 reported spatial temporal variability in rainfall as one factor that increases the exposure of a community to hydrological extremes there have been several destructive floods and droughts reported in the lrc with extensive negative impacts on agriculture and rural communities odiyo et al 2019 mathivha et al 2016 singo et al 2012 2 2 geology and hydrogeology of the study area fig 2 a shows the simplified geological formation of the lrc sourced from the council of geoscience the catchment is mostly made up of the old basement rocks of the swazian age the goudplaats gneiss forms the base for other lithologies to be deposited such as biotite gneiss migmatite and re melted granite the soutpansberg group rocks dominate the mountainous middle reaches of the catchment and are mostly quarzitic rocks with extrusive basalt which gave rise to a mountainous wedge shaped terrain that extends from the kruger national park brand 1999 busari 2007 before the formation of the karoo rock group the soutpansberg group formed a flat featureless landscape and it occupies most of the lower reaches of the catchment while some of the karoo sediments occupy northern parts of the catchment department of water affairs dwa 2014 groundwater flow in fractured granite gneiss pegmatite and dolerite coupled with climate and physiography affect groundwater recharge together with groundwater surface water interactions vegter 2003 the occurrence physiography and climate are used to describe and classify the groundwater regions unit gru see fig 2 b department of water affairs dwa 2014 2 3 data and methods precipitation streamflow and groundwater level data were obtained for periods ranging between nine years and 30 years 1986 and 2016 the variation in data length is due to the unavailability of long term data for some hydro meteorological variables in the study area precipitation data were obtained from the south africa weather service saws while groundwater and streamflow data were obtained from the department of water and sanitation fig 3 shows the different stations where data was collected these stations were selected based on data availability table 1 shows the summary statistics of the datasets used in the study i e rainfall streamflow and groundwater mean monthly rainfall ranged between 64 and 85 mm mean monthly streamflow ranged between 2 09 and 26 45 m3 s while monthly groundwater levels ranged between 5 89 and 22 68 m the variance increased with an increased standard deviation and this is for all the datasets in all stations the standard deviation and variance results obtained in this study are comparable to zhang et al 2018 which showed similar behaviour while comparing statistics of datasets majority of the kurtosis values for groundwater are much smaller than those of rainfall and streamflow and this is due to single digits values of measured groundwater levels 2 3 1 hydrological extremes in the study area hydrological extremes considered in this study are those dominant in the study area i e drought and floods to determine these extremes an index based approach was used the precipitation based spi and streamflow based ssi were selected for the present study the spi has been widely applied in drought studies department of water affairs dwa 2014 nam et al 2015 santos et al 2017 the index has been recommended by the world meteorological organisation wmo for operational drought monitoring world meteorological organization wmo 2012 the ssi calculation is the same as the process of calculating spi the only difference is that instead of precipitation data surface run off data is used shamshirband et al 2020 the values of the indices use the standard deviation of precipitation and streamflow from median values for the long term period for this study normal distribution fitting of homogeneous precipitation series was done using the transform function while for the case of water level the normalising function adopted the two parameter logarithmic function vicente serrano et al 2012 since data such as precipitation are random variables that do not conform to normal distribution input data sequence was normalised with the transformation function f x labedzki 2017 1 f x u x 3 where x is the element of either precipitation or water levels equation 2 was therefore used to compute the indices 2 z f x μ ˆ δ ˆ where z is the chosen index spi ssi f x is the transformed sum of precipitation and water level μ ˆ is the mean of normalised x and δ ˆ is the standard deviation of normalized x flow durations curves fdcs for selected streamflow stations were formulated to determine the exceedance time for high and low flow in the catchment the curves provide historical information on catchment water regime i e the severity of the droughts and magnitude of high and low ﬂows fdcs are widely used in hydrological practice i e hydropower feasibility studies warnick 1984 estimation of optimal release from reservoirs alaouze 1989 and design flow diversion pitman 1993 mallory and mckenzie 1993 however wilby et al 1994 assessed the effects of climate scenarios on streamflow with reference to low flow making use of fdcs although several time resolutions of streamﬂow data can be used to formulate the fdc smakhtin 2001 reported that the ﬁner the resolution the higher is the information provided by the fdc about the hydrological characteristics of the river however daily streamflow data from dws contains many gaps and this has been outlined amongst others by smakhtin 2001 as major limitation for their use therefore to formulate fdcs monthly streamflow data are ranked in descending order and then the sorted data is plotted against their corresponding frequency of exceedance the duration di of the ith sorted observation is its exceedance probability p i if p i is estimated using a weibull plotting position the duration di for any qi with i 1 n is given by eq 3 3 d i p q q i p i i n 1 where n is the length of the streamﬂow series and qi is the ith sorted streamﬂow value 2 3 2 groundwater recharge determination the wtf method was adopted for this study groundwater recharge was obtained by multiplying the change in height of the water table δh with the specific yield sy of the aquifer healy 2010 the δh is the difference between the measured peak of the rise from the recharge event and the extrapolated antecedent recession curve as demonstrated in fig 4 and shown in eq 4 the extrapolated antecedent recession curve is the path the hydrograph would follow if the recharge event had not occurred healy 2010 obuobie et al 2012 atta darkwa et al 2013 the approach is normally performed by drawing the antecedent recession curve on a groundwater hydrograph the curves are based on the scientific s best guess as to how the recession curve would have behaved in the absence of a recharge event healy 2010 obuobie et al 2012 further to the hydrologist knowledge cuthbert 2010 reported that recharge estimates from the wtf should be compared with estimates from other methods for verification purposes therefore study did a comparison analysis of recharge estimates obtained through cmb by a different study in the study area cuthbert 2010 modified the wtf method so that it can be used with time series than event based 4 r t m s y δ h t m where rtm is recharge occurring from t 0 to t m sy is a specific yield and δhtm is the peak water table rise from t 0 to t m 2 3 3 estimation of specific yield determination of specific yield sy is identified as the main challenge involved in the application of wtf in this study the sy value of the aquifer was determined using the simple linear regression model described varni et al 2013 the approach is based on the relationship between the rainfall and groundwater level increase for each recharge event the sy value is estimated by drawing a plot of rainfall against the rise in the groundwater level according to varni et al 2013 the inverse of the slope of a line drawn through the origin to just above all the measured points gives the maximum value of sy 2 3 4 trend analysis mann kendall mk trend test was used for trend detection and analysis for both groundwater and hydrological extremes mann 1945 kendall 1990 this non parametric method was used to detect trends and check the significance of trends in the study mann kendall trend test has been widely applied and has the advantage that the power and significance are not affected by the actual distribution unlike the parametric distributions this method has been applied widely in studies that focused on hydrological trend analysis burn and hag elnur 2002 longobardi and villani 2009 odiyo et al 2015 the mk trend method can be extended into a sequential version of the mann kendall test statistic called the sequential mann kendall sq mk this was proposed by sneyers 1991 and it is used to detect approximate potential trends turning points in a time series this method has been successfully employed by many researchers to detect trend turning points and its significance sneyers 1991 mbatha and xulu 2018 the method generates two time series a progressive u t and a retrograde u t trends to utilise the effectiveness of this trend detection method it is required that both the progressive and the retrograde time series are plotted in the same figure if they happen to cross each other and diverge beyond the specific threshold then there is a statistically significant trend in the time series however in sq mk trend analysis sometimes the forward and backward trends cancel each other and finally do not give a significant trend mbatha and bencherif 2020 the method is computed by using the ranked values of y i of a given time series x 1 x 2 x 3 x n in the analyses the magnitudes of y i i 1 2 3 n are compared with y i j 1 2 3 j 1 at each comparison the number of cases where y i y j are counted and then donated to n i the statistic t i is thereafter defined using eq 5 sneyers 1991 5 t i j 1 i n i the mean and variance of the statistic t i are given by 6 e t i i i 1 4 and 7 var t i i i 1 2 i 5 72 finally the sequential values of statistic u t i which are standardized are calculated using the eq 8 8 u t i t i e t i var t i the above equation gives a forward sequential statistic which is normally called the progressive statistic to calculate the backward retrograde statistic values u t the same time series x 1 x 2 x 3 x n is used but statistic values are computed by starting from the end of the time series the combination of the forward and backward sequential statistic allows for the detection of the approximate beginning of a developing trend 3 results and discussion 3 1 interannual rainfall and streamflow time series over the study area figs 5 and 6 show the interannual variability of rainfall and streamflow in the lrc for 30 years from 1986 to 2016 monthly mean data from 11 weather stations and seven streamflow stations were averaged using the arithmetic mean method to obtain the overall catchment interannual variability although it is rather a simpler approach compared to the thiessen polygon and isohyetal method balany 2011 compared the three methods of averaging catchment rainfall and found that no method is consistently superior to the other the variability plots depict a strong seasonal variation in the study area makarau 1995 reported that the rainy season of the region is characterised by alternating wet and dry spells the streamflow time series showed a positive linear trend while rainfall showed a negative linear trend over the 30 year period although both linear trends were not significant rainfall and streamflow showed an r2 of 0 008 and 0 0005 respectively the wet and dry alternating result obtained in this study is comparable with those obtained by chikoore 2016 over southern africa the two figures depict the negative departure from the mean between the 1980s and 1990s kabanda 2004 reported a declining trend over the study area during the decade while chikoore 2016 reported a high interannual variability of mean rainfall with drier years negative departures during the same period rainfall increased in 1995 96 which resulted in increased streamflow in 1996 97 this event was followed by above normal rainfall received over southern africa in 2000 as a result of tropical cyclone eline which produced 25 of mean rainfall over a few days in the year 2000 reason and keibel 2004 the latter two periods indicate that the system was on partial recovery therefore these findings are comparable with chikoore 2016 3 2 evaluation of hydrological extremes to determine extreme hydrological events in the study area an index based approach was used the spi and ssi were analysed at a 12 month timescale this is because longer timescales exhibit precipitation deficit impact on water resources wmo 2012 reported that groundwater streamflow and reservoir storage are reflected in long term precipitation anomalies figs 7 a d and 8 a c show spi 12 and ssi 12 for the four selected weather and streamflow stations respectively rainfall based index depicted the 1991 92 and 2014 16 major drought and the year 2000 floods hydrological extremes have been reported in southern africa development community sadc notably drought events in 1982 83 1987 88 1991 92 1994 95 1997 98 mason and tyson 2000 food and agricultural organisation fao 2004 and the most recent multi season 2014 16 drought nhamo et al 2019 this drought event resulted in major water resources supply challenges in the western cape province before the 2014 16 drought the 1991 92 drought was classified as the most extreme however this study analysis found that mukumbani and levubu stations noted the 2014 16 as the most extreme it should be noted that thohoyandou station started operations in 1996 and therefore could not account for the 1991 92 drought event while data for pafuri weather station operated until 2013 and therefore could not account for the most recent multi season 2014 16 drought in the year 2000 tropical cyclone eline caused continuous heavy rains over southern africa resulting in a devastating flood over the limpopo river basin before this event the study area has experienced floods in 1976 78 christie and hanlon 2001 the latter most floods events were reported to have occurred in 2010 11 and 2012 13 musyoki et al 2016 all the four selected weather stations spi at 12 month timescale depicted the 1999 00 flood while both 2010 11 and 2013 were underestimated by the index at this timescale the year 2000 flood was most catastrophic and results in loss of lives and flooded infrastructure odiyo et al 2019 reported that the 1999 2000 and 2011 2012 floods resulted in bridge collapse in the study area the 12 month timescale of ssi at stations a9h003 and a9h013 showed the major flood event that occurred in the region in the year 2000 while station a9h012 underestimated the flood event and depicted a notable flood in 1996 tables 2 and 3 show the different spi and ssi moisture level categories percentages for the respective stations at a 12 month timescale these moisture level categories are adopted from mckee et al 1993 near normal conditions were found to be most dominant over the study period and ranged between 68 and 77 in the respective weather stations however some stations exhibited more wet spells compared to other stations the weather station in thohoyandou town for instance showed more moderate wet years compared to the other stations while levubu showed the highest extreme dry years and recorded the highest percentage of extreme drought events with 10 21 of spi showing this category over the study period for the case of ssi station a9h003 in the tshinane river one of the major tributaries of the luvuvhu rivers exhibited higher duration in the near normal category the lower reach of the catchment in the mutale river ranked second in the extreme dryness category compared to the middle reached as represented by station a9h012 3 3 fdc for luvuvhu river catchment fig 9 a d show monthly flow duration curves for the selected streamflow station in the study area all the stations exhibited similar characteristics and this is noted as a result of the shape of the curves a b and c station a9h003 and a9h012 flowed 100 of the time while a9h013 flowed just above the 90th percentile station a9h003 observed 1618 76 m3 s highest flows while the rest of the stations highest flows observed were 198 636 and 366 67 m3 s at the 50th percentile stations a9h003 a9h012 and a9h013 observed 13 84 m3 s 4 53 m3 s and 1 62 m3 s respectively and according to smakhtin 2001 low flows correspond to the entire section of the fdc below the 50th percentile q50 the percentage of time a stream experiences zero flows illustrates the degree of its intermittency and indicates the percentage of zero flow months gorgens and hughes 1982 smakhtin et al 1995 smakhtin 2001 further stated that the longest record of consecutive zero flow months may be perceived as an indication of extreme drought table 4 shows the period when the respective river systems experienced flood and drought conditions low flow thresholds usually adopted in drought studies range between the 70th and 95th percentiles hisdal et al 2004 corzo perez et al 2011 while the 31st to 69th percentile is considered near normal and anything at the 30th percentile and below is considered as floods streamflow at the 50th percentile is a conservative upper bound to low flow hydrology with the absolute minimum flow representing the lower bound cammalleri et al 2017 similarly streamflow at the 30th percentile is the lower bound for flood while the 1st percentile shows the absolute maximum flow in a river system upper bound although studies have reported both extremes frequencies to be on the increase usman and reason 2004 this study found that majority of these events were mild cases over the study period the fdcs were then used to support index based hydrological extremes findings i e results of spi and ssi the fdcs findings for the respective stations show that the catchment experienced both high and low flows over the study period at different magnitudes therefore this agrees with the results of the index that the two hydrological extremes occurred at different magnitudes in the study area over the study period and that majority of the time the catchment near normal conditions where streams are neither experiencing drought or floods 3 4 determined specific yield for the study area fig 10 a c show the relationship between groundwater levels and rainfall obtained through a linear regression model the slope of the line in fig 10 a c corresponds to a specific yield of 0 04 0 05 and 0 06 for boreholes a9n0018 a9n0007 and a9n0008 respectively each of these specific yield values has been reported to be the maximum value although it can decrease if rainfall recharge events occur when soil and vadose zone were not at field capacity the specific yield obtained in this study agrees with findings in other studies conducted in the same study area tshipala 2018 nemaxwi et al 2019 3 5 groundwater recharge in the lrc fig 11 a c confirm that the wet season in this area starts from october and proceed until april whereas the dry season starts from may to september during the wet season groundwater levels rise due to the amount of rainwater that infiltrates and percolates the ground the highest monthly rainfall was recorded in october in all the selected rainfall stations for the duration considered in this study this month falls within the rainfall season the figures show that the rise of groundwater levels varies with rainfall with a significant lag observed in the peak rainfall and water level rise in borehole a9n0008 according to xu and beekman 2003 the lag could have been due to prolonged recharge events caused by increasing thickness of the unsaturated zone or delayed due to the 3 dimensional spreading of moisture the highest groundwater level increased was 0 75 0 83 and 1 01 m for borehole a9n0008 a9n0007 and a9n0018 respectively it also indicates that recharge to groundwater is almost entirely from the seasonal rainfall as the rise of water levels occurs during this period scarpa 1994 obuobie 2008 groundwater recharge estimations were carried out for three boreholes located within the fractured granite gneiss pegmatite and dolerite aquifers the specific yield of geologic materials within the study area ranged from 0 04 to 0 06 table 5 shows groundwater recharge for the selected boreholes in the study area borehole a9n0007 recorded the highest groundwater level in 2006 and the lowest in 2012 the estimated groundwater recharge for this borehole ranged between 5 and 50 mm year which is equivalent to 1 5 11 5 of the annual rainfall the highest groundwater recharge estimated was 11 5 received in2007 and the lowest groundwater recharge was 1 5 received in 2010 for the case of borehole a9n0008 the estimated groundwater recharge ranged between 42 and 48 mm year which is equivalent to 5 6 10 3 of the annual rainfall the highest groundwater recharge estimated was 10 3 received in 2012 and the lowest groundwater recharge was 5 6 received 2009 estimated groundwater recharge for borehole a9n0018 ranged between 8 and 52 mm year the estimated groundwater recharge for borehole a9n0018 is equivalent to 1 1 11 5 of the annual rainfall the highest groundwater recharge estimated was 11 5 received in the year 2016 and the lowest groundwater recharge was 1 1 received in 2010 therefore groundwater recharge estimates ranged from 1 1 11 5 of mean annual rainfall in the lrc dwaf 2006 reported an estimated recharge ranging between 2 3 of mean annual rainfall using the cmb while nemaxwi et al 2019 found aquifer recharge estimates ranging between 3 10 3 of mean annual precipitation in the lrc these therefore show that the catchment receives less amount of recharge from total rainfall the recharge results obtained in this study are therefore comparable to other studies conducted in the same study area and in areas with similar geologic properties and climate conditions 3 6 hydrological extremes and groundwater trends in the luvuvhu river catchment table 6 shows the mk test statistics for spi ssi and groundwater levels in the study area for the case of index based extremes such as in this case a decreasing trend in streamflow indicates that an area is experiencing more drought while an increasingly positive trend is indicative of drought recovery spi depicted a significant decreasing trend in three of the rainfall stations i e thohoyandou mukumbani and levubu with the pafuri station located downstream of the catchment depicting an increasing insignificant trend the ssi results showed a significant increasing trend in two streamflow stations i e a9h012 and a negative decreasing trend which was significant in the lower reaches of the catchment for the case of groundwater levels all stations showed a significant decreasing trend apart from a9n0008 which showed an insignificant decreasing trend in that respective station figs 12 a c 13 a d and 14 a c show the sq mk for ssi spi and groundwater levels for the study area respectively the sq mk plots agree with the trend detection as reported by mk spi showed significant decreasing changes were detected in the years 2009 2004 and 2012 for mukumbani thohoyandou and levubu respectively while pafuri stations noted the insignificant increasing change in the 1990s for the case of ssi streamflow a9h003 and a9h012 observed significant increasing changes in 2000 while station a9h013 located downstream of the catchment showed a significant decreasing trend change after the flood in the year 2000 the direction of change is indicated when the forward and backward prog and retr lines intersect after which there is some stabilization groundwater station a9n0007 trend was on a stable decreasing trend between august 2007 and october 2013 which at this point the level seemed to be recovering the sq mk behaviour for a9n0007 and a9n0008 were similar while a9n0018 showed to have stabilised from july 2007 until august 2014 and the trend was noted to have moved towards the negative further to the significant changes detected by mk sq mk showed that most stations i e weather streamflow and groundwater also had significant trend changes over the study period the study noted the correlation between groundwater levels and the amount of rainfall over the study period for example a declining ssi trend for streamflow station a9h013 and an insignificant trend of spi found in pafuri weather station the same relationship was realised between groundwater weather and streamflow found within the catchment for instance groundwater recharge in a9n0018 and the spi in levubu showed decreasing significant trends over the study period the same relationship was realised in quaternary catchment a91 f i e a9n0008 and thohoyandou where both groundwater levels and the thohoyandou spi showed a decreasing trend although the spi trend was not significant this therefore shows that there exists a relationship between groundwater levels and hydro meteorological variables these findings are comparable to those obtained by kolusu et al 2019 which found that the 2015 2016 el nino induced extreme drought resulted in groundwater storage declines over the limpopo river basin the variation in the response of groundwater to the estimated hydrological extremes i e drought and floods in some stations for this study may be due to the fact that weather stations are not in the same position within the quaternary catchment 4 conclusion groundwater is a vital resource for domestic and irrigation water supply in rural areas dominantly characterized by semi arid climates this study aimed at evaluating the relationship between groundwater and hydrological extreme a semi arid catchment found in north eastern south africa indices i e spi and ssi were used as drought and flood indicators and the fdcs were further used to determine the exceedance of high and low flows in the lrc the wtf method was used to estimate groundwater recharge to further determine the relationship between hydrological extremes and groundwater levels trend analysis was performed the study found that although near normal conditions are dominant in the study area stations i e levubu and mukumbani showed drier conditions compared to pafuri and thohoyandou at the 50th percentile the middle reach of the catchment flow varied between 13 84 m3 s and 4 53 m3 s while the lower reaches showed the lowest flows at 1 62 m3 s the specific yield of geologic materials within the study area ranged from 0 04 to 0 06 groundwater recharge estimates ranged from 1 1 11 5 of mean annual rainfall about 60 of the stations i e streamflow groundwater and rainfall stations showed a significantly decreasing trend this therefore indicates that there was a decreasing trend in groundwater levels streamflow and rainfall over the study period the decreasing trends found on all the variables considered indicated that there is some relationship between variables considered in this study therefore when there is above average rainfall in the catchment groundwater levels are likely to increase and the opposite is the case during the dry periods studies such as varni et al 2013 have linked groundwater level rise to groundwater recharge and as such rainfall does have some form of linear relationship with groundwater recharge given the increasing frequency of hydrological extremes and the relationship they have with groundwater resources as shown in this study it is important to have stricter management practices implemented this will not only ensure the sustainability of the groundwater resources but also improve the livelihoods of rural communities who are dependent on groundwater resources for domestic water uses author s statement all persons who meet authorship criteria are listed as authors and

8143,study region the coast of the emilia romagna region in northern italy consists of about 210 km of sandy beaches that have been attracting tourists for decades since the 1980s erosion processes resulted in a remarkable beach retreat notwithstanding the construction of several protections works study focus in 2005 2006 and 2017 2020 30 floods of two small rivers feeding the beaches of ravenna fiumi uniti and savio were monitored and bedload was measured with a helly smith sampler riverbed bathymetric surveys were carried out after some selected floods to investigate the occurrence and geometry of alluvial bedforms the dune migration method was also used to calculate bedload results provided by this method are very encouraging new hydrological insights for the region to the authors knowledge this field investigation on the bedload transport of small coastal rivers is the first one of this kind in the adriatic and provides the regional land managers with a useful tool to predict the bedload yield for future scientifically based interventions and hopefully successful beach protection works the bedload data indicate a higher variability of bedload for discharges lower than bankfull flow whereas a stronger control of discharge is evident for larger floods though the bedload of the study rivers proved to be higher than in the largest river of the region it resulted rather low and witnesses sediment supply limited conditions keywords bedload sediment supply dunes dune migration coastal rivers 1 introduction the beaches of the italian northern adriatic sea are a very important environmental and touristic resource in the emilia romagna region the income generated by the beach holiday industry has always been a crucial component of the regional economy in the last four decades however this asset has been substantially threatened by severe beach erosion and retreat gambolati et al 1998 armaroli et al 2006 balouin et al 2006 in spite of the large number of beach protection works deployed most of the romagna beaches are still threatened by erosion the reasons of such environmental degradation are manifold and a matter of debate between scientists and land managers the sand supply from rivers is a crucial factor in the sedimentary budget of a beach but poorly known vorosmarty et al 2003 the romagna beaches are mainly fed by small sand bed rivers but information about the sand flux of the latter is rather limited in the international literature there are interesting studies on sediment transport in large sand bed rivers e g lukanda et al 1992 molinas and wu 2010 claude et al 2012 but very few papers investigated the bedload transport processes of small coastal rivers and their role in the beach stability a few authors e g church 2006 consider the sediment transport of sand bed rivers as suspension dominated with possibly significant bedload moving in the bedforms previous studies on sand bed rivers with dune bedforms of the emilia romagna coast e g preciso et al 2012 billi et al 2017 and unpublished data indicate that the sandy fraction accounts for less than 10 of the suspended load grain size distribution and consists only of fine and very fine sand in the coastal rivers of the study area the largest proportion of sand is transported as bedload and its measurement may contribute to understand and to quantify the potential supply of sand by small coastal rivers to the emilia romagna beaches quantification of the bedload transport for effective management of rivers with sand dominated bed material is paramount and strictly interconnected with bedforms migration over time several approaches and methods have been developed to quantify bedload but due to the complexity and variety of the processes involved no one universal method proved to provide reliable results for rivers with different characteristics gomez 2006 despite one of the most effective methods consists in direct field sampling with bedload samplers the occurrence of large bedforms such as dunes implies additional technical difficulties gaeuman and jacobson 2007 muhammad et al 2019 and a reduction of sampling efficiency hubbel 1987 gomez 1991 holmes 2010 in the romagna alluvial coastal plain rivers typically have very low gradients and a sandy streambed with moving alluvial bedforms such as dunes which suggest considering different approaches to asses bedload one of the most popular methods involves the extraction of time series elevation profile of the riverbed through echo sounding techniques simons et al 1965 van den berg 1987 dinehart 2002 villard and church 2003 wilbers and ten brinke 2003 holmes 2010 claude et al 2012 guala et al 2014 and bedforms geometry and celerity can be used to calculate bedload transport in natural rivers simons et al 1965 kostashuk and villard 1996 ashworth et al 2000 julien et al 2002 parsons et al 2005 holmes 2010 wintenberger et al 2015 schippa et al 2016 notwithstanding these valuable studies the development of models to estimate bedload transport by means of dune migration is still in progress and to the knowledge of the authors it has not been used in small coastal rivers holmes 2010 field data on river dune characteristics are scarce and referred to few rivers gabel 1993 julien and klaassen 1995 kostashuk and villard 1996 amsler and garcia 1997 carling et al 2000 mainly because of the difficulties involved in the field measurements mclean and smith 1979 grinvald and nikora 1988 kostashuk and villard 1996 as a consequence dunes were more commonly investigated in laboratory flumes under controlled steady and uniform flow conditions gilja and kuspilić 2018 guala et al 2020 moreover a lack of comparative analyses between laboratory and field studies does exist which is attributed to technical limitations sukhodolov et al 2006 holmes 2010 this paper presents the results of investigations on bedload transport and dune morphology through field measurements under different hydrometric conditions in the lower reaches of two small sand bed rivers entering the adriatic sea in northern italy cilli et al 2018 2020 main aims of this study are 1 to analyse the role of small rivers in supplying the sand to the beaches of the emilia romagna region 2 to investigate the current river sediment flux deficit in terms of upstream supply vs flow capacity 3 to test the reliability of the dune migration as an alternative method to assess the bedload transport of sand bed rivers this information is crucial for a scientifically based management of an economically very important touristic coast of the romagna region which has been severely threatened by beach erosion in the last five decades gambolati et al 1998 armaroli et al 2006 balouin et al 2006 the development of simple relations between flow discharge and bedload flux on the base of field data and the identification among the currently most used bedload equations of those capable of the best performance in terms of bedload prediction accuracy are useful and easy tools to carry out basic bedload investigations which are preliminary to the design of new beach protection engineering works and to depict the sand supply variability throughout the past decades in relation to the implementation of past beach erosion countermeasures 2 study area fiumi uniti and savio are two small river systems located 50 60 km south of the po river delta in the northern adriatic sea they both originate from the northern apennines and reach the adriatic sea after crossing the coastal plain of ravenna fig 1 the fiumi uniti river with a catchment of about 1199 km2 is the result of the man made merging of the lower reaches of the montone 532 km2 and ronco 625 km2 rivers near ravenna i e 12 km upstream of the river mouth in this latter reach the river receives some water from the surrounding croplands of neglectable hydrological importance so the total catchment area is slightly larger than the sum of monton and ronco catchments the fiumi uniti river enters the adriatic sea between lido adriano and lido di dante fig 1 the savio river has a catchment of 625 km2 is located a short distance to the south of the fiumi uniti and flows into the adriatic sea between lido di classe and lido di savio fig 1 in the headwaters both rivers are underlain by miocene turbidities sandstones and marlstones whereas the alluvial plain mainly consists of pliocene marine deposits and quaternary alluvial deposits amorosi et al 2002 mean annual precipitation is 1041 and 1005 mm for the fiumi uniti and savio catchments respectively in both the study river catchments the monthly precipitation follows a typical mediterranean pattern with a dry season from june to september a monthly peak in autumn in october and a secondary peak in late winter february and a long spring rainy season from march to may fig 2 mennella 1972 mean annual temperature is around 13 5 c for both basins in the downstream reach of both rivers a few dams and hydraulic structures are present for irrigation purposes and to prevent salt water intrusion the most influential is the rasponi sluice gate located 3 5 km upstream the fiumi uniti river outlet figs 3 and 4 all these dams are principally used for agricultural purposes and the local land reclamation authority controls their opening and closing during the flooding season i e from october to february and the dry period from march to september respectively the sediment transport monitoring sites are located at pedestrian and road bridges placed 8 km fiumi uniti and 3 5 km savio upstream of the river outlet respectively fig 4 at the measuring site both rivers have a straight channel with a rectangular cross section fig 4 the stream bed gradient is about 0 0003 for both the study rivers bed material is sand with a median diameter d50 of 0 43 mm in the fiumi uniti and 0 26 mm in the savio the tidal excursion of the adriatic sea along the coast of the study area is very limited as it does not exceed 0 7 m although the tidal range is almost negligible backwater effects are present during low flow conditions but are irrelevant during floods 3 methods 3 1 field measurements the streambed gradient was measured with a total station and bed material samples were collected by a us bmh 60 sediment sampler bed material samples were collected at each measuring vertical considered for the sediment transport monitoring and merged together to obtain a representative sample of the river cross section the samples were dry sieved with a ro tap shaker using sieves arranged on a ½ phi scale in the fiumi uniti field measurements of bedload transport flow hydrodynamics and streambed morphological changes were carried out in 2005 06 billi et al 2017 a new measuring campaign on both the fiumi uniti and the savio rivers started in 2017 and lasted until the early 2020 during floods hydraulic and sediment transport data were collected along established verticals equally spaced across the active portion of the streambed fig 4 flow velocity was measured at each vertical by means of a standard usgs aa type current meter following the standard two point method i e measuring flow velocity at 0 2 and 0 8 water depth h bedload transport was sampled at the same verticals immediately after the measurement of flow velocity a standard helley smith bedload sampler us bl 84 was used it had a 76 76 mm intake 0 1 mm of bag mesh and an expansion rate of 1 10 which is considered to have the highest efficiency emmet 1979 the hydraulic measurements were taken from the bridges at variable time intervals according to the rate of water level change detected by a staff gauge installed on the bridges since the timing of bedload sampling largely depends on the flow conditions it was calibrated after a few attempts in case of high floods and substantial sediment transport rates the sampling duration was 10 min longer sampling times as much as 20 min were necessary for floods with low transport rates in order to ensure the collection of a sufficient sample volume boiten 2003 grain size distribution was obtained for each bedload sample by removing the organic matter and other alien materials and then by dry sieving through a standard ro tap shaker with sieves arranged on a ½ phi scale bedforms and streambed morphological changes of the study rivers were surveyed at low discharge conditions in the aftermath of a few selected floods unfortunately it was not possible to have these measurements during high flood flows due to safety reasons and to their very short duration bathymetric data were collected from a small inflatable dinghy equipped with an ohmex sonarmite v1 single beam eco sounder sampling depth at 2 hz the bathymetric sounder was coupled with a dgps in rtk correction for positioning the instrument performed continuous recordings with 0 05 m of accuracy planimetric and vertical measurements were carried out both in zigzag and longitudinal tracks the longitudinal tracks were parallel to the banks whereas the zigzag tracks were carried out along a line making an angle of approximately 45 with the thalweg the longitudinal transects were at 0 25 0 50 and 0 75 width distance from one bank the boat velocity was maintained constant at about 2 m s in order to ensure the stability of the vessel and the accuracy of the measurements the surveyed reaches were located right upstream of the measuring sites and were about 1 km long fig 4 the rather short a few hours receding flood flow prevented the dune bedforms from reworking moreover the asynchrony between the flow conditions and the dune geometry which is commonly observed during flow level changes in large rivers kostaschuk and ilersich 1995 and flume experiments allen 1982 hu et al 2016 reesink et al 2018 makes it possible to associate the dune geometry surveyed during the late receding flood phase with close to peak flow levels the bathymetric data were post processed with a five data point moving average filter and interpolated with arcgis software through a topo to raster interpolation with a 0 5 m grid the interpolated streambed surfaces were used to evaluate the presence of bedforms which were assumed as immobile at low flow the collected data enabled to calculate the average dune height and wavelength 3 2 hydrodynamic modelling to compare the measured sediment transport the observed dune morphology and kinematics with bedload and bedform predictors it is necessary to derive the involved hydrodynamic parameters e g froude number energy grade bed shear stress stream power to this aim an integrated approach involving gis and a quasi steady flow routing model i e hec ras was used to determine the hydrodynamic condition along the study rivers and to account for the backwater effects induced by the movable sluice gate dam on the fiumi uniti fig 3 the latter according to its operating schedule was maintained open for the entire duration of the flood season autumn to spring and closed in the summer to prevent the upstream intrusion of the saltwater the model was used to calculate the energy gradient and the bed shear stress in the river reaches across the measuring sites a number of cross sections 31 and 20 of the fiumi uniti and savio respectively spaced about 300 m and surveyed by the emilia romagna region watershed technical service were interpolated using a dem imported into arcgis to obtain more closely spaced cross sections the public 10 m resolution dem provided by ingv tarquini et al 2007 2012 was merged with the river s cross sections provided by the basin authority to build a continuous model including the river bed topography for simulations within hec ras boundary conditions were retrieved from the recorded flood hydrograph and sea levels the model was calibrated using the observed water levels for 23 and 11 representative floods recorded in the recent years in the fiumi uniti and savio respectively the rasponi s sluice gate on the fiumi uniti fig 3 was modeled as a boundary condition accounting for the actual operation rule moreover the actual geometry of several representative river cross sections was verified by orthophotos satellite images and on site inspections these data were used to calculate the roughness distribution along the cross sections wetted perimeter including the contributions of the floodplain areas the assessment of the equivalent roughness was performed through the equivalent conveyance method the model calibration was done adjusting the roughness coefficients to get the better match with the observed water levels the calibration gave satisfactory results which allowed the determination of an equivalent manning s coefficient equal to n 0 019 m 1 3s and n 0 029 m 1 3s for the fiumi uniti and savio respectively 3 3 bedload transport as a function of dune bedforms migration the sediment transport involved in dune migration over medium to coarse grained sand bed river is generally assumed to represent bedload transport van den berg 1987 several studies have been proposed formulating theoretical models for flow over dunes mclean and smith 1986 nelson and smith 1989 mendoza and shen 1990 but only a few researchers linked sediment transport with self formed bedforms kostaschuk and ilersich 1995 holmes 2010 aberle et al 2012 leary and buscombe 2020 assuming dunes as two dimensional bedforms with a longitudinal triangular shape and steadily propagating downstream bedload transport can be quantified through dune characteristics using the sediment continuity formula proposed by simons et al 1965 i e the modified exner s 1925 equation which has been largely used in literature e g van den berg 1987 dinehart 2002 villard and church 2003 holmes 2010 aberle et al 2012 venditti et al 2016 1 qb 1 p ud h 2 in which q b is volumetric bed load transport rate per unit width p is bed porosity in case of sand bed is equal to 0 3 holmes 2010 h is mean dune height and u d is dune celerity dune geometry and celerity u d can be obtained from field measurements or in laboratory flumes in the scientific literature there is no evident agreement on the calculation of dune celerity u d in table 1 dune celerity u d equations considered for this study are reported among the several approaches available in literature those based on froude number fr and on mean flow velocity u were used in the present study since these parameters can be easily measured in the field moreover the dune dataset of gabel 1993 was reconsidered and a new fitting power law to calculate the dune celerity was derived table 1 4 results 4 1 flow and bedload field measurements measurements carried out in 2005 2006 and 2017 2020 resulted in a large at least at the study area scale dataset based on 23 floods monitored on the fiumi uniti 11 of which were measured by billi et al 2017 and 12 floods monitored on the savio the flow discharge of the monitored floods ranged from 13 to 358 m3s 1 in the fiumi uniti and from 7 to 234 m3s 1 in the savio the largest flood of 358 m3s 1 was one of the highest ever recorded in the fiumi uniti in the last decades billi et al 2017 the 234 m3s 1 flood can be also considered one of the highest of the savio grottoli et al 2020 in the savio an historical recording flow gauge is located a few kilometers upstream of the sampling site it has a relatively long data record from which it was possible to calculate for the highest flood monitored a return interval of 12 years in the fiumi uniti there is no recording flow gauge on its terminal reach recording stations are present however on the ronco and montone rivers but from these data it is difficult to extrapolate the return interval of the fiumi uniti floods given the independent hydrological behaviour of the two main tributaries on the base of the bankfull and maximum discharge regionalization presented by billi and fazzini 2017 for italy the flood flows of the fiumi uniti can be approximated to 1 6 time those of the savio this ratio also corresponds to that between the highest floods measured in the study rivers from this data we can presume a return interval of 20 years for the highest flood measured in the fiumi uniti flow velocity varied widely between 0 2 and 1 66 ms 1 in the fiumi uniti and from 0 21 to 1 50 ms 1 in the savio mean flow depth varied between 1 3 and 4 7 m in the fiumi uniti and from 1 99 to 3 96 m in the savio bedload transport was measured during 19 floods out of 24 of the fiumi uniti and during 12 floods of the savio the data show some control of flow discharge on bedload transport rate the relationship between unit bedload transport rate qb and unit flow discharge q fig 5 is expressed by the following interpolation equations 2 fiumi uniti qb 0 0149 q 0 009 r2 0 85 3 savio qb 0 0024 q 0 0021 r2 0 56 in which qb is the sediment transport rate in weight per unit with of the bed kg m 1 s 1 and q is the flow discharge per unit width m3s 1 m 1 both correlations are significant at the 0 01 significance level the field measurements confirmed that bedload was active across the entire streambed only during the larger floods whereas during smaller floods only the central portion of the river bed was involved average bedload d50 is medium to coarse sand 0 51 mm in the fiumi uniti and 0 48 mm in the savio and it is coarser than bed material which is 0 43 mm and 0 26 mm in the fiumi uniti and the savio respectively no significant variation of bedload d50 and d 90 with water discharge was observed fig 6 previous studies preciso et al 2012 billi et al 2017 in the reno and the fiumi uniti rivers indicated that martin 2003 equation and mayer peter and muller 1948 equation modified according to wong and parker 2006 returned the best approximation to bedload field data the upgraded data set of this study and the use of bed shear stress calculated through the hydrodynamic modelling described in section 3 2 confirms the findings of these authors martin s equation provided the best predictions especially for the savio river fig 7 this equation though it overpredicts and underpredicts bedload for the fiumi uniti and the savio respectively can be used to provide local technical administrations and professionals with a preliminary general information about the bedload flux to the beaches of the romagna coast since the geology climate and channel processes of the study rivers are similar to those of the other small streams in the area in both the study rivers the largest floods and the highest bedload rates tend to occur in spring whereas bedload seems not to be much influenced by any seasonality fig 8 though it is recognized by many authors e g robert 2003 that bedload is largely controlled by the flow transport capacity the study rivers and especially the fiumi uniti show a high variability of bedload transport rates which was also observed in other rivers and flume experiments fig 9 though in the latter the range is rather small in the study rivers it is evident that at low discharges flow is poorly correlated with bedload transport whereas during higher floods q 200 m3s 1 or specific discharge qu larger than 0 16 0 44 m3s 1 km 2 a consistent control of flow discharge on bedload transport is resumed fig 10 in fig 10 few additional data from other small rivers located in the same region i e romagna were included as well these additional small rivers are the lamone catchment area 530 km2 and the two most downstream tributaries of the reno river the santerno 700 km2 and the senio 450 km2 fig 1 the catchment size of these rivers is of the same order of magnitude of the fiumi uniti and the savio another interesting result was obtained comparing the bedload data of the romagna s largest river the reno catchment area 4628 km2 preciso et al 2012 with that of the small rivers considered in this study fig 11 the data in fig 11 show clearly that for comparable discharges the bedload contribution of the reno river to the romagna beaches is less than that of the small streams the bedload measuring site on the reno is located a few kilometers upstream of the santerno and senio tributaries confluence fig 1 a undertaking a catchment area of 3478 km2 that is from three to six time larger than that of the small streams the reasons for such a low bedload transport of the reno were clearly exposed by preciso et al 2012 and primarily refer to the effects of an intense human impact in the catchment and on the main river channel this evidence emphasizes the importance of the small streams in supplying the romagna beaches with sand and point out the poor bedload transport of the reno as one of the main components of the sediment unbalance along the study area coast 4 2 bathymetric survey and dune geometry four bathymetric surveys were carried out after selected floods one in 2005 billi et al 2017 and one in 2017 on the fiumi uniti and two in the 2017 2018 on the savio fig 12 table 2 reports the main data referred to the monitored floods including also the highest one of 358 m3s 1 recorded in 2005 by billi et al 2017 using the same field methods the bathymetric data were interpolated in arcgis obtaining a 0 5 m grid and smoothed profiles were extrapolated to obtain the dune geometry fig 13 bed profile data returned dune heights between 0 10 and 0 28 m for the fiumi uniti and between 0 12 and 0 16 m for the savio the mean dune wavelength was 15 41 m in the fiumi uniti and 6 65 m in the savio respectively dune steepness is about 0 007 in the fiumi uniti except for the 2005 flood which was about 0 02 and 0 02 in the savio table 3 the dune height and wavelength data measured in the study rivers were compared with a large dataset of river dunes available in the literature fig 14 table 3 the literature data refers to rivers in different environments jamuna and parana data from julien 1992 bergsche maas data from adriaanse 1986 and reported by julien 1992 meuse julien 1992 rhine data from wijbenga 1991 reported by julien 1992 calamus gabel 1993 fraser kostaschuk et al 1989 kostaschuk and ilersich 1995 villard and church 2003 liloet river in british columbia prent and hickin 2001 the study rivers bedforms geometry though comprised within the wide range of the literature data table 3 shows extreme characteristics dune steepness flow depth to dune height ratio and wavelength to flow depth ratio in fact are very close to the lower values of the available literature data fig 14 the study dunes have an average steepness of 0 015 and are comparatively flatter than the average dune of the literature data set fig 14c the flow depth to dune height fig 14a and the wavelength to flow depth ratios fig 14b are smaller than the mean values of the literature data in the study rivers in fact flow depth is equivalent to 3 7 hd dune height and wavelength is about 22 4 h flow depth that is about half and three times the average values of the literature these data indicate that the dunes of the study rivers are thinner shorter and flatter than those of other natural rivers and those produced in flume experiments e g kleinhans 2001 kleinhans et al 2002 4 3 dune bedforms migration and bedload the bedload transport data measured in the field qbm was compared with bedload transport predictions obtained by means of the dune migration method qbd eq 1 since no field data of dune celerity was available dune celerity was calculated by different criteria reported in the literature snishchenko and kopaliani 1978 gabel 1993 nikora et al 1997 and carling et al 2000 table 1 the results obtained are shown in table 4 in which the predictive performance qbm qbd of the selected methods is also reported from the data of table 4 it is evident that carling et al 2000 equation though underpredicting the actual values provides the best results for both the study rivers with the best performance for the savio r values closer to one and shorter ranges the comparison between predicted and field bedload measurements though based on few data confirms that the dune migration method is a valid alternative approach to assess the bedload supplied by small rivers to the beaches of the romagna region 5 discussion 5 1 bedload transport the majority of the beaches of the emilia romagna region are severely threatened by erosion processes that started several decades ago and became impressive in the 1980s gambolati et al 1998 armaroli et al 2006 balouin et al 2006 the bedload transport measurements described in this study were aimed at understanding the role of this important component in the observed unbalance of the coastal sediment budget in both the study rivers unit flow discharge and unit bedload transport are significantly p 0 01 correlated and eqs 2 and 3 can be used to obtain predictions of the sand flux to the local beaches the good correlation between field data and bedload predictions by martin 2003 equation especially for the savio r2 0 74 p 0 01 is not unexpected since the equation is based on unit stream power which in turn is tightly correlated with unit discharge however in the fiumi uniti river martin s equation overpredicts bedload by a factor 1 65 whereas in the savio it underpredicts bedload by a factor 16 7 at this stage of knowledge there is no evident explanation for such a different performance of martin s equation in the savio river the field data also showed a high variability of bedload transport rate in a mediterranean environment with a long dry summer and marked decrease in the forest canopy density in winter some seasonality of bedload would be expected in general the spring rains resulted in the largest floods and highest bedload transport rates even though high values were measured in any season if prolonged or short but very intense rains occur in italy and in the study area as well autumn is the season with the lowest vegetation protection in the cultivated land and the largest rainfall amounts and intensities nevertheless low rates of bedload transport were recorded in the study rivers fig 8 this result suggests a complex and still not fully understood relationship among sediment delivery from slopes bed material entrainment bedload transport and flow and partly accounts for the independent variability of flow and bedload transport combining the study rivers data with few unpublished data of other small rivers in the region different bedload flow discharge patterns became evident for low and high flows the latter show a significant correlation r2 0 81 p 0 01 whereas for discharges less than 150 m3s 1 i e slightly larger than bankfull discharge q 1 58 ranges between 94 and 150 m3s 1 bedload is highly variable probably during small floods issues related to the bedload sampling on a sandy streambed with moving dune bedforms emerge though the helley smith sampler used in this study is considered by emmet 1979 as the type with the best performance the inability to place the sampler in the correct sampling condition may result in bedload samples smaller or larger than the actual bedload especially during little floods another factor to consider is the variability of sediment supply though the data show no seasonality effect the occurrence of scours in the streambed may trap the incoming sediment whereas their emptying may release larger than expected sediment quantities another aspect to be considered is the suspension of bed material given the turbulence induced by the moving dunes in principles the resuspension of sand grains induced by the dunes should increase with the increase in flow velocity and depth nevertheless the lack of evident changes of bedload d50 and d90 with increasing discharge and the small fraction less than 10 of fine and very fine sand in the suspended load samples collected by a us dh 59 depth integrating sampler seems to contradict the assumption of large bed material contributions to suspended load church 2006 in sand bed rivers a possible explanation to this apparent inconsistency may stand in the capability of the helley smith sampler to capture also a significant proportion of the suspended bed material which is likely enhanced by the very flat aspect ratio of the dunes and the very low froude numbers calculated especially for the lower floods the suspended fine sand supply to the beach was not investigated further because fine sand is commonly unable to provide any significant contribution to the beach stability as fine sand grains are easily washed away and are often neglected in littoral sediment budget investigation to design beach erosion countermeasures hansona et al 2002 udo and yamawaki 2006 silva et al 2009 osborne 2018 mcfall 2019 bitan and zviely 2020 the movement of large sand waves whose existence was shown in a laboratory flume experiment by lisle et al 1997 and in the field lisle 2007 may be another factor of sediment supply variability the bathymetric profiles surveyed in the study rivers apparently show the occurrence of sediment waves whose wavelength is about 10 channel widths the processing of these data however is still in progress the downstream movement of such long sand waves may alter the sediment supply to the measuring site in two ways these streambed undulations may act as both sediment traps and sources whereas the transit of the interweaves trough at the measuring site may significantly reduce the quantity of the moving bedload which is mostly in suspension for the local turbulence and the higher shear stress the data suggest that during the higher floods the flow is more powerful and capable to entrain and transport bedload irrespective of the supply from upstream more sand is transported in suspension and the mixing effect of turbulence minimize the difference between the throughs and humps of both the small and large scale sand waves in order to qualitatively assess if the bedload flux of the study rivers reflects sediment supply conditions the unit bedload transport rates measured in the fiumi uniti was compared with flume and other rivers data fig 9 flume experiments on bedload transport are commonly carried out at or close to full saturation of the transport capacity and may represent a useful reference fig 9 shows that for comparable excess unit stream power values the bedload transport rates of the fiumi uniti are less than those observed in the flume experiments of williams 1970 but comparable to those of the east fork river and higher than those of the clearwater river these latter rivers have a mixed sand and fine gravel bedload whereas in the fiumi uniti it is medium sand thus attesting a small sediment supply under conditions of excess transport capacity a general situation of scarcity of bedload supply to the romagna coast also emerges by comparing the bedload rates of the smaller rivers with the reno the largest river of the region though the reno has a catchment from ten to five times larger than the study rivers and the other small rivers depicted in fig 1 for comparable flow discharges higher than 150 m3s 1 the bedload rates of the reno are lower than those of the smaller rivers fig 11 all these results and data point at an impoverishment of the sand supply to the romagna coast which partly explains the serious erosions processes that have been affecting the beaches of the region in the last decades the consciousness that the romagna rivers are transporting very little quantities of sand to the sea is an important staple in the discussion at land management level about the next plans to protect the starving beaches of the area the grain size of bedload contribution to the sea of both the study rivers is between medium to coarse sand d 50 is 0 50 and 0 49 mm in the fiumi uniti and the savio respectively however whether this sediment contribution is sufficient or not to naturally nourish the nearby coast is still debated grottoli et al 2020 other sampling campaigns on other rivers in the area are however necessary to extend the existing database and to confirm this worrying trend 5 2 dune morphology and bedload prediction bathymetric surveys carried out after four of the monitored floods revealed the presence of alluvial bedforms on the streambed of the study rivers the selected floods were characterised by a subcritical flow regime with froude numbers ranging between 0 14 and 0 25 table 3 i e flow conditions whereby the formation of dune bedforms is expected the dunes measured in the study rivers are flatter than those of many other natural rivers reported in the literature e g flemming 1978 kostaschuk et al 1989 prent and hickin 2001 schippa et al 2016 lisimenka and kubicki 2019 schippa 2020 the flume experiments of tuijnder et al 2009 demonstrated that dune steepness tends to increase with increasing sediment availability and flatter dunes are associated with sediment supply limited conditions the same authors also observed that dunes increase in size with increasing flow depth under alluvial conditions transport capacity limited conditions the data of tuijder et al 2009 also indicate that under sediment supply limited conditions dune height is almost not influenced by flow depth the dunes of the study rivers range very little in height from 0 10 to 0 28 m in spite of a wide range in flow discharges 22 358 m3s 1 which also includes one of the largest floods measured in the last decades in the fiumi uniti and a flood 1 5 times bankfull flow in the savio all these considerations lead to describe the dune geometry of the study rivers as typical of supply limited conditions confirming the poor bedload flux pointed out by the sediment transport sampling campaigns the field data of this study indicate that the dune migration method can return reliable predictions of bedload transport provided reliable field data are available or an appropriate method to calculate the dune celerity is selected the results of this study suggest that among the formulas selected to calculate the dune celerity the best performance is given by carling et al 2000 equation which seems to provide more realistic predictions for the study rivers this can be accounted for by the similarity between the dune steepness of our study rivers with carling et al 2000 dataset though the latter was obtained from field measurements on the rhine river i e on a much larger river in the study reach of carling et al 2000 sand dunes made up a patchy network migrating on a pebbly streambed this suggests a relative scarcity of fine sediment supply from upstream this also suggests that supply limited conditions can be assumed for the study rivers whose bedload transport was measured to be modest also with medium to high floods further field investigations on the factors controlling dune celerity are however necessary to improve the already satisfactory performance of the dune migration method to predict bedload transport in sand bed rivers 6 conclusions a field study to analyse the role of the sand supply to a severely eroding coast was carried out in two rivers fiumi uniti and savio representative of the main geo morphological and hydrological characteristics of small rivers in emilia romagna region coastal belt in italy recognizing the importance of moving bedform as a significant and interactive element of control on bedload transport the investigation focused on the quantification of bedload transport rate by field sampling and by the dune migrations method in the 2005 2006 and in the 2017 2020 intervals a wide dataset of about 30 floods were measured and the following main results were obtained 1 in the study rivers flow discharge is the best predictor of bedload transport a wide range of flood flows were measured demonstrating the presence of appreciable bedload transport even though sporadically the field measurements of bedload and the dune geometry confirmed a permanent supply limited condition the sandy sediment delivered by the study rivers to the romagna coast is small compared with other rivers in other parts of the planet and even with flume experiments this result contributes to uncover an important negative factor in the sediment budget and helps to explain the worrying beach retreat that has been affecting the romagna coast in the last decades it also provides a scientifically based information for planning appropriate mitigations measures 2 two significant p 0 01 interpolation equations eqs 3 and 4 were obtained to predict unit bedload transport from unit discharge of the study rivers 3 bedload is highly variable and poorly correlated with discharges for flows less than bankfull stage by contrast for discharges higher than bankfull flow controls 81 of bedload variability 4 previous studies on rivers in the romagna region showed that the modified meyer peter and muller 1948 and the martin 2003 equations return the best prediction of bedload transport this study confirmed that martin 2003 equation provided the best performance with a discrepancy ratio of 1 65 in the fiumi uniti and of 16 7 in the savio but with a determination coefficient r2 0 74 the simple bedload equations obtained in this study and martin 2003 equation can be used for a preliminary though approximate assessment of the bedload in other rivers of the romagna coast though these rivers have a sand bed with dune bed forms only 10 of suspended load consists of fine and very fine sand this allows to consider the bedload data measured in the field as a good approximation of the real bedload transport of the study rives 5 for comparable flow discharges a few small rivers proved to have higher bedload rates than the reno river the largest of romagna the catchment of which is from five to ten times larger than that of the small rivers the comparison with the bedload transport of similar rivers in the world indicates that also the bedload flux of the small rivers in the study area is rather small and it can be considered as an important factor in the severe erosion processes recorded in the romagna coast 6 the dune steepness the flow depth to dune height and wavelength ratios of the monitored dune confirm that the study rivers bedforms are flatter than those observed in other rivers and flume experiments the geometry of the monitored dunes though similar to those from the literature has distinctive characteristics that are supposed to result from sediment supply limited conditions this result confirms the general reduction of sediment supply to the romagna beaches 7 the study confirmed that the dune migration method in an acceptable alternative to field sampling of bedload transport a comparison between field data and prediction by the dune migration method using different equations to calculate the dune celerity showed that the best predictions were obtained using carling et al 2000 equation the discrepancy factor measured to predicted bedload transport ratio is 3 34 and 1 16 in the fiumi uniti and savio rivers respectively this study pointed out the importance of bedload field measurements in contributing to understand the sediment unbalance of eroding beaches and thus in suggesting a more comprehensive approach in the beach stabilization

8143,study region the coast of the emilia romagna region in northern italy consists of about 210 km of sandy beaches that have been attracting tourists for decades since the 1980s erosion processes resulted in a remarkable beach retreat notwithstanding the construction of several protections works study focus in 2005 2006 and 2017 2020 30 floods of two small rivers feeding the beaches of ravenna fiumi uniti and savio were monitored and bedload was measured with a helly smith sampler riverbed bathymetric surveys were carried out after some selected floods to investigate the occurrence and geometry of alluvial bedforms the dune migration method was also used to calculate bedload results provided by this method are very encouraging new hydrological insights for the region to the authors knowledge this field investigation on the bedload transport of small coastal rivers is the first one of this kind in the adriatic and provides the regional land managers with a useful tool to predict the bedload yield for future scientifically based interventions and hopefully successful beach protection works the bedload data indicate a higher variability of bedload for discharges lower than bankfull flow whereas a stronger control of discharge is evident for larger floods though the bedload of the study rivers proved to be higher than in the largest river of the region it resulted rather low and witnesses sediment supply limited conditions keywords bedload sediment supply dunes dune migration coastal rivers 1 introduction the beaches of the italian northern adriatic sea are a very important environmental and touristic resource in the emilia romagna region the income generated by the beach holiday industry has always been a crucial component of the regional economy in the last four decades however this asset has been substantially threatened by severe beach erosion and retreat gambolati et al 1998 armaroli et al 2006 balouin et al 2006 in spite of the large number of beach protection works deployed most of the romagna beaches are still threatened by erosion the reasons of such environmental degradation are manifold and a matter of debate between scientists and land managers the sand supply from rivers is a crucial factor in the sedimentary budget of a beach but poorly known vorosmarty et al 2003 the romagna beaches are mainly fed by small sand bed rivers but information about the sand flux of the latter is rather limited in the international literature there are interesting studies on sediment transport in large sand bed rivers e g lukanda et al 1992 molinas and wu 2010 claude et al 2012 but very few papers investigated the bedload transport processes of small coastal rivers and their role in the beach stability a few authors e g church 2006 consider the sediment transport of sand bed rivers as suspension dominated with possibly significant bedload moving in the bedforms previous studies on sand bed rivers with dune bedforms of the emilia romagna coast e g preciso et al 2012 billi et al 2017 and unpublished data indicate that the sandy fraction accounts for less than 10 of the suspended load grain size distribution and consists only of fine and very fine sand in the coastal rivers of the study area the largest proportion of sand is transported as bedload and its measurement may contribute to understand and to quantify the potential supply of sand by small coastal rivers to the emilia romagna beaches quantification of the bedload transport for effective management of rivers with sand dominated bed material is paramount and strictly interconnected with bedforms migration over time several approaches and methods have been developed to quantify bedload but due to the complexity and variety of the processes involved no one universal method proved to provide reliable results for rivers with different characteristics gomez 2006 despite one of the most effective methods consists in direct field sampling with bedload samplers the occurrence of large bedforms such as dunes implies additional technical difficulties gaeuman and jacobson 2007 muhammad et al 2019 and a reduction of sampling efficiency hubbel 1987 gomez 1991 holmes 2010 in the romagna alluvial coastal plain rivers typically have very low gradients and a sandy streambed with moving alluvial bedforms such as dunes which suggest considering different approaches to asses bedload one of the most popular methods involves the extraction of time series elevation profile of the riverbed through echo sounding techniques simons et al 1965 van den berg 1987 dinehart 2002 villard and church 2003 wilbers and ten brinke 2003 holmes 2010 claude et al 2012 guala et al 2014 and bedforms geometry and celerity can be used to calculate bedload transport in natural rivers simons et al 1965 kostashuk and villard 1996 ashworth et al 2000 julien et al 2002 parsons et al 2005 holmes 2010 wintenberger et al 2015 schippa et al 2016 notwithstanding these valuable studies the development of models to estimate bedload transport by means of dune migration is still in progress and to the knowledge of the authors it has not been used in small coastal rivers holmes 2010 field data on river dune characteristics are scarce and referred to few rivers gabel 1993 julien and klaassen 1995 kostashuk and villard 1996 amsler and garcia 1997 carling et al 2000 mainly because of the difficulties involved in the field measurements mclean and smith 1979 grinvald and nikora 1988 kostashuk and villard 1996 as a consequence dunes were more commonly investigated in laboratory flumes under controlled steady and uniform flow conditions gilja and kuspilić 2018 guala et al 2020 moreover a lack of comparative analyses between laboratory and field studies does exist which is attributed to technical limitations sukhodolov et al 2006 holmes 2010 this paper presents the results of investigations on bedload transport and dune morphology through field measurements under different hydrometric conditions in the lower reaches of two small sand bed rivers entering the adriatic sea in northern italy cilli et al 2018 2020 main aims of this study are 1 to analyse the role of small rivers in supplying the sand to the beaches of the emilia romagna region 2 to investigate the current river sediment flux deficit in terms of upstream supply vs flow capacity 3 to test the reliability of the dune migration as an alternative method to assess the bedload transport of sand bed rivers this information is crucial for a scientifically based management of an economically very important touristic coast of the romagna region which has been severely threatened by beach erosion in the last five decades gambolati et al 1998 armaroli et al 2006 balouin et al 2006 the development of simple relations between flow discharge and bedload flux on the base of field data and the identification among the currently most used bedload equations of those capable of the best performance in terms of bedload prediction accuracy are useful and easy tools to carry out basic bedload investigations which are preliminary to the design of new beach protection engineering works and to depict the sand supply variability throughout the past decades in relation to the implementation of past beach erosion countermeasures 2 study area fiumi uniti and savio are two small river systems located 50 60 km south of the po river delta in the northern adriatic sea they both originate from the northern apennines and reach the adriatic sea after crossing the coastal plain of ravenna fig 1 the fiumi uniti river with a catchment of about 1199 km2 is the result of the man made merging of the lower reaches of the montone 532 km2 and ronco 625 km2 rivers near ravenna i e 12 km upstream of the river mouth in this latter reach the river receives some water from the surrounding croplands of neglectable hydrological importance so the total catchment area is slightly larger than the sum of monton and ronco catchments the fiumi uniti river enters the adriatic sea between lido adriano and lido di dante fig 1 the savio river has a catchment of 625 km2 is located a short distance to the south of the fiumi uniti and flows into the adriatic sea between lido di classe and lido di savio fig 1 in the headwaters both rivers are underlain by miocene turbidities sandstones and marlstones whereas the alluvial plain mainly consists of pliocene marine deposits and quaternary alluvial deposits amorosi et al 2002 mean annual precipitation is 1041 and 1005 mm for the fiumi uniti and savio catchments respectively in both the study river catchments the monthly precipitation follows a typical mediterranean pattern with a dry season from june to september a monthly peak in autumn in october and a secondary peak in late winter february and a long spring rainy season from march to may fig 2 mennella 1972 mean annual temperature is around 13 5 c for both basins in the downstream reach of both rivers a few dams and hydraulic structures are present for irrigation purposes and to prevent salt water intrusion the most influential is the rasponi sluice gate located 3 5 km upstream the fiumi uniti river outlet figs 3 and 4 all these dams are principally used for agricultural purposes and the local land reclamation authority controls their opening and closing during the flooding season i e from october to february and the dry period from march to september respectively the sediment transport monitoring sites are located at pedestrian and road bridges placed 8 km fiumi uniti and 3 5 km savio upstream of the river outlet respectively fig 4 at the measuring site both rivers have a straight channel with a rectangular cross section fig 4 the stream bed gradient is about 0 0003 for both the study rivers bed material is sand with a median diameter d50 of 0 43 mm in the fiumi uniti and 0 26 mm in the savio the tidal excursion of the adriatic sea along the coast of the study area is very limited as it does not exceed 0 7 m although the tidal range is almost negligible backwater effects are present during low flow conditions but are irrelevant during floods 3 methods 3 1 field measurements the streambed gradient was measured with a total station and bed material samples were collected by a us bmh 60 sediment sampler bed material samples were collected at each measuring vertical considered for the sediment transport monitoring and merged together to obtain a representative sample of the river cross section the samples were dry sieved with a ro tap shaker using sieves arranged on a ½ phi scale in the fiumi uniti field measurements of bedload transport flow hydrodynamics and streambed morphological changes were carried out in 2005 06 billi et al 2017 a new measuring campaign on both the fiumi uniti and the savio rivers started in 2017 and lasted until the early 2020 during floods hydraulic and sediment transport data were collected along established verticals equally spaced across the active portion of the streambed fig 4 flow velocity was measured at each vertical by means of a standard usgs aa type current meter following the standard two point method i e measuring flow velocity at 0 2 and 0 8 water depth h bedload transport was sampled at the same verticals immediately after the measurement of flow velocity a standard helley smith bedload sampler us bl 84 was used it had a 76 76 mm intake 0 1 mm of bag mesh and an expansion rate of 1 10 which is considered to have the highest efficiency emmet 1979 the hydraulic measurements were taken from the bridges at variable time intervals according to the rate of water level change detected by a staff gauge installed on the bridges since the timing of bedload sampling largely depends on the flow conditions it was calibrated after a few attempts in case of high floods and substantial sediment transport rates the sampling duration was 10 min longer sampling times as much as 20 min were necessary for floods with low transport rates in order to ensure the collection of a sufficient sample volume boiten 2003 grain size distribution was obtained for each bedload sample by removing the organic matter and other alien materials and then by dry sieving through a standard ro tap shaker with sieves arranged on a ½ phi scale bedforms and streambed morphological changes of the study rivers were surveyed at low discharge conditions in the aftermath of a few selected floods unfortunately it was not possible to have these measurements during high flood flows due to safety reasons and to their very short duration bathymetric data were collected from a small inflatable dinghy equipped with an ohmex sonarmite v1 single beam eco sounder sampling depth at 2 hz the bathymetric sounder was coupled with a dgps in rtk correction for positioning the instrument performed continuous recordings with 0 05 m of accuracy planimetric and vertical measurements were carried out both in zigzag and longitudinal tracks the longitudinal tracks were parallel to the banks whereas the zigzag tracks were carried out along a line making an angle of approximately 45 with the thalweg the longitudinal transects were at 0 25 0 50 and 0 75 width distance from one bank the boat velocity was maintained constant at about 2 m s in order to ensure the stability of the vessel and the accuracy of the measurements the surveyed reaches were located right upstream of the measuring sites and were about 1 km long fig 4 the rather short a few hours receding flood flow prevented the dune bedforms from reworking moreover the asynchrony between the flow conditions and the dune geometry which is commonly observed during flow level changes in large rivers kostaschuk and ilersich 1995 and flume experiments allen 1982 hu et al 2016 reesink et al 2018 makes it possible to associate the dune geometry surveyed during the late receding flood phase with close to peak flow levels the bathymetric data were post processed with a five data point moving average filter and interpolated with arcgis software through a topo to raster interpolation with a 0 5 m grid the interpolated streambed surfaces were used to evaluate the presence of bedforms which were assumed as immobile at low flow the collected data enabled to calculate the average dune height and wavelength 3 2 hydrodynamic modelling to compare the measured sediment transport the observed dune morphology and kinematics with bedload and bedform predictors it is necessary to derive the involved hydrodynamic parameters e g froude number energy grade bed shear stress stream power to this aim an integrated approach involving gis and a quasi steady flow routing model i e hec ras was used to determine the hydrodynamic condition along the study rivers and to account for the backwater effects induced by the movable sluice gate dam on the fiumi uniti fig 3 the latter according to its operating schedule was maintained open for the entire duration of the flood season autumn to spring and closed in the summer to prevent the upstream intrusion of the saltwater the model was used to calculate the energy gradient and the bed shear stress in the river reaches across the measuring sites a number of cross sections 31 and 20 of the fiumi uniti and savio respectively spaced about 300 m and surveyed by the emilia romagna region watershed technical service were interpolated using a dem imported into arcgis to obtain more closely spaced cross sections the public 10 m resolution dem provided by ingv tarquini et al 2007 2012 was merged with the river s cross sections provided by the basin authority to build a continuous model including the river bed topography for simulations within hec ras boundary conditions were retrieved from the recorded flood hydrograph and sea levels the model was calibrated using the observed water levels for 23 and 11 representative floods recorded in the recent years in the fiumi uniti and savio respectively the rasponi s sluice gate on the fiumi uniti fig 3 was modeled as a boundary condition accounting for the actual operation rule moreover the actual geometry of several representative river cross sections was verified by orthophotos satellite images and on site inspections these data were used to calculate the roughness distribution along the cross sections wetted perimeter including the contributions of the floodplain areas the assessment of the equivalent roughness was performed through the equivalent conveyance method the model calibration was done adjusting the roughness coefficients to get the better match with the observed water levels the calibration gave satisfactory results which allowed the determination of an equivalent manning s coefficient equal to n 0 019 m 1 3s and n 0 029 m 1 3s for the fiumi uniti and savio respectively 3 3 bedload transport as a function of dune bedforms migration the sediment transport involved in dune migration over medium to coarse grained sand bed river is generally assumed to represent bedload transport van den berg 1987 several studies have been proposed formulating theoretical models for flow over dunes mclean and smith 1986 nelson and smith 1989 mendoza and shen 1990 but only a few researchers linked sediment transport with self formed bedforms kostaschuk and ilersich 1995 holmes 2010 aberle et al 2012 leary and buscombe 2020 assuming dunes as two dimensional bedforms with a longitudinal triangular shape and steadily propagating downstream bedload transport can be quantified through dune characteristics using the sediment continuity formula proposed by simons et al 1965 i e the modified exner s 1925 equation which has been largely used in literature e g van den berg 1987 dinehart 2002 villard and church 2003 holmes 2010 aberle et al 2012 venditti et al 2016 1 qb 1 p ud h 2 in which q b is volumetric bed load transport rate per unit width p is bed porosity in case of sand bed is equal to 0 3 holmes 2010 h is mean dune height and u d is dune celerity dune geometry and celerity u d can be obtained from field measurements or in laboratory flumes in the scientific literature there is no evident agreement on the calculation of dune celerity u d in table 1 dune celerity u d equations considered for this study are reported among the several approaches available in literature those based on froude number fr and on mean flow velocity u were used in the present study since these parameters can be easily measured in the field moreover the dune dataset of gabel 1993 was reconsidered and a new fitting power law to calculate the dune celerity was derived table 1 4 results 4 1 flow and bedload field measurements measurements carried out in 2005 2006 and 2017 2020 resulted in a large at least at the study area scale dataset based on 23 floods monitored on the fiumi uniti 11 of which were measured by billi et al 2017 and 12 floods monitored on the savio the flow discharge of the monitored floods ranged from 13 to 358 m3s 1 in the fiumi uniti and from 7 to 234 m3s 1 in the savio the largest flood of 358 m3s 1 was one of the highest ever recorded in the fiumi uniti in the last decades billi et al 2017 the 234 m3s 1 flood can be also considered one of the highest of the savio grottoli et al 2020 in the savio an historical recording flow gauge is located a few kilometers upstream of the sampling site it has a relatively long data record from which it was possible to calculate for the highest flood monitored a return interval of 12 years in the fiumi uniti there is no recording flow gauge on its terminal reach recording stations are present however on the ronco and montone rivers but from these data it is difficult to extrapolate the return interval of the fiumi uniti floods given the independent hydrological behaviour of the two main tributaries on the base of the bankfull and maximum discharge regionalization presented by billi and fazzini 2017 for italy the flood flows of the fiumi uniti can be approximated to 1 6 time those of the savio this ratio also corresponds to that between the highest floods measured in the study rivers from this data we can presume a return interval of 20 years for the highest flood measured in the fiumi uniti flow velocity varied widely between 0 2 and 1 66 ms 1 in the fiumi uniti and from 0 21 to 1 50 ms 1 in the savio mean flow depth varied between 1 3 and 4 7 m in the fiumi uniti and from 1 99 to 3 96 m in the savio bedload transport was measured during 19 floods out of 24 of the fiumi uniti and during 12 floods of the savio the data show some control of flow discharge on bedload transport rate the relationship between unit bedload transport rate qb and unit flow discharge q fig 5 is expressed by the following interpolation equations 2 fiumi uniti qb 0 0149 q 0 009 r2 0 85 3 savio qb 0 0024 q 0 0021 r2 0 56 in which qb is the sediment transport rate in weight per unit with of the bed kg m 1 s 1 and q is the flow discharge per unit width m3s 1 m 1 both correlations are significant at the 0 01 significance level the field measurements confirmed that bedload was active across the entire streambed only during the larger floods whereas during smaller floods only the central portion of the river bed was involved average bedload d50 is medium to coarse sand 0 51 mm in the fiumi uniti and 0 48 mm in the savio and it is coarser than bed material which is 0 43 mm and 0 26 mm in the fiumi uniti and the savio respectively no significant variation of bedload d50 and d 90 with water discharge was observed fig 6 previous studies preciso et al 2012 billi et al 2017 in the reno and the fiumi uniti rivers indicated that martin 2003 equation and mayer peter and muller 1948 equation modified according to wong and parker 2006 returned the best approximation to bedload field data the upgraded data set of this study and the use of bed shear stress calculated through the hydrodynamic modelling described in section 3 2 confirms the findings of these authors martin s equation provided the best predictions especially for the savio river fig 7 this equation though it overpredicts and underpredicts bedload for the fiumi uniti and the savio respectively can be used to provide local technical administrations and professionals with a preliminary general information about the bedload flux to the beaches of the romagna coast since the geology climate and channel processes of the study rivers are similar to those of the other small streams in the area in both the study rivers the largest floods and the highest bedload rates tend to occur in spring whereas bedload seems not to be much influenced by any seasonality fig 8 though it is recognized by many authors e g robert 2003 that bedload is largely controlled by the flow transport capacity the study rivers and especially the fiumi uniti show a high variability of bedload transport rates which was also observed in other rivers and flume experiments fig 9 though in the latter the range is rather small in the study rivers it is evident that at low discharges flow is poorly correlated with bedload transport whereas during higher floods q 200 m3s 1 or specific discharge qu larger than 0 16 0 44 m3s 1 km 2 a consistent control of flow discharge on bedload transport is resumed fig 10 in fig 10 few additional data from other small rivers located in the same region i e romagna were included as well these additional small rivers are the lamone catchment area 530 km2 and the two most downstream tributaries of the reno river the santerno 700 km2 and the senio 450 km2 fig 1 the catchment size of these rivers is of the same order of magnitude of the fiumi uniti and the savio another interesting result was obtained comparing the bedload data of the romagna s largest river the reno catchment area 4628 km2 preciso et al 2012 with that of the small rivers considered in this study fig 11 the data in fig 11 show clearly that for comparable discharges the bedload contribution of the reno river to the romagna beaches is less than that of the small streams the bedload measuring site on the reno is located a few kilometers upstream of the santerno and senio tributaries confluence fig 1 a undertaking a catchment area of 3478 km2 that is from three to six time larger than that of the small streams the reasons for such a low bedload transport of the reno were clearly exposed by preciso et al 2012 and primarily refer to the effects of an intense human impact in the catchment and on the main river channel this evidence emphasizes the importance of the small streams in supplying the romagna beaches with sand and point out the poor bedload transport of the reno as one of the main components of the sediment unbalance along the study area coast 4 2 bathymetric survey and dune geometry four bathymetric surveys were carried out after selected floods one in 2005 billi et al 2017 and one in 2017 on the fiumi uniti and two in the 2017 2018 on the savio fig 12 table 2 reports the main data referred to the monitored floods including also the highest one of 358 m3s 1 recorded in 2005 by billi et al 2017 using the same field methods the bathymetric data were interpolated in arcgis obtaining a 0 5 m grid and smoothed profiles were extrapolated to obtain the dune geometry fig 13 bed profile data returned dune heights between 0 10 and 0 28 m for the fiumi uniti and between 0 12 and 0 16 m for the savio the mean dune wavelength was 15 41 m in the fiumi uniti and 6 65 m in the savio respectively dune steepness is about 0 007 in the fiumi uniti except for the 2005 flood which was about 0 02 and 0 02 in the savio table 3 the dune height and wavelength data measured in the study rivers were compared with a large dataset of river dunes available in the literature fig 14 table 3 the literature data refers to rivers in different environments jamuna and parana data from julien 1992 bergsche maas data from adriaanse 1986 and reported by julien 1992 meuse julien 1992 rhine data from wijbenga 1991 reported by julien 1992 calamus gabel 1993 fraser kostaschuk et al 1989 kostaschuk and ilersich 1995 villard and church 2003 liloet river in british columbia prent and hickin 2001 the study rivers bedforms geometry though comprised within the wide range of the literature data table 3 shows extreme characteristics dune steepness flow depth to dune height ratio and wavelength to flow depth ratio in fact are very close to the lower values of the available literature data fig 14 the study dunes have an average steepness of 0 015 and are comparatively flatter than the average dune of the literature data set fig 14c the flow depth to dune height fig 14a and the wavelength to flow depth ratios fig 14b are smaller than the mean values of the literature data in the study rivers in fact flow depth is equivalent to 3 7 hd dune height and wavelength is about 22 4 h flow depth that is about half and three times the average values of the literature these data indicate that the dunes of the study rivers are thinner shorter and flatter than those of other natural rivers and those produced in flume experiments e g kleinhans 2001 kleinhans et al 2002 4 3 dune bedforms migration and bedload the bedload transport data measured in the field qbm was compared with bedload transport predictions obtained by means of the dune migration method qbd eq 1 since no field data of dune celerity was available dune celerity was calculated by different criteria reported in the literature snishchenko and kopaliani 1978 gabel 1993 nikora et al 1997 and carling et al 2000 table 1 the results obtained are shown in table 4 in which the predictive performance qbm qbd of the selected methods is also reported from the data of table 4 it is evident that carling et al 2000 equation though underpredicting the actual values provides the best results for both the study rivers with the best performance for the savio r values closer to one and shorter ranges the comparison between predicted and field bedload measurements though based on few data confirms that the dune migration method is a valid alternative approach to assess the bedload supplied by small rivers to the beaches of the romagna region 5 discussion 5 1 bedload transport the majority of the beaches of the emilia romagna region are severely threatened by erosion processes that started several decades ago and became impressive in the 1980s gambolati et al 1998 armaroli et al 2006 balouin et al 2006 the bedload transport measurements described in this study were aimed at understanding the role of this important component in the observed unbalance of the coastal sediment budget in both the study rivers unit flow discharge and unit bedload transport are significantly p 0 01 correlated and eqs 2 and 3 can be used to obtain predictions of the sand flux to the local beaches the good correlation between field data and bedload predictions by martin 2003 equation especially for the savio r2 0 74 p 0 01 is not unexpected since the equation is based on unit stream power which in turn is tightly correlated with unit discharge however in the fiumi uniti river martin s equation overpredicts bedload by a factor 1 65 whereas in the savio it underpredicts bedload by a factor 16 7 at this stage of knowledge there is no evident explanation for such a different performance of martin s equation in the savio river the field data also showed a high variability of bedload transport rate in a mediterranean environment with a long dry summer and marked decrease in the forest canopy density in winter some seasonality of bedload would be expected in general the spring rains resulted in the largest floods and highest bedload transport rates even though high values were measured in any season if prolonged or short but very intense rains occur in italy and in the study area as well autumn is the season with the lowest vegetation protection in the cultivated land and the largest rainfall amounts and intensities nevertheless low rates of bedload transport were recorded in the study rivers fig 8 this result suggests a complex and still not fully understood relationship among sediment delivery from slopes bed material entrainment bedload transport and flow and partly accounts for the independent variability of flow and bedload transport combining the study rivers data with few unpublished data of other small rivers in the region different bedload flow discharge patterns became evident for low and high flows the latter show a significant correlation r2 0 81 p 0 01 whereas for discharges less than 150 m3s 1 i e slightly larger than bankfull discharge q 1 58 ranges between 94 and 150 m3s 1 bedload is highly variable probably during small floods issues related to the bedload sampling on a sandy streambed with moving dune bedforms emerge though the helley smith sampler used in this study is considered by emmet 1979 as the type with the best performance the inability to place the sampler in the correct sampling condition may result in bedload samples smaller or larger than the actual bedload especially during little floods another factor to consider is the variability of sediment supply though the data show no seasonality effect the occurrence of scours in the streambed may trap the incoming sediment whereas their emptying may release larger than expected sediment quantities another aspect to be considered is the suspension of bed material given the turbulence induced by the moving dunes in principles the resuspension of sand grains induced by the dunes should increase with the increase in flow velocity and depth nevertheless the lack of evident changes of bedload d50 and d90 with increasing discharge and the small fraction less than 10 of fine and very fine sand in the suspended load samples collected by a us dh 59 depth integrating sampler seems to contradict the assumption of large bed material contributions to suspended load church 2006 in sand bed rivers a possible explanation to this apparent inconsistency may stand in the capability of the helley smith sampler to capture also a significant proportion of the suspended bed material which is likely enhanced by the very flat aspect ratio of the dunes and the very low froude numbers calculated especially for the lower floods the suspended fine sand supply to the beach was not investigated further because fine sand is commonly unable to provide any significant contribution to the beach stability as fine sand grains are easily washed away and are often neglected in littoral sediment budget investigation to design beach erosion countermeasures hansona et al 2002 udo and yamawaki 2006 silva et al 2009 osborne 2018 mcfall 2019 bitan and zviely 2020 the movement of large sand waves whose existence was shown in a laboratory flume experiment by lisle et al 1997 and in the field lisle 2007 may be another factor of sediment supply variability the bathymetric profiles surveyed in the study rivers apparently show the occurrence of sediment waves whose wavelength is about 10 channel widths the processing of these data however is still in progress the downstream movement of such long sand waves may alter the sediment supply to the measuring site in two ways these streambed undulations may act as both sediment traps and sources whereas the transit of the interweaves trough at the measuring site may significantly reduce the quantity of the moving bedload which is mostly in suspension for the local turbulence and the higher shear stress the data suggest that during the higher floods the flow is more powerful and capable to entrain and transport bedload irrespective of the supply from upstream more sand is transported in suspension and the mixing effect of turbulence minimize the difference between the throughs and humps of both the small and large scale sand waves in order to qualitatively assess if the bedload flux of the study rivers reflects sediment supply conditions the unit bedload transport rates measured in the fiumi uniti was compared with flume and other rivers data fig 9 flume experiments on bedload transport are commonly carried out at or close to full saturation of the transport capacity and may represent a useful reference fig 9 shows that for comparable excess unit stream power values the bedload transport rates of the fiumi uniti are less than those observed in the flume experiments of williams 1970 but comparable to those of the east fork river and higher than those of the clearwater river these latter rivers have a mixed sand and fine gravel bedload whereas in the fiumi uniti it is medium sand thus attesting a small sediment supply under conditions of excess transport capacity a general situation of scarcity of bedload supply to the romagna coast also emerges by comparing the bedload rates of the smaller rivers with the reno the largest river of the region though the reno has a catchment from ten to five times larger than the study rivers and the other small rivers depicted in fig 1 for comparable flow discharges higher than 150 m3s 1 the bedload rates of the reno are lower than those of the smaller rivers fig 11 all these results and data point at an impoverishment of the sand supply to the romagna coast which partly explains the serious erosions processes that have been affecting the beaches of the region in the last decades the consciousness that the romagna rivers are transporting very little quantities of sand to the sea is an important staple in the discussion at land management level about the next plans to protect the starving beaches of the area the grain size of bedload contribution to the sea of both the study rivers is between medium to coarse sand d 50 is 0 50 and 0 49 mm in the fiumi uniti and the savio respectively however whether this sediment contribution is sufficient or not to naturally nourish the nearby coast is still debated grottoli et al 2020 other sampling campaigns on other rivers in the area are however necessary to extend the existing database and to confirm this worrying trend 5 2 dune morphology and bedload prediction bathymetric surveys carried out after four of the monitored floods revealed the presence of alluvial bedforms on the streambed of the study rivers the selected floods were characterised by a subcritical flow regime with froude numbers ranging between 0 14 and 0 25 table 3 i e flow conditions whereby the formation of dune bedforms is expected the dunes measured in the study rivers are flatter than those of many other natural rivers reported in the literature e g flemming 1978 kostaschuk et al 1989 prent and hickin 2001 schippa et al 2016 lisimenka and kubicki 2019 schippa 2020 the flume experiments of tuijnder et al 2009 demonstrated that dune steepness tends to increase with increasing sediment availability and flatter dunes are associated with sediment supply limited conditions the same authors also observed that dunes increase in size with increasing flow depth under alluvial conditions transport capacity limited conditions the data of tuijder et al 2009 also indicate that under sediment supply limited conditions dune height is almost not influenced by flow depth the dunes of the study rivers range very little in height from 0 10 to 0 28 m in spite of a wide range in flow discharges 22 358 m3s 1 which also includes one of the largest floods measured in the last decades in the fiumi uniti and a flood 1 5 times bankfull flow in the savio all these considerations lead to describe the dune geometry of the study rivers as typical of supply limited conditions confirming the poor bedload flux pointed out by the sediment transport sampling campaigns the field data of this study indicate that the dune migration method can return reliable predictions of bedload transport provided reliable field data are available or an appropriate method to calculate the dune celerity is selected the results of this study suggest that among the formulas selected to calculate the dune celerity the best performance is given by carling et al 2000 equation which seems to provide more realistic predictions for the study rivers this can be accounted for by the similarity between the dune steepness of our study rivers with carling et al 2000 dataset though the latter was obtained from field measurements on the rhine river i e on a much larger river in the study reach of carling et al 2000 sand dunes made up a patchy network migrating on a pebbly streambed this suggests a relative scarcity of fine sediment supply from upstream this also suggests that supply limited conditions can be assumed for the study rivers whose bedload transport was measured to be modest also with medium to high floods further field investigations on the factors controlling dune celerity are however necessary to improve the already satisfactory performance of the dune migration method to predict bedload transport in sand bed rivers 6 conclusions a field study to analyse the role of the sand supply to a severely eroding coast was carried out in two rivers fiumi uniti and savio representative of the main geo morphological and hydrological characteristics of small rivers in emilia romagna region coastal belt in italy recognizing the importance of moving bedform as a significant and interactive element of control on bedload transport the investigation focused on the quantification of bedload transport rate by field sampling and by the dune migrations method in the 2005 2006 and in the 2017 2020 intervals a wide dataset of about 30 floods were measured and the following main results were obtained 1 in the study rivers flow discharge is the best predictor of bedload transport a wide range of flood flows were measured demonstrating the presence of appreciable bedload transport even though sporadically the field measurements of bedload and the dune geometry confirmed a permanent supply limited condition the sandy sediment delivered by the study rivers to the romagna coast is small compared with other rivers in other parts of the planet and even with flume experiments this result contributes to uncover an important negative factor in the sediment budget and helps to explain the worrying beach retreat that has been affecting the romagna coast in the last decades it also provides a scientifically based information for planning appropriate mitigations measures 2 two significant p 0 01 interpolation equations eqs 3 and 4 were obtained to predict unit bedload transport from unit discharge of the study rivers 3 bedload is highly variable and poorly correlated with discharges for flows less than bankfull stage by contrast for discharges higher than bankfull flow controls 81 of bedload variability 4 previous studies on rivers in the romagna region showed that the modified meyer peter and muller 1948 and the martin 2003 equations return the best prediction of bedload transport this study confirmed that martin 2003 equation provided the best performance with a discrepancy ratio of 1 65 in the fiumi uniti and of 16 7 in the savio but with a determination coefficient r2 0 74 the simple bedload equations obtained in this study and martin 2003 equation can be used for a preliminary though approximate assessment of the bedload in other rivers of the romagna coast though these rivers have a sand bed with dune bed forms only 10 of suspended load consists of fine and very fine sand this allows to consider the bedload data measured in the field as a good approximation of the real bedload transport of the study rives 5 for comparable flow discharges a few small rivers proved to have higher bedload rates than the reno river the largest of romagna the catchment of which is from five to ten times larger than that of the small rivers the comparison with the bedload transport of similar rivers in the world indicates that also the bedload flux of the small rivers in the study area is rather small and it can be considered as an important factor in the severe erosion processes recorded in the romagna coast 6 the dune steepness the flow depth to dune height and wavelength ratios of the monitored dune confirm that the study rivers bedforms are flatter than those observed in other rivers and flume experiments the geometry of the monitored dunes though similar to those from the literature has distinctive characteristics that are supposed to result from sediment supply limited conditions this result confirms the general reduction of sediment supply to the romagna beaches 7 the study confirmed that the dune migration method in an acceptable alternative to field sampling of bedload transport a comparison between field data and prediction by the dune migration method using different equations to calculate the dune celerity showed that the best predictions were obtained using carling et al 2000 equation the discrepancy factor measured to predicted bedload transport ratio is 3 34 and 1 16 in the fiumi uniti and savio rivers respectively this study pointed out the importance of bedload field measurements in contributing to understand the sediment unbalance of eroding beaches and thus in suggesting a more comprehensive approach in the beach stabilization

8144,study region central europe czechia study focus mountains are referred to as water towers because they substantially affect the hydrology of downstream areas however snow storages will decrease in the future due to the increase in air temperature which will affect streamflow regime main objectives of this study were 1 to simulate the future changes in snow for a large set of mountain catchments in czechia reflecting a wide range of climate projections and 2 to analyse how the snow changes will affect groundwater recharge streamflow seasonality and low flows in the future new hydrological insights the future hydrological projections showed a decrease in annual maximum swe by 30 70 in the study area until the end of the 21st century additionally snowmelt was found to occur on average 3 4 weeks earlier the results showed the large variability between individual climate chains and indicated that the increase in air temperature causing the decrease in snowfall might be partly compensated by the increase in winter precipitation changes in snowpack will cause the highest streamflow during melting season to occur one month earlier in addition to lower spring runoff volumes due to lower snowmelt inputs the future climate projections leading to overall dry conditions in summer are associated with both the lowest summer precipitation and seasonal snowpack the expected lower snow storages might therefore contribute to more extreme low flow periods keywords climate change snow snowmelt runoff seasonal runoff low flows 1 introduction mountain snowpack is highly sensitive to air temperature which influences the phase of precipitation as a result of increasing air temperature documented by observations the snowfall fraction the proportion of snowfall water equivalent to the total amount of precipitation over the given period decreases knowles et al 2006 this decrease leads to a generally decreasing snowpack later snow accumulation and earlier snowmelt fyfe et al 2017 marty et al 2017b for example zeng et al 2018 showed that in the most affected parts of the western united states the annual maximum swe decreased on average by 41 and the snow season was shortened by 34 days it is also predicted that the above changes will continue in the future due to further changes in climate jenicek et al 2018 marty et al 2017a musselman et al 2017a nevertheless the response of snow to the increase in air temperature is often not straightforward resulting in a large spatial variability between individual regions and elevations with different climate blahušiaková et al 2020 cooper et al 2016 for example the negative effect of increasing temperatures on snow storage may be partially compensated by an increase in precipitation specifically by the increase in the number of extreme snowfall events lute et al 2015 marshall et al 2020 below average snow conditions defined as snow drought can be caused by either high air temperatures or low winter precipitation or a combination of both cooper et al 2016 harpold et al 2017 with predicted future warming many regions might become more susceptible to snow droughts especially those with winter air temperatures currently close to the freezing point dierauer et al 2019 it is well known that changes in climate indices specifically snowfall and snow storages significantly affect the seasonal water balance and rainfall runoff process langhammer and bernsteinová 2020 mountain areas behave as a complex system where the total catchment runoff is a mixture of different input components namely rainfall snowmelt and potentially glacier melt this mixing substantially affects the seasonal distribution of runoff during a water year many studies calculated the relative importance of snow in generating runoff compared to rainfall berghuijs et al 2014 jenicek and ledvinka 2020a meriö et al 2019 resulting in the fact that a higher fraction of snow generated runoff leaves the catchment than what would correspond to the snowfall fraction li et al 2017 this might be explained e g by the lower winter evaporation causing the higher winter runoff coefficients compared to the summer period lower water demand by vegetation and differences in soil moisture and runoff generation during snowmelt compared to rainfall barnhart et al 2016 nevertheless the decreasing snowfall and thus lower runoff inputs from snowmelt during spring may be offset by increasing rain inputs to the total runoff during winter hammond and kampf 2020 this increase in winter runoff is predicted also for central europe including czechia hanel et al 2012 lamačová et al 2014 zheng et al 2021 although the water balance in this area is expected to change mostly in summer due to the increase in evapotranspiration which mostly contributes to changes in summer low flows lamačová et al 2014 vlach et al 2020 snowmelt also strongly affects soil moisture and groundwater recharge and thus it influences the catchment storage runoff seasonality and baseflow snowmelt may control relative partitioning of the water between evapotranspiration and groundwater recharge leading to higher runoff barnhart et al 2016 decreasing snowfall fraction and thus lower and earlier snowmelt causes decrease in early summer soil moisture potopová et al 2016 higher elevations areas play an important role in the catchment storage as they store a lot of water floriancic et al 2018 hood and hayashi 2015 šípek et al 2021 staudinger et al 2017 and thus support the streamflow at lower elevations which is important mainly during low flow periods cochand et al 2019 the groundwater recharge in upper parts of the snow dominated catchments appears decoupled from year to year variations in snow storages and thus those areas are often resilient to droughts carroll et al 2019 the ongoing changes in snow storages snowmelt and changes in spring and summer runoff including low flows are at the centre of recent research blahušiaková et al 2020 dierauer et al 2018 li et al 2018 van loon et al 2015 vlach et al 2020 higher snowpack may lead to higher baseflow hammond et al 2018 which influences summer low flows together with later melt out for years with higher snowpack the summer low flows may be higher than for years with lower snowpack this is especially valid for the mediterranean climate with uneven precipitation distribution between winter and summer dierauer et al 2018 godsey et al 2014 nevertheless the positive effect of higher snowpack for summer low flows may be seen also for humid catchments with precipitation more equally distributed in the water year jenicek and ledvinka 2020a although summer rainfall and evapotranspiration is certainly more important cooper et al 2018 floriancic et al 2020 šípek et al 2021 with future climate changes the positive effect of snow on summer runoff and low flows may decrease at higher elevations and completely disappear at middle and low elevations consequently the low flows might drop to even lower values not only because of higher evapotranspiration and potential decrease in precipitation but also due to lower seasonal snowpack although many studies quantified the impact of climate changes on the water cycle less attention has been paid to how future snow changes influence summer runoff and low flows considering a wide range of hydrological responses to different climate projections specifically due to a complexity of the precipitation runoff processes hydrological responses of catchments to changing climate conditions may be more variable than the climatic changes themselves especially in snow dominated catchments and thus they may be surprising and unexpected to investigate these hydrological responses may be specifically important for the region of central europe because existing climate projections available for this region do not agree in the prediction of precipitation simulating either its increase or decrease svoboda et al 2016 therefore it is important to analyse whether the increase in air temperature causing the decrease in snowfall might be partly compensated by the potential increase in winter precipitation this is also important since snow may represent an important factor of summer low flow severity at least for snow dominated catchments although the snow is usually not a dominant factor in driving summer low flows in humid climates therefore it is important to study whether the seasonal snow is able to partly compensate the low summer precipitation and thus contribute to higher low flows and how it will change in the future all the above points guided the main objectives of this study which were 1 to simulate the future changes in snow storages for a large set of mountain catchments representing different elevations 2 to assess the mutual interplay of changing air temperature and precipitation for snow accumulation reflecting a wide range of climate projections and 3 to analyse how the changes in snow storages will affect groundwater recharge streamflow seasonality and low flows in the future we benefit from a multi catchment level approach which enabled us to generalize the results for a broader region in czechia there were only few studies addressing the topic of hydrological impact of future climate changes hanel et al 2012 lamačová et al 2014 these studies were focused on overall changes in water balance including winter runoff caused by snowmelt but the study investigating the changing effect of snow on spring and summer low flows is still missing with this study we follow up with our previous studies carried out in the same study area which were focused on studying the inter annual variability of the snow influence on summer low flows based on historical data jenicek and ledvinka 2020a and the role of catchment storage in this process šípek et al 2021 2 data and methods 2 1 study area and data we selected 59 catchments located at higher elevations in czechia with a substantial influence of snow on streamflow fig 1 table s1 and kml file in supplementary data section the selected catchments have a minor influence of human activity on runoff the selection covered most mountain ranges in czechia showing the variety of natural conditions table 1 the mean catchment elevation ranges from 491 to 1297 m a s l and the mean slope ranges from 2 2 to 13 0 the annual maximum swe ranges from 35 mm for the lowest catchments to 664 mm for the highest catchments and the snow contributes from 16 6 41 3 to runoff the catchment areas range from 1 8 km2 to 383 4 km2 the same catchment selection was used in a previous study jenicek and ledvinka 2020a daily precipitation daily mean air temperature and weekly swe data were available from stations located within or nearby the individual catchments for the period 1980 2014 except for three catchments with data that started from one to three years later the data were obtained from the czech hydrometeorological institute chmi the temperature based method defined by oudin et al 2005 was used for calculation of potential evapotranspiration pet for individual climate stations the above data together with daily runoff data for all outlet profiles were used to calibrate and evaluate the rainfall runoff model the nearest station with respective climate data was used for each catchment see also kml file in supplementary data section 2 2 hbv model to simulate the individual components of the water cycle and to bring the information from point climatological measurements to a catchment scale we used a conceptual bucket type hbv model lindström et al 1997 in its implementation hbv light seibert and vis 2012 the model consists of four routines namely 1 the snow routine which uses a degree day approach including potential refreezing of meltwater calculation 2 the soil routine with a calculation of groundwater recharge and actual evaporation aet simulated as functions of the actual soil moisture 3 the response routine which calculates the catchment runoff using two groundwater boxes and 4 the routing routine which applies a triangular weighting function for runoff propagation to catchment outlet details on the model structure and routines used to calculate the individual runoff components can be found in several studies jenicek et al 2018 seibert and vis 2012 the catchments were sub divided into elevation zones by 100 m to distribute the information about air temperature accumulated snowpack snowmelt and related soil moisture and groundwater recharge according to elevation the calibration of the hbv model was done for a previous study jenicek and ledvinka 2020a we refer the reader to this study for more details regarding the calibration process and results in general the hbv model was calibrated for each catchment using a genetic algorithm procedure which is implemented in the model seibert 2000 the calibration period was set to 1980 1997 and the validation has been done using a period 1998 2014 the two periods included both wet and dry years and cold and warm years the multi variable model calibration was used using a combination of three criteria 1 nash sutcliffe efficiency for runoff using logarithmic values nash and sutcliffe 1970 2 volume error for runoff and 3 model efficiency for swe the calibration of the model against both runoff and swe enabled to better control the simulation of the swe in individual catchments and improve the model s ability to simulate individual components of the water cycle one hundred calibration runs resulting in one hundred parameter sets was performed to address the uncertainty of the model parameters these one hundred sets served to create one hundred simulations a median simulation was used for further analyses in this study the results of the model calibration and validation are shown in the supplementary material which shows the values of objective functions for calibration and validation period for each catchment fig s1 and the comparison of observed and simulated swe fig s2 and flow duration curves fig s3 for six selected catchments one per each mountain range additionally fig s4 shows comparison of observed and simulated swe and runoff for two selected hydrological years first with extremely snow rich conditions 2006 and second with extremely snow poor conditions 2014 resulting simulations are publicly available jenicek and ledvinka 2020b 2 3 simulations of the future climate and runoff the impact of future changes in climate variables on snow storages and streamflow in the study catchments was assessed using climate simulations from four global circulation models gcms dynamically downscaled by six regional climate models rcms three representative concentration pathways rcp 2 6 4 5 and rcp 8 5 were chosen to capture the variability of the future climate evolution including the rcp 2 6 which limits global warming to between 1 5 c and 2 c compared to the pre industrial period which is reflected by the paris agreement unfccc 2015 data were downloaded from the european domain of the coordinated regional downscaling experiment euro cordex https www euro cordex net in total 17 unique combinations further referred as climate chains of gcms rcms and rcps were used in the study for which the data from the period 2020 2099 were available table 2 the time series for individual basins were derived as weighted averages of rcm grid boxes intersecting a basin with weights proportional to the intersection area the precipitation and temperature data from climate models were bias corrected using a multivariate approach by piani and haerter 2012 in this approach a correction of temperature is performed as the first step subsequently the pairs corrected temperature uncorrected precipitation are split into several bins according to temperature quantiles and a correction of precipitation is performed separately within each bin in this study the number of bins was obtained following the sturges s formula the precipitation thresholds were determined and applied specifically for each bin to prevent the drizzling effect for both temperature and precipitation a precise transfer functions given by the quantile quantile plot were replaced by their linear fits in order to increase the robustness with respect to changing climate conditions a linear approximation of the transfer functions is justified by the underlying probability distributions of both variables in the case of temperature the gaussian distribution is considered as an appropriate model which implies that a required shift of the probability distribution can be achieved by a linear transformation of the dataset the same linear nature can be found in the case of precipitation where the gamma distribution is a generally acceptable model it was shown by hnilica and pus 2013 that for precipitation data a precise quantile mapping transfer function can be well approximated by a linear function an explanation based on a theoretical background can be found in hnilica et al 2017 the bias corrections were calibrated separately for the warm may oct and the cold nov mar periods using the available overlap of the control rcm run specific for each rcm and the observed data from the period 1980 2014 simulations of the future hydrological behaviour of the study catchments as a response to changing climate were compared for three future periods 2020 2049 2045 2074 and 2070 2099 relative to the reference period 1980 2005 in order to keep data consistent and comparable for the reference period we used reanalyses of the individual climate chains which were corrected using the same procedure as for the future simulations described above finally both the reference and future climate data were submitted to the calibrated hbv light hydrological model which was used to simulate the individual water balance components in the study catchments 2 4 snow and streamflow signatures and results analysis to analyse the potential influence of snow on catchment runoff several snow groundwater and streamflow signatures were calculated in this study table 3 to better capture the variability of the hydrological responses to different climate inputs we identified climate chains according to whether they lead to 1 snow rich or snow poor conditions 2 wet or dry conditions and 3 precipitation rich or precipitation poor conditions these conditions were assessed for the future period 2070 2099 using a combination of several characteristics for identifying snow rich snow poor climate chains a combination of annual snowfall swe max and doy meltout was used for identifying wet and dry climate chains q jja q b and d v were used finally summer jja precipitation was used to identify the climate chains with the highest anomalies in summer precipitation the above characteristics were used to rank the individual climate chains the climate chains ranked as the most snow poor and snow rich according to procedure described above were used for most of the analysis in this study for determining the potential relationship between snow and summer low flows the approach of selecting chains leading to snow poor and snow rich conditions cannot be used this is because both climate chains are different in terms of summer precipitation and thus the effect of snow storages on summer runoff cannot be separated from the effect of summer precipitation which is more important therefore we selected the two climate chains which both led to dry summer conditions ranked as 1st and 3rd driest from all considered climate chains caused by low summer precipitation the selected climate chains were the two with the lowest summer precipitation the first chain led to the most snow poor conditions from all climate chains further referred as snow poor and dry and the second selected chain led to the second most snow rich conditions from all climate chains further referred as snow rich and dry the selected climate chains are highlighted in table 2 with this selection we wanted to analyse whether snow rich conditions might lead to less dry summer conditions despite the fact that summer precipitation is comparable and low in both of the selected climate chains 3 results 3 1 changes in snow signatures at different elevations and for different climate chains future simulations showed a considerable decrease in snowfall fraction for all catchments at all elevations fig 2 a followed by a large decrease in swe max from 30 to 70 until the end of the 21st century with higher values below 1100 m a s l fig 2b in addition the melt out day occurred earlier by four weeks at the highest elevations and by 2 3 weeks at the lowest elevations fig 2c this also showed that the snow covered season will be significantly shorter in the future fig 2d the bottom panels of the figure indicate that the shortening of the snow covered season will be caused more by earlier melt out rather than by later snow cover onset fig 2 also shows that changes in swe max and doy melt are in absolute terms larger at higher elevations compared to lower elevations suggesting larger changes in the seasonal water balance at these higher elevations in contrast snow changes are mostly lower for lower elevations due to overall low snow storages due to the large variability in simulated snow storages for individual climate chains we assessed changes in snow signatures for the future period 2070 2099 for three selected climate chains leading to the most snow poor mean and snow rich conditions see methods the results show that despite the large decrease in s f swe max doy melt and s dur was simulated for the mean conditions the differences between the two border conditions are relatively large fig 3 the relatively small decrease in all selected snow signatures was simulated for the climate chain leading to snow rich conditions which is also represented by the highest precipitation during the cold period the precipitation increased by 10 2 relative to the reference period results not shown besides the increase in air temperature for the cold period compared to the reference period is less dramatic compared to other climate chains by 1 4 c compared to the mean temperature increase by 2 8 c in contrast the climate chain leading to snow poor conditions showed a dramatic decrease in all selected snow signatures this snow poor climate chain had the largest increase in air temperature of 4 3 c for the cold period and one which led to the driest conditions with annual precipitation 8 lower compared to the climate chain mean the above results indicated that the increase in air temperature causing the decrease in snowfall might be partly compensated by the increase in winter precipitation despite this potential compensation none from the 17 climate chains led to a future increase in snow storages or later melt out compared to the reference period the results in fig 3 also showed that the decrease in snow signatures is in absolute terms higher for catchments with higher s f swe max and later doy melt which is indicated by the increasing distance between brown and blue points from lower to higher values since the mentioned signatures are correlated with elevation e g for s f the pearson correlation coefficient is 0 53 with p value 0 001 the results suggested that that snow at highest elevations is more affected by the increase in air temperature in our study region for mitigation and adaptation strategies it is important to look at how snow signatures will change in the future for different representative concentration pathways rcp 2 6 4 5 and 8 5 reflecting future evolution of greenhouse gases concentrations and their radiative forcing the results of the most optimistic rcp 2 6 scenario showed the relatively smaller decrease in snow signatures compared to the moderate rcp 4 5 scenario fig 4 the most pessimistic rcp 8 5 scenario showed significantly larger decreases in all selected snow signatures compared to the reference period due to the largest increase in air temperature by 3 7 c by the end of the 21st century compared to the reference period for the study catchments for example s f will decrease on average by 0 13 it means by 60 for the rcp 8 5 for the period 2070 2099 fig 4a for rcps 2 6 and 4 5 this average decrease is between 0 04 0 07 representing a decrease of 30 40 the simulated future decrease in s f caused large decreases in swe max of 29 for the rcp 2 6 and 68 for rcp 8 5 for the period 2070 2099 fig 4b earlier melt out on average 17 days earlier for the rcp 2 6 and 38 days earlier for the rcp 8 5 fig 4c and shorter snow cover duration by 22 and 82 days respectively fig 4d these results clearly show that although the decrease in snow storages and the shortening of the snowmelt period was simulated for all rcps the rcp 2 6 predicted much lower decreases in snow compared to the most pessimistic rcp 8 5 scenario 3 2 changes in seasonal runoff distribution the above results showed that the seasonal snowpack is highly sensitive to changes in climate indices the simulations of the future runoff showed that the changes in snow storages significantly affected seasonal runoff distribution in individual catchments fig 5 the figure shows the seasonal runoff and its relative change for six selected catchments one catchment from each mountain range as defined in fig 1 in the reference period the largest runoff occurred in april or may depending on the catchment elevation for the future period 2070 2099 the period of highest streamflow will occur on average a month earlier following the earlier snowmelt and the seasonal runoff volume is significantly lower in this period due to less water originating from snowmelt additionally the model predicted an increase in winter runoff for the future period due to an increase in air temperature and thus more liquid rain and partial snowmelt during the winter season will occur consequently the decrease in spring runoff will be compensated by the increase in winter runoff in most of the catchments nevertheless this compensation is also caused overall by a slight increase in winter precipitation predicted by most of the climate chains the changes in runoff in the period june october are not as large as in the case of winter and spring runoff in many catchments june to october runoff will not change or slightly increase mostly due to the small increase in precipitation predicted by most of the climate chains the results of comparison of the future snow runoff contribution q sf and consequent spring runoff for all climate chains sorted according to individual rcps showed overall a decrease in both runoff signatures fig 6 for rcp 2 6 the decrease in q sf is lower compared to rcp 4 5 the rcp 8 5 showed much larger decreases in q sf especially for middle and far future periods compared to the reference period the reason for such a decrease lies in the decrease in snow storages shown in fig 4 similar to the decrease in q sf the march to may runoff decreased as well the decrease in spring runoff is largest for rcp 8 5 but lower for rcps 2 6 and 4 5 probably because the expected decrease due to lower snow storages was compensated by the small increase in total precipitation in most of the climate chains overall future changes in snow storages will be the primary cause for changes in winter and spring runoff in most of catchments 3 3 the effect of snow on summer runoff and low flows as explained in the methods the approach of selecting snow poor and snow rich climate chains cannot be used to show the effect of snow impact on summer streamflow and low flows since it is not possible to separate the effect of snow storages from the effect of summer precipitation to answer the question of whether or not the snow is an important driver of summer runoff we selected two climate chains which were ranked as the driest see methods and which have a similar amount of summer precipitation the lowest summer precipitation from all climate chains but the first chain led to snow poor conditions and the second chain led to snow rich conditions the basic climate and snow characteristics of both selected climate chains are shown in table 4 the results displayed in fig 7 showed that the decrease in snow storages for the future period compared to the reference period caused lower snowmelt runoff volume and thus lower spring runoff fig 7a b in addition lower snow storages caused lower groundwater recharge during the cold period fig 7c this lower groundwater recharge is an important indicator of available water in the groundwater zone which contributes to the river streamflow during the summer period especially during low flows the large difference in spring runoff for both selected climate chains were expected since the spring runoff is directly related to snowmelt nevertheless differences can be seen also for summer runoff and low flow signatures fig 7d h despite the fact that summer precipitation is almost the same in both climate chains summer runoff summer baseflow and summer minimum runoff are on average lower for snow poor and dry conditions compared to snow rich and dry conditions although the differences are rather small and they change from catchment to catchment fig 7d f nevertheless drier conditions for snow poor and dry climate chain become more evident for higher elevation catchments where snow plays a more important role in generating the seasonal runoff in these higher elevation catchments the absolute decreases in snow storages are larger than in lower elevation catchments and thus the summer runoff in those catchments is more affected by changes in seasonal snowpack this becomes clearer when looking on summer deficit volumes and their duration fig 7g h both characteristics are displayed as a difference between the 2070 2099 future period and the reference period both summer deficit volumes and their duration will significantly increase in the future whereas the largest increase in deficit volumes but not for their duration seems to be associated with catchments with higher s f to make the results of snow relevance for summer runoff more robust we assessed all available climate chains to see whether there is a tendency of climate chains leading to relatively snow rich conditions to generate higher summer runoff and low flows and vice versa fig 8 showing the climate chain ranking suggests that snow is not important for mean summer jja runoff volume left panel however when deficit volumes are considered as an indicator of low flow extremity the driest climate chains are associated with both the lowest summer precipitation and seasonal snowpack it means that lower deficit volumes less serious droughts were simulated for chains leading to more snow light brown and blue colour in the bottom right quadrant compared to the bottom left quadrant in other words for the same low summer precipitation the summer deficit volumes are lower for climate chains with higher snow storages this indicated that snow can partly increase summer low flows although the summer precipitation is clearly more important the expected lower snow storages might therefore contribute to more extreme low flow periods the same results as for deficit volumes were achieved also for the duration of the low flow periods results not shown in addition to lowest low flows for both lowest precipitation and snow storages fig 8 shows that the highest low flows the lowest deficit volumes were simulated for climate chains with mutual existence of high summer precipitation and snow storages the darkest blue colour in the top right quadrant in other words the same amount of high summer precipitation led to higher low flows for climate chains leading to more snow 4 discussion 4 1 changes in snow storages and their influence on seasonal runoff the results showed a considerable decrease in snow storages in the future in our study catchments the snow decrease is expected at all elevations above 600 m a s l below this elevation threshold the snow storages are low even in the current climate and thus changes are rather small the results of this study support results achieved earlier in the study region which showed either past or predicted future changes in snow characteristics snowmelt and low flows blahušiaková et al 2020 lamačová et al 2014 vlach et al 2020 our results also support results from other world regions with comparable climate marty et al 2017b musselman et al 2017b although some of them showed smaller relative decreases in snow storages at the highest elevations not covered by our study selection fyfe et al 2017 jenicek et al 2018 for interpretation it is important to mention that all climate chains simulated decrease in snow storages although in few of them the decrease was very small this means that no climate chain simulated higher snow storages compared to the reference period despite the fact that some of the chains predicts higher precipitation in the cold period therefore it is clear that the increase in air temperature predicted by all climate chains is the major cause for the decrease in snow storages although this decrease might be partly compensated by the increase in winter precipitation the mutual interplay of both air temperature and precipitation in influencing snow storage is also well documented by several studies which also showed that future changes in precipitation can be associated with changes in snowfall extremity lute et al 2015 marshall et al 2020 such changes in number and extremity of snowfall events or amount of winter precipitation might also help to explain sometimes missing clear trends in selected snow signatures over the last few decades specifically for snow cover onset klein et al 2016 the results also showed that the decrease in snow signatures is in absolute terms higher for higher elevations compared to lower elevations this might also indicate that the overall water balance and the seasonal runoff distribution in higher elevation catchments will be affected more in the future than the water balance in lower elevation catchments this might also affect downstream areas which strongly depend on water from higher elevation areas especially during late spring and summer as shown by results from swiss catchments brunner et al 2019 cochand et al 2019 analysing the changes in winter runoff is important to assess the water amount generated from winter precipitation this water is important for recharge and filling the groundwater storage overall the results in this study showed that future changes in snow storages will be the primary cause for changes in winter and spring runoff in most of catchments additionally climate chains leading to the lowest snow storages are also associated with lower amounts of winter precipitation results not shown this shows that future snow droughts will be associated with both increased in air temperature and reduced precipitation blahušiaková et al 2020 cooper et al 2016 dierauer et al 2019 mountain regions are often referred to as water towers because they substantially affect hydrology of downstream areas for example mountains store a lot of water in the form of snow and ice which contributes to runoff in lower elevation areas even during the warm season with overall lower water availability due to high evapotranspiration and vegetation demand therefore any change in seasonal runoff means a potential problem for environmental systems such as river ecology as well as for many human activities such as hydropower irrigation industry or drinking water supply brunner et al 2019 the decrease in snowmelt runoff might be also important for reservoir management in providing enough water for human activities additionally changes in the water cycle and the main driving forces causing low flows might also be challenging for drought forecasting systems livneh and badger 2020 4 2 influence of snow on summer low flows despite the fact that most of the climate chains led to a dramatic decrease in snow storages the results did not clearly show whether the reduced snowpack will also lead to overall dry or wet summer conditions although the climate chain leading to snow poor conditions led also to the driest conditions the climate chain that led to snow rich conditions was not ranked as one which significantly leads to overall wet conditions in other words climate chains which led to higher snow storages do not necessarily lead to overall wet conditions during warm periods however the results showed that future snow rich conditions are associated with higher low flows and thus lower deficit volumes compared to the snow poor conditions with a similar amount of summer precipitation nevertheless the summer precipitation is the dominant driver for summer low flows as also shown by other studies cooper et al 2018 floriancic et al 2020 the expected lower snow storages might therefore contribute to more extreme low flow periods as indicated by several studies godsey et al 2014 jenicek and ledvinka 2020a šípek et al 2021 additionally some climate chains which led to low snow storages simulated lower low flows despite the relatively high summer precipitation due to the methodology used the simulated decreases in streamflow signatures do not account for an increase in pet due to an increase in air temperature this was motivated by the temperature based equation for pet which was used to calculate the input data for the hbv model it was shown that such equations often overestimate the effect of pet increase which means that the pet is more sensitive to changes in air temperature than it is expected in reality kingston et al 2009 milly and dunne 2011 oudin et al 2005 shaw and riha 2011 besides a clear limitation of this approach it enabled to separate the effect of snow from the effect of increasing pet on the low flows extremity as also used in previous studies e g jenicek et al 2018 consequently changes presented in this study are caused only by changes in snow and related changes in soil storages and thus aet therefore the results of this study cannot be fully interpreted as expected future behaviour of the catchments but the study rather shows the sensitivity of the catchments to changes in air temperature precipitation and related changes in snow storages and runoff due to expected pet increase in the future which might partly result in increased aet at least for humid regions with p pet the future decrease in summer streamflow and lower low flows might be even larger than simulated by the hydrological model in this study unlike the pet the simulated aet may change using our modelling approach due to the changes in soil moisture because the hbv model assumes an increasing aet with increasing soil moisture additionally the model calculates aet only for days without snow cover on the ground consequently the simulated aet increased in future scenarios in the cold period because the model simulated lower snow cover duration and thus more days when aet occurred this increase in aet was partly compensated by the decrease in aet due to lower soil moisture in the summer especially in lower elevation catchments with lower precipitation and higher pet results not shown 4 3 the role of different rcps on snow and runoff variability however despite the clear tendency of snow signatures changes for the climate scenario mean large variability exists between individual climate chains which reflects the large variability in climate inputs for individual gcm rcm and rcp combinations therefore it is important to assess the snow differences simulated by different climate chains for example for mitigation and adaptation strategies it is important to look at how the snow signatures will change in the future for different representative concentration pathways rcp 2 6 4 5 and 8 5 reflecting future evolution of greenhouse gas concentrations and their radiative forcing the most optimistic rcp 2 6 predicts the increase in air temperature between 1 5 c and 2 c until the end of the 21st century compared to the pre industrial period which means an increase of around 1 c compared to the reference period therefore the rcp 2 6 is the scenario which most matches with the goals of the paris agreement in 2015 unfccc 2015 in contrast the rcp 8 5 is from today s perspective the most pessimistic scenario with a temperature increase of 4 5 c until the end of the 21st century compared to the pre industrial period the comparison of the future snow evolution for individual climate chains according to rcps showed an overall decrease in snow storages and the shortening of the snow covered period for the rcp 2 6 however the changes were somewhat lower compared to most of the climate chains considering rcp 4 5 and considerably lower compared to chains assuming rcp 8 5 the reason for the smaller change for the rcp 2 6 is mostly related to the smaller increase in air temperature nevertheless our results also showed the importance of mutual interplay of both temperature and precipitation changes to affect the future snowpack for example the climate chain leading to the most snow rich conditions did not use rcp 2 6 but that used rcp 4 5 although the differences between both climate chains were rather small and may be explained by higher winter precipitation predicted by the specific rcp 4 5 climate chain this particular example highlights the importance of using a variety of gcms and rcms combined with more rcps for hydrological projections to obtain more robust results chegwidden et al 2019 the simulated future changes in snow storages were the primary cause for changes in winter and spring runoff simulated for most of the study catchments overall the results highlighted the importance of the effort of individual countries to reduce greenhouse gases emissions in order to keep warming well below 2 c compared to the pre industrial period as defined in the paris agreement this is important for mitigation and adaptation strategies related to climate change impacts in mountain regions marty et al 2017a 4 4 uncertainty in climate projections and modelling approaches it is well known that raw climate model outputs cannot be used directly in climate change impact studies the inherent biases in model data are introduced by a low spatial resolution of climate models which leads to a simplified representation of important physical processes chen et al 2015 therefore several post processing bias correction methods have been proposed the corrections are frequently calibrated and applied separately for individual meteorological variables as a result the correlation structures of the corrected data are biased although individual corrected variables correspond to the observed data in their statistical indicators several studies recently attempted to overcome this limitation and consider also a dependence structure between or within variables in addition to basic statistical properties meyer et al 2019 such an approach has been followed in this study since the relation between precipitation and temperature obviously affects a hydrological response of a catchment several complex multivariate correction methods can be found in the recent literature e g hnilica et al 2017 johnson and sharma 2012 mehrotra and sharma 2016 nevertheless the increasing complexity of such methods and their unclear effect on the climate change signal have recently been the subject of serious criticism ehret et al 2012 maraun et al 2017 hnilica et al 2019 pointed to the high sensitivity of complex correction methods to outlying values for these reasons the approach of piani and haerter 2012 used in our study represents a compromise between the overly complex multivariate methods and the standard single variate approach e g quantile mapping which leaves the relations between variables entirely uncorrected individual climate chains from the euro cordex experiment predict the amount of precipitation for the future differently where some of them predict an increase in precipitation for central europe while others predict a decrease the corrected data for our study catchments showed that the variability between individual climate chains as well as between individual catchments is very high and ranges from 12 a relative decrease in precipitation compared to the current climate to 28 a relative increase in precipitation this variability together with different downscaling methods may results in large differences in simulated runoff seasonality meyer et al 2019 our results clearly showed that despite the simulated future decrease in snow storages the large variability exists between individual climate chains mainly due to the large variability in precipitation this was also clearly reflected by the large variability in simulated seasonal runoff since the snow storages are strongly sensitive to changes in both air temperature and precipitation in the cold period it is still a question as to which degree the predicted increase in air temperature will be compensated by the increase or decrease in precipitation since the future evolution of precipitation remains uncertain at least for the region of central europe nevertheless despite this large variability in future precipitation the snow storages decreased in all scenarios giving the high confidence of increasing air temperature as a dominant factor which controls the snow storages in our study catchments an important uncertainty of the hydrological model represents the input data used for model calibration and validation in our study the input climate data were formed by stational data located within or nearby the individual catchments since no gridded product of precipitation air temperature and swe is available for czechia the stational data represented the only possible input to the model for our study area to enable correct spatial distribution of all climate and snow data within the catchment and to reduce the uncertainty in the model calibration lapse rates correction factors for elevation for air temperature and precipitation were calibrated by the model separately for each catchment additionally the uncertainty of the model calibration has been reduced using a multi parameter approach which enabled calibration of the model not only against runoff but also against swe this approach contributed to higher agreement of the observed and simulated values especially in higher elevation catchments with higher importance of the snowpack in the water cycle girons lopez et al 2020 jenicek and ledvinka 2020a the uncertainty in hydrological model simulations was further reduced using the 100 parameter sets resulting from 100 calibration runs for each catchment which contributed to more robust results this way the effect of equifinality multiple parameter sets provide equally good or acceptable model outputs was partly reduced although the results may be influenced by specific model choice model structure and parameters uncertainty several studies showed that the uncertainty mainly stems from the gcms and rcms and from the specific emission scenario addor et al 2014 chegwidden et al 2019 parajka et al 2016 however the model choice may by more important for future projections in higher elevation catchments with dominating snowmelt runoff regime addor et al 2014 5 conclusions future simulations of the individual components of the water cycle showed a considerable decrease in snow related variables for all study catchments in czechia at all elevations the hbv model simulated decrease in annual maximum swe by 30 70 until the end of the 21st century compared to current climate with higher values for elevations below 1100 m a s l additionally the snow covered season will be on average 40 60 days shorter in the future the results indicated that the shortening of the snow covered season will be caused more by earlier melt out rather than by later snow onset fig 3 nevertheless the response of the snowpack to changes in climate indices predicted by individual climate chains showed a large variability with the mean decrease in maximum swe by 13 for the most snow rich conditions and by 76 for the most snow poor conditions for the future period 2070 2099 the results also indicated that the increase in air temperature causing the decrease in snowfall might be partly offset by the increase in winter precipitation the simulations of the future runoff showed that the period of highest streamflow will occur on average a month earlier following the earlier snowmelt and the seasonal runoff volume will be significantly lower due to lower snowmelt inputs fig 5 additionally the model predicted the increase in winter runoff for the future period due to the increase in air temperature and thus the shift from snowfall to rain these changes may impose more pressure to create adaptation strategies for water reservoirs management to keep all reservoir functions such as flood and drought protection drinking water supply and hydropower the absolute decreases in snow storages in higher elevation catchments are larger compared to lower elevation catchments and thus the summer runoff in those catchments will be more affected by changes in seasonal snowpack consequently the largest increase in deficit volumes seems to be associated with the highest elevation catchments fig 7 this might have important implications for water availability in downstream areas the climate chains leading to overall dry conditions are associated with both lowest summer precipitation and seasonal snowpack fig 8 it means that higher deficit volumes were simulated for chains with both low summer precipitation and low seasonal snowpack this indicated that snow can partly increase summer low flows although the role of summer precipitation is obviously more important the expected lower snow storages might therefore contribute to more extreme summer low flow periods in the future next to increase in evapotranspiration and potential decrease in precipitation the comparison of the future snow changes for individual climate chains combining different rcps showed an overall decrease in snow storages and significant changes in spring and summer runoff figs 4 and 6 however the rcp 2 6 showed significantly smaller changes compared to the rcp 4 5 and rcp 8 5 both in terms snow storages and seasonal runoff in this respect the results highlighted the importance of efforts to keep the warming well below 2 c

8144,study region central europe czechia study focus mountains are referred to as water towers because they substantially affect the hydrology of downstream areas however snow storages will decrease in the future due to the increase in air temperature which will affect streamflow regime main objectives of this study were 1 to simulate the future changes in snow for a large set of mountain catchments in czechia reflecting a wide range of climate projections and 2 to analyse how the snow changes will affect groundwater recharge streamflow seasonality and low flows in the future new hydrological insights the future hydrological projections showed a decrease in annual maximum swe by 30 70 in the study area until the end of the 21st century additionally snowmelt was found to occur on average 3 4 weeks earlier the results showed the large variability between individual climate chains and indicated that the increase in air temperature causing the decrease in snowfall might be partly compensated by the increase in winter precipitation changes in snowpack will cause the highest streamflow during melting season to occur one month earlier in addition to lower spring runoff volumes due to lower snowmelt inputs the future climate projections leading to overall dry conditions in summer are associated with both the lowest summer precipitation and seasonal snowpack the expected lower snow storages might therefore contribute to more extreme low flow periods keywords climate change snow snowmelt runoff seasonal runoff low flows 1 introduction mountain snowpack is highly sensitive to air temperature which influences the phase of precipitation as a result of increasing air temperature documented by observations the snowfall fraction the proportion of snowfall water equivalent to the total amount of precipitation over the given period decreases knowles et al 2006 this decrease leads to a generally decreasing snowpack later snow accumulation and earlier snowmelt fyfe et al 2017 marty et al 2017b for example zeng et al 2018 showed that in the most affected parts of the western united states the annual maximum swe decreased on average by 41 and the snow season was shortened by 34 days it is also predicted that the above changes will continue in the future due to further changes in climate jenicek et al 2018 marty et al 2017a musselman et al 2017a nevertheless the response of snow to the increase in air temperature is often not straightforward resulting in a large spatial variability between individual regions and elevations with different climate blahušiaková et al 2020 cooper et al 2016 for example the negative effect of increasing temperatures on snow storage may be partially compensated by an increase in precipitation specifically by the increase in the number of extreme snowfall events lute et al 2015 marshall et al 2020 below average snow conditions defined as snow drought can be caused by either high air temperatures or low winter precipitation or a combination of both cooper et al 2016 harpold et al 2017 with predicted future warming many regions might become more susceptible to snow droughts especially those with winter air temperatures currently close to the freezing point dierauer et al 2019 it is well known that changes in climate indices specifically snowfall and snow storages significantly affect the seasonal water balance and rainfall runoff process langhammer and bernsteinová 2020 mountain areas behave as a complex system where the total catchment runoff is a mixture of different input components namely rainfall snowmelt and potentially glacier melt this mixing substantially affects the seasonal distribution of runoff during a water year many studies calculated the relative importance of snow in generating runoff compared to rainfall berghuijs et al 2014 jenicek and ledvinka 2020a meriö et al 2019 resulting in the fact that a higher fraction of snow generated runoff leaves the catchment than what would correspond to the snowfall fraction li et al 2017 this might be explained e g by the lower winter evaporation causing the higher winter runoff coefficients compared to the summer period lower water demand by vegetation and differences in soil moisture and runoff generation during snowmelt compared to rainfall barnhart et al 2016 nevertheless the decreasing snowfall and thus lower runoff inputs from snowmelt during spring may be offset by increasing rain inputs to the total runoff during winter hammond and kampf 2020 this increase in winter runoff is predicted also for central europe including czechia hanel et al 2012 lamačová et al 2014 zheng et al 2021 although the water balance in this area is expected to change mostly in summer due to the increase in evapotranspiration which mostly contributes to changes in summer low flows lamačová et al 2014 vlach et al 2020 snowmelt also strongly affects soil moisture and groundwater recharge and thus it influences the catchment storage runoff seasonality and baseflow snowmelt may control relative partitioning of the water between evapotranspiration and groundwater recharge leading to higher runoff barnhart et al 2016 decreasing snowfall fraction and thus lower and earlier snowmelt causes decrease in early summer soil moisture potopová et al 2016 higher elevations areas play an important role in the catchment storage as they store a lot of water floriancic et al 2018 hood and hayashi 2015 šípek et al 2021 staudinger et al 2017 and thus support the streamflow at lower elevations which is important mainly during low flow periods cochand et al 2019 the groundwater recharge in upper parts of the snow dominated catchments appears decoupled from year to year variations in snow storages and thus those areas are often resilient to droughts carroll et al 2019 the ongoing changes in snow storages snowmelt and changes in spring and summer runoff including low flows are at the centre of recent research blahušiaková et al 2020 dierauer et al 2018 li et al 2018 van loon et al 2015 vlach et al 2020 higher snowpack may lead to higher baseflow hammond et al 2018 which influences summer low flows together with later melt out for years with higher snowpack the summer low flows may be higher than for years with lower snowpack this is especially valid for the mediterranean climate with uneven precipitation distribution between winter and summer dierauer et al 2018 godsey et al 2014 nevertheless the positive effect of higher snowpack for summer low flows may be seen also for humid catchments with precipitation more equally distributed in the water year jenicek and ledvinka 2020a although summer rainfall and evapotranspiration is certainly more important cooper et al 2018 floriancic et al 2020 šípek et al 2021 with future climate changes the positive effect of snow on summer runoff and low flows may decrease at higher elevations and completely disappear at middle and low elevations consequently the low flows might drop to even lower values not only because of higher evapotranspiration and potential decrease in precipitation but also due to lower seasonal snowpack although many studies quantified the impact of climate changes on the water cycle less attention has been paid to how future snow changes influence summer runoff and low flows considering a wide range of hydrological responses to different climate projections specifically due to a complexity of the precipitation runoff processes hydrological responses of catchments to changing climate conditions may be more variable than the climatic changes themselves especially in snow dominated catchments and thus they may be surprising and unexpected to investigate these hydrological responses may be specifically important for the region of central europe because existing climate projections available for this region do not agree in the prediction of precipitation simulating either its increase or decrease svoboda et al 2016 therefore it is important to analyse whether the increase in air temperature causing the decrease in snowfall might be partly compensated by the potential increase in winter precipitation this is also important since snow may represent an important factor of summer low flow severity at least for snow dominated catchments although the snow is usually not a dominant factor in driving summer low flows in humid climates therefore it is important to study whether the seasonal snow is able to partly compensate the low summer precipitation and thus contribute to higher low flows and how it will change in the future all the above points guided the main objectives of this study which were 1 to simulate the future changes in snow storages for a large set of mountain catchments representing different elevations 2 to assess the mutual interplay of changing air temperature and precipitation for snow accumulation reflecting a wide range of climate projections and 3 to analyse how the changes in snow storages will affect groundwater recharge streamflow seasonality and low flows in the future we benefit from a multi catchment level approach which enabled us to generalize the results for a broader region in czechia there were only few studies addressing the topic of hydrological impact of future climate changes hanel et al 2012 lamačová et al 2014 these studies were focused on overall changes in water balance including winter runoff caused by snowmelt but the study investigating the changing effect of snow on spring and summer low flows is still missing with this study we follow up with our previous studies carried out in the same study area which were focused on studying the inter annual variability of the snow influence on summer low flows based on historical data jenicek and ledvinka 2020a and the role of catchment storage in this process šípek et al 2021 2 data and methods 2 1 study area and data we selected 59 catchments located at higher elevations in czechia with a substantial influence of snow on streamflow fig 1 table s1 and kml file in supplementary data section the selected catchments have a minor influence of human activity on runoff the selection covered most mountain ranges in czechia showing the variety of natural conditions table 1 the mean catchment elevation ranges from 491 to 1297 m a s l and the mean slope ranges from 2 2 to 13 0 the annual maximum swe ranges from 35 mm for the lowest catchments to 664 mm for the highest catchments and the snow contributes from 16 6 41 3 to runoff the catchment areas range from 1 8 km2 to 383 4 km2 the same catchment selection was used in a previous study jenicek and ledvinka 2020a daily precipitation daily mean air temperature and weekly swe data were available from stations located within or nearby the individual catchments for the period 1980 2014 except for three catchments with data that started from one to three years later the data were obtained from the czech hydrometeorological institute chmi the temperature based method defined by oudin et al 2005 was used for calculation of potential evapotranspiration pet for individual climate stations the above data together with daily runoff data for all outlet profiles were used to calibrate and evaluate the rainfall runoff model the nearest station with respective climate data was used for each catchment see also kml file in supplementary data section 2 2 hbv model to simulate the individual components of the water cycle and to bring the information from point climatological measurements to a catchment scale we used a conceptual bucket type hbv model lindström et al 1997 in its implementation hbv light seibert and vis 2012 the model consists of four routines namely 1 the snow routine which uses a degree day approach including potential refreezing of meltwater calculation 2 the soil routine with a calculation of groundwater recharge and actual evaporation aet simulated as functions of the actual soil moisture 3 the response routine which calculates the catchment runoff using two groundwater boxes and 4 the routing routine which applies a triangular weighting function for runoff propagation to catchment outlet details on the model structure and routines used to calculate the individual runoff components can be found in several studies jenicek et al 2018 seibert and vis 2012 the catchments were sub divided into elevation zones by 100 m to distribute the information about air temperature accumulated snowpack snowmelt and related soil moisture and groundwater recharge according to elevation the calibration of the hbv model was done for a previous study jenicek and ledvinka 2020a we refer the reader to this study for more details regarding the calibration process and results in general the hbv model was calibrated for each catchment using a genetic algorithm procedure which is implemented in the model seibert 2000 the calibration period was set to 1980 1997 and the validation has been done using a period 1998 2014 the two periods included both wet and dry years and cold and warm years the multi variable model calibration was used using a combination of three criteria 1 nash sutcliffe efficiency for runoff using logarithmic values nash and sutcliffe 1970 2 volume error for runoff and 3 model efficiency for swe the calibration of the model against both runoff and swe enabled to better control the simulation of the swe in individual catchments and improve the model s ability to simulate individual components of the water cycle one hundred calibration runs resulting in one hundred parameter sets was performed to address the uncertainty of the model parameters these one hundred sets served to create one hundred simulations a median simulation was used for further analyses in this study the results of the model calibration and validation are shown in the supplementary material which shows the values of objective functions for calibration and validation period for each catchment fig s1 and the comparison of observed and simulated swe fig s2 and flow duration curves fig s3 for six selected catchments one per each mountain range additionally fig s4 shows comparison of observed and simulated swe and runoff for two selected hydrological years first with extremely snow rich conditions 2006 and second with extremely snow poor conditions 2014 resulting simulations are publicly available jenicek and ledvinka 2020b 2 3 simulations of the future climate and runoff the impact of future changes in climate variables on snow storages and streamflow in the study catchments was assessed using climate simulations from four global circulation models gcms dynamically downscaled by six regional climate models rcms three representative concentration pathways rcp 2 6 4 5 and rcp 8 5 were chosen to capture the variability of the future climate evolution including the rcp 2 6 which limits global warming to between 1 5 c and 2 c compared to the pre industrial period which is reflected by the paris agreement unfccc 2015 data were downloaded from the european domain of the coordinated regional downscaling experiment euro cordex https www euro cordex net in total 17 unique combinations further referred as climate chains of gcms rcms and rcps were used in the study for which the data from the period 2020 2099 were available table 2 the time series for individual basins were derived as weighted averages of rcm grid boxes intersecting a basin with weights proportional to the intersection area the precipitation and temperature data from climate models were bias corrected using a multivariate approach by piani and haerter 2012 in this approach a correction of temperature is performed as the first step subsequently the pairs corrected temperature uncorrected precipitation are split into several bins according to temperature quantiles and a correction of precipitation is performed separately within each bin in this study the number of bins was obtained following the sturges s formula the precipitation thresholds were determined and applied specifically for each bin to prevent the drizzling effect for both temperature and precipitation a precise transfer functions given by the quantile quantile plot were replaced by their linear fits in order to increase the robustness with respect to changing climate conditions a linear approximation of the transfer functions is justified by the underlying probability distributions of both variables in the case of temperature the gaussian distribution is considered as an appropriate model which implies that a required shift of the probability distribution can be achieved by a linear transformation of the dataset the same linear nature can be found in the case of precipitation where the gamma distribution is a generally acceptable model it was shown by hnilica and pus 2013 that for precipitation data a precise quantile mapping transfer function can be well approximated by a linear function an explanation based on a theoretical background can be found in hnilica et al 2017 the bias corrections were calibrated separately for the warm may oct and the cold nov mar periods using the available overlap of the control rcm run specific for each rcm and the observed data from the period 1980 2014 simulations of the future hydrological behaviour of the study catchments as a response to changing climate were compared for three future periods 2020 2049 2045 2074 and 2070 2099 relative to the reference period 1980 2005 in order to keep data consistent and comparable for the reference period we used reanalyses of the individual climate chains which were corrected using the same procedure as for the future simulations described above finally both the reference and future climate data were submitted to the calibrated hbv light hydrological model which was used to simulate the individual water balance components in the study catchments 2 4 snow and streamflow signatures and results analysis to analyse the potential influence of snow on catchment runoff several snow groundwater and streamflow signatures were calculated in this study table 3 to better capture the variability of the hydrological responses to different climate inputs we identified climate chains according to whether they lead to 1 snow rich or snow poor conditions 2 wet or dry conditions and 3 precipitation rich or precipitation poor conditions these conditions were assessed for the future period 2070 2099 using a combination of several characteristics for identifying snow rich snow poor climate chains a combination of annual snowfall swe max and doy meltout was used for identifying wet and dry climate chains q jja q b and d v were used finally summer jja precipitation was used to identify the climate chains with the highest anomalies in summer precipitation the above characteristics were used to rank the individual climate chains the climate chains ranked as the most snow poor and snow rich according to procedure described above were used for most of the analysis in this study for determining the potential relationship between snow and summer low flows the approach of selecting chains leading to snow poor and snow rich conditions cannot be used this is because both climate chains are different in terms of summer precipitation and thus the effect of snow storages on summer runoff cannot be separated from the effect of summer precipitation which is more important therefore we selected the two climate chains which both led to dry summer conditions ranked as 1st and 3rd driest from all considered climate chains caused by low summer precipitation the selected climate chains were the two with the lowest summer precipitation the first chain led to the most snow poor conditions from all climate chains further referred as snow poor and dry and the second selected chain led to the second most snow rich conditions from all climate chains further referred as snow rich and dry the selected climate chains are highlighted in table 2 with this selection we wanted to analyse whether snow rich conditions might lead to less dry summer conditions despite the fact that summer precipitation is comparable and low in both of the selected climate chains 3 results 3 1 changes in snow signatures at different elevations and for different climate chains future simulations showed a considerable decrease in snowfall fraction for all catchments at all elevations fig 2 a followed by a large decrease in swe max from 30 to 70 until the end of the 21st century with higher values below 1100 m a s l fig 2b in addition the melt out day occurred earlier by four weeks at the highest elevations and by 2 3 weeks at the lowest elevations fig 2c this also showed that the snow covered season will be significantly shorter in the future fig 2d the bottom panels of the figure indicate that the shortening of the snow covered season will be caused more by earlier melt out rather than by later snow cover onset fig 2 also shows that changes in swe max and doy melt are in absolute terms larger at higher elevations compared to lower elevations suggesting larger changes in the seasonal water balance at these higher elevations in contrast snow changes are mostly lower for lower elevations due to overall low snow storages due to the large variability in simulated snow storages for individual climate chains we assessed changes in snow signatures for the future period 2070 2099 for three selected climate chains leading to the most snow poor mean and snow rich conditions see methods the results show that despite the large decrease in s f swe max doy melt and s dur was simulated for the mean conditions the differences between the two border conditions are relatively large fig 3 the relatively small decrease in all selected snow signatures was simulated for the climate chain leading to snow rich conditions which is also represented by the highest precipitation during the cold period the precipitation increased by 10 2 relative to the reference period results not shown besides the increase in air temperature for the cold period compared to the reference period is less dramatic compared to other climate chains by 1 4 c compared to the mean temperature increase by 2 8 c in contrast the climate chain leading to snow poor conditions showed a dramatic decrease in all selected snow signatures this snow poor climate chain had the largest increase in air temperature of 4 3 c for the cold period and one which led to the driest conditions with annual precipitation 8 lower compared to the climate chain mean the above results indicated that the increase in air temperature causing the decrease in snowfall might be partly compensated by the increase in winter precipitation despite this potential compensation none from the 17 climate chains led to a future increase in snow storages or later melt out compared to the reference period the results in fig 3 also showed that the decrease in snow signatures is in absolute terms higher for catchments with higher s f swe max and later doy melt which is indicated by the increasing distance between brown and blue points from lower to higher values since the mentioned signatures are correlated with elevation e g for s f the pearson correlation coefficient is 0 53 with p value 0 001 the results suggested that that snow at highest elevations is more affected by the increase in air temperature in our study region for mitigation and adaptation strategies it is important to look at how snow signatures will change in the future for different representative concentration pathways rcp 2 6 4 5 and 8 5 reflecting future evolution of greenhouse gases concentrations and their radiative forcing the results of the most optimistic rcp 2 6 scenario showed the relatively smaller decrease in snow signatures compared to the moderate rcp 4 5 scenario fig 4 the most pessimistic rcp 8 5 scenario showed significantly larger decreases in all selected snow signatures compared to the reference period due to the largest increase in air temperature by 3 7 c by the end of the 21st century compared to the reference period for the study catchments for example s f will decrease on average by 0 13 it means by 60 for the rcp 8 5 for the period 2070 2099 fig 4a for rcps 2 6 and 4 5 this average decrease is between 0 04 0 07 representing a decrease of 30 40 the simulated future decrease in s f caused large decreases in swe max of 29 for the rcp 2 6 and 68 for rcp 8 5 for the period 2070 2099 fig 4b earlier melt out on average 17 days earlier for the rcp 2 6 and 38 days earlier for the rcp 8 5 fig 4c and shorter snow cover duration by 22 and 82 days respectively fig 4d these results clearly show that although the decrease in snow storages and the shortening of the snowmelt period was simulated for all rcps the rcp 2 6 predicted much lower decreases in snow compared to the most pessimistic rcp 8 5 scenario 3 2 changes in seasonal runoff distribution the above results showed that the seasonal snowpack is highly sensitive to changes in climate indices the simulations of the future runoff showed that the changes in snow storages significantly affected seasonal runoff distribution in individual catchments fig 5 the figure shows the seasonal runoff and its relative change for six selected catchments one catchment from each mountain range as defined in fig 1 in the reference period the largest runoff occurred in april or may depending on the catchment elevation for the future period 2070 2099 the period of highest streamflow will occur on average a month earlier following the earlier snowmelt and the seasonal runoff volume is significantly lower in this period due to less water originating from snowmelt additionally the model predicted an increase in winter runoff for the future period due to an increase in air temperature and thus more liquid rain and partial snowmelt during the winter season will occur consequently the decrease in spring runoff will be compensated by the increase in winter runoff in most of the catchments nevertheless this compensation is also caused overall by a slight increase in winter precipitation predicted by most of the climate chains the changes in runoff in the period june october are not as large as in the case of winter and spring runoff in many catchments june to october runoff will not change or slightly increase mostly due to the small increase in precipitation predicted by most of the climate chains the results of comparison of the future snow runoff contribution q sf and consequent spring runoff for all climate chains sorted according to individual rcps showed overall a decrease in both runoff signatures fig 6 for rcp 2 6 the decrease in q sf is lower compared to rcp 4 5 the rcp 8 5 showed much larger decreases in q sf especially for middle and far future periods compared to the reference period the reason for such a decrease lies in the decrease in snow storages shown in fig 4 similar to the decrease in q sf the march to may runoff decreased as well the decrease in spring runoff is largest for rcp 8 5 but lower for rcps 2 6 and 4 5 probably because the expected decrease due to lower snow storages was compensated by the small increase in total precipitation in most of the climate chains overall future changes in snow storages will be the primary cause for changes in winter and spring runoff in most of catchments 3 3 the effect of snow on summer runoff and low flows as explained in the methods the approach of selecting snow poor and snow rich climate chains cannot be used to show the effect of snow impact on summer streamflow and low flows since it is not possible to separate the effect of snow storages from the effect of summer precipitation to answer the question of whether or not the snow is an important driver of summer runoff we selected two climate chains which were ranked as the driest see methods and which have a similar amount of summer precipitation the lowest summer precipitation from all climate chains but the first chain led to snow poor conditions and the second chain led to snow rich conditions the basic climate and snow characteristics of both selected climate chains are shown in table 4 the results displayed in fig 7 showed that the decrease in snow storages for the future period compared to the reference period caused lower snowmelt runoff volume and thus lower spring runoff fig 7a b in addition lower snow storages caused lower groundwater recharge during the cold period fig 7c this lower groundwater recharge is an important indicator of available water in the groundwater zone which contributes to the river streamflow during the summer period especially during low flows the large difference in spring runoff for both selected climate chains were expected since the spring runoff is directly related to snowmelt nevertheless differences can be seen also for summer runoff and low flow signatures fig 7d h despite the fact that summer precipitation is almost the same in both climate chains summer runoff summer baseflow and summer minimum runoff are on average lower for snow poor and dry conditions compared to snow rich and dry conditions although the differences are rather small and they change from catchment to catchment fig 7d f nevertheless drier conditions for snow poor and dry climate chain become more evident for higher elevation catchments where snow plays a more important role in generating the seasonal runoff in these higher elevation catchments the absolute decreases in snow storages are larger than in lower elevation catchments and thus the summer runoff in those catchments is more affected by changes in seasonal snowpack this becomes clearer when looking on summer deficit volumes and their duration fig 7g h both characteristics are displayed as a difference between the 2070 2099 future period and the reference period both summer deficit volumes and their duration will significantly increase in the future whereas the largest increase in deficit volumes but not for their duration seems to be associated with catchments with higher s f to make the results of snow relevance for summer runoff more robust we assessed all available climate chains to see whether there is a tendency of climate chains leading to relatively snow rich conditions to generate higher summer runoff and low flows and vice versa fig 8 showing the climate chain ranking suggests that snow is not important for mean summer jja runoff volume left panel however when deficit volumes are considered as an indicator of low flow extremity the driest climate chains are associated with both the lowest summer precipitation and seasonal snowpack it means that lower deficit volumes less serious droughts were simulated for chains leading to more snow light brown and blue colour in the bottom right quadrant compared to the bottom left quadrant in other words for the same low summer precipitation the summer deficit volumes are lower for climate chains with higher snow storages this indicated that snow can partly increase summer low flows although the summer precipitation is clearly more important the expected lower snow storages might therefore contribute to more extreme low flow periods the same results as for deficit volumes were achieved also for the duration of the low flow periods results not shown in addition to lowest low flows for both lowest precipitation and snow storages fig 8 shows that the highest low flows the lowest deficit volumes were simulated for climate chains with mutual existence of high summer precipitation and snow storages the darkest blue colour in the top right quadrant in other words the same amount of high summer precipitation led to higher low flows for climate chains leading to more snow 4 discussion 4 1 changes in snow storages and their influence on seasonal runoff the results showed a considerable decrease in snow storages in the future in our study catchments the snow decrease is expected at all elevations above 600 m a s l below this elevation threshold the snow storages are low even in the current climate and thus changes are rather small the results of this study support results achieved earlier in the study region which showed either past or predicted future changes in snow characteristics snowmelt and low flows blahušiaková et al 2020 lamačová et al 2014 vlach et al 2020 our results also support results from other world regions with comparable climate marty et al 2017b musselman et al 2017b although some of them showed smaller relative decreases in snow storages at the highest elevations not covered by our study selection fyfe et al 2017 jenicek et al 2018 for interpretation it is important to mention that all climate chains simulated decrease in snow storages although in few of them the decrease was very small this means that no climate chain simulated higher snow storages compared to the reference period despite the fact that some of the chains predicts higher precipitation in the cold period therefore it is clear that the increase in air temperature predicted by all climate chains is the major cause for the decrease in snow storages although this decrease might be partly compensated by the increase in winter precipitation the mutual interplay of both air temperature and precipitation in influencing snow storage is also well documented by several studies which also showed that future changes in precipitation can be associated with changes in snowfall extremity lute et al 2015 marshall et al 2020 such changes in number and extremity of snowfall events or amount of winter precipitation might also help to explain sometimes missing clear trends in selected snow signatures over the last few decades specifically for snow cover onset klein et al 2016 the results also showed that the decrease in snow signatures is in absolute terms higher for higher elevations compared to lower elevations this might also indicate that the overall water balance and the seasonal runoff distribution in higher elevation catchments will be affected more in the future than the water balance in lower elevation catchments this might also affect downstream areas which strongly depend on water from higher elevation areas especially during late spring and summer as shown by results from swiss catchments brunner et al 2019 cochand et al 2019 analysing the changes in winter runoff is important to assess the water amount generated from winter precipitation this water is important for recharge and filling the groundwater storage overall the results in this study showed that future changes in snow storages will be the primary cause for changes in winter and spring runoff in most of catchments additionally climate chains leading to the lowest snow storages are also associated with lower amounts of winter precipitation results not shown this shows that future snow droughts will be associated with both increased in air temperature and reduced precipitation blahušiaková et al 2020 cooper et al 2016 dierauer et al 2019 mountain regions are often referred to as water towers because they substantially affect hydrology of downstream areas for example mountains store a lot of water in the form of snow and ice which contributes to runoff in lower elevation areas even during the warm season with overall lower water availability due to high evapotranspiration and vegetation demand therefore any change in seasonal runoff means a potential problem for environmental systems such as river ecology as well as for many human activities such as hydropower irrigation industry or drinking water supply brunner et al 2019 the decrease in snowmelt runoff might be also important for reservoir management in providing enough water for human activities additionally changes in the water cycle and the main driving forces causing low flows might also be challenging for drought forecasting systems livneh and badger 2020 4 2 influence of snow on summer low flows despite the fact that most of the climate chains led to a dramatic decrease in snow storages the results did not clearly show whether the reduced snowpack will also lead to overall dry or wet summer conditions although the climate chain leading to snow poor conditions led also to the driest conditions the climate chain that led to snow rich conditions was not ranked as one which significantly leads to overall wet conditions in other words climate chains which led to higher snow storages do not necessarily lead to overall wet conditions during warm periods however the results showed that future snow rich conditions are associated with higher low flows and thus lower deficit volumes compared to the snow poor conditions with a similar amount of summer precipitation nevertheless the summer precipitation is the dominant driver for summer low flows as also shown by other studies cooper et al 2018 floriancic et al 2020 the expected lower snow storages might therefore contribute to more extreme low flow periods as indicated by several studies godsey et al 2014 jenicek and ledvinka 2020a šípek et al 2021 additionally some climate chains which led to low snow storages simulated lower low flows despite the relatively high summer precipitation due to the methodology used the simulated decreases in streamflow signatures do not account for an increase in pet due to an increase in air temperature this was motivated by the temperature based equation for pet which was used to calculate the input data for the hbv model it was shown that such equations often overestimate the effect of pet increase which means that the pet is more sensitive to changes in air temperature than it is expected in reality kingston et al 2009 milly and dunne 2011 oudin et al 2005 shaw and riha 2011 besides a clear limitation of this approach it enabled to separate the effect of snow from the effect of increasing pet on the low flows extremity as also used in previous studies e g jenicek et al 2018 consequently changes presented in this study are caused only by changes in snow and related changes in soil storages and thus aet therefore the results of this study cannot be fully interpreted as expected future behaviour of the catchments but the study rather shows the sensitivity of the catchments to changes in air temperature precipitation and related changes in snow storages and runoff due to expected pet increase in the future which might partly result in increased aet at least for humid regions with p pet the future decrease in summer streamflow and lower low flows might be even larger than simulated by the hydrological model in this study unlike the pet the simulated aet may change using our modelling approach due to the changes in soil moisture because the hbv model assumes an increasing aet with increasing soil moisture additionally the model calculates aet only for days without snow cover on the ground consequently the simulated aet increased in future scenarios in the cold period because the model simulated lower snow cover duration and thus more days when aet occurred this increase in aet was partly compensated by the decrease in aet due to lower soil moisture in the summer especially in lower elevation catchments with lower precipitation and higher pet results not shown 4 3 the role of different rcps on snow and runoff variability however despite the clear tendency of snow signatures changes for the climate scenario mean large variability exists between individual climate chains which reflects the large variability in climate inputs for individual gcm rcm and rcp combinations therefore it is important to assess the snow differences simulated by different climate chains for example for mitigation and adaptation strategies it is important to look at how the snow signatures will change in the future for different representative concentration pathways rcp 2 6 4 5 and 8 5 reflecting future evolution of greenhouse gas concentrations and their radiative forcing the most optimistic rcp 2 6 predicts the increase in air temperature between 1 5 c and 2 c until the end of the 21st century compared to the pre industrial period which means an increase of around 1 c compared to the reference period therefore the rcp 2 6 is the scenario which most matches with the goals of the paris agreement in 2015 unfccc 2015 in contrast the rcp 8 5 is from today s perspective the most pessimistic scenario with a temperature increase of 4 5 c until the end of the 21st century compared to the pre industrial period the comparison of the future snow evolution for individual climate chains according to rcps showed an overall decrease in snow storages and the shortening of the snow covered period for the rcp 2 6 however the changes were somewhat lower compared to most of the climate chains considering rcp 4 5 and considerably lower compared to chains assuming rcp 8 5 the reason for the smaller change for the rcp 2 6 is mostly related to the smaller increase in air temperature nevertheless our results also showed the importance of mutual interplay of both temperature and precipitation changes to affect the future snowpack for example the climate chain leading to the most snow rich conditions did not use rcp 2 6 but that used rcp 4 5 although the differences between both climate chains were rather small and may be explained by higher winter precipitation predicted by the specific rcp 4 5 climate chain this particular example highlights the importance of using a variety of gcms and rcms combined with more rcps for hydrological projections to obtain more robust results chegwidden et al 2019 the simulated future changes in snow storages were the primary cause for changes in winter and spring runoff simulated for most of the study catchments overall the results highlighted the importance of the effort of individual countries to reduce greenhouse gases emissions in order to keep warming well below 2 c compared to the pre industrial period as defined in the paris agreement this is important for mitigation and adaptation strategies related to climate change impacts in mountain regions marty et al 2017a 4 4 uncertainty in climate projections and modelling approaches it is well known that raw climate model outputs cannot be used directly in climate change impact studies the inherent biases in model data are introduced by a low spatial resolution of climate models which leads to a simplified representation of important physical processes chen et al 2015 therefore several post processing bias correction methods have been proposed the corrections are frequently calibrated and applied separately for individual meteorological variables as a result the correlation structures of the corrected data are biased although individual corrected variables correspond to the observed data in their statistical indicators several studies recently attempted to overcome this limitation and consider also a dependence structure between or within variables in addition to basic statistical properties meyer et al 2019 such an approach has been followed in this study since the relation between precipitation and temperature obviously affects a hydrological response of a catchment several complex multivariate correction methods can be found in the recent literature e g hnilica et al 2017 johnson and sharma 2012 mehrotra and sharma 2016 nevertheless the increasing complexity of such methods and their unclear effect on the climate change signal have recently been the subject of serious criticism ehret et al 2012 maraun et al 2017 hnilica et al 2019 pointed to the high sensitivity of complex correction methods to outlying values for these reasons the approach of piani and haerter 2012 used in our study represents a compromise between the overly complex multivariate methods and the standard single variate approach e g quantile mapping which leaves the relations between variables entirely uncorrected individual climate chains from the euro cordex experiment predict the amount of precipitation for the future differently where some of them predict an increase in precipitation for central europe while others predict a decrease the corrected data for our study catchments showed that the variability between individual climate chains as well as between individual catchments is very high and ranges from 12 a relative decrease in precipitation compared to the current climate to 28 a relative increase in precipitation this variability together with different downscaling methods may results in large differences in simulated runoff seasonality meyer et al 2019 our results clearly showed that despite the simulated future decrease in snow storages the large variability exists between individual climate chains mainly due to the large variability in precipitation this was also clearly reflected by the large variability in simulated seasonal runoff since the snow storages are strongly sensitive to changes in both air temperature and precipitation in the cold period it is still a question as to which degree the predicted increase in air temperature will be compensated by the increase or decrease in precipitation since the future evolution of precipitation remains uncertain at least for the region of central europe nevertheless despite this large variability in future precipitation the snow storages decreased in all scenarios giving the high confidence of increasing air temperature as a dominant factor which controls the snow storages in our study catchments an important uncertainty of the hydrological model represents the input data used for model calibration and validation in our study the input climate data were formed by stational data located within or nearby the individual catchments since no gridded product of precipitation air temperature and swe is available for czechia the stational data represented the only possible input to the model for our study area to enable correct spatial distribution of all climate and snow data within the catchment and to reduce the uncertainty in the model calibration lapse rates correction factors for elevation for air temperature and precipitation were calibrated by the model separately for each catchment additionally the uncertainty of the model calibration has been reduced using a multi parameter approach which enabled calibration of the model not only against runoff but also against swe this approach contributed to higher agreement of the observed and simulated values especially in higher elevation catchments with higher importance of the snowpack in the water cycle girons lopez et al 2020 jenicek and ledvinka 2020a the uncertainty in hydrological model simulations was further reduced using the 100 parameter sets resulting from 100 calibration runs for each catchment which contributed to more robust results this way the effect of equifinality multiple parameter sets provide equally good or acceptable model outputs was partly reduced although the results may be influenced by specific model choice model structure and parameters uncertainty several studies showed that the uncertainty mainly stems from the gcms and rcms and from the specific emission scenario addor et al 2014 chegwidden et al 2019 parajka et al 2016 however the model choice may by more important for future projections in higher elevation catchments with dominating snowmelt runoff regime addor et al 2014 5 conclusions future simulations of the individual components of the water cycle showed a considerable decrease in snow related variables for all study catchments in czechia at all elevations the hbv model simulated decrease in annual maximum swe by 30 70 until the end of the 21st century compared to current climate with higher values for elevations below 1100 m a s l additionally the snow covered season will be on average 40 60 days shorter in the future the results indicated that the shortening of the snow covered season will be caused more by earlier melt out rather than by later snow onset fig 3 nevertheless the response of the snowpack to changes in climate indices predicted by individual climate chains showed a large variability with the mean decrease in maximum swe by 13 for the most snow rich conditions and by 76 for the most snow poor conditions for the future period 2070 2099 the results also indicated that the increase in air temperature causing the decrease in snowfall might be partly offset by the increase in winter precipitation the simulations of the future runoff showed that the period of highest streamflow will occur on average a month earlier following the earlier snowmelt and the seasonal runoff volume will be significantly lower due to lower snowmelt inputs fig 5 additionally the model predicted the increase in winter runoff for the future period due to the increase in air temperature and thus the shift from snowfall to rain these changes may impose more pressure to create adaptation strategies for water reservoirs management to keep all reservoir functions such as flood and drought protection drinking water supply and hydropower the absolute decreases in snow storages in higher elevation catchments are larger compared to lower elevation catchments and thus the summer runoff in those catchments will be more affected by changes in seasonal snowpack consequently the largest increase in deficit volumes seems to be associated with the highest elevation catchments fig 7 this might have important implications for water availability in downstream areas the climate chains leading to overall dry conditions are associated with both lowest summer precipitation and seasonal snowpack fig 8 it means that higher deficit volumes were simulated for chains with both low summer precipitation and low seasonal snowpack this indicated that snow can partly increase summer low flows although the role of summer precipitation is obviously more important the expected lower snow storages might therefore contribute to more extreme summer low flow periods in the future next to increase in evapotranspiration and potential decrease in precipitation the comparison of the future snow changes for individual climate chains combining different rcps showed an overall decrease in snow storages and significant changes in spring and summer runoff figs 4 and 6 however the rcp 2 6 showed significantly smaller changes compared to the rcp 4 5 and rcp 8 5 both in terms snow storages and seasonal runoff in this respect the results highlighted the importance of efforts to keep the warming well below 2 c
